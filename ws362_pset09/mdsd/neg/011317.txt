When Dickens was good, he was very very good.  When he was bad, he was wordy and sappy and boring.  Did you ever wonder why you never heard of the three stories in this book?  Because they're so unremarkable!  The title story is the best; i.e. it's the only one that's even readable.  Do yourself a favor, don't read this boo
