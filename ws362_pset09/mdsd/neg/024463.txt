Anyone who thinks southerners eat this stuff is another one. They eat fast food, macaroniandcheese and other prepared stuff. Also and extrawise, I gather from some of the reviewers that this food, contrarytofactwise if they DID eat it, is better than Yankee food. No. Food has gotten better in this country, to be positive for once. Except DownSouth. 
DownSouth, you eat in ethnic restaurants. Just like in England.
