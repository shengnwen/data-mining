I have both this book and Revealed and by far I recommend the Revealed book.  This book is ok to use as a companion guide with Revealed, but I did not find it nearly as helpful.  I mainly bought the Dummy book to see if I could get a different point of view about sites, restuarants, etc. and I did in some cases, but I will be using the Revealed book as my main guide when I go back to Maui this year.
