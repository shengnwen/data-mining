Once I read the description on the author, about how she's a screenwriter, it all makes sense.  I mean this in the sense that the text is not lyrical.  It's just there to serve the purpose of conveying the plot, nothing else.  There's no poetry to the writing.

Like many have said already, the characters lack depth, the plot is not much more than a soap opera, the recipes are added to the writing almost as an afterthought (they're just dropped in), and the ending is so forced and abrupt and ODD, that the book just left me feeling like I wasted my time reading it.

I did find the smattering of information about the Mexican revolution interesting.  Maybe I'm too much of a realist and enjoy nonfiction too much, but this story just was not for me
