Thomas Berry promotes a &quot;new story&quot; of the universe, also known as the &quot;Earth story,&quot; &quot;Universe story,&quot; or &quot;new cosmology.&quot;  The new cosmology essentially is a bio-centric, Godless, New Age, and scientific account of creation, rather than a God-centered religious story.  Sadly, Berry is widely promoted as a Catholic author, yet there is nothing Catholic about this book.  In fact, the book is generally critical of Christianity and Western Culture.  During our time of environmental crisis, we need to turn to God, the Creator of the universe.  This book will only steer us away.  Save your money.  There are better Christian faith and ecology books out there
