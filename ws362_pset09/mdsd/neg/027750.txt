Frommer's does a good job with the general hints on travelling cheaper, but unless you plan on visiting only the major cities and capitals only, look for another book.  There are 24 major cities and surrounding areas covered from Ireland to Budapest, but that's not many cities in comparison with all of Europe.  I only will have a short time in Europe and that means that I will only be able to visit two of the cities listed and have to use another book for everything in between.  Lonely Planet is much more inclusive and definitely covers the lower price scale
