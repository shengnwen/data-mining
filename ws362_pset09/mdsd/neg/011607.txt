A bit cheesey... I felt like I was reading a fluffed up self-help book! If you are a fan of The Da Vinci Code looking for more information on the lost sacred feminine, this book will be of little help.  I bought it because I thought it would be an interesting way to absorb some facts, but I found it to be a simplistic, repetetive, overly-idealized account of a woman's "rebirth".  I couldn't even finish it!

While its okay as a light read, it won't satisfy your want of solid religious/historical information
