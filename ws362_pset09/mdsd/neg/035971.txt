I have to disagree with everyone else.  This book was not good, the writing was sloppy, disorganized, and just all around bad.  I wanted to read this book because the plot appealed to me, a young man who comes from a bad home life, yet he chooses to turn his life around.  Too many of our men, not just black men are abandoning their children to be raised by single mothers who have no choice but to become strong. I was highly disappointed. I could not make it through the book. Finally, i just skipped to the end and needless to say, the ending did not leave me wanting more.  Maybe one day I will give it another try, but for now this book goes into my never again pile
