This book is typical, self-aggrandizing fare for the baby boomers. It almost has the weird sheen of revisionist history. 
Some topics glossed over;
The average American reads on a sixth grade level. 
This country's educational system is in shambles. 
Greed rules the day. The quaint retirement programs and "golden handshakes" are long gone. Companies cut what the can when they can. 
The gap between the rich and poor was never wider. 
The boomer's retirement will bankrupt the nation, social security, and Medicare. (Look up the cost estimation for Alzheimer's Disease).

Lets talk about how relevant we are!! 

Self-absorbed garbage from and for people who love to hear themselves talk.
