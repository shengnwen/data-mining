This checklist book has some photographs of homes that were OK but the checklist and text part of the book was much too basic. None of the parts of a home inspection were revealed or included in this book. So it is NOT a worksheet with 111 checklists but only a very basic and simple guide. I could not recommend this to anyone. Get another book that has a more complete checklist that you can use and that is helpful. You will never be able to do a home inspection from using this checklist book. If you did then you will be risking a lot since you will not know what to check out and inspect if this book is your guide!!!
