It makes for a wonderful book when your toddler is going through one of those stages of just wanting to read the same book over and over and over and over and over b/c there isn't much for you to read. 

I have to admit though that although I find the illustrations charming the whole premise is kind of creepy. I always end the reading with, "And then CPS came and took the mother away and placed baby with a loving, responsible family and Carl went on to star in his own TV show." I don't want my daughter being left with the impression that if we get a dog at some point it will be babysitting. I'm all for catharsis in children's books to show irresponsible behavior, etc. I think this one is disturbing b/c the parent is the one that's so horrible. The kid and dog are doing what one would expect
