As a consequence of the proliferation of chick lit, SF authors such as Wilson have caved in and added all the chick lit cliches to the skeleton of a good premise. Delete all the emotional turmoil that the numerous hormonal chicks experience in this otherwise clever book and you're left with a great short story. They should provide a pair of pantyhose created by the "Hypotheticals" with each copy of the book. Maybe they should start calling the award the Huguette Award. Or the "Hug-Me" Award
