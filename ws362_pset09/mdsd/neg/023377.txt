I purchased this book last month (Jan 07') and as I was preparing the coupons for a trip to Vegas (Feb 07') I found that there were """32""" pages of coupons missing from the book.  Of course ""all"" of them were for my Vegas trip and they were the ones that I ""was"" planning on using.  I didn't notice these coupons missing until just now and don't have time to return the book for replacement before my trip. 
What a rip-off!!!!!!!
Beware customers.......check your book upon arrival.  I noticed that some people were selling "just" the coupons from this book on E-Bay, so I'm assuming that sellers are double-dipping and getting twice the $$ for this book between selling the book and also selling the coupons seperately.
I'm so mad!!!!
