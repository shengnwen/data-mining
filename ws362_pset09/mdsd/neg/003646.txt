I feel really sorry for the student assistants that got credit in the front of Dobb's book for their careful editing.  This book has more typos in it than any thing I have ever seen.  And if Torts law was not hard enough to understand, having to work within Dobbs sorry typos makes it that  much harder.  Content wise, the book just does not lay out Torts in any  logical order.  It is just too hard from this book to pull out what the  rule is and whether a case represents the majority view or a minority.   Defense arguments against recovery tend to get far less coverage than the  plaintiff viewpoint: That much is obvious from the books' subtitle.   Overall, it is required that you use a study supplement with this book.  I  recommend &quot;Understanding Torts&quot; by Larry Levine, et al.  Don't  buy this book unless some sadistic professor is forcing you too
