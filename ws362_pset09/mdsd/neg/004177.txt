I have been meaning to write Dr. Wilson a fan letter because I have enjoyed his work immensely.  However, I am deeply offended that he and his publisher would pass off an excerpt from ALL THE RAGE as a "new" Repairman Jack short story.  I wonder what Jack would do if he encountered an author exploiting devoted fans.  Maybe it wasn't F. Paul behind this....maybe it was RASALOM.  I regret purchasing this book and would like my money back.  I think Dr. Wilson owes his readers and explanation and or an apology.
