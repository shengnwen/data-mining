I found this book very amateurish.   The author purports to tell the story in each subject's own words.   Sometimes, though, ones own words aren't very good - that's what authors are supposed to do - think through the words!   I guess some of the stories were inspiring, heartwarming and even somewhat interesting, but in the end I didn't get much more of this than "I decided to run the Ironman, so I trained really hard and I did it"
