     For those of you who have sincerely been seeking the truth about the Holocaust, who have done your homework and read a variety of sources and opinions, this book may well push you completely over into the revisionist ("deniers") camp, as it did me.  

     Deborah Lipstadt is an Emory University professor of Jewish Religion, NOT history.  She was evidently supported by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in writing this book; they hold the copyright, not her.  Denying the Holocaust is an attempt to respond to Arthur Butz and others who have raised major factual objections to the usual "6 million Jews killed in gas chambers" version of WW II.  

     Arthur Butz gathered a wealth of research material in his book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century.  Ms Lipstadt responds to his scholarship with things such as name calling, twisted logic, half truths, appeals to emotions, failure to produce evidence, failure to define terms, omitting things, assigning bad motives, answering a question with another question, using big words, etc.  That is why I call her book, Denying the Holocaust, a Holocaust Liar's Handbook.  I value my copy as a wonderful exercise book for seeing through sophistocated lies.
