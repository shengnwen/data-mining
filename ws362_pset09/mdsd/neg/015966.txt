Incubus Dream finally got me to a point where the sex is starting to aggravate me in this series. I think Hamilton can get her point across about the ardeur without having the whole book be nothing but about sex. What I missed most in this book was the good police mystery part. Don't get me wrong, there was a mystery but it want barely there as if the sex stuff had been written and she found a way to write in an actual case to work on. It just took away from the other stuff I love so much about Anita. I enjoyed her finally getting it on with Nathaniel because her moral choices just don't make much sense, which the character admits herself, and Anita really does love Nathaniel. It's just frustrating when the story didn't seem to have a point a lot of the time except for all of Anita's new powers which revolve around sex. Most people have talked bad about the way the character was going before now but it was really, really evident in this book. I'm going to continue with the series but only because the past eleven titles have been so great
