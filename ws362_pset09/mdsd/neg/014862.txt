This is the silliest, goofiest book I have read in a long time. There is no gentle way to say this: the author is a man of exceedingly modest intellectual capacity. He does not understand evolution. He does not understand science. He has an idiosyncratic understanding of the Bible that one can only marvel at - or else heartily laugh at!

If his intended audience was kindergarten classes, then he has been successful.

Here are some examples of the Bible's science:

Evidence of atoms:  "things which are seen were not made of things which do appear." Hebrews 11:3

Radio waves: "Can you send lightnings, that they may go, and say to you, Here we are?" Job 38:35 

Job 38:19 "Where is the way where light dwells?" This implies electromagnetic radiation and light travelling at 186,000 mpsecond.

By talking of heavens & "highest heavens", the Bible was explaining galaxies and clusters of galaxies. 

"...neither shall you eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field..." Exodus 22:31  He hails this as insight into bacterial contamination!

He quotes a lot of notable people on their biblical faith - but most are centuries dead and not a few are taken out of context (e.g. Einstein who clearly stated his "God" was not the Christian God). His section on archeology is a farce - or state of the art for the 17th century if you prefer. His discussion of evolution is so warped as to make one wonder if he has EVER bothered reading even a high school biology textbook. 

I don't think any reasonable, rational, semi-conscious Christian can take much "comfort" in this embarrassing book. I went to Comfort's web site to get further insight and I came away thinking this is a man with a GIANT ego and he has absolutely no basis for his self-congratulatory egotism.

This book is useless, except for chuckles.
