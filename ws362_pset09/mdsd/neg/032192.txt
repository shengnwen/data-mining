I don't really know what to say after finishing Dermaphoria.  The book is definitely more about style, and how Clevenger writes, than it is about actually finding out how the convoluted plot comes together in the last 20 pages.  The book starts out interesting enough, with a grabbing interrogation scene followed by a conversation that Eric Ashworth, the main character, has with his lawyer, Morrel.  Much is introduced in the first 15 pages, and we basically get all the answers to the questions posed by the book, but does it make sense?  What does it all mean?

Personally, I thought that dialogue portions of the book were the best part.  The parts that actually revealed something about the characters, and weren't just randomly describing cockroaches or the chirping of crickets or invisible bugman helicopters that spy on you at night.  Clevenger writes well, there is no doubt about that, I guess that I just have trouble investing myself into a story that consists of basically one big drug trip.  The hallucinations of a drug addict don't strike me as events that can fill a 200 page novel, but Clevenger somehow does it, and manages to keep the story somewhat interesting, but only enough that you barely get to the finish just to find out how it all fits together.

I think that Clevenger is a good writer.  I still plan on reading The Contortionist's Handbook because I have heard that it is far superior to this, his second effort.  This book is definitely not going to have widespread success, it just is too tripped out and diluted to really resonate with the reader.  It's too bad, I had heard a lot of amazing things about Clevenger before I read this book.  Hopefully Contortionist's Handbook lives up to the hype
