I rarely ever fail to complete a book I've paid for but after about sixty pages of Edward Klein's docudrama I don't know if I'll be finishing.  Instead of a historical summary about Hillary Clinton's life and policies, Klein elected to open with a series of tenuously credible accounts from interns who witnessed marital strife between her and Bill, accusations that she's a secret lesbian and obvious observations such as criticism of her seemingly inborn political nature. I didn't see the makings of any ruminations on the real reasons to question the merits of Mrs. Clinton's candidacy (i.e blatant nepotism in federal government, her relative lack of charisma to inspire the masses,  the failure of the first Clinton administration in response to the USS Cole bombing etc.)Instead Klein seems content, at least in intoductary chapters, to make glib carpet muncher referances about Mrs. Clinton his thesis for why she would make a bad president.  The minimum price of this book is skyrocketing upwards of twenty dollars.  If you don't like money then buy it.
