Am I the only one who has recognized the cover similarities between this book and another about codes? I'm certain that these two very proficient marketers didn't randomly select the title or cover layout. Maybe Dan Brown, the author of the most successful adult fiction of all time, should have his publisher look into this "coincidence". And by the way, I'm not a DaVinci Code fan. Like all other entrepreneur and self-help book authors, Hansen and Allen figured out years ago that all you have to do is repackage the same ideas. They were more clever than most by branding with Brown's blockbuster. Glad I saved $2,000 and three days of my life on their seminar.
