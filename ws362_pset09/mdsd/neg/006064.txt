While I loved the first two of Doss' &quot;Shaman&quot; series, this one was a big disappointment. The author seemed more infatuated with his hero, Charlie Moon, whom he presents as a sort of Native American Jimmy Stewart, than interested in constructing an efficient plot. There are an endless number of jokes about &quot;the big Ute's&quot; voracious appetite for fried foods, his impressive masculine physique, and his total bafflement over the behavior of the opposite sex. In fact, Doss' depiction of women was one of the most irritating things about this book: They all (with the exception of Daisy, the shaman) seem to belong more in a comic book than in a novel for grown-ups. Every last one of them has &quot;tiny, delicate hands,&quot; &quot;a small foot,&quot; &quot;crimson nails,&quot; and has no thought in her head other than how to land Charlie Moon (why they would want to is the only mystery in the book). I had been very impressed with Doss' handling of the mystical in his previous novels, but this one is so choked with cliches that I quit two thirds of the way through. And the shaman of the title, a vibrant character, gets little attention in this one. So if you want a well-paced mystery with touches of poetry in the writing and well-developed characters, go to Tony Hillerman
