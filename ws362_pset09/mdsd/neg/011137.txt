While this book contains a wide range of topics of interest to those considering parenthood, it doesn't cover these topics with very much detail.  I would have found it more helpful if the stories of the women interviewed had been longer than a paragraph apiece.  Overall, this book is useful in that it brings up many important issues for consideration, but in my opinion, it served only as a &quot;springboard&quot; for further research
