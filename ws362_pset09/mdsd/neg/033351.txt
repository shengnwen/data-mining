In order to maintain the legal status of your corporation, you need to pass very specific resolutions and keep very specific records.  I had hoped for a "cookbook" for the legal steps required to set up and operate my corporation, but this is not it.  

The info on corporate structures is very basic and general - you could easily find this level of detail on the web.  That's my primary complaint with this book...  it mentions what you must do, but doesn't give you the specifics of how.

Instead of this book, I recommend you:

(1)  Get the *basics* from your lawyer or accountant (or even doing some research on the web)

(2)  buy The Corporate Minutes Book by Anothony Mancuso instead of this book
