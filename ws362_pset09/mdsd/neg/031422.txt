A woman chasing a man to this extent is not romantic.It was like a foxhunt with her trying to run the fox to ground,at any moment I expected her to yell "tallyho!" It's ok to give Warren a nudge but this girl was outrageously ridiculously too forward to be believable.I finally got through it by skipping the more outrageous parts.
Of course Warren was no dreamboat either.Unfeeling is the best I can come up with to describe him.To be fair to him though he tried to warn her about not setting her cap for him and constantly referred to her as little girl in order to discourage her.Alas she didn't take the hint.Halfway through the novel I still had no idea why she was chasing Warren.What qualities of his caused her to believe herself in love with him? I don't believe he fell in love with her either,he gave in so she'd stop chasing him
