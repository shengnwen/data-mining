I picked up "Bergdorf Blondes" by Plum Sykes because I had some money and I couldn't find "The Devil wares Prada" I should have saved my money! This book was totally uninteresting to me! I couldn't relate to any of the characters and I scared at the idea that people really live this way! There are many great chick-lit books out there, but "Bergdorf Blondes" is not one of them
