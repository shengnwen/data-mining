I read this book and yes it is a page turner, and I also watched the movie.  This prompted me to do some research into this case and I've come to the conclusion that this woman was wrongfully convicted of a crime she did not commit.  I think this author fantasized a great many details in her book.  If you do just a little looking into this case you will probably come to my same conclusion.  This is not an isolated case, this happens time and again on many levels of our legal system.  And the sad thing is, she's still in prison.  The author of this book has made a lot of money off this case and it is not even an accurate portrayal of events and the blatant miscarriage of justice.  Shame on everyone involved
