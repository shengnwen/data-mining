&quot;Torn Togas&quot; could not only be the worst written book  grammatically ever to be published, it as also the most factually  inaccurate book I have ever read.  I heard of this book after watching an  episode of Oprah that dealt with hazing across the country.  Being a  fraternity man myself, I am interested in learning more about Greek life  anyway I can, so I bought the book.  While I was reading it I was  absolutely flabbergasted at the biases and stereotypes this woman had about  members of college fraternities and sororities.  She may feel that just  because she was in a sorority herself, that it is alright to say the things  that she did, but I truly feel that she was out to write a book that would  sell copies and she tried to make it as interesting as she could.  I would  recommend this book to anyone who would like to experience how it feels to  be Greek and deal with the discrimination and prejudices that people have.   I do not know where this woman went to college for her undergraduate work,  but if the stuff she says that went on there actually did happen, how does  the Greek community there still exist?  Where I go to school, I have never  heard or even thought of 25% of the things she said went on at her campus.   This book is a slap in the face to anyone that is an undergraduate,  graduate, or a family member of anyone that has ever been in a Greek letter  organization.  How much credibility can you give a &quot;so-called&quot;  Greek when she can't even spell the names of the Greek letters right?  This  book would be a waste or money, time, and brain cells to anyone who would  purchase it
