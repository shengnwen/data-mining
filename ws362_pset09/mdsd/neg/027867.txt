First must say all the raves you see are from professionals that have used other systems and maybe good friends of the author, as some of the reviews said, mistakes, no clear definition of way to go, confusing, believe the author once sent me an answer to a question stating he has condensed a book of 950 pages into this, Well unless your an photographic, or layout person, this book too confusing for someone starting out, I would not recommend  this book to first timer
