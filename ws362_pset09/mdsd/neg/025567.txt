This book contains almost no photographs of finished projects.  There are hardly any diagrams of the intermediate steps, and the instructions are minimalistic at best.  This book assumes a reasonable knowledge of cabinet installation techniques; however, persons who possess such skills would largely find this book unnecessary.  What you do get in this book is lots of line drawings of how to stack and arrange cabinets in different configurations, but these drawings are much like the ones you can get through the design services that are provided by Lowe's, Home Depot, and other major home supply stores.
A better choice would be "Built-In Furniture: A Gallery of Design Ideas".
