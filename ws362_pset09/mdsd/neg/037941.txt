As fair as studies aids go, this one is not very good. While concise and simple, the book really lacks the aid aspect. This book is like buying a textbook and reading it. In addition, I felt it times it wasn't very useful. I would read the UCC (especially 2-207) material and feel like I wasn't any better off than when I left class. I would buy instead the Emmanuel's and/or the Emmanuel Flash Cards if you want a stronger study aid. Unlike those additions, this book lacks the useful charts and acronyms that help when you're trying to remember the series of questions to ask yourself on the exam. In essence, if you are going to buy only one guide, and you don't need a second textbook, don't buy this one. However, if you haven't been going to your first year classes this is a good book to buy
