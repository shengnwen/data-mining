I thought since this was form the AAP that it would be the best reference. Not even close. It is difficult to read because it is in 6pt type. It looks like they just shrunk down the original Hard copy and tried to size it to a paperback. As a result, the text is tiny and only fills up 2/3 of the page! The book measures 6 X 9, but the reading area is 4 1/2 X 6 1/4!!It does not look at all like what you see when you take a peek on the website. The illustrations are very few and of poor quality. The information is from 1997. There was a LOT missing, especially since there have been advances in pediatrics in the last 8 years. The information is not very helpful as far as relieving symptoms, and is geared toward older children. There are so many references out there today that are MUCH better than this book. This is the first time I have EVER returned a book. I am extrememly disappointed. Please continue to browse - there are a lot of choices out there that are more complete and better organized than this.
