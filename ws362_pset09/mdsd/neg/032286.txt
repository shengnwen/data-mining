Mr Hibbert writes in a very dull, dry tone and I found it incredibly hard to be engaged in the story. He confuses the reader with time, people and his interpretation of what Elizabeth was like as a woman and a queen.  I only read this because I had to (for school). If you don't have to read it, then DON'T! It will bore you to death
