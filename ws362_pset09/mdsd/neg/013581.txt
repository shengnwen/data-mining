I was surprised to find this slim, well researched volume so banal. Mr Leavitt has only skimmed the frivolous surface of  life in Florence. Yes, for this book he's done his literary research, all to prove his point of the bitchy gay gossipy life of the city. He is quick to point out that he's  not been, nor does he want to be part of the continuation of that life, then lists his social conquests. The only part that involved real Italians, and real life there was when he talks about the flood. He clearly didn't get into the life of the city he claims to know so well. This book is so full of missed opportunities that I don't understand what the editors had in mind. Is this a gay guide? Is it a memoir? Is it a conciet? Don't bother buying this book
