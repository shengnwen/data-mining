The first few reviews are too harsh,I was given this as a gift so I am not as pissed off at the money. I give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book I expected much from anyway.  The plot also gets way to over the top.  I mean is there any plane or helicopter they cannot learn to fly in a weekend? Hero's invited to the summit by the President! They escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to China! Also hero knew the guy was Chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute, how many white folks can tell difference among non whites? Why are all the Chinese Americans bad guys as well?  
The novel is way to heavy with anit Chinese comments, has lot of what are just rants. See the other points in the publisher weekly review, but after considering them you may want to read the book, if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads, but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win. Do not expect much and look for used copy, I paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before I cut him off.
