East, West, Muslim or Christian, this book proves the rule that the majority of abusive-slash-dysfunctional families are basically the same. While Living in Hell rides on the recent wave of first person accounts of Iran written by women, it falls far short of their benchmark.
Mildly sensationalist, most of the book is one, (yawn) long, intensely detailed, lament about an abusive and deprived childhood and young adulthood, exacerbated by repressive cultural conditions. It is, however, interspersed with occassional interesting and colorful bits about Persian history, folklore, costume and architecture. Unfortunately, this book is dominated by the author's extremely narrow social outlook (which living in Canada has not overcome) and completely subjective view of her country and history. 
Possibly good reading for college level, social studies students. Or for those who enjoy long, rambling, weepy stories. 
As a counterpoint I highly recommend reading Lipstick Jihad instead
