This would have to be the worst book I have ever read. I bought it based on the brilliant reviews it had received on Amazon, however it was a very disappointing read. The characters were poorly developed and quite one dimensional. The main character and her outlook on the world was pathetic. It was so bad that I couldn't bear reading the last few chapters and instead threw the book in the bin.

I am an avid reader of chicklit and especially love authors like Sophie Kinsella and Maggie Alderson. These books are cleaverly writen and keep you turning the pages. Unfortunately this book couldn't even keep my interest to the end.

A total waste of time, let a lone make up
