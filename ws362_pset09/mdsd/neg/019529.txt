I'll keep this simple and short. If you enjoy mysteries that have no mystery, suspense, character development, creative storyline, etcetera - this book is for you. I'm serious. It reeks of an endeavor the author was goaded into by some teaching colleague that thought she had some talent. The author tries to be witty and is overly wordy in the process.   

I bought this book thinking the description, title, and cover looked interesting, particularly for this time of year. Don't make the same mistake
