This book attempts to look at all the American &quot;attrocities&quot; made during the Pacific War, but seems to forget everything committed by the Japanies. The 'attrocities committed by the americans involved such awful acts as making propagandist films and capturing people alive. What is neglectfully mentioned in this book are some of the Japanese atrocities like using American and Japanesee POWs for medical experiments, and things like the Bataan Death March, which killed more POWs than died in Allied possesion in the entire war in all theaters. I have discussions with multiple history professors at college about this book, and the nicest thing any of them can say about it is that it is &quot;one-sided.&quot; Don't read
