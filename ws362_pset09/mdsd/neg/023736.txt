Having just finished the fabulously written "I, Elizabeth" by Rosalind Miles (highly recommended!) I was in the mood for some more historical fiction.  I didn't get through a quarter of Wideacre before dropping it like an infected sore - it certainly was not what I had in mind.  The central charcter would be psychiatrically diagnosed and locked away for life in this day and age (hopefully some readers will actually figure that out!) and is not someone I want to get to know better (and I work with people with major psychiatric illnesses!).  I actually feel nauseated by her!  What really upsets me though is that the author appears to equate her acts with developing feminine power.  If  you can call one person killing another because they had no other recourse for legal ownership of property, or for acting in a sexually depraved manner (incest) as a recourse for same, then go ahead and enjoy the story.  To me, if I am going to spend my precious time on reading a 600 + page novel (first in a trilogy, no less) then I had better get something out of it that improves my understanding of life and others - or at least makes me feel somewhat proud to be a human.  This just makes me sick!
