I think I paid way too much for this extremely slim and small book.  This paperback book measures approximately 3 inches by 5 inches.  About 1/10 of an inch think.  I paid over $5 from Amazon.  The pages can easily be torn by a toddler or preschooler.  It's just way too small to read to several children at once.  Everyone is complaining that they can't see it
