Unless you are burning to know more about Mr Rabinow.  The book reads more like a justification for Rabinow's ethnographic failure than like reflections upon his experiences.  Much better examinations of the  fieldwork experience are available.  Nevertheless, Rabinow does have an  interesting style and sense of drama which makes for a not unpleasant  reading experience.  Were the title not so misleading I would like the book  better but it should really be known as &quot;Reflections on my Failure as  an Ethnographer in Morocco.&quot
