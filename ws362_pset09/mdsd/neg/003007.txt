I had not read this author and was so disappointed in this book I have returned it to Amazon, even though I will be out the shipping costs!  It is written as though talking to and written by a 6 year old.  I am insulted that she would even think an adult would read this book.  I recommend you do not waste your money. If you can't make an art journal, visit the many wonderful on-line websites that will teach you how for free, and offer guidance by other on-line journalers and artists. This book is a total waste of money
