As an Eldar fan I was highly offended by this piece of filth. Mr. Goto does no reasearch to ensure that his writing fits with the background of the world. Furthermore, one thing remains the same over every C.S. Goto novel, and that is that the Eldar will be killed in ways humiliating and offensive to fans of the Eldar race.

In C.S. Goto books you can expect any number of things, flying terminators who surf on the back of razorbacks, children who destroy Eldar grav-tanks by shoving rocks in the barrels of their weapons, and an over-abundance of the word 'Bray' (Yes, heehaw, the donkey sound... braying).

On a far more serious note, Goto's work is exceptionally misogynistic, and you can expect in every book to see at least one female character (usually Eldar) be tortured to death, or meet a slow, gruesome and humiliating end, all the while being portrayed as weak and incompetant. Infact in this particular gem, he goes to the trouble of torturing the farseer Taldeer from the game Dawn of War to death over the course of a chapter or two.

If you are looking to find a good Black Library author stay CLEAR of Goto. Try Abnett, McNiel, Thrope or one of the many other authors who writes from an unbiased point of view, and is not as prone to gratuitous butchery of female characters
