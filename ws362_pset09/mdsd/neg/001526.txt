Rilke is just about my favourite poet... a true master.  In the German, his verse is just sublime.

These translations, however, are shockingly bad.  Not only does the translator completely ignore (or distort) some of the key images, he invents new ones for no apparent reason.   Mitchell seems to think he is there to improve on the original.  He doesn't.

If you don't read German, you should only buy this to read Mitchell's verse.  You won't be getting Rilke's
