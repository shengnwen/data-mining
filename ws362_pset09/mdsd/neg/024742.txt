I bought this book thinking that it would be something different and interesting.  I like fairy stories but the book was so not what I expected.  It was more the story of a bunch of dirty little children that go out and kidnap other children and take their places so they can live boring lives in which they are so bored with their own existence they have to go in search of the lives they had before they were originally stolen to become dirty little children.  Not really interesting, very little plot, extremely predictable, and a stupid ending.  My friend and I read this at the same time and we both agreed it was not worth the money
