I agree wholeheartedly with Kenneth Ryan's review.  This book was "recommended" reading in one of my English classes at UCLA several years ago, and I bought it, but just now picked it up for a read.  The problem is that the main character is so vapid that I simply did not CARE what happened to her.  It has always been my firm belief that one must identify with, care about, or even despise a main character to care enough to keep reading.  This novel was painful to finish; who cares what happens to these people?  I agree that whatever "splash" the book made in its day came from the shock value it would have had because of the amorality of its characters.  It's hard to shock us these days, and the book is now just plain uninteresting
