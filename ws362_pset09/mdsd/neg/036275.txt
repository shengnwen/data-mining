I had such anticipation for this latest book from the Cedar Cove series....I was VERY disappointed, so much so that I didn't finish the book which is extremely rare for me.  I love Debbie Macomber as an author.  However, this book spends most of its time split among a huge cast of characters (from previous books...rehashing them into the story).

I love series and I even like to have earlier characters brought into the story of the current book.  However, in this case, it is too much and dilutes the storyline terribly.  Just as you are getting warmed up about a couple, it switches to another storyline....very frustrating....

I don't often write reviews...except when I am terribly disappointed.  Truly, wait and order this used or even get it at your local library....

I look forward to Debbie Macomber's next book as she is a great author....this one was off the mark though..
