If I had the opportunity to flip through this book in a bricks-and-mortar bookstore, I wouldn't have bought it.  I was looking for ways to communicate business and organizational lessons through the use of games and activities.  This book is just a list of icebreaker activities without providing any of the "meat" of the lesson the activity should have delivered.  Providing references for those of us seeking said content would have helped to fill that gap.  

Many of the activities require visual aids.  It would have been nice for the publishers to provide graphics to go along with these---perhaps a registration key for a website to download the visual tools?  I would be far more likely to use the activities (and, of course, credit the authors) if the tools were easily accessible and not burdomsome to create.  

I have every confidence that the book meets its intended purpose and the authors have done a good job.  However, I don't feel that Amazon.com is presenting the book for what it is.  I also believe the publishers could have done a better job of supporting this publication to make it truly useful to the purchaser.

In general, if you are completely at a loss for how to get people interacting with one another at a meeting or training session, this is a good "creativity sparker" to get you thinking.
