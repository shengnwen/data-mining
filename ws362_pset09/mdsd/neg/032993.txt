Somewhere in the afterword of &quot;The Callahan Chronicals,&quot; Robinson alludes to an SF writer who wrote a series of stories that were deliberately bad, I suppose as a sort of commentary on the literary standards of the public. The series proved popular. After reading this note, I wondered for a few days what the series could be. Then, duh, it struck me. Robinson is, of course, referring to the stories in this very book. It's a reasonable joke, but not one I was happy to pay for. As for the stories themselves, if you like characters that are organic (i.e., wooden) and multidimensional-remember that one is a multiple of itself-and don't care about plots, you might like the book. Readers who prefer science fantasy to science fiction may like the book as well: most non-human characters are unique, freeing Robinson from any obligation to consider implications of the presence of different sentient species in this adolescent fantasy world. The book might also appeal to science fantasy fans who crave reassurance about how cool they are and who don't mind page after page of authors showing off how clever they are
