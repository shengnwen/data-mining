Leo the Late Bloomer occupies a dusty, terrifying shelf in one of the furthest reaches of my memory.  

To a child who is already depressed and uncertain, Leo offers no solace.  I found him pathetic, and because I was like him, I found myself pathetic all the more.  Leo is the prisoner who escapes while the others languish.  He proves only that salvation is possible, but he offers no guidance for how it will come about.  It's nice for Leo that he "bloomed," but the child is still miserable.  You think I am kidding.  I wish I was.  

I do not blame the book per se, though.  With kind, insightful parents, it could help a child talk about his hopes and dreams, and with their encouragement they might come true.  But read alone, on the floor of an otherwise empty room, with no one to translate the allegory, it only tightens the noose.
