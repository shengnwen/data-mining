While I Was Gone, by Sue Miller, reads suspiciously like a blend of the steadily increasing numbers of this genre of WASP apologist novels. To my jaded eyes, these offensively scrupulous tales appear to be written for WASP C Average women college graduates of A plus incomes.

I am certain that many of these readers will consider themselves more well-read and better understood for having consumed a stack of this stuff by similar writers. Somehow, WASPS everywhere will feel that instead of being emotionally constipated and terminally civilized, that they are, as usual, better than everyone else who isn't like them.

The characters, including the animals, are for the most part, good-looking, privileged, educated, and eminently acceptable. Suspension of disbelief is just not happening here. This novel pays some token hommage to the strife of teenage parenting and the shoals of marriage. Yet, it remains smug and self-satisfied conveying beyond a shadow of a doubt that these superior folks are going to soldier on and become even better than they already are for having erred on the side of humanity.

Ugh! Just once it would have been nice to experience a character like Jo screaming at her minister husband Daniel to cease his sadistic sanctimonius silent cruelty and put himself in her place. Alas, no, that sort of low-class behaviour can never exist in the rarified world of the dazzlingly narcissictic humble.

I would exhort Sue Miller to redeem herself by writing about some low-born WASPS who know how to crochet toilet roll covers and make gloppy casseroles while drowning in some decently offensive hypocracy
