This is easily one of the worst written, worst researched, and worst argued books I have ever read.

In fact it is so bad it is laughable.  I do not agree with their views but this has nothing to do with this review.

Turn to the epilogue and read this statement: "For example, all prophecy scholars agree that the generation that saw Israel restored to her land in 1948 could well be the "generation [that] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened" (Matthew 24:32-34, NIV)."

No one, not even LaHaye can actually believe that statement.  You can't get 10 people to agree on what to have for lunch, how in the world will you ever get people to agree on something as controversial as the interpretation of Bible prophecy.

Other things that had me in stitches was when they said that a past scholar believed there would be 50 years between the rapture and the tribulation.  They then go on to state that they are pretty sure he would change his mind if he were alive today.  That may be true but why even bring it up.  If that makes it in your book you surely must not have much to say.

Don't waste your time, money, or effort on this book.  I had never read any Left Behind or other LaHaye prophecy books.  From the outside in it sure seemed like it was a cash cow with little substance.  This absolutely proved to me that my assumption is probably true.

****A Side Note****
For those commenting on reviews by partial preterists, you really have no idea what you are talking about.  I understand the futurist view.  I was taught it my whole life and in Bible college.  I have read books about it including this piece of drivel.  The least you can do is read something by DeMar or Gentry and learn what you are arguing against instead of making assumptions.  What has been written so far in the reviews really makes you look like you have no idea what you are talking about
