After reading the reviews on this book, both negative and positive I decided to head out to Barnes and Noble and take a look myself. I spent three hours reading through this book at the cafe before finally giving up from frustration. I can see what other reviewers mean when they say this book is informative and full of information, but I approached the book looking for hoodoo specific knowledge and found little to none. I do agree with the reviewer who wrote in saying that Hyatts and Yronwodes works are far better when one is looking for hoodoo, where this book falls short, however if you are looking for a collection of information, not hoodoo specific, then this is probably a good book for you, unfortuenantly I didnt find it necessary to buy
