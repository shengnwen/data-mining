I would have probably given this book only 1 star, if it had not beenfor the crisp illustrations, besides that this book did not show meanything that i didn't know before.  And with that being said, ididn't know much in billiards to begin with.  Precision Pool, merelyintroduces the reader to the terminology of billiards and confinedsituations, instead of actually presenting procedures, techniques orany other facets that might have improved my overall performance.Throughout the entire book the detailed illustrations wereovershadowed by incredibly poor writing, as well as vaguedescriptions.  For instance, they would show diagrams of the cue andobjective balls in certain situations, only pointing out how to makethat shot in that certain situation, completely ignoring any other.The best analogy that i can come up with is that of a math teacher whodoesn't exactly show how to solve a problem, instead that teachershows the student only the answers.  The worst sections in this bookwere on english, kicks, bank shots, and caroms (practicallyeverything). I don't have anything against Mr. Kanov or Miss. Stauch,but a book that is as poorly written asthis one, is not much of a steal unless.  Checkit out at a library before buying it if you don't trust this reviewer
