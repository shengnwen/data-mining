Here are some noteworthy tutorials perhaps you may find a use for, even though I did not: DVD mockup, Book mockup, Grudge Effect, Making a Photo Look Old. The best tutorials are by Felix Nelson, because they are original and unique. Scott Kelby's stuff is kitsch. He copykats what graphic designer's are doing today and recreates a cheap knock-off tutorial for this book. Best Buy, American Pie's Logo, etc. Why the hell would I want to make a logo that looks just like American Pie's logo? Or a logo that looks just like EA Sport's logo? How trite. But if that's your thing to steal, mimic, and make crappy versions of the original then go ahead. I used to respect Kelby, mmm not so much anymore. Anything for a buck and reproduce filler garbage for the masses. I pity anybody who uses this for commercial purposes or for anything that the public will see
