Unlike most of R.L Stines books this one was my least favorite of them all. This book takes place at Midwood highschool and a girl named joanna wants to break up with her boyfriend but before she as the chance he boyfriend falls off a cliff and dies or is alive i dont know which one because he keeps on dyeing that by the end of the book you dont really care if he is dead or alive.The major charters are joanna and dex the boy who dies. the problem in the story is that before she has the chance to break up with him and then he dies but he comes back from the dead for one last date and finds out that she wants to break up with him and tryes to kill her.The novel is fiction.
