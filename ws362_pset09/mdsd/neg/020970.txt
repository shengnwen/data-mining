OK... this book has action. However, it seemed to me that the action sequences were not written for the readers but rather to satisfy Author's need to be tedious and verbose. 

Here is a question I want to throw at the people who read this book and gave it more than 2 stars. 

"How did the military test Supernova to see whether it works or not in the first place before it was stolen?" 

I sure as hell would love to know the answer to this question from the readers who are hyping this book and also the author himself. 

This book is trash. Dump it and move on to the next one on your list
