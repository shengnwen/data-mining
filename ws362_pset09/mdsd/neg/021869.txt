The science is: brains are like neural nets; a hidden layer with feedback gives nets the ability to detect temporal patterns; information/logic in a net is distributed.  That's it, plus some rambling about Husserl that seems largely irrelevant (if you're curious it's summarised pretty well by the review above (by the "top 100 reviewer" who apparently never gives below 4 stars...))

So if you're at all interested in consciousness, you probably know the science.  If you don't, then I assume you've read a bit more than the typical science nerd and expect a basic level of narrative competence - you're going to be disappointed.  The fiction part is embarassingly bad.  The plotting is appalling; the characterisation cartoon-like.

Some reviewers are saying this would be good for an introductory course.  It would have to be very introductory.

(I see that this book is currently being offered with Papadimitriou's "Turing".  That's not a great book, either, but it's stunningly good compared to this - it has warmth, wit and depth.  The closest this book gets is a painful irony; the cover suggest that someone, somewhere, was hoping for a noir ambience, but the only darkness comes from a power cut).

I feel bad writing a negative review, because I guess this was a work of love.  I can understand the desire to popularise ideas that you find interesting.  But please, if you're going to take my money, give me something at least half-way decent.  If I were the author I'd be pretty mad with the editors at MIT for letting me publish something this bad.

And finally, I note that one star is the lowest rating possible, which is rather sneaky of Amazon (doesn't their use of the arithmetic mean imply a zero-based scale?).
