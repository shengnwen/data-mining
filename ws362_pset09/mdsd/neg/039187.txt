In the words of author Gertrude Stein: "There's no 'there' there." I was very impressed with the first third of this book and then my interest in reading it simply fell off the edge of the table. 

The book relies almost exclusively on anecdotal evidence to support its claims, and most examples aren't that well developed. Some conclusions are muddled or, in my view, considered "stretches."

One of my personal pet peeves is that this book is horribly edited. It is riddled with misspelled words and other grammatical nightmares. It was horribly distracting. It seemed like they almost rushed this book to print to coincide with the article in Fast Company magazine.

Even though it's only 159 pages, halfway through this book, I just couldn't wait to be done with it. I'm glad I checked it out of the library. I would have been p*ssed if I had paid $25 for it
