If you want to read a great book on personal illness by a fine writer, read Reynolds Price' "A Whole New Life."  The prose is authentic and there is not a touch of pretense in it. 

Styron's lack of insight into his illness is topped only by his lack of knowledge of abnormal psychology.  His declaration that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is disturbing, because it mixes cause and effect.  His assertion is tantamount to attributing global warming to melting glaciers.  Mixing cause and effect is not something one would attribte to a writer of his distinction, as it is the essence of clear thought.

Yes, the intensity and distribution of various neuro-chemicals have been found to be compromised among those suffering depression who have been tested.  But how are they compromised?  Contrary to the author's belief that "the madness results from an aberrant biochemical process," and that "such madness is chemically induced," it is the commonly-held view today that psychology plays the decisive causitive role in mental illness, as that psychology is formulated and developed throughout life, and is influenced by situations, including loss, misuse of drugs and alcochol, and unconscious dilemmas, among others. 

That an organic etiology has been surmised in many cases of schizophrenia and other psychosis, as well as in profound obsessions, certainly "rules in" brain damage, whether it is evident at birth, or the result of other physical and emotional trauma later in life; but it does not rule out psychology and the higher order mental functions we attribute to consciousness.
