This book is a tormented stream of consciousness from a lady who was obviously fighting major demons.  It is exactly the type of book that you would expect an amateur academic to "wow" and "gush" over, as it nicely fits into the dogmatic radicalism of Chicano Studies.  The discerning reader, on the other hand, sees page after page of outdated cliches, sob-stories, and anger-filled tantrums.  Anzaldua would like you to believe her suffering and self-searching  is all the fault of the "white" culture encroaching upon the enlightened cosmic race of the mestiza.  She'd like you to think that her mestiza/chicana/lesbian/female identity is the sole cause of her misfortune and hardship.   What becomes overwhelmingly evident upon reading her unabashed torrent of decadent self-pity is the learned and self-enforced quality of her "opression".   Anzaldua helplessly wallows in her romantic fatalism dreaming of the great mestiza revolution that will fix all of the world's problems by turning the middle class value system upside down.

If you like romantic literature, and enjoy the hopeless and sorrowful ramblings of society's self-marginalized, I might suggest "The Sorrows of the Young Werther" by Goethe or some poems by Lord Byron - at least then you get some literary value
