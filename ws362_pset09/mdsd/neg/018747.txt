I purchased this book with hopes of finding some information in teaching my ADHD son.  I have been homeschooling for 3 years now and their &quot;start-up&quot; advice, although useful for others, was of no help to me. Most other books that deal with ADD/ADHD focus on children in the public school setting. I set out to find a book specifically dealing with homeschool children. This book is very deceiving in its title and I am saddened that the author would use ADD as a lure to get people to buy her book. Especially homeschoolers, who are often on a very limited budget to begin with. It should be titled, &quot;How to start homeschooling a child with special needs,&quot; and leave the ADD out of it. There are some very useful ideas for beginning homeschoolers, but if you are looking for &quot;specific&quot; guidance regarding ADD issues you will be very disappointed
