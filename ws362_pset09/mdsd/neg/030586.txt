There is no significance in this book. Most of the people already know that there are sweatshops out there. It can be in the US soils or not. They make a product or support the operations. Many companies use these practices to make money quick. Also I can imagine most of the people understand that it is difficult to be a customer service representative. I really didn't need to be told these ten thousand times. This book didn't make me laugh it made me depressed. No wonder this book is so repetitive since there is not much for author to write on the subject that it is repetitive to start wit
