this book in short, did not meet my expectations. I thought it would have much better pictures of the beautiful costumes. you think of this beautiful movie and how much of M.A's life was centered around clothing. I was expecting close-ups of the amazing craftsmanship on the costumes, and sketches (which there are none). instead, I was deliverd Kirstin Dunst's high school year book, with tiny, grainy pictures of her big powdered hair.
