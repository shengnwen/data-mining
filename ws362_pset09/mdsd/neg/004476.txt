I am a big fan of Dummies guides because I feel that most technical books start you at the middle and take you to the end rather than starting you at the beginning. This book was a little disappointing compared to other Dummies books. My major complaint is that the author consistently points out what tools are available and where they are located but rarely has information on how or why you would use them. For a Dummies guide it is a little advanced in some areas and spends a lot of paper on topics that a person interested in upgrading to Oracle would already know. For instance there is a whole lot of material on SQL and the relational model but not much on how to administer a database for multiple users. Presumably if you are starting to use Oracle you already know a fair amount about SQL and constraints but need information on how to administer the database. In its defense however, it does give a broad overview of what tools and services are available in 9i and is not a bad place to start
