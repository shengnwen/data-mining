I read this book at the local Barnes & Nobles. I thougt I was getting something out of it because the ideas the author was talking about sounds very interesting.

I was greatly disappointed because throughout the entire book, I found no actual example of dialogues, NONE. It's like saying "BE frindly at first every you meet a person" and it does not tell you how to be friendly nor any example of conversation.

Don't waste your money, I recommend this one instead:

Conversationally Speaking : Tested New Ways to Increase Your Personal and Social Effectiveness
