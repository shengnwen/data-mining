I have to disagree with the opinions of some of the reviews presented here and give this book two stars - mainly for its smooth narrative style and nothing more. Alex Marshall is not a professional in any urban field - he is a journalist. His take on the problems modern cities face is expressed shallowly. It is like a book on medicine written by a lawyer. Sure, he has some nice ideas but these seem childish views to me and more of a common sense matter - not really worth putting to print. In fact, it is so easy, simple and shallow I consider it a great exercise for your first speed reading class.
