Yes, Rifkin's descriptions of the cultural differences between Americans and Europeans make interesting reading, but the vast majority of what he says is anecdotal, if not inaccurate.  I found it amusing to read his praise of Europe's assimilation of immigrants when riots were occurring all over France.  And the idea that the popularity of subscription services and auto leasing means companies are now in the business of selling "time" rather than material products is absurd
