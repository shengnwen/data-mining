Ever other knitting book/magazine/pattern etc. has stressed the importance of knitting gauge. Unfortunately, the patterns in this book don't even offer a gauge! I knit the baby booties...they came out absolutely adorable but were better suited for a Barbie than a baby...they were sooo tiny! I changed to needles two sizes larger and still ended up with bitty baby booties.

Without a knitting gauge, it is really hard to tell if you should change yarn, needles, or if you are knitting too tight or loose. 

I also agree with the other readers who commented on the lack of photos. Why would I spend hours and hours on a project with no idea of what it should even look like (imagine spending two months on a sweater that you absolutely hate!). 

There are sooo many other knitting books out there for beginners...skip this one and get Stitch n Bitch or Debbie Bliss "How to Knit"
