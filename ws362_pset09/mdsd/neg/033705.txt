Yes, this book was a present from my father in law. He knew about my interest in digital photography and bought this book in Japan for me. 

What to say about this book..hmmm..each time I look at its size and compare it with the shallowness of its contents it makes my blood boil. Seems Mr. Rick Sammons wants to keep the real knowledge to himself and dish out only a small fraction of it to the readers.

I have learned much more from the internet and from second hand magazines than from this hefty book. His constant reference to plugins ticks one off as it seems he never wants the reader to know about photoshop's potential and the effects the program can create itself (don't know how much he was paid by nik color efex..his favorite plugin)
A hobbyist would love to know how to make fabulous images and not what Professional photographers have shot, about rules of composition (not just rule of the 3rds), exposure, 18% gray, how different colors in nature can assist you take a guess about the correct exposure if u donot have a grey card, how u can use the palm of your hand to take a meter reading, the use of manual mode for night photography, etc. All such vital information was either not given the required emphasis or was avoided completely by Mr. Sammons. 

This book is a waste of money. Though my father in law paid for it, I still feel sad. If only I knew what he was buying and what the book was like, I would have advised him otherwis
