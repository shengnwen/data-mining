I took a numerical analysis course last semester at my university and had a horrible time understanding this book. As many reviewers have already stated, there aren't very many examples and the explanations aren't very clear. I had to refer to a number of other books from the school library to actually figure anything out. Don't waste your money on this book, there are much better books on the subject out there
