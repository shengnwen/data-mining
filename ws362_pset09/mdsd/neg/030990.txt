This book does two things:  It surveys the history of probability and randomness, and it teaches some insights about how people think about randomness and probabilities.  It is a short, light read, but it disappoints on both fronts.  For history, "Against the Gods" by Peter Bernstein is much better (more detailed and more interesting).  For insights, "Fooled by Randomness" by Taleb is much more insightful.
