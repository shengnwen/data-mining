A book with a picture collection of ideas, but very dated if not outdated. Many kitchens appear based from the 1960s era. The book almost comes across as a gathering of many old pictures assembled to glean the final dollar profit in book publishing.  Despite what the lead review suggests about &quot;Its sharp photography&quot; - photo reproduction is second rate. For those just starting the thought process and starting with minimal knowledge of kitchen building the book represents a possible starting point, but lacks true substance beyond that point. Those looking to build an upscale kitchen are well advised to look elsewhere; &quot;At Home With America's Top (26) Chefs&quot; is arguably the best of the best, a book with solid ideas and concepts applicable even to the more modest kitchen
