As a woman (who incidentally learned to read when I was two years old), I found this book to be apalling and insulting. What the book boils down to is that  we'd be better off if we didn't read, but the evil patriarchy has imposed literacy on us so we need to know how to read, but reading is against the female nature so we're even worse off. 

Please don't waste your time and money on this dreck
