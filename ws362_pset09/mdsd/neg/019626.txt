"Home Comforts" has been so helpful and authoritative that I preordered "Laundry" as soon as it was announced.  I was very disappointed to find that it consisted almost entirely of material taken from her previous book.  If Cheryl Mendelson feels that she needs to revise "Home Comforts", she should go over the entire book and bring out a second edition.

If you already have "Home Comforts", you don't need to buy "Laundry"; and if you don't have "Home Comforts", you need to buy it.  But I see little reason to buy "Laundry".  I am returning my copy
