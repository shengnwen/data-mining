My therapist, the Shan Guisinger mention in the book, gave this book to me to read, which I did in one sitting.  I was with my mother at the time, who gave a loud exclamation in the middle of the busy cafe we were in.  She recognized the author's name from the controversy that went on in the somethingfishy.com's message boards. I read aloud to her the part which the author mentions this occurance, and the both of us decided that she glossed over the incident and didn't tell the whole truth.

The book (minus the glossed over bits) didn't much captivate me.  She gave little to no explanation to how they actually got their daughter to consume the vast amounts of food.  Any anorexic I have ever met (myself included) would not have been party to this treatment.  

If a parent does wish to go ahead and try this Maudsley method, I would reccomend that he/she not let her son/daughter read this book before a stable recovery point.  The mention of hiding butter in every type of food (including milk) will be enough to send him/her running as fast as their emaciated legs can carry them
