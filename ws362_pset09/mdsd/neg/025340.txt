At first glance this book looked like a really fun read.  Cute cover and catchy concepts it seemed like it would something right up my alley.  I was very wrong.  The book talks all about the sort of girlfriends that one may want to have or hope to have over the course of her lifetime.  That's all fine and dandy (not to mention obvious) but does anyone really need to read 200+ pages of the author's fond memories of her friends? Is it necessary to suck up to Oprah right in the dedication and then barely mention her in those 200+ pages? I also did not appreciate the cheap marketing ploy that involved the author plugging her stupid pajama line.  I don't think that the author imparts any true words of wisdom and I seriously doubt there is much for anyone to gain by reading this book.  You could do better things with your time like perhaps watching Thelma & Louise, A League of their Own, Beaches, Steel Magnolias, etc.... Don't waste your time or money on this.  Don't even waste a trip to the library - grab a girlfriend and go shopping instead!!!!
