This writer made so many mistakes on when the comics were made, what years they were published, and almost does not acknowledge past creators at all except in brief not so well researched chapters.

This Freek writer out of the side show certainly promotes his own work, and seems to be a big supporter of the Dark Horse and Image Companies, which might explain his limited knowledge in so many areas, Maybe he should design video games and leave history of the comic book to real writers who bother researching the facts before putting them on paper
