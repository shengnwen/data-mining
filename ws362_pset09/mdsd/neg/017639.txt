First, let me admit, I only made it through the first book in this series and then about half of the second.  At that point it became unbearably ridiculous and I put it down, never to pick it up again.  There were parts that I liked (Syrinx and her ship) but the author went and focused on other less interesting plotlines.  The violence in this book is cartoony and fails to shock.  And the sex?  It's like a teenage boy wrote it.  Sorry, I like stories that push the envelope a bit more than this
