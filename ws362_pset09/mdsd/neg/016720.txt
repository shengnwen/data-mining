I had to order this twice from Amazon because the first time I ordered it used and it did not come with the book included which I thought was a rip off because the seller said you did not need it.  I ordered it again new and really realized the used seller was wrong as the book with CD's is an absolute necessity.  I rated it one star as I am reviewing the 1st purchase.  I was not happy
