Hands down this is Bukowski's single worst book.  Bought it when it first came out just before/after his death in 1994.  Having read just about everything the man had written, "Pulp" was a hugely disappointing epitaph.  If you've never read Bukowski start with "Post Office" or the short story collections, but avoid this like the plague.  A bad book.  I can't think of a single reason to recommend it
