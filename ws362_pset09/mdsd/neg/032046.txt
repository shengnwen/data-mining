Shame the author had to call the damn thing Steve Vai: Guitar Styles &amp; Techniques. This is just a tab and music book for some of Vai's more popular songs, with only one or two little tricks in there, like pick  squeal... If you want to play like Vai, just practise. Reading a book like  this isn't going to help you too much
