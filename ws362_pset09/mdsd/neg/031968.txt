I'm sure I'm being unfair to the author, but I was spoiled by reading RELIC,STILL LIFE WITH CROWS, THUNDERHEAD and (to a lesser degree) RELIQUARY, which are among my favorite books in this genre.  In comparison, I was underwhelmed by BRIMSTONE, DANCE OF DEATH, etc. I have just started Preston's TYRANNOSAUR CANYON, and I'm getting that same dragging feeling...It's not that it's not good, it's that it's not what you'd call a page-turner...
