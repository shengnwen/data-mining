I have loved this series since discovering them in the late 80's.  I think that O'Brian ranks with Austen, Twain, Forster, etc. regardless of 'genre'.  However, Simon Vance just does not do justice to this book.  I have not heard his renditions of others in this series, but if his Aubrey voice is consistent, they must all be disasters.  Aubrey sounds like one of Monty Python's Twits.  Vance also rushes descriptions that deserve much better pacing.  He also seems to miss much of the wit hidden in O'Brian's circumlocations -- or is much too subtle at conveying it.  I hate to diss working actors but....  Mr. Vance should try Wodehouse.  Bring back Tull
