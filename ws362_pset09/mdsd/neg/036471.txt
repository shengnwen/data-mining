As a cat lover, I've enjoyed the Cat Who... books immensely.  However, this book left me with a lot of questions, and there were several items mentioned that were never resolved.  Homer Tibbet had been a prominent character in many of that series of books, he dies, and that's the last mention of him.  Surely, James MacIntosh Qwilleran would have attended his funeral!  Same thing for Liz Hart.  She's killed in a car accident, and that's the last we hear of her.  What about the impact of her death on Derek Cuttlebrink,another prominent character in this series?  We've read all these books, these characters have become important to us, and suddenly we're left hanging in these relationships.  I'll continue to read the new books, but they're clearly not what they were even 3 or 4 years ago
