I was sorely disappointed with the text of this book. The use of "dino" before numerous words does not a catchy story make. I'm a huge fan of the illustrator and my toddler is a huge fan of dinosaurs, so we were eager for the book to arrive. The story, though, is written in such a way that it could be anything -- bears, people, dogs, aliens. There's nothing uniquely DINOSAUR about the characters. I was really hoping for a clever story that married the nature of dinosaurs with the life of a sailor -- perhaps even *teaching* me something about dinosaurs or life at sea. No such luck. The rhythm feels stilted, many of the rhymes sound flat and the two-page spread of all the dinosaurs spewing green vomit off the sides of the ship really is too much. As alluring as the cover art is, I recommend you pass on this one
