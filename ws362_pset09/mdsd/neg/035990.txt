i love anna quindlen, i love literature, i love landscapes of the imagination, and i love london, so i was ready to love this book.  however, it didn't give me nearly the depth i wanted.  the essays are oddly generic, the comments oddly superficial.  i was left with little impression, literary or geographical.  i'm sad
