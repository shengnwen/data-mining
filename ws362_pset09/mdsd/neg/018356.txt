While this book has a lot of great information, it's very hard for me to sit down and read.  Here's an example of a writing style:  Under "Quitting Programs" the author writes "If I had a twisted and warped sense of humor, I'd simly tell you to quit applications by pulliiing your Mac's power cord from  the wall socket.  (Luckily, I don't.)  There are, however, more sane ways to  exit a program..."  If you're like me, and this style drives you up the wall, try another book, because this book has examples like this on every page.  It just gets tiring reading past the cute to get to the meat
