So unmemorable I'm not even sure I read it. Books about damaged college professors have begun to blur for me. Please, can these supposed writers of fiction just stop writing about the faculty of small liberal arts colleges? I can't remember what happened in which. There was a coed involved. And some drugs, I think. Or maybe that was The Corrections
