T.E. Lawerence was certainly an extraordinary figure in history based on his achievements with the Arabs during WWI but not all heroes are great writers and Lawrence is NOT a good writer.  Do yourself a favor and get a book on Lawrence of Arabia by a professional history writer or although not exactly historically correct (but close enough) watch the fabulous movie "Lawrence of arabia".  You will still get the true feeling of what it was like back then and what Lawrence was trying to accomplish.  His book will just confuse the reader
