I got this book to affirm my choice to be a stay at home mom.  I am so blessed that I can stay home, but sometimes the drudgery gets to me...as it does so many other moms/housewives.  I wanted to try to focus on the blessings of being home and taking care of my family, instead of the negatives.  This book has some very good information to offer, but the author can be very crude and negative.  Some of the words she uses really turned me off, and I ended up putting the book away because of it.  I get it back out sometimes if I need a little pick me up, but I try to focus on the good parts and skim over the bad.  Overall, I would not recommend this book.  One that is full of the positives about being a mom without the negatives is "The Momstown Guide to Getting it All".  Would definitely recommend that one over this one
