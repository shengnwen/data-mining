Read the reviews and checked out the book.  What's wrong with the narrator?  Since this is a "fictional" biography, the narrator can wiggle his way in and out of funky --I mean, funky situations.  I sense a neurotic writer who is probably insecure and a bit on the "edge" (not cutting edge, but psycho-edge), who used this book as therapy.   Yeah, the writer intrigues at a real elementary, base level. . .  The hapa is represented in such a pathetic way, I was wondering if Fulbeck was resurrecting the tragic, neurotic,psycho mulatto (the main character of this book is reminiscent of Soaphead Church of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye. . . Pathetic.  Bad representation of hapas.  Get over yourself!  Please don't speak for all hapa guys, just your "fictional, biographical" self.  Can we move into the 21st century with more realistic representations of hapas already!
