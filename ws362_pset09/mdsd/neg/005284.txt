I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.

Boy, was I wrong.

This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.

I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words
