I was assigned this book as preparation for an A.P. English class, and I was incredibly disappointed with it. Although it features some stirring stories of bravery and compassion (hence the two stars), every word of it is poured over with syrup and then carelessly vomited onto the page. Only about half of the words in this book are necessary at all to the context of the stories it tells; the rest are flag-waving literary masturbation. Consider sentences like these:

"Millions of men and women were involved in this tumultous journey through adversity and achievement, despair and triumph. Certainly there were those who failed to measure up, but taken as a whole this generation did have a 'rendezvous with destiny' that went well beyond the outsized expectations of President Roosevelt when he first issued that call to duty in 1936."

Yes, I get it, Grandma and Grandpa were great! Now please, sir, learn how to structure a sentence! Most of the rest of the book is mindlessly self-indulgent treacle in this repetitive vein. How this man got a book deal is comprehensible to me only because I know how famous Brokaw is, but how any sadly misinformed American bought this book is more than beyond me. Please, if you respect yourself as a human being, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK
