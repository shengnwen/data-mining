I made the huge mistake of wasting my time and money on this CD set. She has absolutely no clue regarding the 'law of attraction' and her judgmental, 'you are pathetic and I'm wonderful' attitude was enough to make ask for my money back. I thought of destroying the CD's because like watching a slasher film I don't think they're good for anyone but I simply don't want her receiving any royalties for the garbage she's handing out as truth. If you are interested in something uplifting and something that will teach you about "Your Power To Create" please look elsewhere
