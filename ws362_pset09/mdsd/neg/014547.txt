I'm currently working through this book now as it's the required text for my General Chemistry course(s).  I have to say that I've had a harder time reading (and understanding) this text than usual.  I would not begin to recommend this book for general study, but let's face it, the only reason you're likely to buy this book is because it's required.

So here's how to use it:

Plan to read only one or two sections (4-5 pages per Section) in a study session.  Read it, work through the solved problems, skip to the problems covering that topic at the back of the chapter and see how well you do.

Buy the solutions manual - if you write out all your work (and you should, will particularly help if you forget how to solve something and your professor gives an open book/note exam), looking over the worked solutions will help.

Write down questions on specific problems and parts of the text/chapter you didn't understand.  Ask a tutor or the instructor.

The text is a hard read, but you -can- get through it. If I can do it, so can you.
