There are so many publishing errors in the first paperback edition (2004) of Leon Kass's book that it is almost unreadable.  It is obvious that no one even bothered to look at the book before sending it to retail.

Do a quick read of Chapter One and you will see what I mean.  Sentences are left entirely unfinished from one page to the next, leaving the reader wondering how much other text has been omitted.  Although page 35 starting with the word "nogoly" is pretty classy, my favorite example is the transition from page 37-38.  Here, Dr. Kass is begins to frame an argument, but the sentence is never completed.  Then, the next paragraph begins, "Crudely put, the argument could be stated this way."  What way?  Of course the irony is all the more poignant because this series of publishing mistakes follows Dr. Kass's meta-observation about the technology used in producing this very book.  Good stuff.

I would not be nearly as concerned had this book not been a god-send for my present research project.  But $17 later, I guess I have to track down a hardback copy in the hopes that I can actually read what Dr. Kass has written
