On the inside cover of this book the publishing details state,

First published New York 2004
Corrected edition published 2005

Which probably tells you all you need to know.  This is a book published for Americans and the shame is that it hasn't been corrected half enough.

The book is indeed witty in places but that doesn't save it from being weighed down by errors and mean-spiritedness.  If you share Queenan's passion for Edward VII, Monty Python and The Beatles you may be able to overlook its faults but I ended up skipping huge chunks.

To give an example, Queenan says he doesn't understand why there is a comedy called "No Sex Please We're British" running in London.  He then explains he hasn't actually seen it.  If he had bought a ticket, seen the show and perhaps talked to the cast or members of the audience he might have actually learnt something.  That is, he should have tried doing a bit of JOURNALISM.  

Sadly he doesn't bother and the book falls flat on its face.  I found it offensive (especially the chapters on Wales and "Ten things I hate about Britain" - by far the longest bit of the book) and disappointing.
