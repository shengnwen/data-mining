  After stumbling upon, at a relative's house, this collection of corny attempts to be witty and creative, I was shocked at how blatantly stereotypical and sexist this book was once I read it cover-to-cover. 
  Although there were one or two cute trinkets, I particularly remember the following lines much more strongly:

* Mom will introduce her to classical music- you let her listen to the Beatles

* Remember, if you tell a boy not to play with the electrical outlet, he will stomp off or do it anyway. A girl will cry.

* Cheer for her team. Even though they may be called the Pansies.

* Teenage girls spend hours doing something in their rooms. No man has ever figured it out.

* She may look cute, but her diaper can be as challenging as any boy's.

There was also another about letting her mother have time alone with her, and one about protecting her from boys.

 In conclusion,
Sure, this book is wonderful- if you live in the 50's.....
