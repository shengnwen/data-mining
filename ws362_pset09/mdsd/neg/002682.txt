I had to purchase this book for a network administation class. I find the zen and quotes and quizzes, annoying and distracting if not down right frustrating.After jumping back and forth trying to figure out what the heck  the author's point is...he throws in another piece of useless humor--I use  the term loosely. (Perhaps he should consider writing aerobic exercise  books). The case studies might be useful if the answer was, in fact, in  appendix C. re: chapter 4 case study.I certainly hope I can convince my  instructor not to use any more of these books
