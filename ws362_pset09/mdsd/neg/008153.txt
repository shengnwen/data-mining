In this book, the author tries to encourage Americans to forget the Declaration of Independence because even though a plurality of men have rights, the rights of individuals have never been identified.  So, the author becomes a member of Marilyn Ferguson's Aquarian Conspiracy and the New Age movement, which place individuals above `the people' of the USA and its Union.  On p. 277, the author says that the truth or falsities of the natural rights philosophy of the Declaration of Independence is a meaningless question.

While the author's conclusions can be challenged, his book has been out-dated by advanced knowledge.  First, his writing is out-dated by the 1920 discovery that' all empirical data are symbolic.' Thus, one must ask, 'How can the meaning of the Declaration of Independence become a meaningless when the Declaration is formed out of symbols that must be given meaning in order to interpret it correctly?  Second, modern science has recently led to the scientific proof of God's existence.  How can man have no natural rights if God exists?

If the author's succeeding generations are accepting this book, the USA is in deep trouble.
