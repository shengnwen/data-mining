To start with, I have seen pretty much all of the Wolf's Rain anime, (I may have missed a few episodes) and it wasen't all that great, anyway (THE ENDING, for great's sake!). The only thing outstanding in the anime was the music, logically nonexistent in the manga. Still, I bought the manga in hopes that it would differ from the anime in some respect, perhaps end better? Although the end is yet to come, I already dislike the manga mostly for the artwork, more precisely the wolves, whose legs resemble those of a girrafe's! And Kiba is supposed to be fluffy, but his fur looks much too stringy in the manga. Also, instead of selectively leaving out a few parts, they seem to have selectively chose a few parts to actually draw! It seems almost like a summary, they have so few scenes. What really ticks me is that my favorite part of the ENTIRE series, (which I didn't even like) the scene where Quent shoots UNDER Blue, smacking the crap out of Kiba, is left out. The entire charm of showing how in tune Blue and Quent are is left out. I just can't wait to see the second book, which I bet won't even show an ending. So much for this series- the only thing worth money are the two CD's. 

P.S.- one last thing that just struck me as odd and out of place, the text on the front of the book, "Wolf's Rain" is.... Pink. Not just a little. Bright..... PINK. Almost ANY other color would do for this depressing anime. Oh, and another thing, something GOOD- the bonus thing at the end of the book- I liked that. Very Nice
