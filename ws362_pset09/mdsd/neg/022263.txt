Sorry, I was looking for cool kosher Spanish recipes. The title "A Drizzle of Honey" sounded good but....

In front of each recipe is a story about someone who was tortured or burned at the stake or persecuted. Some of the descriptions are quite graphic, for example, a woman was tortured by putting a thin cloth over her mouth and then pouring water into her throat which gave her the sensation of drowning. At the last moment, they pulled the cloth out, and she told them anything they wanted. She begged only to die, but they did it to her again. Following is her recipe for heaven-knows-what -- I'm not hungry anymore.

In another vignette, a daughter turns her mother in to be burned at the stake, by reporting how her mother threw a crucifix down the latrine. Another recipe follows.

There are recipes for pork, and recipes by people dying of horrifically nauseating diseases. Other dinnertime conversation includes gouging people's eyes out, and the sanitary conditions of medieval Mexico. I never figured out what they were drizzling the honey on. Maybe it was some kind of torture.

It *was* a fascinating study of the Inquisition, but as a cookbook, it's terrible. Don't let the pretty picture on the cover fool you. 

It would have been better if they had just wrote about the Spanish Inquisition, and then offered the cookbook as a smaller, separate companion. 

I left this in the hallway for my neighbors to take. I was grossed out by it being in my kitchen.

For now, I'll stick with my 1,000 Jewish Recipes book, which contains some healthy Sephardic recipes
