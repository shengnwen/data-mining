Siegel presents an interesting view of the next few decades and how to profit off them. With the book, he had to do two things: prove that "Stocks For The Long Run" still works and join in on the many books about the effect of demographics on equities.

Siegel's portfolio theories are the strength of the book. Compounding dividends and the mean aversion theory of stocks have been a success. The time period Siegel uses to come up with hypothetical returns has been the best 50 years for US markets, so one can only hope it continues.

Siegel's demographic models show that Harry S. Dent's Age Wave gets completely absorbed by rising middle-classes around the world and several other smaller solutions. But the numbers just don't add up and I mean that quite literally. This is one of the largest demographic problems the planet has seen in 500 years. I fully expect some sacrifice coming up. Too many people owe too much money.

In case of a worst case scenario, such as those in "The Next Great Bubble Boom," "The Coming Generational Storm," "Empire of Debt," and Prechtor/Folsom's daily newsletters, Siegel recommends TIPS. Read that again. TIPS during a period of deflation.

I don't know what the future will bring, but at least I know what a business professor's computer models think will happen. If you're set on reading this book, be sure to read "Stocks For The Long Run" first
