This is a good overview, albeit very superficial, of the factors that drove the irrational exhuberance of the late 90s.  The role of the financial media, the so-called stock analysts, and others is explored and the consequence of the synergistic effects on the collective mind of the suckers who invested in the dot.com companies is highlighted.  Despite the book develops a dry topic, the book is an easy read; it reads well and will most certainly capture the interest of many readers.  On the negative side, this book can hardly be regarded as objective; the author has most certainly an ideological resentment against the Fed and Greenspan in particular.  This is not necessarily a bad thing - however, the criticism revolves around serious innacuracies in terms of the outlook and the role of Greenspan and the Fed in the NASDAQ crash.     It is unfortnate that the author had to resort to blatant lies when describing how the Fed and Greenspan viewed the role of the Internet and the growth of the dot.com stock bubble.  Readers looking for a an interesting non-fiction book, may be keen to read this book but serious analysts of the background of the NASDAQ debacle should look elsewhere - the inaccuracies are far too overwhelming.
