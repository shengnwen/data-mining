I regret this purchase.  As one reviewer said, this is just a coffetable book. It doesnt introduce any new idea to an educated woman. Who cant roll a napkin and tie a ribbon on it ??? It doesnt take a professional caterer to know that !!!  Funny, but an out of print 1960's cookbook by Mary and Vincent Price ``A Treasury.....'' showed far more intricate, elegant, and exquisite napkin foldings. The utensils showed in Tabletops are not even for very dining ! Worse, an old item was made to pass off as an antique centerpiece and I am a professional antique collector. I lived in Europe and this book does not deserve space in any European home or library. What I saw here, I see frequently in crafts store windows in small towns.  DONT BUY. I got instead ``Perfect Setting'' by Peri Wolfman (?) and finally, I got something intelligent with truly new ideas to captivate an intelligent woman. At best, give this book to a grade school kid
