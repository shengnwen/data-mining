I love Bentley Little - ordinarily - but this short story stinks!  Not too much more can be said about it.  Boy meets dead dad in closed mall, dead dad wants boy to kill mom, boy doesn't kill mom, that's about it.  Save your money on the 'real' novels, and if you haven't read it, start with 'The Ignored' for a book that is worth the money
