I bought the book for my girlfriend, but found myself without a book to read. I expected to find a nice account of a start-up (I love those kinds of books).
I couldn't get past the 2nd chapter. The sugary sweet telling of what MIGHT be a true story; the silly and unrealistic situations; and the contrived dialogue, which I can't imagine coming out or a real person's mouth, forced me to put this down
If you are a 14 year old girl you might be drawn to the story, but if you are looking for an business account of how the three dog bakery was started this won't be for you
