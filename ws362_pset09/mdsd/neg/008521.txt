I cannot believe this is the same person who wrote that fantastic book, Absolute Power.  David, what happened????  The story is very fascinating but the characters were not.  I found myself rooting for the villian who is definitely a very bad person.  But our herione, LuAnn, is not believable.  He has her as a backward hick who does not have a social security number on one hand and then he has her acting like a genius on the other hand.  There were just too many up and downs for me.  I am sure the next book will be back on track
