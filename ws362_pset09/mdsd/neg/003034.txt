My first Philippa Gregory book was "The Queen's Fool"  which I throughly enjoyed.  I could not waited to have time to sit and read!  So as I was towards the end of "The Queen's Fool" I began to see what other books were available by this author.  I bought "The Virgin's Lover" since to seemed to follow "The Queen's Fool".  Within the first 36 pages, I was completely frustrated at the layout of the novel.  TOO MUCH BOUNCING ABOUT WITH THE TIME FRAME.  And the time frames within the book do not match those in "The Queen's Fool".  For instance, in "The Queen's Fool"  Queen Mary dies in Winter 1558 but in "The Virgin's Lover" The Queen dies in Autumn 1558.  Another example is Lord Robert.  In "The Queen's Fool" Lord Robert lives at St. James Palace (Autumn 1558) and presses Queen Mary to name an heir (Winter 1558).  However, in "The Virgin's Lover" Lord Robert is low man in court with no where to go but to his wife's StepMother's.

                                                                 I think part of the problem with this type of time framing is the use Seasons.  Winter 1558....is this November December or January February?  Because further in the book the use of Winter 1558-59 is used. The back and forth at the beginning of the book set me up to confusion a few later chapters into the book.  I spent more time concentrating on keeping the time frame correct then actually enjoying the book which must be quite evident by now with me taking the time to write this review
