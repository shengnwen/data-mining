This book is terrible; nothing but a transcript of the personl opinions of various editors.  If you want a good transcript of meetings with accomplished editors go ahead buy it. If you want to read to learn how an edit is accomplished, and when and how to cut a scene, please don't waste your time.  There isn't a single page that provides instruction on how to perform an edit, or how these editors ever accomplished their work. I wish Amazon would have 0 stars as a choice. 
Be very sketpical of all the 4-5 star ratings given to most books on Amazon's website. I truly believe they're given by writers or publishers of these books
