I'm surprised that no-one has commented on the overly complicated knitting/purling method used in this book.  

The book shows only one way to make a knit/purl stitch, and it's slow and torturous.  You insert the right needle into the stitch as you normally would when knitting or purling, but then you hold the point where the needles intersect, pick up the working yarn with your free hand and wind it around the needle.  Then you pick up both needles again and complete the stitch as usual.  This method would frustrate any child, enough to get them to stop knitting altogether
