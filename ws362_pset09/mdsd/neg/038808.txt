The spells are folk-loreish in their nature, which is all fine and good, I don't expect any different.  What I do expect, and hope for, is an explaination of how things work.  What is the driving force behind this energy.  Why is the sun coming up.  What am I doing.  How is it different from what I've been doing?  Give me something anything to hang onto here.  Don't just tell me to play nice in the dirt.  Yes I know I'm being a tad harsh here.
