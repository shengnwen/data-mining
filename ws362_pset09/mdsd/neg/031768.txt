I didn't finish this one. It was slow to begin with. Once I got to the middle, there was a chapter that ended with Maddie totally upset and worried(even crying)about her sister Cassie. The first page of the chapter that follows has Maddie laughing at something where her sister was just involved in a crime. What happened here? Did a chapter get lost or something? 100% no brainer rea
