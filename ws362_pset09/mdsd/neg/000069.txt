Mary Ann, you're making up things. Kurt Cobain was suicidal, and tried to end his life in Rome. There's no disputing these facts. Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, the actual doctor who pumped Kurt's stomach in Rome and saved his life, knew Cobain was flight risk, and gave him a hospital room with no windows because of it. He knew Cobain was nothing more than a charming junkie from the moment he spotted his veins and heard Cobain speak after he was saved from his coma. Dr. Galletta also said that saving Cobain's life was a waste, which was so funny yet so true. Now THERE'S some brutal honesty for ya.

And here's the link, Mary Ann. Lose the denial:
