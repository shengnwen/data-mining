I count myself, perhaps presumptiuous, as an intelligent person, and I have managed to make an A in Biochemistry using this text; BUT it has everything to do with my ability to see the mistakes and editing errors in this edition!!  From mixing up abribiations to flip-flopping ratios this text is full of poor editing mistakes.  Not to mention the website connection is more confusing and limited.  It takes more time to figure out the wierd 5 graders level of programing that defines their "living graphs" than it takes to simply memorize word for word the page the equations come from in the text (if the equations are correct in the text in the first place!)  I am befuddled by the overwelmingly possitive reviews this second rate text has.  Did I some how get my hands on a first run of this text that should have been recalled like a lemon?  Every chaptor I take my text to my TA in the course and get an error clarified and she and I stand amazed at the amount of confusing errors in this text. I have since aquired a Voet text and look forward to reading it.     

As a side note: the "study guide" to this text that I bought is more acuratly a "confuse you guide" written by monkeys who took on female human names.  They add things up incorrectly for God's sake!

Even though it will cost me more money I hope to God that my second semester of Biochem uses a different text book
