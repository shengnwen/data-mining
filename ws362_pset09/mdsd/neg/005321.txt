I was somewhat disappointed after buying this 10 volume set. Though Kittel gives his all - around views of certain words, that method turned out to be his biggest problem. You will get 3 to 20 POSSIBLE answers to every Greek word addressed in the New Testament by Kittel. Unlike Greek lexicons, Kittel's take on meanings of words leaves one scratching his head. To anyone making a defence of certain theological positions, stick with Old and New Testament lexicons instead of Kittel's theological slants
