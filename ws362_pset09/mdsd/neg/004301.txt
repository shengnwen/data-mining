I've enjoyed earlier Mrs. Murphy books, because the plots and characters were interesting enough to outweigh some of the cloying aspects.  This book is basically like reading the encyclopedia, with a few bits of weak plot pasted in here and there.  Even the characters, both the regular ones and the new ones who appear in order to be bumped off, are boring.  However, you might enjoy the book if you like reading statistics about global warming, terrorism, agriculture, viticulture, agricultural and viticultural terrorism, horses, automobiles and trucks, etc., or rants about the author's pet peeves couched as "conversations" between characters.  I only finished it because I was in the car and didn't have anything else to listen to.  I've never written one of these comments before because I've never been so disappointed with a book
