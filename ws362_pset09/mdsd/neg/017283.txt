i never even got this book because apparently its not a book yet amazons web site said it was. it took me 4 phone calls with 4 different customer service reps for some one to figure that out. all they gave me for the inconvenance was a 15 dollar amazon gift card which i tryed to use and doesn't work. i still don't have the book i needed and it is 4 weeks into the semester. i have baought other things from amazon and gotten them but this expeirance makes me never want to use amazon again. i would like to give you a review of the actual book but i never recieved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
