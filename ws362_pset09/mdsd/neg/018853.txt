This is my first Woods book, and as a fan of this genre I was very disappointed.  The love story between Cary and Stone in this novel is one of the most unrealistic, ridiculous ones I have ever read.  Right before the rather dull and predictable climax, Stone dreams of marrying this woman and having kids with her.  WHY????  Other than her apparent physical attributes and sexual prowess she offers nothing of substance.  By the end of the novel, even before the incredibly predictable revelation of who pushed Sasha, she was an immensely unlikable person.  Yet we are to believe that our handsome, intelligent protagonist is in love with this woman.  COME ON!!!  

The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because there were one or two plot twists early on that I found interesting.  Even though I have a couple of Woods paperbacks on my shelf, I am not sure I will read him again.  If so, I hope the next one is better than this mess
