I was disappointed to read this book. Nye basically argues that the world has become very complex due to the global information age and that even though the US will remain as the world superpower in the coming decades, it is in its best interest to pursue multilateralism instead of unilateralism (altough he recognizes that "at times we will have to go it alone"). 

It's really hard to argue with Nye's argument, because on paper it sounds very true. Unfortunately, this book does not address the practical matters of foreign policy in the first decade of the XXI century. 

I bought this book expecting to find a practical, matter-of-factly counterpoint to the one spoused by the neoconservatives. I had previously read "Of Paradise and Power" (R.Kagan) and "The Threatening Storm" (K.Pollack). I wanted a counter-argument but I did not find it. I am still looking
