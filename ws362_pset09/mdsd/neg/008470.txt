This novel has some campy appeal since it introduces us to the famous Sam Spade, the morally ambiguous, hard drinking, but devastatingly attractive private eye.  The rest of the characters in this short novel don't amount to much, and as a result I didn't find the plot of much interest either.  I have to believe that this novel was voted onto the Radcliffe List at least partly on the strength of the movie that was based on it
