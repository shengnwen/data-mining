masters or Ph.D. students are in a continuos quest for TIME ... reading this book  takes a lot of it! (about 400 pages). however, it could be a good book for relaxed  researchers, with many useful tips( it addresses  historians mostly), so a researcher of  another discipline might find  himself passing many pages like i did. good chapters on: ORGANIZING:  PARAGRAPH, CHAPTER, AND PART / THE ART OF QUOTING  AND TRANSLATING / THE  RULES OF CITING: FOOTNOTES AND  BIBLIOGRAPHY. it is a well known book in  it's fifth edition, but the truth is: I did not enjoy reading it very  much
