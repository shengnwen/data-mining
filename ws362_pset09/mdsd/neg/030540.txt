This book is a total rehash of information that anyone with a weight  problem who has attempted to do anything about it  would already know. The  book is repetitive and tedious. You must wade through 150+ of obvious  information before the unoriginal diet plan is presented. The one redeeming  aspect of the book is the excercise suggestion. There are useful tips on  getting started excercising and a well-structured body sculpting program  using free weights. But this alone is not worth the price of the book
