  I got this book from the library, after having taken out, and IMMENSELY enjoyed other books with similar themes by Indian, and/or Indian-American authors, like Kavita Daswani, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Amulya Malladi. 

   I might have enjoyed this book, and I could have thought it was a good book, if only the author, and the publishers had considered the print and style when printing the books. 

   What I am referring to, is that in this book, EVERY SINGLE new paragraph is preceded by a long hyphen (dash) which was EXTREMELY distracting, and made it VERY difficult for me to get through what may or may not have been a very good book. 

   The hyphen (dash) that I am speaking of is this, for example:

    - She said, "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda". Then she went out to blah blah blah.

    - He said "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda".Then he went out to blah blah blah.

     - They said "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda".Then they went out to blah blah blah.

  
    Because of this distracting form of typing, I was barely able to get past the first dozen or so pages.

     It sounded like a very interesting book, but unfortunately I couldn't get past the constant hyphens. I'm sure its probably even harder for those with dyslexia, and other reading impairments as well as poor eyesight. 

   Maybe in the future, the author and publisher could think of this and maybe print the books just like other normal, regular books.

  Then maybe I'd try reading it again.
