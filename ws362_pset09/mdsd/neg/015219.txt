I found this book a truly disapointment !!
When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it .
Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !!
Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected !
