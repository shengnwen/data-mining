I read the book Heart of Darkness as a sophomore in high school and it was a very challenging book.  The book is very hard to understand and you will learn how to read between the lines if you don't already.  Joseph Conrad uses symbolism to show events and try to "spice" things up, but I could never grasp at those thoughts, unless someone pointed them out to me and then explained them to me.  You should not read this book unless you love learning about history and events that lead to great movies or reading about someone telling you a story.  Marlow is telling the readers a story throughout the book but he switches from him telling the story to dialogue between people, which can be confusing to keep up.  Overall, I did not like this book.  I would only recommend it to people who like history or people who usually like books that take an acquired taste.  I would not recommend this book to my friends because some of them may feel smarter after they read it and some may feel like complete idiots because they were so confused while reading this highly valued book.
