Don't get false hope people! This is not a cure! All this book talks about is Salicylic Acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, Cold Compresses, Retin A, etc STUFF WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT! I followed his directions exactly and I ended up with worse skin than before. I was red, peeling, itchy and still broken out. I have given up on finding a cure, I will probably have acne til the day I die.
