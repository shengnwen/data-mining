It was an ok book. I think that it takes a very special talent to write a historical journal and this author didn't have it. With a journal you are suppose to write your personal feelings and thoughts. But this author never really wrote Catherine's feelings, which misses a big opportunity to relate to the character. Also with journals normally that have one big problem and then small every day problems. The one big problem is resolved at the end of the book and the small problems are resolved in about a week. A Gathering of Days didn't have every day problems and had three some what big problems that were never drawn out. It is a quick read and great if you are doing a lot of research on that time period with other books. If you are reading this for fun don't bother its not entertaining.
