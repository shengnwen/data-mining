A good book for beginners, but not for anyone with at least a few months of marketing experience.  All chapters have good summaries and occasional case studies.  I've been doing marketing for about 2 years and find some of  the general strategies helpful.  For example, he advises using  call-to-action strategies, but doesn't go into details about the tricks of  the implementation.  Also, the first chapter on direct marketing is  excellent in that it ties in well conceptually with internet marketing.   Overall, I would say not worth your time if you're a professional, skim it  if you've had some experience, and a good buy if you're an absolute  beginner
