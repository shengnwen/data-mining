I bought this book as part of a two book purchase for a reference for a home built speaker project. The info that's there seems valid but doesn't cover the title's impression. There is no real info on building speakers and the design data is a little hard to follow. There are much better resources on the web. The basic program just shows how dated the book is.  I am sorry that I spent money on this...publication
