I've been on a reading streak where I've been reading pretty much any book I can get my hands on. This book nearly killed it. The writing was awful and the characters were horrible. I felt really bad for Matthew Rettenmund's thesaurus because I'm sure it was mangled by the time he got through with writing this book. The book was full of unrealistic dialouge and painfully unwitty and unfunny observations. The main character was frustratingly arrogant and unbearable. My only motivation to finish this book was to write a bad review of it here and move on to other, better books. People need to be warned
