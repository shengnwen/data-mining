I guess I am the only person who finds this cookbook horrible.  I ordered this book as a result of reading the reviews and the word "Frantic" in the title.  I assumed that the meals would be quick, easy, and tasty, but I was wrong on all 3 counts.
I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because I've only made 3 of the recipes and assume that the rest are just as disappointing.  A quick rundown of the recipes:
1)Cheap-o Cassoulet - Took a while to make as I had to thinly slice 4 carrots & 4 leeks, chop 2 onions, & 4 slices of bacon, press 4 garlic cloves, in addition to the 11 other ingredients.  Result was bland and watery - my boyfriend preferred pasta and butter.
2) Make Ahead Cheese & Hamburger Casserole: Took about 45 minutes to make and then had to be refrigerated for 1 day.  The result was an average tasting hamburger helper.  The real Hamburger Helper can be made in about 7 minutes and with ground turkey.  The result would be quicker, tastier, and healthier.  This dish has 20G of fat!!!
3)I'll spare you from the bland "Autumn Chix Breasts" which took at least 40 minutes to prepare with a bland result.  I recommend any "shake and bake" coating or a home-made similar one.  Try one of the Loony Spoons or Crazy Plates cookbooks instead.  It will save your $ and time!
