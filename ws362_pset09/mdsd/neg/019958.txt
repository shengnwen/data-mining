It's been a few months since I read this, but I thought I might give a review.

I found this book horrid. It was not organized in a way that would be simple and easy for a reader. As a writer of historical fiction I was interested in finding out about daily life during the Civil War. But I would find references from all years thrown together so I had to fish out the important details.It was not broken down by years or decades which I think would have been much easier. I gave up on this book because I couldn't find the information I needed.

If you are a writer and are thinking about this book I suggest getting it from the library, and if you believe it will be of use to you buy it then.
