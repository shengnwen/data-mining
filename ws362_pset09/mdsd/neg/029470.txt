I bought this book recently while in Thailand, hoping that Thurow would offer-up something interesting - more or less along the lines of the early 90s work, such as "Head to Head." Not here. I checked the date and the book was initially published in 2003, which means he probably wrote the mainstay in 2002. To me, if you have never thought about globalization and its implications, then buy it. If you have already, then this is nothing more than a collections of truisms that anybody with any interest in the subject would know already
