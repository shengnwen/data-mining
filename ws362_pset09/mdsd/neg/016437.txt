Sorry for the sarcasm, but I can't help thinking just how uninspired this book is.  Imagine a counter to this book.  This book would promote "hate", "dishonesty", "immorality", "ignorance, "ingratitude".... you get the picture.  This Mormon leader's great contribution to world is to say we should be honest?  Now that was profound!  Sadly, Gordo and his wrinkled cadre have this bad habit of taking the basic decency of the members of the church and attributing it to the implausible myths they peddle to the world. 

As an avowed atheist, I encourage everyone to be honest, moral, learned, and all the things Gordo promotes in this book.  There is nothing wrong with promoting these and they have nothing to do with Mormonism.  But this book is written for children and sheep.  Promoting this book among the various books that seriously discuss morality, ethics and other serious issues is like watching a high school team play the New England Patriots or comparing a Janice Kapp Perry vapid song to Bach's Mass in B minor.  

Mormonism is declining in real terms because their leadership does not have the capacity to address and provide any illumination to the relevant issues of the 21st century.  This book should confine itself to the children's section or to the local Deseret Book store.
