Admiral Byrd's account is believable to me. This book however, in my opinion, is just too farfetched. Father and son in small boat, day and night, icy cold salt water at north pole, strong waves, days and days (food/ toiletry?)go into eartth-12 foot people in- satan and silks -& 2 years later all he can say is mammoth elephants and apples are really large. What? What about philosophy down there, strange animals or food, technology? What else? Huh? That's it,folks- basically, nothing to learn at all!  Not much to say after living there 2 years!!! Ha! Check it out at library and see for yourself. boring.makes no sense.pathetic. uninspired, unimaginative.dull and unbelievable in my opinion, but see for yourself and decide.
