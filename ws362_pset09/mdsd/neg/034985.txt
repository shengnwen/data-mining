I'm about 1/2 way there and its a struggle to finish - not Cussler's usual - maybe because there is another author and its not his?  Way too many characters - I'm no dummy, but I have to keep referring to the front of the book to remind myself which one of the "cast of characters" he is talking about because he switches every other paragraph to a totally different scene with totally different characters.  The story isn't bad - but beside the confusion of figuring out who he is talking about and where they are, there is so much extra non essential filler in it that it is hard to get involved in it.  I hope it gets better as it goes along, but I doubt it
