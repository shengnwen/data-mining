    I am actually quite suprised to see so many positive reviews of this book.  The first in the series "Hidden Queen" was actually a decent read.  I'd give it 3.5 stars.  Things just went down hill from there though.  
    I agree with a previous reviewer that the characters are very flat with absolutely no motivation behind many of their actions.  The protagonist becomes a god without warning,,,and apparently not a powerful one.  There were no other deities to oppose her...one would think the book should have ended right there.  The romance is lukewarm at best.  Give me a REASON for someone to fall in love.  
    The antagonist had odd personality changes throughout the book.  At one point he kills an entire community of women (burns them alive) to get to the protaganist.  However after years of searching for the protaganist when he finally captures her he just twiddles his thumbs and leaves her wasting in a dungeon for months.....to be rescued.  I found it a little hard to believe a ruthless war hero king who clained his throne by force of arms would find himself incapable of removing the one person in the way of him staying on the throne permanently.    
    In summary, the characters are flat, lack motivation and personality. The romance is contrived and so are many of the "relationships" between characters in the book. The ending is anti-climatic.  The author spends the last 30 pages or so closing up an extremely boring romance.  Don't think Martin, Don't think Hobb, Don't think Fallon, Don't think Jordan, Don't think Haydon.  Trust me...it's subpar
