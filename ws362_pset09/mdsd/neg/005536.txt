Of the first three Anita Blake's novels this is surely the worst.
This hit me as totally unexpected and I am very disappointed.

The problem lies in the plot, misconstructed, discontinuous, a heap of unrelated events thrown together with little sense, not to mention a mass of inconsistencies spread throughout the pages. Inconsistencies in characters descriptions and details are to be found in all the first four books but here we have mistakes such as Anita driving her car which was wrecked the night before and is again the day after. Hard to swallow.

In such a context that some ideas are really good and some characters very interesting matters very little
