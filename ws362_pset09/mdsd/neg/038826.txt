Just Awful
It seems I only write reviews when they are negative, but I think this is because I feel so cheated when a book is so horrible that I actually feel angry for having invested my time and money in it. I feel I want to warn fellow readers so they don't make the same mistake I made. This just may be the most long-winded, boring, disappointing book I have read in a long time. The characters were not believable.  However, they are gutless and heartless. Imagine abandoning your own daughter because she is the victim of rape, or any crime for that matter.  Imagine the daughter accepting this as though she deserves to be treated in such a fashion by her own family. The storyline went nowhere, and the author prattled on and on without ever getting to the point. I stubbornly kept reading in the hope that at some point it would finally draw me in, but NO SUCH LUCK! In addition, the ending left much to be desired. What a disappointment
