I was expecting a book which would explain how to handle specific requests from the film directors.  A book which would contain the "tricks of the trade" drawing solutions for the cameramen to understand ... it was an enourmous disapointment to me to find out that the book contained chapter after chapter talking about perspective and how to draw.  The title is misleading and the drawings are rather dull.  I would only recommend it to students with limited drawing knowledge and desire to storyboard.  For me it was a waste of money
