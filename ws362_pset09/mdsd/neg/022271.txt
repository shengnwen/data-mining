Keneally writes reasonably well -- not exciting, but serviceable prose. Possibly if you are a committed Catholic and interested in the difference between today's Catholic beliefs and those of fifty years ago, this novel might keep you awake. Otherwise, this novel is exhausting in its exploration of an inexperienced priest's coming-of-age, and the plot is slow-paced--I couldn't make it to the promised murder. Besides, the victim was so uninteresting, I couldn't bring myself to care who might have killed her
