I bought this book to inspire me to do what I had already set my mind to do anyway. Would I have taken the leap without having read the book? Yes. In fact, I did in spite of the book's uninspiring examples, which instead of encouraging me, nearly discouraged me.

Perhaps a better  title would be DO WHAT YOU LOVE AND THE MONEY WON'T MATTER, maybe then I wouldn't have been so disappointed with the examples. I've found that by doing what I love, I don't NEED vacations, new clothes, entertaintment, etc., nor the money  necessary to buy those things to fill the emptiness of unfulfilled life.  Am I happier doing what I love, without the money? Yes, a million times happier. (And I've been doing this for 10 years.) But I agree with other reviewers before me, Joseph Campbell is more inspiring.
