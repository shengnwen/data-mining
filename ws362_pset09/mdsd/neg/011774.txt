The material in this collection is fabulous but not all original. I forked out some hard-earned bucks because I thought I was getting new fiction on the cutting edge by authors that I had read and admired and found that this book offered a lot of warmed up leftovers.  Most of the big names in this collection gave the author rights to reprint material from their previously published books, books that were several years old.  I think the book was marketed in a misleading way
