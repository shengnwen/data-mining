The "It's the 2000's and everything is going to be great because nothing can go wrong" theme was the opposite of what I was looking for. 

I'm interested in books that give solid detailed steps to take when preparing for your financial future and this book seems to have a "don't worry about it" kind of tone. I found it pretty worthless.  As if he just wrote a book that told people what they wanted to hear in order to get them to by the book.
