According to my online purchase records, I bought Fear and Trembling nearly 4 years ago, probably on impulse because Amazon had recommended it to me.  I have just now, this evening, managed to finish it.  Considering that the book is only 132 small pages of large type, maybe as long as a short story in the New Yorker, the fact that it has taken me this many years to make my way through it should tell you a lot about how dull this narrative is.  The book has practically no plot, no suspense whatsoever, and all the depth and insight of a 22-year-old working in her first job at a large corporation.

Why the two stars?  It is not incoherent, and it is sort of interesting to read the narrator's misconception that somehow her experiences are worth writing about.

I can imagine that this book, in its original French, might make a good assignment for a second-year college course in the language for non-native speakers.  At least in the English edition I bought, there is plenty of margin space for a student to make notes
