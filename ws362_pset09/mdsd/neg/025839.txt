Reconnaissance, reconnaissance, and some more reconnaissance! That is exactly what this book is all about. I won't recommend any serious reader to buy this book, as it does not benefit you from anything except amuse you with what can you do in your free time sitting in front of a search engine. I doubted the contents of this book even before buying this book, but due to IT consultant by profession, I overlooked my skeptic view and bought it. I have nothing against this book, but this book is addressed to the audience those who are already in IT field, and it does not teach you anything new for which you will shell our forty buck and read over 500 pages. 

However, this can be a good book for some reference and to add in your computer room shelf, but it's just overpriced for the contents it has. Don't expect some great new stuff, it is just some stale information which you will find from internet for free anyway, and hey try to Google it!! ;).

I still think this book as hyped one which failed to deliver what it promises.
