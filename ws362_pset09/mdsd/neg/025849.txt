If "liberal" ideas have the effect on women that the author claims, then how was George W. Bush reelected in 2004?  Obviously the "liberal message" isn't working and her thesis has been disproven.

Besides, these magazines' portrayals of super-rich celebrities as "normal" people just like you and me is a prime example of how in the U.S. we are taught to worship the wealthy and to believe we, too will be wealthy one day.  Sorry Ms. Blythe, that is not a liberal idea, but a conservative one.  Also, the gossipy, malicious, tell-all that this book is merely panders to the lowest common denominator and to the baser instincts which conservatives always bemoan liberalism and the sleazier aspects of pop culture as appealing to.

I'll be the first to admit that most mainstream women's magazines influence women to believe they are overweight and that these magazines sanitize celebrities' home lives, but if you want a solution to or an intelligent analysis of these issues, this isn't it.
