I was looking forward to gaining some real insights with this book.  However, it is one of the most disapointing books on the subject I have read.  The infomation is dated, the size of the book is pitifull. Trying to remain objective, there are a few handy formulas for detailed calculations, the rest of the information here is old news, and all available for free on the net. Ed has, in the past written some of the best and most well known material on this subject.  But this book is just not worth buying.  Ed Rosenthal where has your integrity gone
