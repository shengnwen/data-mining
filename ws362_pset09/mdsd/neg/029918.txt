This is a terrible book. It isn't really a comparison of the two views, as it presents itself to be, primarily because it really only presents one view, that being the Dispensationalist view. The author gives a cursory reading of what he sees as the major points of Covenant Theology, but he mostly just uses it as a foil for his presentation of Dispensationalist Theology. Most of the book consists of arguments consisting of a brief reading of the Covenant view followed by a more thorough reading of the Dispensationalist view and then a discussion of how Scripture supports the Dispensationalist view. 

The author does not present the two views in a fair-minded way. He does not use first-class sources for the Covenant view. He often uses scripture out of context, and fills words with dubious meanings without justification or argument. There is no bibliography per se, just a list of references in the end notes, so the book doesn't even really serve as a jumping-off point for a more thorough study of the questions it covers.

This is not a scholarly book. It isn't a good book. This is a book for people who are already solidly on the Dispensationalist side of the fence and want their current position supported. I recommend running away from this book with all possible speed
