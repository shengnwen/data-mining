I found the plot of this book impossible to follow.  It contains excessively verbose descriptions with a lot of cliches. The hero almost dies twice in a row and is each time magically saved for no reason.  And there are only so many times I can read variations of "he swung his sword really hard" and "it was a really scary dragon."  The illustrations are quite beatiful, though
