For years, I have kept a cherished copy of this book, probably because someone I know and admire wrote a glowing review of it in the Asian press.

Recently, however, despite the fact that I live in Thailand and am fascinated by the region, I realized that I had never read this book!

So I picked it up again, and began to understand why.  From the very first pages, the reader is assaulted with terms for peoples (Mon, Wa, etc.) which remain totally unexplained.  Of course, someone who has spent his life dealing with the history of Thailand feels that such terms are self-explanatory, but they are NOT.

Add to this particular opacity, what?  The plodding style of the author, who is apparently incapable of generating reader interest or suspense no matter how compelling the tale.  And then add in the fact that Wyatt took TWENTY YEARS to revise the first edition, and produce a second, slightly better edition, and you are forced to the conclusion that Wyatt finds writing in English to be an extremely difficult job.

And, if you are writing history for anyone but specialists, that very nearly disqualifies you.

Nevertheless, this book is probably the ONLY available general history of Thailand.  How sad
