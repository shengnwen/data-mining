Simply put, this book is terrible.  It's advertised as "hard sci fi" but the ideas, not even to mention the story or characters, just aren't there.  The characters are all paper cutouts and the storyline drags very badly.  I kept checking the page number and thinking, "Is it possible I've read this many pages and still feel like the interesting part hasn't started yet?"  Worst of all, the "hard sci fi" consists of a Jovian gas-based society (which has been done much better by other authors) and nanotech machines, the Wheelers, which they simply *skip* actually describing in detail in the book!  By the end I felt scammed by the marketing of this book.  If you are looking for hard sci fi, do yourself a favor and buy anything by Vernor Vinge, Ian Banks, Greg Egan, or any of the many other authors writing much better works in this genre
