This book is an excellent example of talking down to children and treating them like they are little idiots, instead of intelligent beings who notice things and are trying to get the world figured out. Almost nothing I consider important about the given objects is what Ms. Brown considers important. I pity the poor children who believe it's imperative that apples be round. What, do apples make good wheels? Surely what's really important about apples is that they are food. 

"The wind is important because it blows" is exactly the same as saying "The wind is important because it's wind." That says nothing. Tell the children why it is important that air move. 

"A daisy is important because it is white." I can think of no reason why it is important that a flower of any kind be white. In my experience, we value flowers in general and daisies in particular because they are pretty. And of course, there's the whole "He loves me, he loves me not" thing, which makes daisies important because they have petals. Color just doesn't factor in.  

And so on and so on. This list is complete baloney. Every time I remember that an apple is important because it's round I get pissed off.  It infuriates me that the author thought it's good to tell children this baloney, that the publisher published it, that the book is still in print, and that anyone would treat children as though they hadn't a brain in their heads.
