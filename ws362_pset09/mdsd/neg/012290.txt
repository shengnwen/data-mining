A book in which the author expresses his enjoyment of Jerry Lewis is not a history.  What on earth do his personal likes and dislikes have to do with anything?  This book is written with an almost flippant, name-dropping tone that detracts from the subject matter.  After all, he is talking about Hollywood, not a subject which lacks in flashy self-promotion.  I came away from it less than impressed
