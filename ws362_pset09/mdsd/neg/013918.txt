The story is OK, but this book is riddled with technical errors.  A few examples:  Submarine dolphins worn by enlisted personnel are silver, not gold which are worn only by officers.  The captain of the boat (not ship) would not address an enlisted man as &quot;Mr.&quot;; that mode of address is reserved for a senior officer to a junior officer.  A yeoman would not be making notations on a navigation chart, as depicted in this book; that is done by quartermasters.  A Tomahawk missile was said to be traveling at 550 mph, or Mach 7; since the speed of sound at sea level is approximately 761 mph (Mach 1), there is something wrong here.  And the list goes on and on to point of distracting this reader from the story.  The author should have had better technical input and proofreading
