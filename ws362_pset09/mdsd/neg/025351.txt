If you want bad gourmet recipes, then this is your book. The basic information is poor at best, and the "fancy" gourmet recipes are not even good. When I begin to cook a meal, i'll look in the "joy of cooking", get disappointed, and go and find what I want on the internet. The recipes are what you would expect to eat in the early 20th century. This book should have stayed there. I'm sure your grandma loves it though! squid in ink sauce?! for real? c'mon
