This review concerns the unabridged audiobook of The Last Camel Died at Noon read by Susan O'Malley. I have read that book before and I am a fan of the Amelia Peadody-series which I have read completely. The books vary in quality but they are always enjoyable. The present title is one of the most unique stories - best explained as being a satirical citation of Henry Rider Haggards SHE. I also like audiobooks and last year I first heard a Peabody-novel narrated by Barbara Rosenblat. It was quite a treat. I wasn't able to get "The last Camel.." read by her then, but was content to order this unabridged version read by Susan O'Malley. However, it was the worst audiobook I ever listened to. ...I therefore recommend that if one ever want's to listen to an Elizabeth Peters audiobook than only if Barbara Rosenblat is the narrator. Anything else would be  selfdeceit. Rosenblat even turns the weaker episodes into celebrations (all by Recordedbooks)
