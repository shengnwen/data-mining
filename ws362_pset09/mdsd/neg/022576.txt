I can only imagine that the bulk of the 8 reviews before this one were written by the authors' friends and relatives.

This book is a shallow and worthless trawl through platitudes. The 'writers' whose collective wisdom furnishes the framework for the effort, are not people you will have heard of, or are ever likely to.

This is a homework project researched in the authors' own backyards. The raw material is would-be writers from local writing groups. When somebody with a decent track-record in fantasy writing gets together with some of their peers to do this job properly, then we'll have a book worth reading
