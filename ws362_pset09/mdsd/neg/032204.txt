  Analysis wassuperficial and prose was lacking.  Homza definitely seems to havestrong views about the Renaissance, but she stretches her evidence tofit what she wants the Renaissance to be.  The primary sources shecites are appropriate for this sort of investigation, but herinterpretations are completely off-base.  I wouldn't have minded theout-of-the-box characterization if the writing had been good, but itwas oh-so-droll.  It lacked flow and zest.  A little wordiness would have helped,Lou Anne.
