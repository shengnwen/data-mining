This book is an insult to the women and men who fought so hard against sexism, racism , militarism and the other ugly aspects of corporate America during the 1960's, 70s, 80s, 90s and beyond. It is an invitation to affluent spoiled brats to get their share of a pie produced by garment workers in Bangladesh and Mexican cleaning ladies and feel good about it at the same time; after all, when you get your share of the goodies you are really being a feminist, beating men at their own game. Reasoning like this could be used to justify rising to the top in the Mafia or the CIA.      At one point Wolf claims that &quot;we&quot; would wage war to stop atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. Funny, I don't remember hearing about her enlisting when war really came. Perhaps that kind of thing is for lower class women (and men) who don't fit into her bourgois pseudo-feminist scheme.       I saw Wolf's name listed on a &quot;Learning Annex&quot; ad with pop psychologist Wayne Dyer, various get rich quick frauds, dubious instructors who will teach you how to break into acting, and similar characters. Nice company she's keeping these days. I guess that's called fighting fire with fire
