Unlike most others who have posted here, I didn't like Ian's Walk. I found that the story spent a lot of time highlighting how different Ian was from other kids and completely ignored anything he might have in common with his sisters. I was uncomfortable with the author's decision to state Ian's autistic tendencies in such an outright way, since clearly everyone's experience with autism is difference. I walked away from this book, thinking we could have another Rain Man catastrophe on our hands. Everyone watched that movie and figured that they understood autism, when they really just knew about one fictional man with autism
