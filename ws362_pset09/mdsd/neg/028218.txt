Most of the issues that the author describes are the same as for any biological child.  For example, The parents are trying to live through the child, and put their own goals onto him/her.  (Who doesn't know biological families like this??)  The child is a perfectionist and tries to please everyone, becoming unhealthily obsessed with being "good."  (Again, we all know children like this, whether adopted or not; the high schools are full of them).  The author takes her experience (adoption in the 1940s) and assumes that things are the same today.  Very few adoptive parents today would lie to their children, pretending that they had given birth to them.  This is 2006!  This book MIGHT be good for people in middle age who were adopted as infants-- assuming that they are still interested in deconstructing their childhoods
