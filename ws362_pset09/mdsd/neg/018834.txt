I really didn't like this book to say the least.  I didn't like the way it was written.  I didn't like the story line at all.  None of it made much of any sense and much of it seemed to contradict some basic Jedi guidelines.  I was looking forward to reading this I thought it would go more into the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin a few years after Episode 1.  I thought it might include some insight on Padawan training.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Overall it was a really stupid story that wasn't at all believable, even in the realm of the Star Wars universe.  Just bad.

It does have a couple relevant story lines that you might want to know if you plan on or do read all the Star Wars books published. I would only read this if you are one of those people, otherwise I would definitely recommend skipping this one
