This small book has a load of recommendations on the back cover. Yet, I find it unsatisfactory. It meanders in and out of the history of Islam and the Middle East, but loses focus on the way. Subjects are touch upon by conclusion and generalisation, but not really in depth. It is obvious, however, that Lewis knows quite a lot - but still some clear mistakes (or misformulations?) in chronology and factual events mar the picture, and damages the feeling of trust to how the subjects are handled. It has some really interesting insights in how the USA became the great enemy of the Islamists, and many details that makes the Middle East history much more detailed than it usually appears. Yet, in walking there and there, it lacks the solid foundation on facts and events present in the books of Serge Trifkovic, for example. And while Trifkovic writes with determination and feeling for the importance of facing the Islamist threat, Lewis merely mentions the threat, but then walks on to something else. And he doesn't really connect the issues of Holy War and Unholy Terror in depth as promised in the subtitle.

Bottom line: While interesting, I suggest to spend time and money on better books. They are out there
