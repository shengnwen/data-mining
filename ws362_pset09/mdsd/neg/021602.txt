   I was unpleasantly surprised by this book.Reading it before I saw the movie, I didn't like it.With a lack of dialogue, it seems that the the story moves slowly, not really going anywheree.One of the only things I did like about it was the subject matter, drawing readers in to something they see regularly in Washington. I wasn't happy with the lack of character interaction, there was definetly alot more telling by Buckley than showing, he needed to let the story just tell itself throught dialogue and character interaction.I was really expecting something better in this book
