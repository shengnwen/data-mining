I usually read through one of Coulter's novel in a few days, exspecially her FBI/intrigue plots. I bought this as soon has it was released in paperback and still haven't finished it. The plot was slow and the main heroine a little too likable. Spoiler: Neighborhood teenagers diving on her body to protect her from bullets?! Talk about a work of fiction. No one expects a romance to be on our plane of reality, but in the same solar system would be nice
