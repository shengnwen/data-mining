I don't know why everyone thinks that Patricia Cornwell is such a HOT writer!  I find her books to be very poorly written with many inaccuracies.  In this book Kay orders a "Palligrini water with Lemon" and then two pages later she calls the bartender back over to forget the "Chardonnay" and orders something stronger.  What's that about?  Doesn't anyone edit or proofread her books before they go to print?  With the pre-publication money in her pocket; I guess they don't need to. Sloppy, slopply, sloppy.  I think she would feel like she owes it to her fans and readers who keep putting up with this stuff just for a possible interesting story and plot line.  Even if most of them are borrowed from the newspapers.  This will be the last of her books that I will read
