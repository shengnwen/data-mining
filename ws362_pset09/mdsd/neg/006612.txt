My friends and I just read this as part of our new "Fashion-Group Book Club"...I didn't dislike it as much as they did, but it does give one reason to marvel at how much completely unspectacular writing and recycled bollocks make it to publication.  It even came to us recommended so I'm surprised at how just-not-good it is.  Even the pictures, the best part, are all ones I swear I've seen a million times before.  So, if you're looking for photos of Kate, I remember a book that came out on her in the nineties, a lot more expensive of course, but that one was excellent.  "Model of Imperfection": not recommended
