This text is one of the most poorly written I have read on the subject of data structures.  The JAVA overview should be removed since it goes into no real details pertinent to data structures, and uses a grammar to define the language which serves to confuse more than assist in learning.  I suppose they felt they needed to be different from other texts in some way to sell... how about writing a clear readable text with good code examples?   There is apparently no code in the text which is compilable (only code fragment) and obvious errors in some of these code fragments.  The writing and questions are ambiguous and unclear in many places.  I don't see why any university would choose to use this text.  Maybe the publisher is giving kickbacks to the department?!?  You could spend your money more wisely... such as on Sedgewick's Algorithms in C++, and a JAVA text such as Deitel and Deitel as a resource instead..
