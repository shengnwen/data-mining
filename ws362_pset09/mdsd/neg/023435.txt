Wow - but not in a good way.  Possibly the worst romance novel I've ever read, and that is saying something.  Stick to Lindsay's earlier Malory novels.  Most of them are delightful and worth revisiting.  "Captive" skims over parts of the story that could be exciting and dwells on the boring, predictable and outright unbelievable.
