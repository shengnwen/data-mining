Immature... smug... arrogant yet insecure. It's really hard to sympathize with a character who is so completely self-absorbed, bitter and judgemental. What were her redeeming qualities?  
It sounds like I'm alone in this, but I found it hard to relate to her -- it really seemed that she was unloved throughout most of the story because she was ... unlovable.
