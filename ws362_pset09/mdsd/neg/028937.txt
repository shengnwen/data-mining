The centuries surrounding the beginning of the Second Christian Millenium are a relatively unknown time even among those, such as myself, with an interest in History.  The light that was shed on this time by the book was interesting to me, as were the concepts of Paris as a small town and Europe as a wilderness.  While some of the characters were interesting, the narrator spent too much time telling what was happening rather than showing it (i.e. through dialogue).  The made the book difficult to get throug, especially in the final chapters.

The symbolism of the book was unclear as well, most especially the strange cottage to which the young black slave fled after stumbling on it.  I felt some of the sexual descriptions were gratuitous and unecessary and while the refusal of the author to give the wives names seemed to echo the tendendcy in the Bible to do the same to women, the Bible does give names to those who play an important role.  Although I disagree to the reveiwer that this was done with mysoginist intent.  Unfortunately the symbolism was either too subtle for the average reader or it completely missed the mark, and I lean toward the latter
