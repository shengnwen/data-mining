Lucie Arnaz herself said this book is full of false statements.The information is wrong and way off. There is a picture in there that says &quot;Lucy trying to make it in New York, in early modeling days&quot;, and it shows a woman with no top on. Lucie Arnaz said that it is not Lucy, it doesn't even look like her. If Lucille Ball could see that she would be very embarrassed. If you want learn about the true life of Lucille Ball read Love,Lucy the one and only autobiography of Lucille Ball told straight from her heart
