Sir Cyril Burt achieved unparalleled results in researching the effects of environment and heredity on identical twins.  Only after his death did it become clear that the alleged research had never happened, that Burt lied to further what he perceived to be a greater truth.
Sadly, the possibility must be considered that Milton Erickson did likewise.  Not only do the results he claimed to have achieved involve impossible to believe coincidences and phenomena far beyond anything ever achieved by anyone else.  They also include results that even unshakable believers in hypnotism's real existence concede are unreplicable and should be impossible.  If Erickson really accomplished what he claimed in various medical journals, then he was a miracleworker beyond compare.  Somehow I doubt that.
