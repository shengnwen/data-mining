The book is a complete waste of money from every aspect. If you are a serious martial artist or a coach, I'd recommend books by Loren Christensen, especially "Fighter's Fact Book". If you don't have a serious martial arts background, I'd highly recommend "Common Sense Self-Defense" by David Garcia and Steward Smith
