Living near McCarter Theater in Princeton my AP English class got to go see a production of this play while it was still being work-shopped for Broadway.
Afterwards, my teacher asked what we all thought, of course first stating that she loved it so that all of the "favorite" students knew which opinion to take.
They all raised their hands and said they loved it to, however, no one could say why.  Why not?  Because everyone hated it.
I was the first to open the flood gate.
"I thought it was ridiculous.  It has no real substance to the plot."
"That's because the language is the point"
"Well the language is the worst part.  Why would poor factory workers speak in absurdly flowery metaphors?  Especially ones that stupid ('Does the bicicle miss the boy?')?"
My teacher flipped out at this.
"You don't understand!  That's what literature is all about!  Metaphors!"
The woman, asides from being a gigantic b**ch, was merely blinded by what reviews had told her to think and by her crush on Jimmy Smitts.
A month later, the New York Times, reviewed the play after its Broadway premiere.  They said pretty much exactly what I thought.  I was going to bring the review into class, but why bother?  The woman already hated me.

PS. One earlier reviewer discussed how it was impossible to determine from the production the the daughter was raped.  During a Q&A afterwards, Emily Mann stated that they were having problems deciding how to show this.  I agree with the reviewer that they clearly didn't come to a good solution
