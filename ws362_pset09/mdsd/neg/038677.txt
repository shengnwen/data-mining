This is a little far fetched but bare with, a London born Actress transplants herself to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap...and then writes about a London born Actress being transplanted  to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap. Got it? Personally this psuedo semiautobiographical novel about Hughes life (or lack there of) is testament that some actors should remain just that! The cynical nature in which her character sees Los Angles and the people surrounding her is way too close to accurate for this to be classified as true "fiction" and the parallels between her main "villain" Meredith Contini and a certain fabulous legendary New York Based All My Children icon is so blatant it borders on insulting. Her work on General Hospital was good, Her work on All My Children was tolerable, at best, but her work as a writer makes me ashamed to admit Finola Hughes is a fellow Brit.
