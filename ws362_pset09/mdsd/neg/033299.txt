I got this book because I just wanted to know what was necessary for healthy conception (what vitamins to take, ideal weight, healthy cycles, ovulation timing etc.). There are TONS of books out their for fertility PROBLEMS... so this book focuses on them WAY too much. Also, he is very alarmist about things we know are not really problems. Like computer screens at work and microwaves... updated computers and microwaces are not a problem (he's referring to computer and microwaves from the early 80's). Also, they address the average woman who would buy this book (a young to middle aged married woman who plans to try to conceive soon) but ALWAYS qualify it by addressing people who are likely NOT buying this book... homosexual partners, single women who want to concieve through science, people who already have diagnosed fertility issues and are being treated for them. That's NOT who is buying this book.

Overall, the basic information is there, but the scare tactics are a bit over the top and anybody who is not educated on human biology may be overwhelmed with semi-false information
