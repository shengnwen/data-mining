Eden in the East turns the prevailing archaeological view of southeast Asian prehistory upside down. The author presents a view of southeast Asia as the cradle of civilization with the technology and culture of an Ice Age  southeast Asian subcontinent spreading north and west at the time when the  sea levels rose following the melting of the Ice Age glaciers. An  interesting idea, but without real support of actual archaeological  excavation on the part of Dr. Oppenheimer (a pediatrician). The author  picks and chooses data from many sources to suit his theories. A  questionable technique to say the least. The second half of the book  reviews the legends and myths of various cultures concerning creation,  floods, Cain &amp; Able stories an so forth. Mildly interesting, but not  convincing
