My objection to this type of book is does nothing but create divides.  For example he lists one religion as a cult that currently is the fourth leading religion in the United States.  The pace it is setting it will be a world religion within a 100 years.  Not bad for a cult.  Just to set the record straight the dictionary defines a cult as a 1.System of religious worship and ritual.2.Devoted attachment to a person or principle3. a sect.

Under that definition every organized religion is a cult.  That would include Evangelical Christians as they espouse Bible and Being Saved.
