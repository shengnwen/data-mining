This book really isn't so good... The first 150 pages is used to really show how the AUTHOR thinks of things, and HIS filosophies... (sp?) Then the meditation, its shown pretty good on 20 pages, and thats it. Then there are all the history and stuff once more! Sure, it learned me to meditate, but i could have saved countles hours if someone just said "close your eyes, repeat a word in your mind, and you got it" instead of reading all this stuff, which i dont even agree with
