I recieved this book from a friend after losing my daughter to still birth at nearly 7 months. The comparison of my family's loss to a "flight that departed just a bit early" enraged me rather than provide any comfort.  The very fact that the author could make such a shoddy comparison is a clear indicator that a tragedy of this magnitude has never touched his life.  
The book continues with what I am sure were meant to be good intentions( which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one) but slowly unravels to a very thinly disguised guilt inducing essay on " aren't you sorry now you had an abortion".  This book deals very little with the heartbreak of a death of a baby that you had no power to save, it does nothing to assuage the hearts of the parents of miscarriage, stillbirth, or babies lost shortly after birth.  
I do not reccomend this book if any of those events are what you are going thru now.
