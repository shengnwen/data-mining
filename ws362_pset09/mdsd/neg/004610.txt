This book has many wonderful reviews. I ordered the book and was looking forward to reading it. So I read it, then read it again. I didnt find much that is helpful to new writers. Certainly no "Ah,Hah!" moments.

Gardner reminds me of something a professor once told me: "If you were lost in the Amazon jungle would you want an Indian to help you OR someone who knows a lot about Indians?" Gardner knows a lot about writers! This book showcases his knowledge of writers and literature. Very interesting book.

But what exactly it does to help new writers is a mystery. New writers are not Tolstoy or Dickens or Balzac. New writers need to know how to hobble a book together that will fly...later they can soar
