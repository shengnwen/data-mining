"You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing" is what he said. Hiroshima Mon Amour depicts the reality of the bombing of Hiroshima, which took place on August 6, 1945.  The story begins with two bodies against each other with multiple clips of the results of the bombing.  When I watched this movie for the first time, I realized this movie was far from a fairy tale.  Instead, this movie captured reality and could be described as the "fiction" aspect of history William Gass explains in "The Nature of Narrative".  Throughout the entire movie the main character, a woman from France explains the hardships she went through back at home.  It was disturbing for me to watch the movie as it went back in time where she was taunted for have been in love with a German soldier.  I felt it violated a person's right as to whom he/she may date.  It was also unbearable to watch the clips where it shows the end results after the bombing of Hiroshima.  The fact that this movie was made in 1959 the black and white picture made it difficult for me to read the subtitles.  Lastly, the one thing I must question about this movie is the fact that it was told in French.  I couldn't help but get frustrated that the movie started from an awkward stage of the overall story.  It seems as though it skipped the introduction and went straight into the rising of the climax.  I didn't like that they both speak of the war with no clear explanation as to what they're really talking about.  If a person who was completely oblivious about the history of Hiroshima were to watch this movie, he/she that's watching would have a hard time comprehending the overall point of the movie.
