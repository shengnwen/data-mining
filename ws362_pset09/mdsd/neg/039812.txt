Normally I read a book of this type in a day or two. This one took over two weeks because I couldn't get past reading a chapter or two at a time before I had to put it down.

Carolyn Blue may be the most stupid, irritating character to hit the cozy scene in a long time. She's pushy, nosy, condescending and flat out stupid. The whole book consisted of her eating and running around talking to people. The plot and the story never moved forward -- she just happened to show up at the murderer's place one time when he decided to let her in and confess.
