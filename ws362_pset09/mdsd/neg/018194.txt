Everything is fine, everything is OK. The simplest answer is the most likely.  Conspiracies are made up by left-wing wackos with nothing to do.  Did Iran-Contra ("Ask about the cocaine!"), Tuskegee, MK-ULTRA, Latin American germ warfare, Bay of Pigs, Allende overthrow, CIA LSD research of the 50s, '66 NY subway experiment, and the Arbenz coup in Guatemala all happen?  No they didn't.  Oliver North acted alone and was deranged and crazy.  E. Howard Hunt was a deranged loner who tried to kill Castro.  Uncle Sam was a crazy deranged lunatic that give African Americans syphilis in 1932.  He acted alone.  God bless America.  I love our leader.  The more than fifty people that died after the Kennedy assassination all committed suicide.  They were distressed by Oswald's murder of Kennedy and could not go on living.  Shame on you Mr. Oswald.  I love you Mr. Posner.  You're a lot better than that Oswald guy.  Mr. Posner: would you please write a book debunking the claims of The Chuch of the Sub-Genius?  JR Bob Dobbs is a nut and must be stopped.  God bless you and your people
