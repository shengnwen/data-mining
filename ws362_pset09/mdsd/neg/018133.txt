If this was called "the white girl's guide to the fabulous life" it would be called a racist piece of trash. Why does the title of this book say its "the black girl's guide"?  I found it had great tips for everyone, but I am disappointed in the phrasing of this title. It excludes.

I'm objecting to the title here. Not the book. The book had great tips for everyone. But its a shame that the title has to be discriminatory
