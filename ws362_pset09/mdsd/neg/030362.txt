I disliked this book so much that I had to put it down frequently.  First of all, the book is laid out in an illogical manner, with information spread out over chapters called Day 1, Day 2, Week 1, Week 2, Month 1, Month 2, etc.  If you want to read all the information on a particular topic, you won't find it in one place, and that can be frustrating.  Secondly, Becker's attitude is "Once a diabetic, always a diabetic".  She leaves little hope that by dieting and exercising you can return your body to a normal state, even if your diabetes isn't severe (this is in contradiction to what many doctors say).  Becker seems jaded to me and is obviously tired of dealing with her own diabetes, and her negativity is very evident in the book.  She doesn't understand the power of suggestion to help or hinder people; and since she doesn't have any faith in the human body to regenerate itself (once your beta cells are gone, they're gone!!!), she conveys this hopelessness to the reader.

Her sense of humor is laced with irony and reflects her negative attitude, and she uses humor to pander to the fears of her readers.  She seems to think that all her readers are in a state of "shock" from their diagnoses.  Throughout the section about taking blood sugar readings, she kept saying "Ouch" as if in sympathy with the reader (even though modern blood sugar meters are mostly painless).  The pandering can become irritating to a reader with a more mature attitude.

Having said all that, there is nonetheless a great deal of information in the book; but to get it all, you have to ward off her negative bullets with your magic bracelets -- and that may be difficult for people who are new to diabetes.  I DON'T recommend this book
