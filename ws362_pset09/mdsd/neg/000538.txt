This was my first Coutlter novel, so maybe this book isn't indicative of her other books, but this one was very poorly written and a real disappointment. 

Her characters have no authenticity and are poorly developed. For example, the main character at one point is almost hysterical at seeing a skeleton, but soon after is boldly engaged in a gunfight with a madman. These kinds of glaring character problems pop up through the entire book. 

At times the writing is very stilted, with short, simple sentences strung one after the other. It reads like a draft rather than a finished novel. The dialog is also poorly written, and sometimes I found myself having to read it twice to figure out what was being said. 

The romance aspect is very poorly developed. We get no sense of a developing relationship, it seems as though the two characters barely know one another, and yet they get engaged at the end of the book.

Coulter throws in a subplot that is clunky and doens't integrate into the main story at all. Because of this subplot, the book ends up with not one, but two deranged psychos who try to kill the heroine (two psychos for the price of one!), and it seems just silly and unnecessary.

I'm glad I merely checked this stinker out from my local library and didn't spend money on i
