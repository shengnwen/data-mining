Shame on the Unofficial Guide folks.  After the success of the WDW guide I think they decided to make a few extra bucks on the Disneyland folks so they threw out a book just to have one.  I am a huge fan of the WDW Unofficial Guide and I've read it cover to cover and I can't believe how much of the stuff in this book is exactly the same as the WDW guide.  Basically all they did is cut and paste from that guide and market it as a Disneyland guide.

Here is why I was so upset with this guide.  No hotel information and no restaurant information.  One thing I use the WDW guide for is to find out specifics about Disney hotels (do they have laundry, how are the rooms laid out, etc).  They had NOTHING about the Grand Californian.  I found out more from Disney's website.  Also they have no info about restaurants.  They have like one paragraph just mentioning restaurants but nothing like the WDW guide with descriptions and ratings. 

Overall I found the book quite useless and a waste of money.  Shame on them for throwing a bunch of regurgitated and useless info a book and then charging us for it.  If you're going to WDW, buy the Unofficial guide, if you're going to Disneyland skip it.  Ironically I actually found the Birnbaum Official guide more useful for Disneyland
