I've met Ed McGaa, read his book and almost published my language studies under his publishing company.  He's a fairly decent guy but his views are not the majority view of the Native population.  His book is more geared toward the Non-Native.  

Most of my people would never agree with Ed's writings - and many of my relatives would call Ed a "sell-out."  While I would never say this about him because I don't know what compells him to write what he does.  I can tell you, the writings in this book are not a good example of the way 98% of the Native population think and believe.  If you are looking for a "romantic" view on Native beliefs - this is the book for you!  Personally, myself and many of my relations feel you should study your own nationality and not someone else's.  But if you really want a glimpse at the life and beliefs of another culture like our own... read Fool's Crow or watch, "Smoke Signals."  And then get on with your life - don't wrap yourself up in the genes and thought processes of another heritage and lifestyle when there are so many unique and special points of your own life that you could discover.  Look in the mirror and be proud of who YOU are.  Don't try to be someone else to escape the blood that flows through your own veins.  That is the greatest teaching you could ever hear from any of my people - and 98% of us, feel that way.
