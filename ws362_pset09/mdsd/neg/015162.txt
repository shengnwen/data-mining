I did not enjoy this book at all.  The protagonist had to be the weakest woman I have ever read about.  I kept reading about her strength and all I saw was a sorry, weak women.  It does not take strength to do what she did but true selfishness.  The character of Rapheal was not developed properly either.  He came across as first angry, then confused, then accepting, then forgiving, she was all over the place with this character.  As for the reviewer who was sick of being hit over the head with what the white man did, in this book its more what the white woman did to save face.
