I read this book and I was quite dissapointed. I had read My 60 Memorable games and The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal, and felt that those were excellant books! I felt that Nimzowitsch didn't have anything good to day. I read this book last year, when I was under 1600, and thought to myself, maybe its to advanced I will try reading it again in a year from now.  But now at expert strength I still am going wow, its not good at all.  
Fine, Nimzowitsch gave some good ideas about chess, but it seemed all very basic! I think/thought that this books was a total waste of money if you have a USCF rating of over 1300, and a ICC rating of probably over 1500.  If you are under that, this book may benifit you.  
Even though it is said that every one read My System, I disagree.  I think that this book is a very sad excuse for a "classic".  I really believe that it is a nothing compared to "The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal" and "My 60 Memorable Games". 
I guess overall, the book wasnt so hot, but it may be benificial to people who are lower rated, but people who are higher rated I would highly advise NOT TO BUY THIS BOOK! It would be a waste of money :
