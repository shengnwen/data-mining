This will teach me not to read the reviews carefully before purchase.  This is a very abridged version of the classic story: the bright shiny engine and the big strong engine are nowhere to be found.  If you're after  the book you remember from your childhood, find another version.  The  illustrations are bright &amp; fun, but there's just too much missing from  the story
