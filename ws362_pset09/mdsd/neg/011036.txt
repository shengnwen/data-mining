The premise seemed pretty cute. A high school girl calling on the ancient Roman gods for help in her love life. And it is mildly cute...but that's about all.

Goode's writing style is annoying. I can't stand writers who feel the need to constantly remind the audience of their characters' appearence, personality, etc. Usually in sentences like "You're a loser," said the dark-haired beauty. And that's just a mild example of what her sentences are like.
And her characters are even worse. Stereotyped to the Nth degree, with less personality than lime Jell-o. Laura is unsympathetic as a heroine, Cupidity runs around like she's had too many Pixie Styx...only the gods are mildly amusing.

The plot is ridiculous. Apart from being fairly predictable, so much of it is random and scattered. Loose ends aren't tied up, things happen for no good reason, and Laura has one friend (Ashley) who has a habit of appearing out of thing air. There's little explanation or reasoning behind Laura's realization of who she loves, and she's pretty unconvincing about it anyway.

And for someone who most obviously prides herself on being a mythology buff, Goode seems to have forgotten that the gods have been around a lot longer than 3000 years
