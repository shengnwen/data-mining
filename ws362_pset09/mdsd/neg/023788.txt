Robert Massie has spent execptional amounts of time for over 30 years flaying this dead horse about the Romanvos. He has all ways been dead wrong with any of his "findings".

As any /every one knows, history is a fairy tale, slanted by the winning side. Russians are incapable of telling the truth. The British are not known as exceptionally truthful. There are legions of individuals both directly involved and peripherally involved with the "fate" of the Romanovs, but none will band together and state the facts. TOO, too ridiculous, with Massie acting like Moses coming down from the Mount. Hey, Bob, after all, it is ONLY your version of the facts. 

His "research" is sloppy, he relies on dubious sources. He violates all the basic tenets of factual, honest journalism. 

By all means, AVOID any and all books with Massie's name on them. Total waste of time, effort, ink, paper and money. He should have quit with "Nicholas & Alexandra", so long ago
