This is one of the worst books I've read!  It was poorly written, (lot's of type-o's).  I also did not like the authors writting style.  (he jumps around topics too much).  I have read a lot of IT Books this last year and a half(over 50) and this is the first book I came across that I had to write a review about.  I caution you if thinking about buying this book.  The book I am reading now is Data Network Design 2nd Edition (reprint by Mcgraw-Hill copyright 2000 and it says it contains select material from this book)  I don't know maybe McGraw-Hill screwed it up royally because the other reviews I've read are all high marks
