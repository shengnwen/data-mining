At first, I thought this book would be a good idea.  Being a liberal and a labor and delivery nurse, I thought it would be nice to see it from a patient's perspective.  Wrong.  It goes on a BOOK LONG anti-establishment rant.  Some of my favorite topics included the author's opinions on breast feeding vs. bottle feeding and discipline.  Against any form of feeding that is not from the breast?  That's fine.  Don't make the rest of us who don't want to breast feed (or who physically CAN'T, thank you very much) look like beasts from hell. And my favorite, "when your child is throwing a fit in the middle of a grocery store, be glad that they are able to and know how to express their opinions at a young age".  Oh no.  No, no, no.  At that point, I would like to say that there is nothing wrong with giving your child a firm reminder who the parent is and just how they are to BEHAVE in a public place.  It's not "repressing" your child's basic needs of expression, it's responsible/respectful parenting.  Sounds to me like Ms. Gore needs a time out herself
