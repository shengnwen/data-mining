This is a very scattered novel with lots of needless repetitions. What was Percy on when he wrote this thing? There are so many loose ends it would take an additional book just to tie them all together. My response to this book is similar to the incessant grunts of the protagonist Will Barrett--"Huh"?, "What"?, "Who"? "Eh"?  For me a poor ending and an unsatisfying read. Perhaps I should go back and read it again to see what all these five stars are about
