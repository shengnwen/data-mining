Iron Man keeps talking about his 'transistor-powered' armor. Transistors are not a power source! 

The whole thing is silly. Tony Stark makes a living designing missiles for the United States government. Then he goes off as Iron Man and encounters villains who use things like time-travel and sorcery. Wouldn't it occur to him that with these sorts of villains running around, missiles are somewhat obsolete?
