What bothered me about this book is that I found Susan Powter contradictory with her other books.  In her wellness books, she talks how she wouldn't pollute her body with diet drinks, eating meats and such.  Then she writes how she was unhappy with her life because she was/is an alcoholic.  What did she think she was polluting her body with all the beers and such?  I thought when I skimmed thru this Sober book, that if I drank alcohol, I guess my weight loss would of been easier too.  In her question and answer book called Pocket Powter, she stated that if you drink and drive and hit her child, she'd come after you.  Was she taking taxis home or had a designated driver for her and her children?  She claimed in all her books before the Sober one, that she had no secrets as she was open to everything.  When I read this alcohol book, I wondered what other lies she told.  This reminds me of the saying--the lady doth protests too much
