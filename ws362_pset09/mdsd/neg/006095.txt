I found this book completely useless except for a paperweight or doorstop!  What I did find interesting is that Vickie Adkins-Marcum seems to review all of Matthew Lesko's books.  Of course Vickie highly exalts him using such phrases as &quot;KUDOS to Matthew Lesko! He's making this a better place!&quot;  For those of you who are a little slow, let me inform you that Vickie Adkins-Marcum is really Matthew Lesko, or someone Matthew gave this review to and paid Vickie to post it.  It's strange that Vickie's reviews all start out with the same first paragraph and have many of the same phrases throughout.  It is also strange that Vickie only reviews Matthew's books.  Shame on you Matthew Lesko for writing your own review
