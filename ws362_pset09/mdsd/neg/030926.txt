Journalism requires objectivity first and foremost, but this book offers little. It makes no reasonable effort to provide points of view outside those of the perpetrators presented here. 

The book profiles such figures as Pyongyang-born Kim Hyon Hui, who on Nov. 28, 1987 destroyed Korean Air Flight 858, loaded with passengers bound for Seoul; Leila Khaled, a Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacker with "great hatred of the Jews;" and Red Brigade kidnapper Susan Ronconni, whose group murdered former Italian premier Aldo Moro. 

The book parrots their words, and romances their actions as well as the indoctrination of children to hatred and war. MacDonald observes children taught to throw stones at the age of two as adorable resisters, not the examples of parental and societal abuse that they are. She presents unconfirmed reports of Israeli "abuse" without skepticism and pronounces these women "extraordinary," rendering both the reports and the book suspect. 

This 1991 book provides an early view of all that is wrong with the Western press corps. Now, reporters go even further, and use every euphemism in the dictionary for people who purposely target civilians. They are terrorists, not "militants" or "activists." 

Presenting female killers as normal or even worthy blurs the lines between acceptable and unacceptable. I see nothing normal about their sentiments and nothing glamorous about their desire to inflict pain and suffering on innocents, be they Korean, German--or Israeli. 

The author presents the transparent anti-Semitism of those insisting they "do not hate Jews, only Israelis" without comment. Carried to its logical conclusion, this view denies the Jewish people alone among peoples and nations the right to self-determination.

Sorry, but this book flunks journalism 101.
