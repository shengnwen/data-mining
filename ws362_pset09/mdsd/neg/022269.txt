I love Sidney Sheldon's books, but I was quite disappointed with this one.  I can't believe it got such good reviews.  The story was fast-paced, interesting, and well written.  However, the ending was awful and frustrating.  It was too abrupt and too many things happened at once, it didn't resolve well.  It was also too much of a let down.  There are definitely better Sidney Sheldon books than this one
