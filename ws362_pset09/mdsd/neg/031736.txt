I have read most of Ludlum's novels, and I usually can't put them down. I found that I was so distracted by the need to correct his grammar, usage, and spelling that I almost didn't finish the book. The story was not bad,  but too contrived even for Ludlum, and not nearly as polished or compelling  as his later novels. Also, of his dialogue was downright embarrassing in  its naive lack of credible inter-sex conversation. Very disappointing for  Ludlum
