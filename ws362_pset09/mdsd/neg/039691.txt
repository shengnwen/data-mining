Eugene O'Neill may have been the father of American theatre, but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in Long Day's Journey into Night. O'Neill's characters were shallow, pathetic and seemed to have great moodswings.The father-son relationship between James Tyrone and his son, Jamie, is meanspirited, and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems. Tyrone regularly refers to Jamie as a useless failure, and a drunk, not only to his face but to other family members, and in turn Jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son, Edmund. Tyrone says such things as "You'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life!"(p.32) and comments to Edmund that, "If he's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey, he's never shown it."(p.131). The characters of the parents are pathetic, the mother all fluttery and drugged, and the father as the stereotypical old, cheap, and mean failed celebrity. The only seemingly normal relationship is between Edmund and Jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love. The relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural, they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds. It is as if they entire family is bipolar.

Long Day's Journey into Night was based on the life of O'Neill himself, with the character of Edmund as O'Neill. The mother of O'Neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between O'Neill and his older brother, and his father never accepted O'Neill for who he was. These sad beginnings continued throughout the life of O'Neill and was evident in the writing of this piece. If the characters in Long Day's Journey into Night are closely based on his family members then O'Neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine
