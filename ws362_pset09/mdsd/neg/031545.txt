This book provides good general information useful for starting any small business - with an emphasis on the private investigator.  However it  provides no real information or insight into the specific types of work  private investigators do, the day to day aspects of the work itself, or  tips for conducting these activities.   Nor, despite its' identification as  a 'self study guide,' does it  provide any useful references to related  subject matter which would provide this information.   Simple, quick, easy  and enjoyable reading but a poor value for the money
