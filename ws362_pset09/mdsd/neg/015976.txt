i found this book obtuse and very hard to read. if youre not an advanced electrician i would start somewhere else first as this title spends very little time on the basic mechanics of electronics and is mostly full of 'helpful case histories" which i found pretty much useless. the publishers should take the title and rewrite the entire contents instead of adding on to an esoteric book written 20 years ago in the most confusing venacular ive ever attempted to read. thumbs down
