The first part of this book is mesmorizing,  I couldn't put it down.  However, after the first big adventure, the story rapidly deteriorates.  The ending was a HUGE disappointment.  It felt like Wilbur Smith got bored with writing and stopped one or two chapters short of finishing.  It is a shame as this book had great potential
