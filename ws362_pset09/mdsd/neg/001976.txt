The author is obviously as out of her element as Inspector Monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's.  Her characters are hardly believable:  Sutton, the rat exterminator and Dr. Crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones.  Would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function?  Very disappointing
