I would not buy this version of the old classic for very young children.  In this version two of the pigs get eaten by the wolf, and the wolf gets eaten in the end by the last pig. When the pigs ask for the materials to  build their houses, they do not offer to pay, trade or work for the straw,  sticks or bricks, they are given the materials. What kind of message does  that give our youth
