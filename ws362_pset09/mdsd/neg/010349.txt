I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes. My nutritionist basically told me to watch my carbs, but dont limit my fat/salt/etc at this time. I bought this along with a Betty Crocker Diabetic Cookbook Everyday Meals Easy as 1-2-3. I am glad I bought the other one. It has pictures and is much easier to navigate. In my case the New Diabetic cookbook spends too much time on diabetes information and isn't as appealing for meals. Great for someone else, just not me
