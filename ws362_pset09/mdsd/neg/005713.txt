I purchased this book because I want to know how I should work out now that I'm pregnant. It's marginally helpful in that it calls attention to abdominal exercises and indicates when to stop running and when to start up again. Beyond that, it's not very helpful. The exercises are described, but the suggestions for reps or sets are sporadic at best. I saw only a few exercises that gave recommended reps, and none of them talked about sets. There's no way to chart or plan your workout schedule or progress. I realized this book wasn't aimed at women like me when I read that I shouldn't feel bad if I can't do more than 3 or 4 bench presses with a 3-pound weight.
 
 I think this book tries to be too many things: It tries to be a fitness book, and introduction to exercise book, and an overview of pregnancy. It goes into loving detail about how much of your body will be destroyed, and refers to you as a 'breastorant.' I would prefer a book that treated me as a thinking, fit woman who wants to optimize her fitness regimen for carrying, giving birth, and recovering.
 
 If you've never exercised and you want to start during pregnancy, go for it! And maybe this book will be helpful for you, although you'll have to do some additional research to optimize your fitness. If you are already in good shape, or know how to work out, skip this book
