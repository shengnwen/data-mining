When I first looked at the title, I thought,&quot;wow, someone has a great understanding of the movement from the Shoalin to other places of Asia, and eventually America.&quot;  But that was not the case.  I feel that the title is misleading, for it hardly describes that at all.  The author i felt was way to bias to his style of martial arts, not only, the original forms created in the Shoalin temple.  His agruments is basically that all martial artists should learn the traditional Shoalin forms for they hold &quot;special meaning,&quot; or that they were created for a &quot;better purpose.&quot;  In other words, no one must forget them.  This is a kind of contradiction to the buddhist thought which is change is inevitable.  I have a question, if the purpose of forms a state of focus, a state of meditation, and phyical training, than does it matter what form we as martial artis do?  I feel that he is trying too hard to promote his style he trains.  Had some good concepts in the book, but the rest has nothing to do with the title, therefore, i feel you need to retitle it.  My opinion,  Also i found many other things that seemed contratictory to the taoist, buddhist and zen thought, but i will let everyone else figure that out themselves
