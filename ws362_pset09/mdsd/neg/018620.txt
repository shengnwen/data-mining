This book is TERRIBLE.  It is perhaps the slowest-paced book I have ever read.  We know from the back cover that Noble is going to die & Celeste is going to be made his surrogate.  This has the potential for great stories, intriguing psychological drama, and other things one might look for in a book like this.  But not when it takes half the author hundreds of pages just to get to what should be the starting point.  The reader is forced to sit through page after page of the family eating dinner, or playing in the yard, or other pointless minutiae that serve to develop neither the plot nor the characters.  Not to mention that it's written in a simplistic style that might be considered artistic when the narrator is 7, but is merely degrading by the time she reaches adulthood.
Do yourself a favor and watch paint dry.  It would go faster and be more worthwhile than this book
