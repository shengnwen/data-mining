Before this misguided book was published, DDT was successfully reducing malaria deaths across the globe.  After it, and the subsequent ban on DDT, millions of people have suffered and died needlessly.  For example, in Sri Lanka in 1948, there were 2.8 million malaria cases and 7,300 malaria deaths. With widespread DDT use, malaria cases fell to 17 and no deaths in 1963. After DDT use was discontinued, Sri Lankan malaria cases rose to 2.5 million in the years 1968 and 1969, and the disease remains a killer in Sri Lanka today.

Carson' science is dodgy, her conclusions false and her prescriptions plain wrong.  Do not buy this boo
