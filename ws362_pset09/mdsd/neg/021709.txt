This is a very strange book.  Even for a book for third graders, it's boring and sketchy, without charm or fun and creating no sense of wonder at the fictional world created.  The main character is a seemingly depressed boy.  Things just happen to him and he's at a loss to understand the chaos around him.  The reader shares his confusion.  The experiences at Wizard's Hall are bizarre, nonsensical and unpleasant, without being amusing in any way. In short, the tone of the book more closely resembles a child's nightmare than a child's fantasy novel.  Some teachers like to recommend this book to children because it is a book about a school for wizards, like Harry Potter.  But this just isn't a good book, and there are much better choices to excite children and get them thinking about comparing and contrasting books. Of a long and illustrious list of children's authors of wonderful fantasy books for 9 to 12 year old children, many dealing with magic and magical worlds, some of the finest are Zilpha Keatley Snyder, Richard Peck and Lynne Reid Banks.  All of the great Ms. Synder's books are worthy of recommendation, with some of the best being The Velvet Room, Black and Blue Magic, The Truth about Stone Hollow, and the highly entertaining The Headless Cupid (and the sequels).  Ms. Snyder won the Newbery Medal for The Eygpt Game, but that isn't her most entertaining novel.  Richard Peck's Blossom Culp books are full of fun and fantasy, and Lynne Reids Banks' Indian in the Cupboard series are modern fantasy classics.  Ms. Yolen is a prolific writer and some of her picture books are fine, but the Snyder, Peck and Banks books are far superior and much more enjoyable
