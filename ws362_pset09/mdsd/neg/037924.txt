The book is surprisingly dull, devoid of color, and largely barren of graphics, tables, concrete examples, glossary of terms, etc. There is page after page after page ad nauseum of black and white ...mostly it is words, words, words. Its approach is completely unimaginative. It is like being served white rice on a white plate on a white table in a white room with a bare light bulb hanging overhead. 

Although in its 5th edition, and published in 2005, it is colorless in every way, especially in comparison to what else is available. With so many attractive texts out there that would pull a student in and keep his/her attention, this one will undoubtedly create a cacophony of snores. It is even boring to me as teacher. I cannot imagine being able to stay focused and move forward when every page seems like the one before and every chapter like the next one. how on earth will it motivate the student? The worst part of this book, in my opinion as teacher and WRITER, is that the authors seem to want to tell the readers what to think rather than setting up situations where they can use literature to think originally. 

I have not seen such a boring book in a long time. I'd rather be faced with colums of numbers that go on forever than to try to teach using this snoozer. I wish there was a rating of 0 stars. I picked 1 because that was as low as the site allows
