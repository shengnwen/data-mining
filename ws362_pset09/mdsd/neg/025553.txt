I had high hopes for this book. I was sorely disappointed. The author kept going on and on with his theories about why the Roman Empire collapsed. Every time I thought he was about to get around to some IRISH history, he went back to Rome, or some other culture. I can understand setting the stage, but this was ridiculous. Halfway through, I gave up, skimmed the rest of the book, and decided it wasn't worth the time
