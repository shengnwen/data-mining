I don't understand all the hype.  I really don't understand why this book is so revered.  It really can't be called an accurate history, since it's based on one person's opinion.  This book was published in 1979.  Take into account that does not mean that was when Ms. Adler did her so-called "research", that's just when the book was actually printed.  Even so, just using the publication date shows this book is extremely outdated.  Groups and publications mentioned have either disbanded or gone out of business.  There's a lot of information in the book, sure, but there just isn't enough in there that is relevant to today in order to justify reading it.  I saw a review here that states Ms. Adler is going to come out with an updated version...that rumor has been going around for *years*.  I'll believe it when I see it.  Borrow a copy from a friend or check it out from the library, if you are that interested.  The book doesn't seem that big, but it is very, very dry and was hard to get through.  I honestly can't even recommend this as even a reference book to keep on hand.
