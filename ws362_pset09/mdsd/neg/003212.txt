As a teacher, I was so angry and insulted reading the beginning of the book that I almost put it in the garbage.  Recycle or book donation might mean someone else would be subjected to it, so garbage or burning seemed the only option.   I was on jury duty and had nothing else to read, so I read it.  It was an interesting and quick read and I did find some inspiration in it, but I found the insult to so many of the teaching profession and public education appalling.  There are some bad teachers and bad things about public education, but Rafe would have you believe that he is one of the only good ones out there.  It's too bad that I almost threw the book away to miss out on the inspiration that was buried within
