This book is terrible!  There are so many mistakes in this book, I don't even know where to start.  The family tree is so complex, that not even the author seems to have been able to keep it straight.  In addition the plot takes so many twists and turns and so many of them dead end that it is hard work keeping the story straight.  And the ending is predictable.  A character (&quot;Ashely&quot;) identified as Odile's grandson on the family tree is called a great-grandson in the text.  The novel describes events that take place in 1999, yet Odile's birthdate is given as 1918, when the characters are supposed to be coming together to celebrate her eighteth birthday.  And when a character talks about an event in the 60's, she describes it as almost thirty years ago?  Last time I checked, that should be almost forty!!! In addition Henry's son is named Harry Jr.  Aren't Henry and Harry different names?  How did he (Harry) get to be a Jr. I couldn't put this book down - mainly because I wanted to see what would be wrong next. These errors bothered me so much, I got up to write a review at midnight - and I've never written a review before
