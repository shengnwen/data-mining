Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.

I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I :
