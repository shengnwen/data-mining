I rather enjoyed Kenry's first book, Can't Buy Me Love, so I looked forward with anticipation to this one. I was sadly disappointed. The machinations of the characters are grotesque, and while the lifestyle depicted is so overdone as to be obviously fictional, I am nevertheless offended by the glorification of robbery, falsehood and self-indulgence that Max attempts to teach Dillon. I realize that this is not intended to be a serious work, nor is it intended to teach a way of life - but it is nevertheless extreme to the point of distaste. Max's attempts to manipulate everyone around him are almost nauseating, up to and including seducing his nephew. Max is self-centered to the point of blindness, and I found myself hard-pressed to maintain an interest in his schemes. Dillon fails to see anything aberrant in the behavior he is being taught. He ultimately recognizes Max's selfishness - but indulges him anyway. At the end, I found the whole mess singularly unpleasant and thoroughly unamusing
