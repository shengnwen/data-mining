I had to force myself to finish this book. After reading two-thirds I felt compelled to finish it simply in hopes of finding some redeeming value to the time I'd already invested.  Upon finishing the book (unlike the insightful and eloquent analysis by the Reader in New England) I shut the book and said, &quot;This is the stupidest book I have ever read!&quot;  After calming down a little I began to wonder if perhaps Wise Blood represented Flannery's life and emotions?  One has to imagine being stricken with a debilitating disease that eventually robbed her of life at a young age must have tortured her to some degree.  She must have wondered where is God in all this without being able to deny Him.  Could Hazel represent Flannery? A life of seeming despair, allowed to waist away slowly in a drainage ditch only to be finally found yet treated with complete disregard and with utter contempt by the police sent to rescue and redeem Haze (Flannery) by thumping him (her) on the head with a death blow without any apparent feelings.  Was Flannery making a statement about being treated thus by God?  Is it possible Flannery used Wise Blood as a cathartic for her own emotions towards God for the cards she'd been dealt?  I don't say that judgmentally in the least.  It just makes sense now that I am calm enough to think about it. I'm hardly qualified to dish out such psycho-babble.  Basically, I still agree with the New England reader in terms of regretting the read.  Perhaps this story will have more meaning should I face personal suffering and loss like Flannery.  Faith does not make one immune to the multi-levels of agony.  This story was agonizing
