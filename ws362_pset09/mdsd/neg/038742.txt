For an "encyclopedia" this book is severly lacking in detail and coverage on the subject. This is a thin book that gives very short descriptions of a limited number of treatments. Many very common and popular spa treatments are not even included, while other obscure and non-existent in most spas found their way into the book. If you're looking for information on what is done during many of the common spa treatments used today and what their benefits are I do not suggest this book. I was very disappointed
