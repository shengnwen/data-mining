The book begins with Huffington complaining that her cable bill has just gone up while the CEO of her cable company just got a fat raise. Poor Huffington, the victim of ruthless greedy CEO's. Here's  an idea Arianna, dump cable and sign up with dish network or Voom or DirectTV, or just cancel service altogether, its just cable TV not oxygen. She really doesn't discuss the fact that there are such alternatives. Why are there so many alternatives to those meanies at the cable company? Because of deregulation which she bemoans as the source of all the worlds troubles in the first place. This sort of nutty reasoning is used throughout the entire book. If youre an angry lefty by all means buy this book. If you want to learn somthing, don't waste your money
