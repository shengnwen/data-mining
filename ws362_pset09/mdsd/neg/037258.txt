The most unfortunate aspect of this book, like many classical reprints, is the commentary by the editor. His so called &quot;incisive and witty commentary&quot; adds nothing to the value of the text, and is more a  distraction than anything else. Some of his comments border on ridiculous.  I would have liked to have seen more explanation of the meaning behind each  of Washington's precepts, rather than Brookhiser's unsuccessful attempt at  humor. Still, in today's world more than ever before, we need guidance on  how to behave in public. The handy pocket size format of the book allows it  to be carried on the person and used as a constant reminder of how to act  towards others. Washington put these rules to action throughout his life,  and they apparently served him well. If it were not for the commentary, I  would give it five stars
