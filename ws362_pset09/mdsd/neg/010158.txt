This book has a great title, but somewhat lackluster content. The book is really not so much about changing the world, and more about one organization in particular. In addition to focusing on an organization, I find that the stories of the people *in* the organization take up as much of the book as actual stories about people they've found who have made or are making a difference in the world.  It's not necessarily bad-there are plenty of inspiring people and stories to motivate you. It just takes the book a long time to get to them and seems to deviate often
