I was a little disappointed by this book, for there are less maps and photos than I expected. It is unlikely for "Eyewitness Travel Guides." I usually believe maps will be greatly appreciated especially for small towns which don't have the tourist information center. However, I appreciate the concept that this publisher makes this regional guidebook, so I give one start for it. Another star is for the reasonable price at Amazon.com: $13.60 (regular $20) as of 11/3/2006
