OK, this is NOT a recommended title, but I couldn't resistsaying a few words about it here because of its high entertainmentvalue. For 15 years now I have consulted for US companies entering the Japanese market. So naturally I paid close attention to the chapters on Japan.  They were very entertaining.  They read like the script from a Mr Bad Guy in a 007 movie...  Check out the prose, too: &quot;A Japanese samurai worker produces in one day what it takes an American worker two days to produce.  To the western world the Japanese stress the importance of free trade because they know that the western worker is no match for the Japanese samurai worker&quot; (p. 125). .. The final section contains precious specific advice such as &quot;respect local culture&quot; and &quot;develop long term objectives&quot;.  One of the deepest pieces of timeless advise is that &quot;if you drop your chopstick in Asia it means good luck&quot;.  I guarantee you won't know a thing about doing business in Japan after reading this book, but you may be amused reading it. ... it seems that a ticket to Austin Powers may represent better value.
