I usually try not to be too mean to a new author (as I am one, myself).

The plot was predictable, boring and simplistic.  That was not the worst part.

Now to the characters

Kattan duRhys: My God, he was weak-willed, utterly devoid of passion, he was whining on every page and annoying to no end.  I did not find him endearing at all, and skipped every line he spoke.  WHo is Kattan? "Weakling in Tights"

Melisande-- .....another simple-minded..... She's even WORSE than Kattan.  I can't imagine someone more obnoxious and totally empty of compassion and intellect than this character.  

Wolfram-the only character worth rooting for, other than the dogs.  He was well-rounded, sharp, and actually knew what the heck was going on.  

The pros: the songs were nice, I wish there were MORE.  After all, it was supposed to be about a BARD Hero.  Where were the songs? What happened to them whenever that annoying simpleton, Kattan opened his mouth?

I can't imagine a book where I've enjoyed less than watching six-second commericials about after shave.
