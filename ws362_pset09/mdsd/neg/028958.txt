what mr. sen fails to realize is that the common man doesn't pigeonhole muslims or anyone else because of little boxes the common man is told to place them in (from whatever author assigned and designed the little boxes). the common man pigeonholes foreigners he has no interaction with, mainly not because of some authors the common man never reads or cares about, but because of the actions of some of those who are pigeonholed. everyone knows that khwarizmi originated algebra, and that some muslim leaders in the past sheltered jews when no one else would. sadly though the relative tolerance of those muslims cannot be said to exist in mainstream to hardline muslims of today. when videos of daniel pearl's horrific and senseless murder are passed around amongst friends in saudi arabia as an honored example of the valiant muslim struggle against the mythical zionist-american world conspiracy we start to see the true depth of the problem. the problem is not america, or the west, or how these institutions see muslims or muslim countries...the problem is the hardline fundamentalists for all intents and purposes are the mouthpieces and boots of today's islam, and that is what america and the west doesn't care for. common man joe in the usa has no problem with his bangladeshi muslim immigrant neighbor, he has a problem with foreign muslims executing americans and jews. the true intolerants are not the west or america, but the hatemongers that unfortunately are too often heard and too often idolized in the muslim world. when islam moves forward light-years in reality of being comparable to the multicultural and diversity champions of the world (the west), when the average muslim would sooner turn in hatemongers and murderers rather than shelter them...only then could anyone make any valid complaints against the extremely tolerant and open minded countries of the west, if any imagined bias could be found at that point
