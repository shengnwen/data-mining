I expected this book to be a good technical reference (much like just about every other Sam's Teach Yourself book).  The book fails to deliver technical information and is primarily focused on how to perform tasks when USING Sharepoint that just about anyone who can read and click would be able to figure out without the help.  This book is overly simplistic and is targeted to the END USER who is not even familiar with using Internet Explorer (several pages spent on what the different features of IE are)
