You can totally disregard my review because I admit that I did not read all of this novel I found it so disgustingly detailed that I had to put it down. This novel is NOT what I thought it to be like an "Ella Enchanted" or McKinley's novels it is strongly for adults not children. I am not a child but, I do not like books to cuss frequently or to tell too many details. The begining of the book astounded me and I hope that this will never fall into the hands of a child because of its content. I guess if you like overly gory and sexually explicit fantasy novels this is the one for you but, I'm a romantic and would rather have a kinda "happily ever after" than a "everyone gets killed or is emotionally/mentally not ever happy after" if you get what I mean
