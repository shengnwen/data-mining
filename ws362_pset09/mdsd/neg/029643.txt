I got this book for my foster teens but tossed it in the recycling bin instead. The book is full of chatter; the authors never get to the point.  Plus all the illustrations, boxes and fonts, which I guess are supposed to be hip, give you a headache. I did plog through this quagmire long enough to confirm the authors weren't saying anything that would inspire a kid, so it's just as well they slathered it with window dressing. The book dies have a catchy cover, which I assume is designed to attract parents, not kids.  Heck, I bought it.
