The only redeeming point of this book is that I received it as a birthday present, so I didn't waste my own money on it.  I can't explain why I read the entire thing, and its slightly better predecessor The Rising, but I did, and I regret it. 

What the novel(s) lack in intelligence, character development, and originality the author attempts to make up by describing the most gruesome methods of death he can think of.  We therefore have numerous penises being shot or bitten off.  After all, there is no worse horror that any boy can imagine than having his manhood chewed off.   

I've heard that some (presumably someone who runs a website) have described Keene as the next Stephen King.  I think not.  King, though he may be "the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and Fries", as he describes himself, CAN write.  He knows how to craft a story and develop characters.  Mr. Keene has a lot of work to do, and I wish him well.  

I love zombies and post-apocalyptic fiction and film, and I thought this couldn't miss in light of its subject matter and good ratings on Amazon.  Holy Zombie Jesus was I wrong
