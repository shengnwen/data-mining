    With an articulated agenda to "demythologize" the text of the gospels, Bultmann, with a decidedly skeptical method, proceeds to cut out whatever he believes to be unoriginal in the New Testament.  His method of determining which texts are worthy of removal, although presented very academically, proves to be extremely arbitrary and decidedly uninformed. Although hailed by a few as a revolutionary new way to interpret the Christian Scriptures, later scholarship has proven Bultmann's method to be tremendously biased and agenda-driven. Today he is worthy reading in order to get a good laugh, and nearly nothing fruitful can be gleaned from his observations.  Don't waste your time.  Don't buy this book.
