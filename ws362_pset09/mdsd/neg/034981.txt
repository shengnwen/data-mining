I read this book many years ago, and thought it was terrible.  Looking through the reviews just now, I couldn't believe how overwhelmingly positive they were, and just had to put in a word for those of us (and I assume/hope there are others) who didn't like the book.

The book is ludicrously long, and meanders through way too many red herrings, dead ends, and nonsequitirs.  There are any number of sub-plots that appear out of nowhwere, go nowhere, never pay off, and leave you wondering why you had to take the time to read through them at all.

The sub-plots, though, are nothing like as much of a problem as the main plot itself.  It's a very uninspiring story about a business deal.  Will person A get the contract, or will person B?  A business deal?  Who cares?

SPOILER ALERT:

And then, after sitting through thousands of pages boringly building up to the big deal, at the end one of the characters randomly dies, and the whole thing just peters out.  No climax, no drama, nothing.

I also respectfully disagree with the reviewers who praised the characters.  I found that Clavell has a bad habit of making his characters too perfect, carried out too far in this book.  All of the major characters are the greatest golfer and an olympic diver and the greatest gourmet and a brilliant business person and so on and so on.  These are not real people, they're supermen who I couldn't relate to at all.

It's boring, it's long, it's badly written.  I was particularly disappointed because I loved Shogun and liked Tai-pan and King Rat.  But after this one, I've never read another Clavell book, and I don't think I will
