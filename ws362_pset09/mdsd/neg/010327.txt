I am rather confused that there are people who enjoyed this book.  The reviews criticizing the plot are a bit off I think - sure, it is wildly implausible and not always coherently organized, but it does have elements of originality.  The huge, massive problem that is so difficult to overlook is that the writing is dreadful.  By the sixth or seventh page, I was already appalled that this was a national book club selection.  Lots of cliches.  Lots of rambling, useless passages.  Frequently obvious and shallow in descriptions.  Attempts to introduce novel turns of phrase are usually gaudy and awkward.  Note that the book is from a minor press.  Note that the book is already heavily discounted by Amazon.  These are important signals that I shouldn't have looked over.  The book might have been salvagable, had the author tried to rewrite and if the editor had exerted any sort of influence over the dismal writing.  As currently written, it reads like a draft of a novel from someone's weekend writing group.
