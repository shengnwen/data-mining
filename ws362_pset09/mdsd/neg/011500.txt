Derek Hutchinson has led kayaking expeditions around the world and teaches  highly regarded seminars on the sport.  However, he seems unable to clearly  translate this teaching ability to print.  This book reads like a laundry  list of things to do in a kayak: equipment choices, paddle strokes, rescue  techniques, rolling, surfing maneuvers, etc.; without rhyme or reason as to  their purpose or when they should be executed.  The book does cover a  complete range of topics relevant to the sea kayaker: all topics just  mentioned plus weather, tides, navigation, wind, etc. Unfortunately, many  sections are out-of-date, such as the equipment section; a lot of  information, such as that on nautical charts and on weather, is specific to  kayaking in Britain; and some information, such as that on tidal currents,  is just plain wrong.  I did learn quite a lot from the sections on turning  strokes and eskimo rolling, but not as much as I feel I should have and not  enough to know where or when to use a particular technique.  Overall, I was  disappointed with the quality of instruction presented in this book
