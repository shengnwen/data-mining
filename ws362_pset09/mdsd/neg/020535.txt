A friend of mine gave me Bad Love to read when I spent the night at his house and was looking for a book.  I started it, and took it home with me.  After almost finishing it, I called him and said I really didn't like it, at which point he started laughing and told me both he and his wife thought it was horrible, and they gave it to me as a gag!  They couldn't beleive I got as far as I did.

I like fiction, and even meaningless pop-fiction like Patterson, Stephen King, Grisham, etc., so I'm not some elitist.  With that as a background,  Bad Love is without a doubt the worst work I have ever read.  I am shocked that people have given this garbage 5 stars.  Its poorly written, has a bad plot, and....you know what....its not even worth going on.  I am only writing to warn others.  Avoid at all costs.  You would be better off shaving your head with a cheese grater than putting yourself through Bad Love.
