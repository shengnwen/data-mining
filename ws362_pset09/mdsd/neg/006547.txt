Did that person actually read this book? 

Green Melusine and I must be kindred spirits - I came here intending to make EXACTLY the same points! First of all, reading the back cover was what made up my mind to buy this book. It sounded like a fun and funny read about a young woman who tries to change her life and personality after she catches her boyfriend cheating on her. Instead, she spends the rest of the book whining and starting even more dysfunctional relationships, one after the other. Trina does not change or develop AT ALL, and that was disappointing. 

Most disturbing, however, was the overall message. I don't know what points the author wanted to get across, but it seemed to me that she spent most of the book complaining that the outlook is grim for single women in their thirties - the only available guys are into disturbing sex games, or they have STDs. The moral of the story was that it's better to return to the guy who cheats on you (hey! He SAID he wouldn't do it again!) than to develop a shred of self esteem and show him the door, since the pickings are so slim. WHAT?

Despite the annoying protagonist and infuriating ending, I'm giving White Bikini Panties two stars, since it's fairly well written and there are some interesting moments (while I was sick of Trina by the book's end, I found myself absorbed by the subplot involving her older sister Jessie, and Jessie's struggle with infertility. Although it is also implied that Jessie can do no better than to settle for a cheating husband... hmmm...) If you really NEED another light chick lit read, this one will pass the time. However, if you're like me and your shelves are overflowing with this kind of book, don't bother adding this to the collection.
