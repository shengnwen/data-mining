I bought this book along with Link's most recent book "Magic For Beginners" due mainly to the high praise that is heaped on these two collections. Sadly (at least with "Stranger Things Happen") I'm left feeling dissapointed. The writing is very good but the stories just dont "do it" for me. I have yet to read "Magic" and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will be as good as the majority of critics seem to think. Before you buy this book (Sranger Things) try and loan a copy first or I do believe there maybe a free downloadable copy from Link's official web site? 

Instead of buying this I would suggest you try Jeff vandermeer's "city of saints and madmen", far more satisfying,a worthy 5 star book.
