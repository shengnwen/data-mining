I expected this book to be a satire comparing the ridiculous actions of some wealthy people to similar behaviors found in the animal kingdom. When the book sticks to its satirical purpose it somewhat succeeds, though I didn't find Conniff as funny as all the blurbs describing his "wittiness' would suggest.

But where I had a problem with this book is its one-sided perspective on human behavior, which Conniff attempts to explain through the very narrow lens of "biology as destiny." Now don't get me wrong, I definitely believe in Darwin's theory of evolution and the other basic ideas of science that have been proven through the "scientific method" of serious research and collected evidence. But, as most people would agree, BOTH nature and nuture play a part in human development. In other words both culture and biology are important factors in why humans behave as we do. This, to me, is common sense. But Conniff comes across as overly ideological in his biologically deterministic perspective. This is especially the case when he takes his jabs at feminists and others with a more "culturally based" point of view. I think there is much to be learned about humanity from studying the sciences. But I also believe in drawing from other ideas and academic disciplines in order to form a balanced basis of knowledge. Conniff fails to do that and for that reason I find his book does not ring true.
