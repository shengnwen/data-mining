Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.

This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.

I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.

Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad
