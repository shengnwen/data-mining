For obvious reasons this book should be easy to read. Unfortunately it isn't, especially not if you're not English (and due to the theme of the book, at least one of two readers could be expected to be non English). The book is full of incredibly long sentences and woolly language and the constant use of terms like 'minority language' and 'majority language' is very confusing. 
So far for the style. Now the content. Contrary to the subtitle it's not practical at all. One parent should speak one language, the other should speak the other, both should be consistent - that's the message that is repeated over and over again, and it's about the only practical advice you'll find here. The rest is a heap of possible situations without really valuable tips. Most of the comments from bilingual parents you'll read in this book seem out of context and are therefore not useful.
Why a 2 stars rating and not 1? The book was written with honest intentions and I think the authors did their best. But, Mr. Publisher, where was your editor?
