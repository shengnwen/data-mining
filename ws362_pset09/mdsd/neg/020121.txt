This is a warning.  This is an atrocious translation and should be avoided. Hopkins, who translated this work in 1906 is either sloppy or just a poor translator.  The English is awkward, and what is most reprehensible, Hopkins just plain omits two of the most important factual items of the entire play--1) Gone is Pepel's admission that he spend time in prison because he murdered a man, and 2) and this is the most grievous of all, the fact that Actor hanged himself at the play's cnclusion (almost the last words of the play which produces an immense impoact) is also omitted.   There is no good reason other than monetary since all copywrite is probably gone for this edition, to republish it.   I learned this the hard way, using it in a class amd now have subjected my students to this particular translation.  It is a wonderful play, but this edition should be taken off the market
