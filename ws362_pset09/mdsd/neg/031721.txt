I purchased the book because I thought that anything Fine Gardening put out would be superb.  I thought wrong-as a landscaper I'm looking for new and different ideas, Fine Gardenings trademark. If the content wasn't great I thought I could always use the photo's to show clients for ideas- wrong again.  The photos are dark and dreary.  Again I should have paid more attention to the copy right date
