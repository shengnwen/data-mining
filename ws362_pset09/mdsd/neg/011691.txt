Okay, Alex, I'm not reviewing the book.  I just have to respond to you calling people morons.  Yes the computer may make the "recommendations", but if you think Amazon was not aware of this recommendation and its potential to make them a lot of money - you're extremely naive.  I'm not going to be rude and call you a moron.  My mother raised me better than that.  Shame on you and shame on Amazon
