I can't believe this book was a finalist for the National Book Award! Although it was well written in the sense of grammar and vocabulary, it was not an effective vehicle to introduce readers to the subject. I live in Appalachia, and I feel this book in some way demeans the practices of these persons religion. It starts out with a reporter covering a murder trial where a "snake handler" forces his wife to be bitten in the hopes that she will die so he can have another woman. I would have loved the court dialog and more of a background of the alleged "crime."  I definitely would have found more background information on the snake handlers interesting, and also more information about the strychnine; where they get it, how they know ratio to mix with water, etc. Strychnine from churches around my home has been found to be "non-lethal" doses. 

As it is, with it's wide margins and double/triple spacing I think it would have been better printed as a long article in the New York Times, for which Mr. Covington writes about the South
