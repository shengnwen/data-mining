As a beginner, I found the first ten pages of this book interesting and helpful, but after that it gets complex fast. The enclosed CD is pointless, except for the tuning, and even then you have to wait a few minutes while the artists in the studio get some foolishness out of the way. There are 7 or 8 songs that follow, but no connection with the book or guidance on how to play. I'll get back to it in about a year, but this is no value for absolute beginners
