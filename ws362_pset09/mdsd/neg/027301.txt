This book reduces Nietzsche to rhetorical devices and tropes.  Many out of control discussions are on hand, eventuating in nothing worth remembering.  The idea of this book seems to be to reinforce the idea that morality is boring, that no one should find thinking about morality interesting, and that if you just call boring prose dangerous, then it is.  The argument in this book goes all the way back to Paul Valery, Derrida's inspiration, who misunderstood Saussure.  Valery argues that philosophy has all the marks of literature, and so is indistinguishable from it, and so just is more literature -- no different from comic books, grafitti and wedding vows.  But Quine found no marks of science that were not to be found in philosophy, yet philosophy does not reduce to science.  The argument is no better from the side of art.  Philosophy does not reduce to art.  Valery was wrong, and so is the Magnus group
