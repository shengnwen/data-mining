I was looking to read something that would really stimulate my thinking and allow me to think about this topic in a new way, with the hope that I could come to some answers for myself.  What I got was a very cursory overview of many potentially relevant aspects of this topic with nothing I could really "sink my teeth into."  To give you an idea about how basic the material is, I was able to read the whole thing in one sitting in bed one night before going to sleep.  Overall not very useful and I would not buy this book again
