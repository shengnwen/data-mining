The only good thing is that the review system does not let me rate this zero stars.  From the obscure language to the fight the system attitude, this book does nothing except expound upon Profesor McLaren's political views.  This publication points at one facet of the discussion of critical pedagogy and fails to evaluate the other aspects.  As a political work, this book appears well researched, but look elsewhere for a book on critical pedagogy
