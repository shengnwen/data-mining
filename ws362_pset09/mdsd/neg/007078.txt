I've seen plenty of American and British reviews of Turtledove, but I'd like to express my view as a Canadian (as well as a student of history).  Turtledove always presents me with a fascinating concept and then proceeds to dissappoint me in how he deals with it....  The author tends to overlook historical logic for the sake of developing the plot as he wishes (and despite this, developments happen so bloody slowly!).  Just two Cases in point: 1)a naval attack on the British held Pearl Harbour would likely look more like a Gallipoli than a WWII-style Pearl Harbour- shore batteries are not so easy to take out.  2) Having the North devlop tanks at the same time as the Brits did historically seems like such a cop-out, to avoid having to America's enemies any real advantages.  Germany didn't develop a tank before the Brits, and when they did start making WWI tanks, they were shabby copies of the Allied versions- why would the North be any different?  However, I will say Kudos to Turtledove for allowing Canada to put up a good fight-they were some of WWI's best soldiers, and wouldn't have gone down easy.   Ultimately, I do agree with Turtledove with what the ultimate outcome of this conflict would be, but I disagree with how he reaches it- it just seems too staged for the purposes of his sequels.  This combined with the plodding writing style and the bad sex scenes ("He saluted her, but but not with his hands"?  I could do without that) makes me say that this book contains a lot of squandered potential for the alternative history buff
