If you are looking for a bio about what it's like to be an astronaut, look elsewhere, like Mike Collin's Carrying the Fire.  This book is only for the Pete Conrad fan who wants more about the man than you can find in excellent books such as From the Earth to the Moon by Andrew Chaikin or, of course, the Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe.  Most of the book is about what he did before and after being an astronaut.  There is very, very little new info about the NASA years.  Did you know his callsign was Squarewave?  Did you know he had abnormally long eybrows?   Dyslexic too.  These are the little tidbits you learn from this book.  
I was most excited to find out more about Pete's time with Skylab, a forgotten chapter in space history, and the Delta Clipper, a prototype he worked on in the early Ninties, but these also were a disappointment.  Skipping over events at light speed, the book fails to mention important facts and events.  The Delta Clipper section totally fails to mention the vehicle was a Testbed and could never have gone into orbit itself.  The authors totally skip the fire that occured later.  What caused it?  How much of the vehicle survived?  What effect did this incident have on the cancellation of the program?  If I did not remember it happened I would read this book thinking nothing ever went wrong with the program.    
This book bears the hallmark of being a work written by an adoring widow and reverent fan of a writer, which is what it is.
