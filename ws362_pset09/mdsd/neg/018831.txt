"Footsteps" is not the first novel you want to read by PA Toer.  It should be the third.  PAT is a great writer, no doubt; it's a shame he was never awarded the Nobel Prize that he deserved.  As for "F", it does not have the edge that the first two novels in his famed Buru Quartet - "This Earth of Mankind" and "Child of all Nations" - have.  It's not a stretch to say that reading "F" is like watching the third Godfather movie:  it just doesn't have it; but you watch anyway.  And so I read it.  It reads more like a slow-paced political history of Indonesia, and the best parts are when characters from "TEOM" and "COAN" make an appearance.  I will definitely read the fourth book in the series.  PAT is writer that you can't help but admire, but "F" just didn't resonate the way his other novels did (for me)
