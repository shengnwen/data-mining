I saw this book at Petco and it looked really cute and I thought it would be fun to make some treats for my cats. Boy, was I wrong. I didn't buy the book (thankfully), but I tried out the one recipe that you can see when you "Look Inside", the "Tempting Tuna Treats". I had all the ingredients for it, so I figured it was a good place to start. 

I started the recipe, but then I looked and realized that it said to use a 3 oz. can of tuna. I had a 6 oz, which is normal tuna can size. I never remembered seeing any smaller cans of tuna when I went shopping, so I just used my normal-sized can and figured I could double the recipe if I needed too. After mixing everything together, it seemed goopy, not sticky as the book said it should have been, so I doubled everything except the tuna. It still wasn't really the right consistency. It was still too liquidy to be sticky, so I added a bunch of flour. I still don't think it ever reached the right consistency, but by this time, I was feeling a bit nauseous. 

Apparently things that cats like to eat don't smell too good. I think it was the mixture of the tuna and the powdered milk, but it was pretty awful. I seriously wanted to vomit. I was determined to make these things, so I sort of took gobs of it, put it on a lined cookie sheet, and stuck it in the oven for 5-10 minutes. During the baking, I decided to cut my losses and pour the rest of the batter down the sink. I took the "treats" out of the oven and put them on a plate. Later, I realized they were still soft inside and not cooked all the way through, so I never did give them to my cats. Even if they loved it, it still was not worth the nausea. I'll definitely buy my cats treats next time
