I read the first chapter and I was puzzled. Then I went back, read it again, and laughed. My tenth grade creative writing class can make a better effort at a plot, dialogue, and characterization than that, and be witty to boot. As for the quality of the writing, just the dialogue in the Quick Stop scene was enough to make my head spin around and explode. After reading this, I wasn't sure whether the author was high, or if he just hadn't seen a lot of Buffy and decided to make up the show and the characters' personalities (into something so juvenile and whacked out, it was almost incomprehensible). Did they let a 13-year-old fanboy write this? No, that can't be, because there is fanfiction out there that is many, many levels above this. ... Don't waste your money on this atrocious mess
