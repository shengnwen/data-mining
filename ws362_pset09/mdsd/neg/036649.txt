The worst S.E Hinton book ever. I felt more compassion for Freddy vs. Jason then i did for the characters in this book. Motorcycle boy was a spokesmen for medication. His bipolar gave a new divination of metal illness. And worse was the losers who crowned him king of the streets. The film version was even worse. I thought the photography was down by spike the rugrats dog.
