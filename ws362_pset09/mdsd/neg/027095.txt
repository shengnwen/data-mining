I'm a computer science student and last semester I had a GUI course where this HCI book was in the curriculum. It has to -without a doubt- be the worst book I have ever read. There is absolutely nothing useful in it, whatsoever. Nothing in that book will help people design better user interfaces for their programs/web pages. You'll be much better off simply with the use of common sense
