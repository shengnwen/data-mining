I only jumped in to look at what was written about Hemingway and Col. Buck Lanham and it didn't take long to realize how off this author is. The story he writes took place at "Schloss Hemingstein" in the Schnee Eifel region of Germany in September 1944, not in the Huertgen Forest as claimed, which didn't occur until November. Moreover, Hemingway met Col. Lanham back in Normandy in July. Ouch! And to think this made past Wiley editors. Oh for shame.
