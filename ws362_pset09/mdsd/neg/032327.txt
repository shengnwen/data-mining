The author may be a good storyteller but he exhibits over and over again in this book that he doesn't understand several of the basic principles of aerodynamics and the operation of aeroplanes. For me that defect in the author's presentation was fatal, as it totally undermined my confidence in him as an author. If Captain Eddie Rickenbacker were alive, he would undoubtedly be quite upset with having a biographer who is so lacking in technical acumen about the mechanics of flying. As a result I much prefer Richard Smith's earlier biography of the aviator
