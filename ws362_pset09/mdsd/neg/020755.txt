I am grateful that this conversation has begun, but this book is by no means the final word on the subject.  

I found 200 pages of individual acts of backstabbing to be uninsightful.  We already know women can be vicious.  While this book takes heroic steps to sympathetically rationalize treachery and dispel the "good girl-bad girl" dichotomy, it would be a far more inspirational read if it gave practical advice for dealing with our inevitable day to day confrontations.  

I was hoping this book would lay out the nuances and pitfalls of working with women before dispensing some apt suggestions for diffusing tense situations.  Perhaps with some humorous/memorable examples of these tactics applied.  I was disappointed.  

I had to glean from the anecdotes the sorts of environmental conditions which could lead to thinly veiled hostility: feeling threatened by youth, talent, beauty, race, social class or contested token woman status.  Should I find myself in possession of one of these threatening advantages, I'm unsure how to react outside of warily paranoid.  

Although this book alludes to individual advocacy, at its core it is a collective action cop-out.  Women are reluctant to make individual changes because their less altruistic coworkers will take advantage of them.  The solution?  Macro-level reform meted out by our government, media and employers.  

Amidst a slew of gratuitous quotes, it seems Margaret Mead's critical message has been left out: "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."
