This book is a major disappointment from beginning to end. It starts out promisingly enough with a vampire convocation to be held under Jean Claude's auspices and a mysterious vampire ballet production company scheduled to appear. That's where it ends. From there it descends into a series of fairly poorly written sex scenes as Anita, presumably controlled by the "ardeur" hops from bed to bed, as well as floor couch and any other object that happens to be handy. There are some teasers along the way - a Master Vampire and his mermaid wife make a start at some sort of power play, the human and were servants of another Master Vampire enter and exit, etc. - but nothing ever comes of any of them. In the final chapter there is a power play by the vampire leader of the   ballet company but it is all squashed into one short final chapter and pretty well left hanging.

I did not buy this book - for which I am grateful. Even at paperback prices, it is not worth the money. If you must read it, see if the library has a copy
