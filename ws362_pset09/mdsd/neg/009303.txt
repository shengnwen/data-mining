Here's what this book never explained:  if you are WILLING to cook at all, you can cook anything you want.  So why do you need this book?  You don't.  Cooking for yourself is a personal hurdle that you either accomplish or you don't.  If you can get to the point of cooking at all, then you don't need this book...the world is at your dutch oven.  The advice in the book is nothing that you haven't read in ANY magazine that you can pick up, whether it's a men's health magazine or even any ladies magazine.  The recipes may as well have been gleaned from the same pages as those same magazines.  There was NOTHING in this book new.   This was a major league disappointment
