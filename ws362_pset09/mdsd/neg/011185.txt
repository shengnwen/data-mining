The style of the author is far less mature than what I'd hoped for.  I generally read Coonts, Clancy, Poyer, and Coyle.  For a quick read, Poyer's Tiller Galloway books or Riker's SEAL books are good.  For armored warfare novels, Harold Coyle and John Antal are excellent.  I've never read the other "Armored Corps" books and I admit, I didn't get past the first ten pages of this one.  The reason why: stating what happens is clear enough for most readers.  Stating the obvious afterward isn't necessary.  The style is also a bit more crude and while this may be the type of language encountered in the military and in combat, personally, I think the author could leave that to the characters instead of commenting in the same fashion constantly.  Refernce pg 10, "The BRDM surrendered to the forces of physics and American firepower, which is to say it got the S* blown out of it."  The last phrase is a Capt Obvious type statement.  I found this style to be a big turn-off.  I expect profanity and violence to happen.  For the other comments, I'm not retarded.  This would've been my kind of book when I was in junior high
