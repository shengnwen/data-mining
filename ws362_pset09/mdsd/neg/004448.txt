Wanna roll a boulder down a hill to take out a tank? Learn 5 ways of swinging logs from trees to hit people? Then this book is for you. I just do not see any value to what it suggests. If the author actually sets up these kind of traps, they'd work good for Hollywood, but not much else. How do you get the boulder up the side of the mountain to set the trap? How does 1 person lift those big logs into trees? There are a couple basic NVA type foot traps, but the internet has better for free
