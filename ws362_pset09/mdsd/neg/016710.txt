"Mark's Handbook" is one of those books you hear other students in college talk about like it's a must have that you'll use for the rest of your life. But it's not. I bought this book, and six years out of college I barely ever crack it open. It's packed with information, but it's so general that you can't get any real-world specific information out of it. It's like a restaurant reviewer who can tell you that "New York has some great Italian restaurants" but doesn't give you the name of any of them. You're much better off skipping this book and buying one that's more specific to your particular field. As an example, the mechanical engineer is much better off with Shigley's "Mechanical Engineering Design"
