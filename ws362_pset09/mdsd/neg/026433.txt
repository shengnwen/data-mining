You can almost see MMM trying to bring out the characters, to shed some sort of three-dimensional light on them, as well as giving some meaning to their interactions. There are too many characters, however, and past the 200th page you kind of stop caring whether Jack wants to live up to his fathers expectations, or that Elizabeth is torn up inside about her feelings. Fiona keeps making stupid decisions and having sex with every TOm Dick and Harry that knocks on her door. Not to mention the fact she keeps associating herself with Patrick, after what he's done to her. She acts like a battered woman, but meanwhile she's supposed to be some sort of strong, outspoken diva. Perhaps it shows up her different faucets, but afer the fifth time she hangs up on Patrick and the thrid time she gets caught trying to get in some guy's pants, it gets kind of annoying. This could have been a very insightful book, instead, it reads like a soap opera. I hate soap operas
