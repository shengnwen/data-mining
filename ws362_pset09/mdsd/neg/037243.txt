Generally well written prose, Evan's &quot;The American Century&quot; is rife with examples of his left-leaning tendencies.  Throughout the book, every Democrat is described in noble and glowing terms.  Errors made by the liberals are explained away as casual mistakes or honest misunderstandings.  Democrats are universally portrayed as virtuous and well-meaning.  Conversely, all Republicans/conservatives are shown to be mean-spirited and their policies are donation driven and designed to hurt the &quot;average&quot; American.  I understand that every historian writes with a particular bias, but the totality of it here makes the work unreadable to less idealogically-driven readers
