I read this book right after Norman Maclean's A River Runs Through It.

Let us look at the substance first. I applaud the author for many things. Among them, for not trying to stretch the amazingly thin plot over any more than 130 pages, which it takes comfortably. Second, for insinuating but not conferring the name of Sherlock Holmes on the old detective. To have flirted with accident but avoided a direct/dangerous hit has, I suspect, left the driver as well as the pedestrians healthy enough. I have hope that they will each continue on their journey with very little scarring and an unimpaired memory of their favorite detective.   

As for style, for all those interested, I recommend both of Norman Maclean's books for a lesson on the exact meaning of brevity. True brevity  simply reduces the vehicle which carries the power of the story. Infact, the power becomes all the more starker for it. Poorly executed brevity cuts out power proportional to the removed verbage. Such is the case here. To all authors, taught and aiming brevity, I plead, in reducing the weight of the overcoat, do not lose the wool. Keep it warm and keep it alive. 

The vocabulary is solid enough but feels like pepper sprinkled over a spoonful of cold, cold pasta. The words being, individually, pretty much the only admirable things, the novel is the highbrow pulling the lowbrow into its own world rather than walking over to the latter.
