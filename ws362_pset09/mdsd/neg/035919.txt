I found this book to be a bit dry and behind the times, especially in terms of using the Web for surveys. There's also not much about polling. Unfortunately, that was my main reason for buying it. It is one of the few books out there about surveys and polls and there is some helpful information, but I will have to look elsewhere for my needs
