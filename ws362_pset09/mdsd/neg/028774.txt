I love Jane Austen.  I firmly believe that if Jane were to time travel to the future she would throw this book in the trash were it belongs and run, not walk; back to her time travel machine. She would  return to her own time where garbage like this would not have gotten published .  It was predictable, ridiculous and poorly written.  The names of the characters all throw back to Jane Austen stories, including the cat(Wickham!?!?!)  I am all for escapist reading but this was un-readable and left me angry and annoyed.  If I could time travel I would travel to the author's home pre-publish time and erased every copy !!!
