I was actually surprised to see such high ratings for this book. yeah it's comedic and witty but it's a little bit over the top and after reading it about half the way through the comedy gets old and witt seems more like a person overwhelming disdain for Bush. Even though the book is a more than a bit extreme, I can see the book being useful some weeks and even months after the election, after that i find it useless. Personally the author seems like a an overly bitter democrat who's letting out some aggression that exploded after the 2004 election. I myself sympathize with the author and share some sentiments but some of the stereotypes were just too much and over the top to appreciate. I do admit that the jokes and the Bushisms did serve
