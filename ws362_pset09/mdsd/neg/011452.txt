Yancey's problem is that he follows fads.  It's like in the movie, Good Will Hunting.  Most of the people studying an issue will follow the latest fad.  That's what Yancey does.  The title, "The Bible That Jesus Read", insults Jesus Christ, who is God -- the Second Person in the Holy Trinity.  The Old Testament and the New Testament clearly teach the Holy Trinity.  Gospel of John chpater 1 shows all Three Persons of the Holy Triity operating.  It is because people like Yancey has taken the helm of Christianity -- he is the editor of Christianity Today -- that America's Christianity is in grave trouble.  Ordaining homosexuals?  What do you think about that Yancey?  Is that a part of the "Bible that Jesus Read"?  Ridiculous!
