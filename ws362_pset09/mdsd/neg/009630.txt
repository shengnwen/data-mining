I usually read right before im going to bed, and i just couldnt get into this book, the information was the same and it was all very predictable.  Im sure that if i wouldve finished it, then i would have loved it, because i love almost all of danielle steel's books.  If you havent read most of them, then your missing out, so stop reading this boring passage, and get into a book of hers
