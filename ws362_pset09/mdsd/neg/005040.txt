I am not quite sure why people are giving this 5 stars and a perfect rating.  This is nowhere near classic literature, nor is is a wonderous example of english prose.

All that aside, I simply found this book slow.  If you are a huge Raistlin fan, then this might have something for you.  Really all you do is follow his life day by day from childhood to adulthood.  Really boring and drab with about 3 pages total of action.  

The second book in this set was much better, and I would pick up a third if it gets written.  By itself, this book doesn't really stand for itself at all.  I have liked many of Weis' books, but this one is down there at the bottom of the stack
