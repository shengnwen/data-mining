I am more than a little interested in historical accounts of piracy, especially those dealing Grace O'Malley, and other female mariners.  I selected this book hoping for more stories of the same, and was instead bored to tears by the author's accounts of her trip, the countryside, the places she stayed.. On and On.  I got no new information about Grace or anyone else.  It seemed like the author did not find enough information about these "legendary women" and needed to pad the book with her adventures.  I personally would reccomend "She Captians" or Anne Chambers biography of Grace O'Malley over this book
