Reading this book, I got a picture of a certain kind of person who would love this book. Unfortunately, this
kind of person is not me! I was disappointed. But if you find ideas like these useful you will also like One Thing at a Time:
# 31  Keep a phone log
# 68. Label a cardboard box "office supplies" and put all your office supplies in it so you can find them.
# 24. Sweep and vacuum at least once a week.
# 61. Put things back, even when you're rushed.
# 9.  Make your bed every day.
# 72. Put a trash container in every room.
Seems like these "tips" are things most everyone already knows. Don't they?

Other suggestions border on bizarre:
#11. Make a list of mini-tasks like: sort mail, make a phone call, write a check, wipe up something that's spilled, 
take out the trash, check a web site, etc. Why make a list when you could just do the work? 
# 5. Carry a clip board because "A clipboard puts you squarely in charge of Things in your life." It does?
#43. Create a list of items "almost anyone would throw away or recycle" including: used paper dishes, cups and napkins, 
used tissues and toilet paper, empty cans, broken rubber bands, balls of hair, used dental floss, etc.!! Is the author joking? 
If a person needs to make this list they also need much more help than this book can give!

I did find a few useful tried-and-true gems: 
#1 One thing at a time. 
#94 Leave it neater than you found it.

Finally, I recommend www.freecycle.org. Freecycle is an email list where people give away things that they no longer need
for free. Give your stuff to a good home
