I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for a non-realistic cutsie book to pass the time.  The book starts with a good premise: what the elaborate ritual of college admissions really tells about a person and who he or she is.  However, the story gets lost with odd twists, turns, and irrelevant plot lines.  This poorly written maze of a book about nothing isn't exactly written for teens as it heavily focuses on the emotions of the stress of parents sending their children away.  There are some mildly amusing parts as Dylan goes through various college interviews.  However, most of these situations are cliché and predictable.  The more unintentional amusing parts of this book is watching the author, James Finney Boylan, attempt to create characters that talk like modern day teenagers.  Someone should tell this guy no one calls each other &quot;dickweed&quot; or &quot;dude&quot; in every sentence.  Another thing that is annoying is that he writes like he is still in junior high.  One may notice he shifts from the narrator talking in first person to third person at various points.  He also used convoluted vocabulary in an attempt to add some sort of depth to the writing.  So if you are really bored, there may be some humorous things in this book to read, mostly unintentional
