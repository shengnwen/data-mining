How many stories can intrigue in Catholic Church spawn?

Berry tries to imitate Dan Brown (which is also, admittedly, his own basic style) but he really falls flat with this work.

Stock characters: a moderate dying pope, a somewhat secret liberal investigating priest, a conservative Catholic powerful priest/villan who is willing to murder to achieve his aims.

It all culminates in a real religious "truth" that shows that the powerful interests in the Church have really been working against the true will of God (in this case through various Marian appearances) for decades.  

Not to be a spoiler, but the ultimate "secret" wasn't all that exciting either.  My own personal views are pretty much in line with Berry's so this is far from a political statement.  It just wasn't that much from a thriller perspective.

This one can be given a pass.  The lackluster plot sinks this one
