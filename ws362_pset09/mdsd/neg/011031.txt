The author could have added so many details that were factual and actual events and, yet, were so compelling and riveting.  This book lacked substance and depth.  You don't really experience the life or the personal conflicts that played out in the French court.  It was also too sympathetic to Marie Antoinette and highly unbelievable.  There were also so many missing pieces that could have explained more clearly what led up to the revolution.  I know this is a work of fiction but the true historical events and figures that took place were much more interesting than all the fictional events and characters the author created.
