Having recently read The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory and The Birth of Venus by by Sarah Dunant, I was very much disappointed in this novel by Jeanne Kalogridis.  It does not match the complexity of plot, character or style found in the other two works of historical fiction about women; its badly written, graphic love scenes diminish it even more
