The problem with his argument is that he makes generalized motives the norm after researching a few examples. It's naive to go with the premise of White workers and Black slaves going against the power structure, united we  stand, etc. by itself. Historically, there are financial motives that were  far stronger than &quot;brothers in bondage&quot; motives. The companies in  the north were being bested by their southern brethren. The north could not  use slaves and suffered financially, therefore created a general sympathy  for the slave movement. The humanitarian issue did not come until much  later, generally. For those that were always humanitarians, the John  Browns, etc. They were the minority of Whites in the north, not the  majority. The correlation might as well not even exist
