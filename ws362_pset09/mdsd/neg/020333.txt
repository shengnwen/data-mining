I was hoping for more in-depth information about Hibernate 3.  The book flows ok and is easy to read, but just doesn't have the details that you can find with the general documentation.   I should have previewed the book at a local store before buying it.  Hibernate in Action is supposed to be the best Hibernate book, but didn't buy it because it is almost 2 years old now.  Looking back, probably should have bought that to get a good foundation, then used the online docs to find the differences with ver 3
