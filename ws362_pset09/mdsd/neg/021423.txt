Frankly, this book is barely worth the paper it's printed on. It's full of "social climbing" truisms that should be obvious to anyone with a pulse. Very little of the book is actually devoted to first impressions, which is what the title suggests.

The only remotely useful part of the book is a couple pages describing the relationships between economic advancement and social advancement. Don't waste your time
