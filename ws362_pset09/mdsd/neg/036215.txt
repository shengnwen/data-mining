I personally think this book (actually having read it impartially) is not good for any Information Security professional, corporate or government (IA, IAM, IASO, ISSO, ect), but, if you had to place it in any category I guess it would be in the business management end of communication compliance (maybe for a Policy Compliance Officer).  Also I really think that some of the other reviewers here must have been working to promote this book.  I unfortunately say this because the author creates entirely too many unique and extremely complex management policy theories on communication development, which frankly gets way off the subject of INFOSEC, and even has him chasing his own tail in the narrated scenarios.  The author even goes so far as to concoct and create possibly 20-30 new acronyms (as if you didn't have enough already as a real INFOSEC professional), which almost became a little comedic by the end of the book, especially when hearing even the author try recap each chapter and make each new theory tie into another new theory.  Although I'm sure the author is a very distinguished professional in his own right, I unfortunately found this book weak to incorporate into any of my perceived Information Security plans.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one and move onto the next, and make sure the books you choose on this topic do not try to reinvent the wheel
