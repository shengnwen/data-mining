This is a great concept for a three book series, but after this first book, I felt unsatisfied with the character development and predictable plot. Mariah Stewart did a great job of writing, though the book wasn't that suspenseful (maybe I've just been reading too much lately).  The relationship between Mara Douglas and Aiden Shields wasn't fully developed. I would have liked a few more scenes where they get to know each other, or something just to show the chemistry between the two. I found that seriously lacking in this book.
If you want an easy read, get a used copy of this book, but definitely don't pay full price. I'm not going to bother with the other two in the series. This one didn't make me care enough to finish the series
