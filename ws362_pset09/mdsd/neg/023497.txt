The author of the book said he wanted to go for aesthetically pleasing, but figured artists wanted more on visibility.  He would've done so much better going with his first choice!  I wanted a good book of poses, and have yet to get one picture out of the book!  Most of the poses in this book weren't pleasing to the eye at all.  The models are all young, thin people in ridiculous, often painful looking poses.  A little variety would've been great, too, and the two photos of pregnant women in there don't count for much.  There are no old people, fat people, or even normal sized people!  There are, however, an archive of the worst poses I've seen to date.  Do yourself a favor and go get a good book like Anatomy for the Artist by Sarah Simblet or Virtual Pose 2 by Mario Henri Chakkour.  You'll actually get some use out of them
