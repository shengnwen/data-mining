I was a child abuse investigator for many years. The business is full of Crusaders such as Mones. I find that most of them are hot for a pay-off, including book deals, and they generally uncover whatever it is theyre looking for. So Mones motivation is suspect, to me. And if you pay attention to the studies he references you get a sense that teens murder for any number of reasons, and manipulate the hell out of everyone with the abuse claims. I estimate 75%-80% of abuse reports are nonsense. Another 10%-15% are do-gooders trying to make something out of nothing. And maybe 5% are the real deal. I always keep in mind that fruit & nuts never fall far from the tree.

I mean, if Mones reported that child abuse really isnt all that bad a problem who would buy his book
