A poor, incomplete and unwieldy reference.  "Modern American Usage" fails to deal with many of the everyday issues people struggle with in their writing -- the list of omissions is long and varied -- and those that are included are sometimes addressed with a lack of thoroughness or clarity. Too often, and too irritatingly, entries merely redirect users to other headings, when the issue could easily have been resolved under the original entry-heading. Those involved in creating this edition seem not to appreciate that a little duplication goes a long way in making what is, first and foremost, a craftsperson's tool user-friendly.
