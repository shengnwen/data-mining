THE BEGINING WAS VERY AMUSING BUT AS IT GETS ON I JUST DON'T FEEL THE ROMANCE ANYMORE. THE SEX IS PRETTY MUCH CONSTANT BUT THE HEROINE'S CHARACTER WAS WAY TOO CHILDISH. SHE DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE UNTIL THE END OF THE BOOK. SHE'S NOT VERY EXCITING OR UNDERSTANDING LIKE THE OTHER FEMALE IN DARA JOY'S OTHER BOOK. THE GIRL JUST LEFT ME COLD AND SORRY FOR THE GUY. WELL, THE GUY IS VERY SWEET AND TRIED TO WOO HER FROM THE BEGINING TO THE END. AT FIRST IT WAS JUST A CHALLENGE TO HIM BUT THEN IT BECOMES A LOVE CHASE. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CUTE. ALTHOUGH HE'S A GREAT CHARACTER, THE ONGOING OF HIS MASCULINITY IS VERY ANNOYING IN THE HEROINE'S POINT OF VIEW. IT MAKES ME THINK SHE'S LUSTING AFTER HIM. BUT ANYWAY, I FIRST I ENJOYED THE BOOK BUT STILL IT LEFT ME UNCERTAIN OF THEIR FUTURE TOGETHER. IF IT WAS ANY OTHER HEROINE, THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE PULL IT OFF EASILY
