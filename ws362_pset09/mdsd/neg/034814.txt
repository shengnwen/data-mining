I wanted to learn about the man who guided so many down the wrong road to drug experiementation.  Reading this preplexed me throughout the chore.  Somehow, I couldn't figure out how someone who had so much going for him turn down this road, consuming his daughter and son in the process.

It seemed all he ever sought was publicity and nothing else except another high. His ego and hunger for always higher recognition never seemed to be satisfied. 

If any of us mere humans had down what he did, like he did, we would ended up dead, in a mental health facility for life, or locked away in some prison for much longer than he served.  Book is well written and very factual but the subject matter should have been viewed with more disdain
