I have the Bad Cats book and love it, that is why I bought the calendar. I did not realize the pics were in black and white. If I had known that, I would not have bought it. Like another reviewer stated, they should have put that in the description. I would not recommend this calendar. Hopefully next year they will make the pics color or they wont sell many
