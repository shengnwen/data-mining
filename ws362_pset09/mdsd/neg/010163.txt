I teach antenna course and have found that students get confused when problems are incorrect.  At least 2 problems (6.40, 6.46) design Tchevy array with specifications that are impossible to meet. The solutionary is wrong too!  The required SSL of 30dB is never attained 'cause when you verify the visible region of T(z)doesn't reach sidelobes (z&lt;1) so don't meet for given d and N.  Need to increase spacing or N. This is serious bad training for students.  In addition, the author use of beta for phase-shift instead of alpha is missleading and confused with nomenclature for k = 2 pi/lambda.  Other aspects are very good, but needs color and photos
