I can't say I read this whole book, because, I started to read it and found from a markets perspective I couldn't agree with much of what it said.  That probably applies to T/A in general, mind, not just this book.  However, it does confirm that this book isn't really managing to sell T/A.  There are too many qualifications about indicators and rules which if you take on, rather than ignore, make some of these systems no better than a crack-pot lottery system.  Also, having dipped into various chapters there seem to be cases of things only being glossed over, such as candlesticks.

Much cases, of may, might, probable, etc.  If you want to get rich quick, first learn how to do the DD and value analysis.  Then use T/A if you must to provide some support to your entry and exits into investments, but do not invest on the basis of charts alone.  You may win some, and then lose some, and win some, and lose some, and lose some, and over time, unless lucky, you'll probably lose some more than you win some.  Of course, there are lucky people.  Don't take these people as being statistically representative of whether T/A works or not!

Sorry; the book doesn't do it for me, though I'm quite positive there will be more succint books produced by sharper traders which will act as better guides
