I have the "Seeds of Greatness" on audio tape.  I wanted it on CD.  So I ordered it on CD.

The audio tape version is 4 tapes which represent about 3 hours of audio.

The CD is missing all of the great illustrations and only represents about 1/3 of the audio tape and book version.

Very disappointing
