After looking through the book, I found this book not so structured. The diagrams are not enough to get the reader easily understood. The description of how the algorithms work in the book is unclear. The book  just listed out some basis without further looking. And the 'see also'  reference in the book makes the readers jump from page to page without  giving the titles of the pages. The material covered by this book is ok,  but it has the potential to improve
