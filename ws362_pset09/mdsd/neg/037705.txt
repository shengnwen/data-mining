I've used a lot of the recipes in this book, and I've come to the conclusion that it's not that great. I followed everything to exact specifications, so has my girlfriend, and there's always a problem with it. The breads come out too hard or flaky, the chili is REALLY bland (I ended up adding my own ingredients and cooking it much, much longer than instructed, and it came out great) the "easy breezy cheese sauce" is nasty, the pancakes aren't that good, the sauces/dressings aren't good. The only thing I actually think came out good is the whip cream. 

I've gone online and found much better recipes for free. So, there's really no reason to buy this book, unless you need some ideas or reference to create your own meals.
