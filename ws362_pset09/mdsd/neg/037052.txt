As a translator, I'm always wary of people who take responsibility for translating from one language into another without a firm grounding in both languages. I realize that it's done, but in my personal experience, a lot gets lost unless the person is an absolute master in his or her area of expertise. I bought this book out of curiousity, but it seems to be riding a trend, not contributing much to the field.
