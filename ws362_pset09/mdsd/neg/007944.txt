As a former military hand-to-hand combat instructor I can say that while this book contains horribly ineffective information, it contains things that are commonly taught in the military.

Regardless of what some say, the military teaches hand-to-hand combat to primarily teach aggressiveness, not effectiveness.  There are things that the military teaches that are quite asinine.  However, the main goal for 99% of the military is to teach aggressiveness.

For example, the US Army Rangers teach Gracie Jujitsu for Christ sake.  They go out to the wrestling mats and roll around.  Why?   To teach you to be aggressive.  If you think you can wrestle wearing 70 pounds of gear, carrying a rifle, and after marching 20 miles through rough terrain, then you should be able to qualify for handicapped plates.

Does this book contain information that is commonly taught to the US Special Forces?  Yes it does.  Does it work effectively when faced by criminal violence?  It's not really supposed to
