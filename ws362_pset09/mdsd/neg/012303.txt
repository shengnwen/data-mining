This book is not for Charmed fans.  It knocks all the little things wrong on set that you may not have noticed and would rather not.  You would think a book of this title would be more positive but this book points out things that went wrong on set such as missing items (jackets, purses, etc.)and it talks about how "real witches" aren't like the ones on Charmed.  Hello, can you say fiction?  So if you are looking for something that knocks the show you will love the book but if you are a true Charmed fan, you will find it offensive.
