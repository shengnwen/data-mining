The reviews are mostly weird ramblings about whatever, and the little bit of food descriptions are really gross. If things like "pancakes and some dead pig products" or "get the duck if you like eating stuff you can see at the park" or "a hot dog that will sit in your small intestine for weeks" or "Thai that won't burn a hole in your colon or through your tounge" or "you probably don't care which vegetable it sprung from" make you actually want to eat, then you won't have a problem. It makes me feel sick
