This book bounces between the cute and the cliche.  The reader feels there is a real story-teller waiting to get out, but suffocating under the author's clumsy craftsmanship.  The immigrant &quot;experience&quot; is not deconstructed but frozen into solid pieces narrative, into obvious encounters with bigots and identity confusion/pursuit.  My best advice is that the potential reader should get the book out of library and save the cash for another book that will deserve a re-read
