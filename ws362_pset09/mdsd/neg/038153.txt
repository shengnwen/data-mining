Let me start out by being fair - if you know a lot about Indian history/culture this book MAY interest you even if the first 50 pgs. are excruciatingly slow. Otherwise, you will have a hard time understanding the value behind what the characters do. The whole plot revolves around the woman's place in Indian society & more specifically, Bimla's conflict with her brother, Raja. The conflict seems to begin resolving itself in the last 15 pgs, but the author does not take the time to write out the final scene between sister & brother. Very difficult book to enjoy with no satisfactory conclusion
