I, like other Star Trek fans, have a sound ability to suspend reality and enjoy fantasy.  If the plot isn't that exciting, you can usually get into the character development.  My problem with this book is that I was faced with a ridiculous plot:  Enterprise creates a worm hole through syphoning off power from a soon-to-go Nova sun, to allow the nearby doomed planet, with its 20 million residents, to then move through (yes, the entire planet!) to safety several light years away and a new, more stable sun.  And yes, all this is an experiment that Data pulled out of his positronic rear end.  There are then 'teaser' plots that don't go anywhere: ancient civilisation that had abandoned the planet previously, despite having some clever stabilisation control in the middle of the sun; writings of the ancients (that disappointingly are never interpreted through a failure of its archeologists to locate a Rosetta Stone equivalent); dolphin-like creatures who 'might' be ancients, studied by a cult-like group dwelling under the ocean; a completely unconvincing child hostage scene that is resolved in a poorly described narrative 'blip'; and a strange reference to Federation politics overtaking the traditional 'doing the right thing'.  From a character-development perspective, the only point of recall was Worf admiring the scenery of the planet - snooze.  My kingdom for a Batleth swinging, Daktagh wielding warrior!

This novel really didn't gel at all with me, and truly seemed like Star Trek pulp.  Would only recommend people read this, if they want to fill "Novel No# 43" to complete a gap on their bookshelf
