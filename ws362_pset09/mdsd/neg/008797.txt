Wild at Heart can captivate your interest and suck you in to believing it's all good.Problem with this book is that it is not sound when it comes to true untwisted scripture.I first loved this book and it began to change me until I researched further only to discover that The Bible has been used incorrectly.If you don't believe me,just punch in Wild at Heart on any search engine and read the complications with these writings.If you are a believer you will see in a very short time what I mean.
If you're not a believer I suggest you purchase a Bible instead.With much love to all..........................
