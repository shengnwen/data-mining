I was looking forward to using this cookbook as the idea of preparing dinner early in the day and having it ready and waiting for me at six o'clock was extremely appealing.  However, I have been extremely disappointed.  All the entrees I have tried have been, in my opinion, overcooked.  Sadly, I am coming to the conclusion that most foods were not meant to be cooked 6-7 hours.  Most of the recipes I tried were a bland mushy mess and there is not one that I would subject my family to again.  My last and final attempt was the Chicken with Beer which was both dry (due to the required baking for 20 minutes in the oven after 3 to 4 hours in the slow cooker on high) and tasteless.  Much to my amazement, one prior reviewer actually liked this recipe!  So maybe its just me.  In any case I am considering givin the slow cooker to Goodwill, along with this cookbook.  There has got to be a better way to simplify the chaos of dinner time preparation
