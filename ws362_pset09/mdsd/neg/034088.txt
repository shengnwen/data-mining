This book is one of the most biased I have ever read. Most of the people who read it will probably already agree with much of what it says. It talks about supposed threats to freedom and security by "right wing extremist". The only things threatened by the right are the degenerate social policies and experiments of left wing groups, zionist, globalist, and marxist.

Don't bother reading it unless you are one of the above mentioned
