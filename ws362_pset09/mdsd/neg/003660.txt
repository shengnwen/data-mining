I'm not sure I completely understood what Delillo was trying to do with this novel. I understood the whole description of what it was like to be a powerful corporate entity who had an infinite amount of money and who everyone hated for what he represented, but beyond that, the story is very problematic. Delillo seems to be saying that certain character traits are an essential part of anyone as materialistic (not in the I need to buy things sense, but rather the I need to own or have dominion over as much as possible sense) as his protagonist Eric. There was an element of Sartre and Camus in that this corporate demigod wanted some sort of consequence to take place for his misdeeds (including killing his own bodyguard and losing millions of dollars betting against the Yen), but something was simply missing. I think it would have been more effective if Delillo would have simply put the fiction aside and simply written some diatribe on the dangers of money because this whole novel seems to fence-sit, trying to be both a philosophical exploration and great novel, unfortunately failing miserably at both. Although I may not love the philosophy that much, Rand is much more successful at providing entertaining stories and a schematic of her own philosophy than anything I've seen Delillo write.
