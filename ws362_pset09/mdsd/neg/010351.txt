I'm disappointed to see some reviewers of this book state that it's origins are in the "real-life" disappearance of American Tourists in Burma.  I too, believed the "author's note" and believed her back story.  Of course, as you get into the book you realize that there is far too much information available to Tan for this to be a true story (yes, even if based on the telepathic communications of the deceased narrator!).  I decided to search the internet for the story of these tourists. Instead I found an interview (NPR) with Tan in which she states she is surprised that people didn't realize that even the author's note is fiction.  What????  She goes on to state that she only wanted to allow the reader to suspend disbelief.  Isn't that understood when we pick up a book in the fiction category?  Does she need to add this to 'help' us?  It only serves to insult the reader or make them feel tricked into believing her.  When I went to my book club and shared the information with others the overwhelming response was anger.  Unfortunately, this was my first book by Tan and will be my last.
