That's what you get when you buy this book. The book simply reprints the same material you get in the DISC instrument. There is nothing, nothing, new here. There is no insight, no detail, no discussion on how to use the information. I use DISC constantly in my business and found this book a total waste. If you want to understand DISC go to www.discinsights.com and get their home study program. It's terrific, detailed, and provides lots of examples. I also recommend the book "The 4-Dimensional Manager." Still not as good as the above reference but at least it's worth the money.
