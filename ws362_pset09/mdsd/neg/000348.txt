I have a very strong willed daughter who I co-slept with, nursed until 14 months of age, wore in a sling when very young and needed contact with me a lot, and stay home with.  Dr Sears implies that this will cause you to have a naturally well behaved child.  Not so.  I found this book very un-helpful in trying to get ideas on methods for dicipline.  Dr Sears must have naturally well behaved children -- how lucky for him.  He seems to believe that it is ok for a child to tell you he "hates" you because he is expressing his anger. How disrespectful!!!  If I had "expressed my anger" in such a way as a child my mother would have sat on me (not really, but she would have grounded me for sure).  He suggests using pillows, couches, etc. for children to hit while angry instead of a person.  I thought that was sort of strange.  To me that's encouraging tantrums.  Isn't the point to try to avoid them?  His aproach is very "lovey" and "nice", which simply DOES NOT WORK with a strong willed child!  I disagreed with half of this book, but I really tried to get what I could from it.  However, once I got to the part where he encourages using counting to get a child to behave (AGGGHHH!!! my pet peeve!!), I tossed the book right into the used bookstore bag!!  I have yet to meet a child who is not a total monster whose parent uses counting.  If you have very very mild children, this book might be worth a read.  If you have a tyrant on your hands, don't bother
