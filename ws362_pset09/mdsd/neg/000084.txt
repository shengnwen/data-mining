Disappointing since 1/3 of the book is dedicated to foreign authors' translated versions. In the sense of making an anthology of super-short, the selection might come directly from original English instead of any translated, seemingly storytelling-only stories since the brightness of diction is far more important than a &quot;short-short&quot; story itself
