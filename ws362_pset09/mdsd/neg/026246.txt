I had heard of Iyanla as inspiring and wonderful, so when I saw this book on the new book shelf I decided to give it a try.  Expecting enlightenment and motivation as the cover promises, instead I found rather disturbing recollections of her life and constant proclamations of how blessed she is because of it.  Not only did I miss the point of the lessons I could stand to read, but I'm rushing it back to the library early
