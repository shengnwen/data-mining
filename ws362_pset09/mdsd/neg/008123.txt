Here's why D&D supplements (ie SPLAT books) are good:

If you want a lot of extra rules, occasionally some good new optiosn, and the ability for your players to make characters that are overpowered -- without a single magic item. And when the overpowered characters DO get an item, look out!

Here's why they suck:
I'm happy they pumped the Clerics, Paladins, etc ... but if you buy the D&D game, you're looking at hundreds of dollars of books.

The whole system needs to be revamped. A roleplaying game shouldn't cost players, GM's, or fans hundreds of dollars.

Players & GM's, go find a cheaper yet also good RPG like Call of Cthulhu, Amber Diceless, Paranoia, Hackmaster, ShadowRun, etc. Or just DON'T buy all the expansions!!
