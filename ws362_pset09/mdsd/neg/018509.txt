I received this book for Christmas as I have been a devotee of the game for over 30 years. I have never been so disappointed in any present I have ever received.  This book serves as a reminder of everything that has gone wrong with the game.  Baseball was once the game of the common man.  A game of honesty integrity and spirit.  Reading this book reminded me that the important legacy items of the game are now in the hands of the superwealthy and can only be accessed by the interviews of another super wealthy man - Wong.  His sycophantic prose and painful rhetoric were difficult to stomach.  Do yourself and your kids a favor.  Save your money. Go outside and throw a ball around in your yard
