I must say that I was not pleased with this book.  I was excited about reading it because TheWomen of Brewster Place is one of my favorite books.  The only reason I continued to read the book was because of Eugene and Basil.  I also found error in the time ti in compaison to The Women Of Brewster Place ( Eugene made a  statement about Aids, However at that time it was still be refered to as Grid) However I will say that I you have read the first book, this book will clear up a few of the unanswered questions that you may have had after reading the first book.  Even though Basil kept me reading the book, I still could not buy his reasoning for running out on his mother and then trying to make it right
