Completely and utterly out of context. The author of this book takes things that appear to be out of context and lists them in this bias, prejudice and predisposed book. He appears to have prior knowledge of understanding the Bible, and has many points of topics that seem as if he is right. The reason that it is wrong is that he takes verses of the Bible and compares them to other passages that have similar subjects, but are talking about completely different situations. The whole passage, along with the text above and below that verse need to be read.
The author points out many "infallible" contradictions that include numbers. During transition from the Greek and Hebrew to English there have been many different translations made. It is possible that a zero gets left off or 1 too many get put in. This is an error of man (key piece of information), not God's Word. Although man has made errors in translation, this is not God's fault, nor have any of these errors changed the doctrine of the Bible.
Although the author makes it clear that he is not a believer, I think that it is written from a very bias view that has no true evidence of his theory. I would not recommend this book to others, but if you do read it, please keep this information in mind.
