This book should never have been put together.  Many of the works are butchered.  Sometimes not even the original title is included and it seems that authors are missing from several as well.  He even butchers Aesops fables -- guess he doesn't want to overtax young minds with the full versions in all their splendor.  Of course, many of the selections are classics, but what he's edited out leaves me not only cold but disgusted.  If your kids internallize some of the slop used to demonstate these virtues, it will be hard to erase a number of pernitious misconceptions later
