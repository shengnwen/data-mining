Buddhism & Christianity have only one thing in common; MORALITY. Nothing else.

The author needs to find other ways to make money. This book encourages ignorance, and delusion. I pity Thich Nhat Hanh.

If you want to know what Christianity is read the Bible. If you want to truely understand Buddhism, visit www.buddhanet.net... there youll find FREE E-Texts detailing every aspect of Theravada & Zen Buddhism
