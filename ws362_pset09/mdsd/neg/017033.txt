After hearing the reviews of Time's eye and Sunstrom on NPR I thoughy I would revisit the world of Clarke, whihc I had not done for several years.  Suffice it to say that I found this first book to be tedious and not very interesting.  The characters were rather simplistic and the story line did not make a lot of sense in terms of what the aliena';s hope dto accomplish.  It makes even less sense with the second book, which has holes in logic that you could drive the planet Jupiter through.  These were a very disappointing pair of books
