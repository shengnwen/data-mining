The tortured language, the dialogue, is simply awful. His attempt to make the detective's conversations seem like Spencer is more like Shaft in drag and it fails miserably. 

The sexual tension is gratuitous, seems forced as if added to make the book sell rather than spending the pages in deeper character building. It's rare that I won't finish even a bad look, but this one I finally threw at the wall at page 160.  Enough.
