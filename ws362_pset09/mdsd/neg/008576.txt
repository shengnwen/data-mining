I encountered this gem as a wannabe text book in 1998.
 
 The author makes a big deal out of using movies as a self help device. The problem I have with this book how the author judges the movies he presents. Get a copy and read &quot;Solomon's&quot; description of your favorite movie. It as if he stretches his views and theory's around a movie that just are not there. A case in point is The Great Santini / The Gift of Fury (1979). A coming of age movie with a dedicated Marine Pilot as the father. Gary Solomon treats this movie as Child Abuse. Gary misses the point completely. Once you begin to actually look at the movies he recommends his Prescription falls flat on its face! It is the same self help mumbo jumbo for a buck that hits the book stores every day. I would go so far as to say this is a Toxic book. Toxic in the same way as using aspirin to grow hair on your head.
 
 If a college instructor hands this book to you hand it back and drop the class
