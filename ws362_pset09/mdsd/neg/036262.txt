As readers, people should always be careful about the way they write a review of a book such as this: it is not in any way shape or form a representation of "life in Brazil."  It is a representation of what life in some, I repeat, some poorer areas of Brazil can be like... but even so, being originally from Brazil and having traveled in my country, I can give anyone a million examples of poor or people who live under the poverty line, who are loving, decent, clean, concerned with the well-being and protection of others first before their own.  I despise it when people file anything under the "generalization" category about other countries, and Brazil seems to always get a bad wrap in this sense.  Brazil is an amazing country, culturally rich and diverse, geographically gorgeous and varied, and when speaking of a country with 186+ million inhabitants, how can anyone generalize under any one specific term about this or that factor?  Not all mothers -- by a very very long stretch -- in Brazil fit the mode portrayed in "Death without weeping," and hope to have made that absolutely clear here: misinformation of this kind is absurd, and using the subhead "The Violence in Everyday Brazil" even more irreponsible from such a noted author
