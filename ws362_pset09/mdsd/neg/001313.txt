Hello to all those who have read this book.  After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something.  WHy are you so set against God and Christianity?  One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity.  Christianity is not some weird religion,  it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much.  Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.  Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him.  Thank you
