I was impressed by the volume of data supporting the overall conclusion and was pleased that the authors chose data that was adjusted for other factors (age, etc) but I agreed with a previous reviewer that they failed to show cause and effect.  Many of the downsides of not being married (domestic violence, eg) may result in not being married instead of vice versa.

This is especially true in reference to the section on how there is a full out war against marriage - yes, there is a lot of bad press on marriage but that's because there are a lot of bad marriages (and if you think divorce is bad for the children, try having one of the parents - or both - hating their home life).  The authors show that their are several inherent values to marriage (eg, finance is easier with 2 people supporting one household)-and you want us to believe that people stay out or get of marriages because they others talking about how bad marriages are?  In the end, people are going to make decision based on personal experience if available and I know very few people who haven't experienced marriage, either their own or their parents.  Something's going wrong within the matrimonial institution that the authors completely ignore.  What is it?  I don't know and the book fails to give me insight.

Given that omission the authors' final conclusion - encourage marriage by giving financial breaks to married couples and marginalizing single people - will not solve the problem. If singles have trouble financially, shouldn't they be the ones getting tax breaks? If some singles are less likely to have affordable health insurance shouldn't we address the health industry? What about those singles who want to be married but haven't met the proper person - how is this going to help them? Bottom line is the authors' suggestions won't necessarily increase the proportion of happily married people but will make single people's lives more difficult.
