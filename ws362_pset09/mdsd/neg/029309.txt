One of the things I love about Robert B. Parker novels is the witty dialogue between the characters and a strong, unique story line.  That element is missing from the new Jess Stone novel and is replaced with the 'f' word (Jess uses the word, Jenn uses the word, they all are engaged in the word and basically is the entire premise of the book) and continuous sexual references.  The entire book was disappointing.
