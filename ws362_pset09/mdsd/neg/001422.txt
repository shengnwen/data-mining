Thank you, Ladies, for writing this book. You are exactly why I will never marry an American woman and why I have advised my nephews and younger brother the same.

I was exhausted halfway through the thing. While I had dealt with my divorce, this book has kindled in me something I would never have expected concerning my divorce from the woman whose very breath I loved. That something is nothing less than ecstatic joy at being free from being tied to an American woman.

Hard, driven, cold, lacking natural affection for their own children, often focused on proving they are as sexually active as a man would like to be, LOL, as if that is a good thing these women portray the American woman as totally devoid of affection or morals.

Don't worry ladies about committment, no one would want you for more than an evening's distraction anyway.
