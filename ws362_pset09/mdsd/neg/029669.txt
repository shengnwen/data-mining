a braindamaged baboon couldnt believe a word of this dross - and neither should you. the only reason hes gotten away with it for so long is because the people buying his crap wouldnt know one end of a horse from the other - morons attract morons after all.

ask the woman whos horse monty virtually destroyed running it into the ground chasing 'wild' mustangs. ask the woman who was nearly killed by her horse after monty 'trained' it. check the history records and see if you can find a skerrick of truth in any of montys books.

anyone who knows anything about horses finds monty laughable - buy his offensive rubbish and well all be laughing at you too.
