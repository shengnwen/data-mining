This book could have been written by any party affiliate decrying the state of the media in favor for the other party.We all know about the use of statistics and anecdotal evidence and the authors hate-mongering against Conservatives leads little credibility to use of such devices.
If you're a Democratic (or someone who writes reviews and says I'm a Conservative, but...) this book is going to help you account for the tremendous beatings you've taken in the polls and your increasing loss of popularity across the nation. If you're a Republican you're going to see it as another whine-and-moan fest of democrats trying to explain, once again, how they are victims.The author is a partisan who generates diviseness between parties so he can gin up book sales.

In both cases, you know exactly what you are getting
