I read the enthusiatic reviews before buying this cookbook.  I was disappointed.  First of all, the recipes are very difficult and time-consuming. It would help to have a staff of kitchen help to do all the required prep. Secondly, the presentation is lacking. But the worst problem of all is the exotic ingredients called for.  It seems that every other recipe requires "kombu" which is apparently some kind of seaweed.  I searched high and low and checked out every oriental market in town, to no avail.  Nobody knew what I was talking about!  I still don't know what kombu is.  Similarly, many other ingredients are generally unavailable.  Maybe these things would be easier to find on the West Coast where there is a large Asian population, but you just can't get them in Texas.

All that said, I did have some very delicious results on the "Acorn Squash stuffed with sweet rice."  I only had to make a few substitutions..
