Don't be fooled from the good reviews this book has gotten. this book is the WRONG choice for anyone willing to LEARN about web services in Java. It is merely a boring, dry, wordy, repetive, confusing (and confused) compilation of web-services related topics.
The authours might be good programmers maybe, but as they are clearly very poor technical authors.. their writing style is boring, excessively wordy and abstruse.
Not clear and concise enough to be useful as a reference and absolutely terrible as a tutorial. 
The preface tells how the idea of writing this book came form one of the authors who, sitting in a pub with the others was the the only one who wasn't drinking. I have some advice for this guy: start drinking
