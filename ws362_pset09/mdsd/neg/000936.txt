Once again Drizzt runs through impossible obstacles in invincibility mode.  I've read many of Salvatores works and it's just more of the same.  He keeps creating new stories for his bread and butter character which have grown so stale that were at one time creative nd suspenseful.  Drizzt always comes out on top.  Wulfgar is always torn between the same emotions that he only knows how to deal with in his barbarian rage. If this is your first venture into Salvatore's world you may enjoy it.  But long time readers are likely to be bored with the same old same old.  Read War of the spider queen book one instead.  It's actually versatile, creative, and multidimensional; what a good fantasy book should be. Note:  I am referring to the entire trilogy no just book 3.
