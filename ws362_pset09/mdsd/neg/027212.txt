Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL
and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN
STANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I just
heard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller
about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to
solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . I cared little about any of the
characters, and there were far too many subplots floating around
for my taste . . . the ending also didn't do much for me, as it brought
too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly,
I did not particularly "buy" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn't 
all that believable.
