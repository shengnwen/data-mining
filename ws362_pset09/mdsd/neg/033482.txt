Who would want to &quot;work a room&quot;?  Someone trying to sell something, maybe?  If you're not selling anything overtly, this book will not be of interest.  I say overtly because, as someone once pointed out, we're all selling something, but we need not do so overtly or manifestly.  But by our behavior.  Actions and words and all.  This book, and others like it, all have us looking outward for gratification, basically from other people, people &quot;in the room.&quot;  &quot;In the room&quot; can be a metaphor for the &quot;in crowd.&quot;  Do you want in with the in crowd?  Maybe you'll learn some tools from this book.  Then again, you might do better looking inward at yourself.  Listen to one of the great modern inward-seekers, Vernon Howard (excuse the gender specificity, it's an old book): &quot;A man owes nothing to any other human being on earth except to be himself, but since few see this, most men stagger under the burdensome debt of artificial behavior.  It is a tragic illusion that we can do anything for others before we have done something for ourselves.&quot;  The writer of &quot;How to work a room&quot; is essentially focusing on how to improve your artificial behavior.
