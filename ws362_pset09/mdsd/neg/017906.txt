This is simply the worst Phantom fiction ever written. First, it is poorly written. It feels to me like a trashy romance novel...and it is based on the not so well done POTO movie. It is a waste of money, the plot is awful.  And Erik's astounding brilliance disappears and he turns into an overdone and unbelievable Scottish man.  As far as the author's choice of "Phantom's" to base her character on...Gerard Butler? Not so much, Gerard was a decent Phantom, but certainly not good enough to truly embody what Erik is all about and he certainly does not deserve a book dedicated to him and his half of a performance he gave in the movie.  Don't waste your time with this book, folks...this has to be the worst Phantom Fiction, ever
