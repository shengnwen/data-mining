Do any of you positive reviewer even know that "Dr." Breggin doesn't even see patients anymore? That in nearly 2 years all he has done has traveled the country to testify in courts against psychiatrists? That is, in states which haven't yet discredited him for being biased and unscientific. I find it amazing that a man who hasn't treated a psychiatrist patient in years can write a book so skewed and wrong that it can endanged the public and still be published. What bothers me more is that people think he's correct. Modern medicine does not know the reason that the pancreas produces less insulin than normal, they only know that it does, so maybe diabetics should stop taking insulin and try to figure out if they were raised improperly by their mothers. Sound crazy? Of course, but this is the message that he's advocating. He should be ashamed of himself. He is not a real doctor and should return his diploma. Edit: 12/21/05---take about misunderstanding...Karellen's comments above are typical of those attacking something they know little about, making me wonder if Karellen believes in aliens like Tom Cruise. I said nothing about when the book was written and that is irrelevant to the point of the review which is that Breggin's opinions are so biased that he has been discredited by state courts in this country. I was trying to avoid posting websites, but since you posted one I'll post one too: http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/breggin.htm
