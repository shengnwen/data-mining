This book left me very unsatisfied.  Most reviewers here hail the book as a "classic" and magnificent thriller, and many seem to feel that since Ambler is the "father of the modern spy thriller" they are duty-bound to beatify this work.  I'll take a modern spy author any day.  True, the plot moves steadily forward, the characters are fascinating and well-drawn, and the descriptions of pre-war Central Europe are delicious.  But the book seems to move like a train -- you get on, you look out the window at the passing landscape, and then you get off.  There was little if any excitement; the suspense was tepid; the plot  turned on convenient contrivances aimed only at enabling the author to keep the book moving.  The ending, to me, was naive and left me saying:  "Is that all there is???"  Like I say, in the face of all the rave reviews, I must be missing something
