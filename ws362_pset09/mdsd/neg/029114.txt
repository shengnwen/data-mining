Yes, God indeed is the God of second chances.  Yes, he forgives, redeems and restores.  We all make bad choices.  We all make mistakes.  No one can cast stones.  However, when the adulteress was forgiven by Jesus he said "go and sin no more".  I would find more credibility in this story if Sandi Patty had either reconciled with her husband and found a way to work through the problems she was having in her first marriage.  What I'm confused about is that Sandi Patty married the man she had the affair with....and he is just as guilty as she is.  In the first part of the book there is a great act of contrition on her part and sugar coating the details of what took place.  But the second half of the book appears to me that she is glorifying her actions by continually throwing her "new found happiness" in our face.  Isn't she still committing adultery??  Indeed, the message this book seems to bring out is even though we sin and make mistakes and hurt people, God does forgive and provide restoration by giving you happiness with the one you caused the hurt with!  I'm very confused and if Satan is the author of lies and the author of confusion, then I pray I am enlightened by someone who has read this book and can offer another perspective.  Because it seems Sandy Patty's sin didn't matter anyhow because she's living a golden life with the object of her sin.  I'm very confused......because I'm getting mixed messages..one of which is "even though adultery is wrong and you hurt people, once you confess, its o.k. to marry the person you had the affair with and live happily ever after".
