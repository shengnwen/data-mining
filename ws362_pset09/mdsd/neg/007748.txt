I love books like this, if they are well done and at least on some level believable. Unfortunately, this one is neither. The author obviously has not bothered to research the period at all and most of the action frankly makes no sense. Is it possible the North and South would have joined together? I suppose so. In fact I commend Mr. Harrison for not portraying the Confederates as one dimensional, evil villains as so much other fiction does. That said, it does not seem plausible. Especially considering that they joined forces after the British ACCIDENTALY attacked the South. The most powerful Navy in the world can't tell Mississippi from an island? Apparently in Harrison's world the British are all buffoons and the unbreakable Union could defeat anyone simply because they are American. Overall, the book is a disappointment. I give it 1.5 stars, mainly for the idea
