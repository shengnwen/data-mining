This is, without a doubt, the worst commercially published novel I have ever read. The characters are wooden, the writing is stilted. The action flails around, going nowhere for long stretches.                                              Example of the bad writing: The narrator's voice in the  novel (third person omniscient) tells us about one of the characters, that  she was &quot;fourteen, going on twenty.&quot; Now mind you, I don't mean  that a character said that in dialogue. The NARRATION said that. Using  hackneyed cliche's like that is what I call bad writing. I can't believe  that this book is still in print and was actually made into a movie! Spare  yourself
