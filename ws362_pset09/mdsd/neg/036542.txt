The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)

The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.

I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish
