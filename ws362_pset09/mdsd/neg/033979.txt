Criss Cross, by Lynne Rae Perkins is a fantastic book. NOT!!!!!!!!!!! This book had way too many things going on at once, I just couldn't keep up. There's Hector, Debbie, Rowanne, Dan , Meadow, Patty and Lenny. They expect you to know who they're talking about in the beginning of every chapter. It goes from making a wish to playing a guitar at the bottom of a church. I feel this story had no plot whatsoever. Even after the first 150 pages, I could not find the meaning of the book. It was boring.I thought the author could have left out alot of extra meaningless things to make the book more interesting and shorter instead of just adding and adding and adding all of this stuff that's not helping you understand. I would rather watch grass grow than read this book.Seriously, I almost fell asleep reading. Basically, I think this book needed some stronger power scattered around. You know, BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! I would not recommend this book to people who enjoy adventures and who read for fun, it would just be a waste of your time
