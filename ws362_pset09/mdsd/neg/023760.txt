This book is proof that anyone can say anything and get it published.  The sad thing about this is that many women are going to take this to heart. It is a book obviously full of anger. It is also full of errors. An epidemiologist should have better data. It is apparent that this MAN has spent very little time in Labor and delivery and if he says he has, he did not understand what was happening around him. I don't see how any physician (he's a pediatrician), with any medical training, even outside one's own specialty can make such huge errors and errorneous conclusions. He is also an epidemiologist which tells me he's spent his life treating numbers and NOT patients.  This guy has NO insight into women's health care.I think the key word here is HE.  Perhaps somewhere in time what he says may have been true, but the obstetrician described by Mr. Wagner is a dinosaur.  Over 50% of residents in Ob-Gyn are now women. Women who would consider reading this should ask, do you really care what a man has to say about women's healthcare
