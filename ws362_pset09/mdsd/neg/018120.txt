I've read every book Catherine Coulter has ever written, but to be honest, what started out as a series of great FBI crime novels, has turned into so much phooey! If she writes one more book with the Tuttles and their talent for "mass hypnosis", I will hurl. And the two main characters in this book, well, I don't think they could be more docile and boring. I think Savach and Sherlock should have been retired after the pitiful excuse for a novel that was Ms. Coulter's last book. Come on!!! Mass Hypnosis??? It's an insult to the reader's intelligence
