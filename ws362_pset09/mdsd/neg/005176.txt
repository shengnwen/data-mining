I was expecting much more out of this 2 volume set. The books are full of mistakes, especially in formulas. If you plan on purchasing these books, make sure to download and print out the errata as well. It could save many headaches in trying to understand formulas that don't agree with the accompanying explanation. I don't doubt that Glassner is a very intelligent man, but his descriptions are somewhat dense and difficult to decypher sometimes. My recommendation: get an ACM SIGGRAPH membership to get access to many of the papers in this field and get the algorithms straight from the source
