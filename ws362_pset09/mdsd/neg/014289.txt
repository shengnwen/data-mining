Let me first say that I have no problem with the principal themes of this book: that there are extreme subtleties that operate in our lives; that the world is more than we can see; that a force -- whether one calls it god or anything else -- is operative in the world. i think there are many books that explore these profund ideas. But Dr. Schwartz's book was extremely disappointing in its execution of these ideas. By the end of the book I had the feeling that he had dictated this book and, because he needed the book to be certain length, gave the same name to different chapters that essentially covered the same material. I found Dean Radin's "Entangled Minds" a much more rigorous exploration of some of the subtleties that affect our lives. I have not read any of Dr. Schwartz's other books; but I have often noticed that, sometimes, an author has exhausted the limits of his/her explanation of a particular topic but still squeezes out a book from a much smaller pool of information. In the instance of this book, Dr. Schwartz should have exercised, perhaps, a bit more discipline and either not written this book or made it shorter. One final point: the name of this book is incredibly misleading. The "experiments" listed inside are highly non-rigourous thought experiments; I mean, so thin as to make me believe that Dr. Schwartz actually undercuts his arguments if those are the best positions he can muster
