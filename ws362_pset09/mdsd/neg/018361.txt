I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.

It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.

The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic
