I, Jedi is amazing. Amazingly BORING! 

You've got a first person narrator, which in the all-action-little-depth conceit of the SW novels is a Really Bad Idea. And this isn't even a deep Star Wars charecter. He loves his wife, he tries hard at school, he Never Ever does something he knows is wrong. 

The plot slouches along, with narrator-Jedi on a quest to find his wife who doesn't even really get kidnapped proper, just sorta misplaced and sleepy. He then farts around the Jedi Academy for a while (despite not being in the Jedi Academy books) because: hey! wouldn't it be easier to find her if I was a Jedi? This is the central conflict of the novel, a challenge that should be familiar to anyone who played Super Mario Brothers.  

Eventually, he goes off to find whatever it was he was looking for, and discovers a whole new plot conflict about 150 pages from the end that has no relationship with the previous anything. So, basicly you're slugging through a miserable 400-page diary to get to an OK novella, which then ends abruptly. After all the excess chaff you put up with, it doesn't even tie up loose ends or explore the few interesting ideas introduced in the last 20 pages.

I honestly don't remember if he saved the princess, but I assume he did, because if he didn't... that would be awesome. In the end, it didn't really matter. This was sooooo bad. I can't believe how bad it was. So BAD! BAAAAD!
