Dr Sears has distorted his description of the okinawa diet in his book.

It's true that they eat fish and soy, but they only eat 100-300g of fish per day, practically no meat.  They eat soy, small to moderate amounts of fruit and heaps of vegetables - so far so good.  But he forgets to mention that they eat between 7-13 serves of whole grain products such as rice and noodles, and large amounts of imo (sweet potato).  Thus their diet is actually a wholefoods higher carb 55-80%, lower protein(10-20%), low fat (10-25%) diet !!  This is obviously not a zone diet.

He left out the bit about the grains and sweet potato to fit his own philosophy, this is fundamentally dishonest.

If you wish to know more about the real Okinawa diet, read "The Okinawa Way"  or "The Okinawa Diet" by Bradley Willcox (Md).  Bradley Wilson has actually been to Okinawa personally.  It is interesting to not that in the notes at the back of the book, Dr Wilcox distances himself from the zone and states categorically that the Okinawa diet is NOT the zone diet because it is C55% P20%F25%.  I am sure that Bradley Wilcox is horrified that his research has been distorted by the dishonesty of Dr Sears
