This book is a poisonous but convincingly well written attack on divorce.  It's conclusions --- that divorce pretty much always destroys the children --- kept me in a bad marriage many years longer than necessary, and it's conclusions are flawed.

First of all, this is a very small study of people who volunteered to be included, so the families under consideration are far from representative of the population as a whole. (The participants were offered free counseling, so you could argue that Dr. Wallerstein was selecting for the least functional divorces.) Moreover, there's no control group, so it's unclear which of the problems that Wallerstein discusses are actually caused by the divorce and which or are commonplace in society as a whole. (Other studies point to the latter.) She simply assumes that everything bad was caused by the divorce.

This book, however, is an effective indictment of the too-common arrangement, where the mother gets the kids and the father is banished to a four-day-a-month visiting schedule---an arrangement that's almost guaranteed to be bad for the kids. Most of the divorces she discusses work that way. There are other alternatives, however, that are much less destructive, and Wallerstein's book discusses none of these.

I strongly recommend that you read Mavis Heatherington's "For Better or For Worse: Divorce Reconsidered" and Constance Ahrons' "The Good Divorce: Keeping Your Family Together When Your Marriage Comes Apart," either instead of, or at least as a complement to Wallerstein's book. These books are based on much larger studies, done properly in the sense of looking at a large, randomly selected, group of subjects with control groups in place. They come to very different conclusions than Wallerstein
