I was disappointed with this product.  The format is convenient, but the walks they recommend aren't real intersting.  Most of the walks are very short (usually only a few blocks) and are mostly in the touristy edges of the city.  I much prefer "Stairway Walks in San Francisco" which has longer walks (a few miles each) and focuses more on the more diverse interior of the city
