This book came highly recommended so I was looking forward to it but ended up very disapointed.  First off, this is a very thin, large font, tons of white space excuse for a book - there is very little to it and it isn't worth 5 bucks much less the list price of 20.  The book is fluffy, trite and idealistic at best.  The entire gist of the book is covered here in the Amazon description and all the value is there as well - no need to buy the book.  Skip this one
