The author uses the same tactics he denigrates when used by others. For instance, in the section on Japan, he has to admit that gun crime is the lowest in the industrialized world, mostly affecting intra-ciminal violence. To mitigate that success, Poe describes the fuedal lord who took away swords in the 16th century and how the police are still the arrogant samurai, as if that's relevant to this modern subject.

Citing a few successful-gun-defense-kills/failure-to-have-a-gun stories always gets the pro-gun crowd excited. No different than when the anti-gun extremists cite their innocent bystander shootings. The absence of large number statistics in this book relegates it to the genre of hype, mostly. The fact is that the US has the highest gun violence is because of the easy access to our huge inventory of firearms. The author never once mentions that felons get many handguns that are stolen from law-abiding suburban homes.

The author's myths are just that, real statistics and the law of large numbers prove Poe wrong. In 2003, there were 163 justifiable private citizen homicides with handguns, but 7701 handgun homicides in total. (See FBI Uniform Crime Report www.fbi.gov/ucr/03cius.htm)

I don't understand why the book has size 24 bold letters for a hundred paragraph headings, maybe it's a sign of statistical weakness. Still, the author cites many sources that could be used for pro-gun research, I gave it two stars for effort.
