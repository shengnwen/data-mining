She has too much of her own opinion which can really get in the way of all the information and it worries me that she left all sources out that are not somewhat christian. She even goes as far as to call carl jung and idiot as if she has more knowledge and information on anything. This book has a lot of infromation but I found it hard to read with all the christian goobly gook getting in the way. There are other books on the subject with just as much information
