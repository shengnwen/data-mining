This book, and the IFG group in general, do not offer an alternative to capitalist globalisation, which is the real problem, not solely globalisation.  While subsidiarity, or localisation, is an important concept that should be considered and implented in any alternative to capitalism, this book misses the point that capitalism is the problem.  

This book operates on the outmoded and illusionary idea that Adam Smith's capitalism, local capitalism, can be achieved and will provide an opporunity for fairness and equality.  Capitalism can never be this way, as it is by nature expansive and anti-local.

This book leaves out the perspectives of many concerned social actors such as Indigenous people and women.  It provides the view of a very narrow selection of the anti-globalisation movement.

This book is dangerous and subversive in that it appears to offer a viable alternative to the exploitation of the current economic world order, and so activists will work toward this reform of capitalism, and in the end prolong suffering and exploitation.
The only way is to end capitalism and explore alternatives that are noncapitalist(and perhaps anti-globalisation as well) in nature.

SMASH CAPITALISM
