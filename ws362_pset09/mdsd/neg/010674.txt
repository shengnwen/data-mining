I was somehow under the impression that this book might be good for vegetarians and vegans.  Whoops!  Almost every page details how much the couple loves various animal-derived items.  Yes, they recommend fresh fruits and veggies, and yes, they point out in the vegetarian chapter (entitled "Where's the Beef") that cholesterol, found only in animal products, can contribute to clogged arteries and maybe ED, but that weak message is overshadowed by veg-hostile recipes in almost every other chapter, especially the one that precedes the veg chapter, entitled "Caveman's Delight."  Sigh.  And Ellen, who is a dietitian, loses credibility when she uses the terms pesco-vegetarian and pollo-vegetarian.  For the record, if one eats fish and/or chicken, s/he is NOT a vegetarian of any type.  And while the veg chapter mentions fruitarianism, raw foodism has completely passed them over.

I guess I'm disappointed more than anything else.  I was hoping for recipes to cook for my boyfriend and me.  I will say I like the idea of cooking together (which sadly is not practical if you have a tiny kitchen) and truly enjoying the food you eat, but that's somewhat common knowledge.  And checking someone's food preferences before cooking for them is also common sense
