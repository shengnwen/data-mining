For me, this encyclopedia has a  misleading title in that most of the entries deal with vampires or vampire-like creatures. There is some material on werewolves & other shapeshifters and skinwalkers, but I found myself wondering where those 'Other Monsters' were. The author dedicated several pages to the 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' television series and the author Anne Rice while only giving a nod to classics such as 'Carmilla' and not even a mention of the 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' - and the only mention of Dr. Frankenstein or his monster is an entry for 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman'. There are also entries for Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley - people who may have been involved in the occult but who were hardly monsters. Noticeably absent, especially in the presence of vampire and monster -portraying actors, is Vincent Price. Overall, I can only recommend this book in good conscience if you're a vampire fan. Otherwise, it will only disappoint
