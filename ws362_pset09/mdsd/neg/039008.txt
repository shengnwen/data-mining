The theme is interesting enough - an American inmate of a British lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of OED.  Unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme.  As some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the "superior" Victorian English kind
