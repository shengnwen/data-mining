This book is not good for the beginning yoga guru.  You need a &quot;speak and sound&quot; machine for all the yoga jargon in the book--otherwise you get caught up in the hard-to-pronounce names and words.  Every couple of chapters there would be some insightful information to help you along &quot;your Quest&quot;, but the final chapters tell you that you didn't need the book in the first place
