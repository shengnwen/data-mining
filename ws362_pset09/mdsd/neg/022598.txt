Everyone else seems to adore this book so I guess I have lost my sense of humor because I just don't like this particular version-- at least not for the 3 and under set.  

My first objection stems from the use of bug spray by the 'old lady' to get rid of the fly.  She is shown sitting on a couch surrounded by cans of depleted insecticide while spraying more in her mouth.  Rather than find this funny, it scared me to think that some child might get a notion to copy this activity.  

Then second is my objection to boiling a cat and chasing a dog with the same intent.  Now most children wouldn't do this so that's not a problem but I still don't like the idea of introducing this weird concept to my little boy.  (My son asked me if we needed to keep our cat inside and safe from the neighbors - hmmm.)

The funny part of all of this is that I don't mind when the old lady just pops the animals down her throat.  Go figure.  In any case, Nadine Westcott is a good story teller and her artwork is clever, but I still have to give this book two stars because of the above reservations.
