While some of the evidence could be considered compeling if properly presented, it holds little water in the "I Hate Clinton" context.

I am sure Cashill learned more about evidence while earning his Phd at Purdue.  Apparently WND has focused the fear mongering and hate side of Cashill and blinded him to "good" research.  His recent book "hoodwinked" though outs his haterd for academia, so maybe he did not learn much in West Lafayette, just honed his dislikes.

But this wonderful (puke, gag) piece of work has found its place into Amazon's top 20,000..............  woooohooooo, go jack.

You should check out his doctorile thesis on capitalism and fictional heros, another steller work............  you go jack, jack for dog catcher.............  maybe he can round up farah, coulter, "oxycontin" rash and oreally, agents of the dark side.......  the anti-truth tellers....
