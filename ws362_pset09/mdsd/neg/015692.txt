Although the book Sweet Whispers, Brother Rush was extremely well written and encompassed many wonderful aspects of fantasy writing; I question the quality of the content for young readers. The book touches on many sensitive issues such as child abuse, disease, drug use, sex and developmental issues; which leads me to wonder what age group this book was primarily written for. I do not feel that this book was allowed to evolve into a traditional fantasy theme book because of the focus of the content of Tree's past.

For me personally, reading this book with the knowledge of it being written for a young reader I couldn't get past the topics of the book to really enjoy the fantasy aspects. Although I do think the story showcases' human nature and the struggle between perseverance in the face of obstacles and personal responsibility, I do no think that the content of the book was not worthwhile for young readers. Overall I think Sweet Whispers, Brother Rush was well written and portrayed some common themes found in fantasy books; however the content was lacking for a young reader and this in turn makes me not warmhearted towards the book
