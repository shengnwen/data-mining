I actually belong to the Mercedes Club - who had a lot to do with the contents of this book - and I was very disappointed. I do have an older Mercedes (1969), and I do my own work, and practically nothing in this book was helpful. There are some common problems that are covered, like replacing the rear sub-frame mounts on the swing-axle rear ends, or how to fix the climate control sliders that often break on older models, but this is all info that's available on the internet for free - with better photos! The factory shop manuals are very expensive, but if you're looking for a way to fix a specific problem on your specific model - they're the way to go. One other option is to buy "Glenn's Mercedes Repair" also available on Amazon (I did, and I love it) - for an older Mercedes reference, it's the best $13.99 you'll ever spend, and it was better illustrated and photographed than the Haynes manuals to boot
