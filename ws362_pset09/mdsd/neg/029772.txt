I keep running into Booksellers, Book Collectors saying "But McBride's Books Say". Please take all and any information with a grain of salt, when some of the information are just what others are saying. There are mistakes with all EXPERTS, remember the Earth is round not flat. Do research of your own, most(99.5%) of the correct information is available for free, the rest is theory. Keep that in mind
