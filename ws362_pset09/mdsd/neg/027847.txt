     I purchased this book because the premise intrigued me. You can imagine my letdown as I got a few chapters into it. Eleven Karens is as much a "story" as Busty Cops 3 is a "movie;" the book reads like a late night cinemax movie: not enough story to      Each chapter tells of the author's sexual encounter with yet another beautiful woman, one of whom lives in the middle of Africa (yet, inexplicably is still named "karen," which I can't imagine is a very popular name for Africans in a country where the official language is french). The differeng girls (karens) all are described as being very attractive, yet none have anything of interest to say or do, their looks are their sole purpose for being in the story. 
keep you interested, and not enough sex to qualify it as a porn either. 
     Most disappointingly, perhaps, is the book's lack of purpose. I can live with the pretentious footnotes inserted onto every other page (yes, footnotes, the purpose of which is to show the reader how cultured the narrator is, as he loves making obscure reverences for little or no reason), and the abbreviated sense of reality, however I can not put up with the lack of meaning to the relationshps. 
     Eleven Karens reads like the product of an overactive imagination of a sixth grader who happens to be locked up in a room with only a globe and a barbie doll, this is the story of a globe trotting man-whore who sleeps with boring women, and just so happens to be a boring guy himself.
     I bought an autographed copy of this book for $2.99, and I still got ripped off.
