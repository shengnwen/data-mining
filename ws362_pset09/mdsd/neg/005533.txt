Like others, I picked this book up after reading several in the No. 1 Ladies...series.  No comparison.

The story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book.  I just don't understand the rest of this book.  Isabel never even asked the key question to the whole "mystery" until it slapped her in her silly face.  The mystery for me is - what is the Sunday Philosophy Club, and what in the world does it have to do with this book?

I'm sorry I spent the time on this - there are important books to be read
