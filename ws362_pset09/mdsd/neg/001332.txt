now mabye this is not fair because i do not usually like realistic books but this book was boring. I hade to read this book for school and I was bored. It's about a young boy named Fu growing up and having a hard life in  China. I would not recomend this book unless really like realistic books  and ones that are slow. Did I mention the chapters were long
