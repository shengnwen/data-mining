I suppose the people who loved the artwork in this book also thought that Martin was serious when he swore on everything that was holy that his series would not go beyond 3 titles.  Now, as we await book 4, we at least have many side-line products to keep us busy.  This book of card game art should not be one of those diversions.  A few of the images were truly good, but for the most part, seriously lacking.  I'm just as rabid a fan as the next reviewer of this product, but I am also honest, and won't label something extraordinary just because someone's name is on it...  And while the quality of writing in the series itself has not suffered so far, it concerns me that this series now seems to be marketed more as "The Wheel of Time and Money - Part 2" than the great work of modern literature that it is..
