I purchased this book to learn HOW TO ATTACH CLASPS. Well, there are NO PICTURES to go along with the step by step instructions. I am a total NOVICE at this, and with all the great reviews I figured this would be the ONE BOOK to get ... no. I still have no idea how to modify a necklace on a leather cord to attach a clasp. If anyone can offer any help, I would appreciate it. But I would not buy this book if you don't know how to attach clasps
