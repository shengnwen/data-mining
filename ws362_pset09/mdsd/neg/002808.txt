I am a big fan of Michael Connelley's.  He usually writes about very bright police officers.   I do not know why he wandered so far away from familiar territory, but he has managed to create a character -- Henry Pierce -- who may be a genius, but is also unbelievably stupid.   I cannot accept the reasons that he tries to learn about a missing escort simply because he was given her former phone number.   He not only puts his life at risk but his entire company and the careers of his associates.  I was so disappointed in Henry Pierce that I began to side with those who wanted to arrest him or kill him.   That might have been the most satisfying ending.   I won't give up on Michael Connelley -- books he wrote since Chasing the Dime were better, including one that moved into the courtroom.   However, I will no longer assume that his name on the dustjacket insures a great read.
