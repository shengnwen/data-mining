The title of this book should be an alert as how one could class the oratory work of Abraham Lincoln with Bill Clinton is beyond what a reasonable mind could accept. It is like having Albert Einstein and then including Daffy Duck.
For that reason, I wonder of the agenda and the claim that the author knows more than anyone about these speeches and how he can pass over the oratory of the Comanche, Cheyenne and Kiowa at the Medicine Lodge treaty or for that matter neglect the moving speeches of General Patton only to include Betty Friedan who history has already passed over like most to the recent "great" speeches included here.
There is just too much a mix of extraordinary with the mundane which appears like a political spin to try and make people like Bill Clinton appear great by sticking him in with Lincoln. How one can compare the destruction of a people in the words of Chief Joseph to what some of these speeches entail is pure rhetoric.
One would do better to seek out the people who made the speeches in biographies and autobiographies than to invest in this rendered work, but if you enjoy rolling your eyes in how the compiler includes paid speech writers for leaders with people like Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Chief Joseph.....then you probably will enjoy this book.
