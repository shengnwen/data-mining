The title of this book is deceptive.  The author's major RV experience was in driving an 18' motorhome and she definately feels that anything larger is more like staying at home than camping.  If you are interested in RV related material, this book is not for you.  If you want a so so travelogue with minimal information about where to park your RV, you might like the book.  The author obviously has no experience in using RVs in urban environments--something than most owners of large RVs do on a routine basis.  I think the title is highly misleading
