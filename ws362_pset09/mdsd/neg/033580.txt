I work in the construction industry as a secretary and I bought the Construction Dictionary for my desk so I could look up some of the more obscure words when I type letters and proposals.  This dicitionary is  really easy to read but the words are too basic.  It would be a good  dictionary for someone new to the business but if you need a more diverse  set of words this is not the dictionary for you.  It's priced right for the  beginner
