I have been around football my entire life, being that my dad is a coach, and has been for 18 years. I was amazed to read the perspective of this player who did not live up to &quot;his&quot; potential. He sounds like a bitter young man. Obviously he had more confidence in himself, than coaches who have been in the game for much longer than he has even been alive. Sometimes players don't understand the processing that coaches go through to put together a game plan, and then to carry it out. Yes, it is unfortunate that he had to have four coaches throughout his career, but at least he had the oppurtunity to play the game. There are many other young men who would have loved to at least get to play at the University of Oklahoma, or anywere else. So sometimes people should be greatful for their oppurtunities
