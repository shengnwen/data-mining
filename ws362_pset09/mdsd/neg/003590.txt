Nothing about the title is accurate.  The recipes are far too large for a 1 1/2 quart slow cooker - one of them, the Brunswick Stew (which was dreadful, by the way just barely fit in my 3 quart slow cooker.

The recipes make no effort to reduce fat, calories, carbs, or sodium - especially sodium, since nearly all of them use canned food as the main ingredients, and are therefore loaded with sodium.  A few of the dessert recipes do incorporate sugar substitutes - but a typical dessert recipe instructs you, basically, to use half a box of cake mix along with half the ingredients the mix calls for anyway.  Ever tried to use half a box of cake mix?  It's not easy.

In fact, most of the recipes are not cooked in the usual sense at all:  they use already cooked ingredients and employ the crock pot to heat them slowly.

The one minor virtue of the book is that you can read the recipes and then draw some conclusions about how to adapt regular recipes for the crock pot - but that is true about any crock pot cookbook.

I am sorry I bought it and recommend against your buying it
