Mr. Patterson is a bourgeois who understands freedom from a typical husbandman's perspective. What he doesn't see is the perspective of nomads, gypsies, wandering artists, etc., i.e. the moving crowd. He did not look at them, and by this missed the chance to write about a commitment to freedom much deeper and older than the attempts of the people bound to their soil or community. Also, he neglects the Jewish heritage of Christianity and its fight for freedom. Obviously he has not read Michael Walzer's &quot;Exodus and Revolution&quot;. If he had, he would have known that the first successful attempt to become free from slavery did not happen in Greece but in the desert between Egypt and Palestine. It was not Greek rhetoric about freedom but the Exodus story that gave spiritual power to the civil rights movement
