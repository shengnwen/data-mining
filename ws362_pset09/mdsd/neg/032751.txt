I was disappointed in this book, had I not been on a coast-coast flight I would not have finished it.  The author could not keep track of whether his characters had their footwear on or off, among other problems.  The two main characters could not between them fight their way out of a wet paper bag if decision making were part of the process.  Watching them do stuipid things repeatedly for the sake of the plot became very trying.

It's too bad, the universe is interesting.
