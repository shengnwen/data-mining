Seeing other reviews of this book left me feeling slightly confussed. Personally, I found it horrible. It was full of stories that had been writen so long after the event, that it had lost all emotion tied to it. However, Sixteen has appeared on many " Greastest Teen Books..Ever!" lists, although might I add so did the WHOLE Princess diarys series, which lost them a bit of credability.  A compelation of , in my opinion, a little too-short, short stories, Sixteen just doesn't have any meat to it. I was required to read it over the summer, otherwise I would probably have quit less than halfway through. Don't waste ya money.If you must...check it out
