While I enjoy geology, it is not my profession. I am interested in expanding my knowledge but have no intention of becoming a geologist. I found this book so boring that I was unable to finish it. It reads very much like a textbook. It certianly contains a great deal of information, but it is related in such a dull fashion that it simply could not keep my interest. I was expecting something more along the lines of John McPhee who writes in an informative but entertaining manner.  This fits the first bill but not the second.
