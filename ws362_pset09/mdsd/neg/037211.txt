This is for reviewer CHRISTOPHER FUNG. If you found Argulles' work to be a load of mallarky, you might find an alternate study of the Mayan Calendar interesting. Swedish Mayanist/authro Carl Johan Calleman has written a book on the subject and he is in strong disagreement with Argulles' conjectures (and this whole Dreamspell business). He even sets a completely different date for the end of the Mayan Calendar (a year earlier). Hope you find this info useful
