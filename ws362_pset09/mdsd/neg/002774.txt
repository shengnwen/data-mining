I've been a fan of Tom Wolfe's work, but this was terrible. The characters were all so conceited, poorly developed, and annoying that I couldn't bring myself to care what happened to them. It was clear the novel was written by someone who doesn't understand what college kids are like. It seems like Wolfe got some "insight" from other people and then tried to force that into just about every line of the novel. The whole novel felt forced and was almost painful to read.
