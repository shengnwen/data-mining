I am an engineering student and currently in differential equations.  I bought this solutions manual to accompany the text book (which I also strongly don't recommend) and wish I had returned it to the bookstore in time.  Unforntuately, I am stuck with it now.  This solutions manual does not explain anything thoroughly.  Any questions with problems that I have, or anyone else in my class for that matter, are almost always skipped over as if the answer to the question is blatantly obvious.  You'll probably have much better luck researching the answers to your questions on the internet or just asking your professor to explain it, because this solutions manual is next to no help at all
