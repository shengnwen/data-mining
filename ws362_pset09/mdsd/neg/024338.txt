I bought this anthology based on the two positive reviews from other purchasers. Four stars seemed like a pretty good recommendation. However, I received the book yesterday and was fairly disappointed. Many of the songs are quite poorly done, and all of them are much too simple. Big Yellow Taxi, for instance, has several chords that are clearly not correct and sound nothing like the &quot;real&quot; version. I thought Circle Game was the best rendition overall, but other than that, I wouldn't bother purchasing this. I have not bought any other Joni Mitchell book, but if this is the best out there, then I think I've just discovered a niche in the market....I'll be off writing my own, and accurate, version of these songs
