Being an avid admirer of Manet and of the paintings in which Victorine Meurent appeared, I was happy to see a book about her.  Finally, I would be able to learn something of her and her life!  I learned that she was a Lesbian and died in 1927 and not as a destitute alcoholic as written in some rather sketchy histories of her. but that is all I learned.  The book is actually more about the author and her trying to make peace with her past and her mother than anything else.  If you want to learn about Victorine, you must find another book.  If you want to know about Eunice Lipton, this is the book for you.  Also very few facts in the book; the author puts Victorine in some situations and conversations, but these are all imaginary.  Definitely would not recommend.  Author was self-indulgent and apparently not very concerned with her subject
