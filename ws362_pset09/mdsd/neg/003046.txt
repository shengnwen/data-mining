This book had some good concepts, but overall I was pretty disappointed by it.  It moves quickly from practical suggestions for identifying potential areas of ministry to over spiritualized strategic level warfare, which focuses more on the enemy than anything else.  The appendix (which takes up more than half the book!) has some helpful tables in it, but for the most part it wasn't very helpful
