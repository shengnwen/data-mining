I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y
