I was so eager to read this book. But I was so disappointed when I finally did read it.
I couuldnt even make it to the end of it. its so boring. and she keeps jumping from a story to another without knowing what is the real point of telling that story. its like you'are sitting with some talkative chatterbox who keeps on talking and talking till you lose it..
