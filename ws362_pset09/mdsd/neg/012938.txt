This book had a lot of extreme views.  Demoss generalizes constantly.  I felt she twisted scripture to explain her point of view.  I did gleam some good out of the book.  I am a fairly new Christian and I felt it was more harmful then good.  I felt it could give a Christain women a feeling there are only absolutes to God's way, that we are not individuals.  I felt it weighed me down more than lifted me up.  I had to go back to God's word and study because at times I felt the study was toxic.  I think Demoss is very biased and narrow minded.  I would especially not recommend it if you are a new Christian.  I also about group study I would only recommend it if you are with seasoned Christians who are willing to be objective about this book.
