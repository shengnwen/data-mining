The distinct impression I got from reading Moby-Dick is the complete and utter convoluted concept of the whole thing. It felt like I wrestling with Melville himself the entire time I was reading it. The first thing that put me off was the fact that huge pieces of the story were simply the author explaining things like an encyclopedia: what the different types of whales were, how to prep harpoons, the protocol for the officers to eat, and so on, and so on, and so on... What Melville could have said in one sentence-it seems-he said in ten pages. While it is true that there is a deeper literary meaning behind it, it's definitely covered up by the blatant symbolism that is thrown in the reader's face every page. What was told here could easily be told in a smaller format, as this book is loooong, and that fact is only amplified by the method in which it is told. Several times I found myself skipping pages just to see if anything interesting would happen in the near future. I suppose the best thing I could say about this book is that the chapters are short, so it makes it seem that it is going faster than it actually is
