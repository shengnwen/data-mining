   Whenever the New Yorker arrives the first thing I do is tear it open, check 
the table of contents to see if Adam Gopnik has anything in the issue, and 
then, if he does, turn the pages to get to his essay.  Why?  For the very 
same reason that I can watch the movie "Showgirls" over and over again, or
be riveted to Robert Goulet should I ever find him singing a song on television
(admittedly a rare, albeit treasured treat nowadays), or be unable to turn
the channel during a Donald Rumsfield press conference. For Gopnik is SUCH
a Man You Love to Hate, that it isn't remotely unfair to suggest that he has
become the J. R. Ewing of American Letters.  Reading a Gopnik essay--and 
this book proves it--is like watching Jerry Lewis singing "You'll Never Walk
Alone" at the end of the MDA Telethon.     
   
I treasured each and every word of his "From Paris to the Moon" collection,
because each and every word of it was just soooo lousy.  (If you want to read
A.G. at his worst, btw, read him writing about New York just after 9/11.  It's
a hoot.)  Back to the present, when "Children's Gate" came out, I snatched it
up, because I really, really wanted to hate it.  I saw, within five paragraphs, 
that I was not to be let down.  As a native New Yorker, I relish when writers 
who moved here write as if they were born and bred here and own the place.  
Alas, Gopnik writes about New York not like a genuine New Yorker, but like someone 
who writes for the New Yorker.  The man...is clueless.  The subject of every
Gopnik essay is not whatever the essay seems to be about, but is Gopnik himself;
this is a man who loves to write about how much he's read. 
Before you put this book in your cart, ask yourself this: Are you really
interested in reading the essays of a person who does nothing but read all day?

Can't wait for the next book!
