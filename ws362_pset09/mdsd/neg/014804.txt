I just read this short story and I didn't like it is just to hard to read and their is really nothing that makes you want to keep on reading this story.  It is verry (not my type).  I read better stories by better  authors.  A good author is Dean Koontz now he has good books and stories.   You would probably like Dean Koontz  more than this Edgar Allan.  Without  having to be confuse at any moment while your reading
