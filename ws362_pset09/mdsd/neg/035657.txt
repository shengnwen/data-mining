I have never read an Iris Johansen book that I didn't like...until this one. The characters were never developed and were unbelievable. Sophie is supposedly a genius researcher and a doctor. MacDuff is a Scottish laird who's background we never learn about. Two gorgeous killers who we're supposed to empathize with. The list goes on. 

I forced my way through the book, what a waste of time. I'll think twice before I read another one. Hopefully this was an anomoly
