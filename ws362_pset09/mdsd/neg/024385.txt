This tiny little book is all about presidents and one statesman whose contemporaries said they might be of African descent.  No documentation is presented, even though there are purportedly written depositions from people who knew people who said that these men had Negro ancestry.  I was really hoping for more substantial proof that at least one of these men could be proven to have African ancestry, but it was mostly bombastic propanganda.  No census records shown, no church records, no slave rolls, not even a newspaper clipping, just the assertion that such things exist.  Oh well, I will keep looking for answers elsewhere
