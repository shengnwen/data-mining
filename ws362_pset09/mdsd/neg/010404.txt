The audience for this book seems to be young couples who have not organized social functions.  The overriding emphasis is on style, flowers, colors, settings, the entertainment side, having fun, and there is nothing wrong with that.  I agree with the other commentators--far too much space is spent telling us to hire an expert to be in charge.  If you want advice on themes, flowers, and clothing styles, on what is the &quot;in&quot; thing, this is your book.  If you have an idea how to plan events and are looking for alternatives, choices, and simplicity, especially for those over forty, and there a lot of us,look elsewhere.  It certainly builds up expectations for a grand event, but with the national divorce rate over fifty per cent, there is an air of unreality and impossible expectations as well.  It closely resembles the three glossy publications for Washington, DC, promoting the commercial services to implement these plans.  The best part is too brief--the psychology of working with the families and the main players.  Also, union musicians cost more and are worth it if you are more interested in the quality of the music than in the experience for high schoolers
