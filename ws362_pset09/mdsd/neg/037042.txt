&quot;Time on the Cross&quot; is a very well written book. That is all it is! It uses information from small spacific areas of the south and generalizes it for all of the south. Just because it happens in one area of the south doesn't mean that it happens every where. People that read this book may think that they are getting a new look at the south but really they are getting a bunch of numbers that makes it look like the south was not that bad of a place. This book depicts people as rational people who always think things out. This book depicts the south as though the slaves were being treated well as far as eating, sleeping quarters, and medical care. This is a good book for showing how bad clieometrics can go wrong. I just hope people will not take this book to heart for if they do they will be very misinformed as to how the south was. Fogel and Engerman only use information from specific areas, such as New Orleans. They doen't take into consideration about the human nature of people. This book, if not explaned in detail could do some harm to the view of the south. This book does use statistics very well but it doesn't give the big pitcure. The only reason I would recomend this book is if someone wants to see a different way of writing or how data could creat different aproaches about historical events, good or bad
