 This would be a minor basilica in the architecture of the American novel, except for one small problem.

 Marilyn Monroe may have been a creation of an industry and a confused, naive destitute woman, but the supporting cast are no works of fiction. They were, and some-Miller, Dougherty, others-still are (as of Christmas 2004!) living humans, not fictional entities to be used as the author would have. Norma Jeane Mortenson, who was Marilyn Monroe in every way at the end, and Joe DiMaggio, Frank SInatra, and all the players in this penultimate drama-under the pseudonyms (Bucky, et al) or their real names (Whitey Snyder) were real humans and deserve to be treated as such. And Joyce Carol Oates is, however great a novelist, not fit to judge them. 

 If the story had replaced every single name with a fictionalized one, including those of the central being herself, I would have had more respect for Oates. However, as one of the younger people on the planet who belong to an exclusive club-I met the real Marilyn Monroe, talked with her, shook her hand, smelled her perfume (supposedly she wore Chanel #5, but I've never smelled anything like she did:wonderful!)  in New York when I was fourteen-I would like to speak for all of us, from her husbands and lovers to her adoring fans to those like myself who _weren't_ fans until we met her. 

 She deserves better; so do we!
