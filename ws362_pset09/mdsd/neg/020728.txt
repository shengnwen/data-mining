The fantastic arrogance of the title "THIS is Cuba" should let you know that the text of this traveler-cum-pseudo-anthropologist is going to be fairly insufferable.  For more nuanced (but still critical) travel diary sorts of things, look at "Cuba Diaries" (highly recommended) or even "Es Cuba."  This tract is a waste of time
