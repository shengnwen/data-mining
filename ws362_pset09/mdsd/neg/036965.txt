I have read about a dozen real estate and landlording books so far. Based on the title of this one, I expected some heavy hitting information about Property Management and Landlording. Instead, what I got was a general overview of all of the topics in the table of contents, but no really good in depth material about any of it. 

I also didn't like the fact that the first several chapters are about how to decide if you're cut out for this business. I was under the impression that anyone buying a book with this title would already own a property or at least be well under way.

Overall, this is a good SUPER newbie book, but if you've read even one other, don't bother
