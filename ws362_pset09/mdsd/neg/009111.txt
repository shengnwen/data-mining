This book is only masquerading as a textbook -- it is a propaganda tool for those who want to stick their heads in the sand and not talk honestly about contraception.  Check the index for yourself -- "birth control" and "contraception" are NOT EVEN LISTED.  The section on AIDS does NOT MENTION condom use.  It is appalling that in this day and age a textbook to be used in health class can leave out science, truth, and a well-rounded discussion of responsible use of contraceptives.  This book deserves far less than 1 star.
