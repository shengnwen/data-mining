I hadn't heard of the book or the author before I picked it.   I read its first few pages and 
Was hooked.  The main character, Cacciato [how do you pronounce this name?], decides to walk away from the Vietnam war and hike overland to Paris. His platoon follows him.
The book describes their adventures.  
The first quarter of the book contains some of the best combat narrative I have read, it describes the trauma, the randomness, the banality, the irritation of involuntarily living cheek-by-jowl with others.  This part for me flowed along. I was able to suspend disbelief about the fact that they were on a mission to track down one of their comrades who was walking into enemy territory. 
Without giving the story away, there was a point where they came into contact with the Vietnamese enemy, where I gave up entirely.  The fiction had become magic realism, there was no going back to credibility and I'm afraid I lost the plot.  
I did however persevere and finish, but I cannot recommend it based on my initial impressions.  The writing overall is excellent, the characters well-documented, but  I cannot follow when the plot doesn't have the pretence of credibility.   I would have liked to have liked this book more.
