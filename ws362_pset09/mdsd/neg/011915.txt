The book "Crank" has some good points: I liked the use of text layout in the shape of a cross when the character is praying, for example. However, the narrator's point of view is inauthentic. It does not sound like a teenage girl but a mother in many places in the story. It gets a little preachy due to how heavy-handed the messages is hammered home that meth is addictive. The portrayal of the Planned Parenthood clinic is completely wrong and feels like the author has an agenda, an ax to grind. I have worked with staff and volunteers at Planned Parenthood clinics, and the people who work there are very nice, non-judgemental people who really care about the women and girls they treat. They do not "recommend" abortion as the author says, but let you make up your own mind. This part of the book feels like a scare tactic, a polemic. The novel "Go Ask Alice" is much more authentic story about a girl and addiction. This  novel, like any, is just one person's opinion
