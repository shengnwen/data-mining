This book is really beautiful to look at. But the patterns are more confusing than they need to be and the flow is completely non-intuitive.  You have to keep looking on a different page for the visual and there's alot of "wrong side, right and left side, right" which could be explained MUCH more simply.  It's as if this book attempts to be more complicated than it is
