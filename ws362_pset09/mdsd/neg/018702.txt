After reading the other books from Two Plus Two publishing by Sklansky &amp; Malmuth, I was let down by this offering. I play both Stud 8/b and Omaha 8/b and I can't really say that this book helped me at all. Anyone who's logged any time at the tables knows the basics of live cards in Stud 8/b and drawing to the nuts in O8B. What I found especially irritating was the deceptive size of the book. Zee goes through the teaching sections and then says the EXACT same thing in the &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; section, giving the EXACT same answers. Considering how few good books there are on the subject of high-low poker, I thought surely an offering from Two Plus Two would be the definitive authority, but alas, buy this book and you'll be disappointed
