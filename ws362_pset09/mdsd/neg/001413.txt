It is possible to enjoy a move that is all action, without any plot or character development due to the fast pace, and the visual stimulation that a movie has.  A novel, however, is a different story.  In order to enjoy a novel there must be some sort of character depth and development that, sadly, this novel lacks completely.

This was one of the most boring books I have ever read, and I'm still not entirely sure why I read this total piece of garbage all the way to the end.  Before reading this novel numerous friends of mine told me how good an author Tom Clancy is, and I completely trusted their assessment, mostly due to the wide success he has had in the literary world.  However, if this is representative of his writing then perhaps my friends, and the general public as a whole, needs to figure out what good writing is!

In fact I'm not entirely sure if Tom Clancy actually wrote this book, because the writing credits are for Tom Clancy and Martin Greenberg.  Did this Greenberg guy write this garbage and then Tom Clancy put his name, as a brand, onto it?  If that is so, then Tom Clancy is really hurting himself by being associated with such refuse.

On the bright side the cover is pretty cool.  I like the picture a lot.  Additionally there is a lot of technical information about US and Chinese submarines in this novel.  If you are interested in the technical specs of submarines, however, I imagine that you would be better served reading a technical manual, or some sort of nonfiction book about subs.

If you like an insanely repetitive story with ZERO character development, then pick up this book, otherwise try anything else
