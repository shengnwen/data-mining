This book was painfully bad.  If you are tempted to buy it, I strongly suggest reading an excerpt from it, or flipping through a few pages at the library or a bookstore.  It's pretentious prose, with thin characters and a plot with very little to recommend it.  Interested in the Hoover Dam?  He gets to it about two hundred pages in.  If gratuitous violence is your thing, you might be able to skim this novel for the parts about Lew Beck and enjoy the bits where he stomps on legless beggers, chops off fingers, or stabs people in the guts with broken bottles.  I wouldn't have minded the violence so much had the justification for it not been so very weak.  Nothing we see of Lew's childhood really illuminates his sadistic nature to my satisfaction. He just doesn't add up, which is frustrating because he's the only potentially interesting thing in novel.
