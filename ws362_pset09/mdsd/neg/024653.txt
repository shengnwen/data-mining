No reflection on Mr. Watson's translation--the book is very readable and is of historical interest.  But it's mostly an apologetic for Mahayana vs. Theravada Buddhism.  Though it does indicate that a layman can spiritually reach higher than monks.  While compassion is very appealing this book is unconvincing that Mahayanists have higher enlightenment than Theravadists.  True, this book does have the "koan" in which the protagonist is speechless to demonstrate a lack of duality.  But, it was disappointing as a whole.  Per David Snellgrove: "The fault in this plot is that it makes us expect too much from Vimalakirti's argumentative power.  Modern novelists make the same mistake...the actual quality of his discourse is not good enough.  We are left wondering why all the Saints stood in such awe of him.  The author of this sutra tries to make up for this defect by a series of flighty miraculous episodes, which serve only to enhance the general effect of triviality."  p. 272 in Edward Conze, I. B. Horner, David Snellgrove, & Arthur Waley, Buddhist Texts through the Ages (Boston: Shambhala, 1954)
