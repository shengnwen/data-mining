This is the dumbest book ever.  I really can find no redeeming value in it, other than the obvious humorous title and catch phrases.  I am seriously at a loss as to how this woman became so popular.  Maybe it is because our generation of moms (and I include myself) really don't know what we're doing and are searching, searching for someone to help guide us, and this woman just happens to be one of the funnier and do-what-feels-right advice givers.  At one point in the book, she actually suggests reasoning with your toddler while they are throwing a tantrum.  Please tell me that was another attempt at humor that went horribly, horribly wrong....  I say, don't waste your time on this worthless rag.  You will get a few chuckles for sure, but there is nothing useful in here at all (unless you run out of toilet paper)
