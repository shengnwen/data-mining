Toxin is not a very good book. What starts out, seemingly, like another Robin Cook thriller quickly turns into a rant about managed health care and the beef industry. There's also several gaps in the story, like he started writing it, got bored and left, then came back later and started forgetting where he was going the last time. The ending sucked. There was no finalty, to wrap up, not even something to think about it. Shortly into the book you're left scratching your head about the characters. The main two, Kim and Tracy, don't act like typical parents, or any of the other situations where you'd expect normal people to act... 

Toxin is a scary book. You'll stop eating (hamburgers) for a while. Cook makes really great points about managed health care, the USDA, and fast food in general. Just think it might've read better had Toxin been a non-fiction book about those subjects than trying to slop some half-baked fictional story around it...
