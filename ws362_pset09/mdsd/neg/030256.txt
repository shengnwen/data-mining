The fact is this guy does not give the most solid advice for directing.  He rips on Spielberg, and basicly calls martin scorsese a Hack.  He tells you that a good idea is to sleep with your producers to secure you job, just a lot of things that are not that helpfull.  He does have some good things to say, but you have to dig through so much crap that it's not really worth it.  There are plenty of other good books out there, and this would be one to pass on
