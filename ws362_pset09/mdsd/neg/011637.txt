While I agree that Lynn Hill may be an inspiration to many women climbers, I felt that the book was very poorly written.  I also concur and can not understand how this book achieved a rating of 5 and 6 stars.  It highlights some events of Lynn's climbing in her lifetime but it doesn't capture the soul of climbing.  I also felt some arrogance with her writing where most of the writing were concentrated on the negatives of others' climbs while in some instances she had the same.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this book to a beginner or a inspirational women's climb
