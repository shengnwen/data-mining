I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.

Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.

I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided.
