Last year, we used this book for our Lenten Wednesday discussions. We decided on it because I mentioned to the other pastors that I was reading this book and really liked the first two chapters.  When another pastor heard the writer's name, she said she had read things by him that she had really liked.  So, we recommended it to our parishes.  The problem with this book is that Rev. Keizer needed someone to help him clarify what he really wanted to say in the middle chapters.  That is, he needed an editor who would be honest with him about his thought process rather than just puclish everything he wrote.  
He went off on tangents that were not particularly germaine to the general topic.  It worked as a rumination on his own experiences and would have been better if that's the approach he had taken.  Instead, he tried to deal with issues much more generally.  Rev. Keizer is both thoughtful and caring.  I applaud him for those attributes in this book, but I could have used some "help" tryin to understand where he really was going with his ideas in the mid to late chapters.  Then, in the last chapter, he returned to clarity again.  I know that we were sorry we had chosen THIS book to recommend to our parishioners.  This book is a wonderful idea, but it still needs some sorting through by the writer and editor
