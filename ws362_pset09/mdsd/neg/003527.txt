If by "loved" you mean "loathed" and if by "this book" you mean "this piece of garbage."  I would say the characterization comes off as flat, but that would be an insult to flat characterization.  This book has NO characterization.  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  Zero.  You don't give one rip about the characters or their lives.  Ditto for the tepid plot.  Ditto for the awkward, wooden dialogue.  Ugh, it makes me hurt just thinking about it.  I've read bad books before that nonetheless drew me in, affording the opportunity to at least suspend my disbelief even if the story still stunk in the end.  The Sky Is Falling is not one of those novels.  Buy this if you're a writer and need a primer on how NOT to craft your fiction.  Otherwise, steer clear
