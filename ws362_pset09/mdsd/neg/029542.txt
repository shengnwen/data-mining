I've got to be honest, I couldn't finish this book.  I couldn't even get through the introduction because I was so angered and offended by two comments: 1) large breasts are an abnormality caused by an overactive pituitary gland and 2) small hands are a malformation.  My reaction to this was to take my overactive pituitary gland and malformed limbs and go find another book to read.  Attacking other women for the genetics that define their body types is NOT what feminism should be about
