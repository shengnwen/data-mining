Boring, boring, and oh, did I mention boring?  It was short, not terribly clever at all, and the illustrations are not even Dr. Suess. I felt ripped off.  I don't know why I thought it was tooth "fairy" related, as our daughter just lost her first tooth and we thought this would tie in.  It doesn't.  Neither of my kids (3 and 6)liked this even a little.  They both said it was...boring.
