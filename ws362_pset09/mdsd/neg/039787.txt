When Ezra Pound, one of the top 150 poets ever to have been born in Idaho in the mid-1880s, was an impressionable young man living in Venice, his application for a job as a gondolier was turned down on account of his being "a miserable, skinny little runt."  That hurt.  A lot.  Young Ezra knew that however much he may have looked like a beta-male weakling pansy-ass poet with curiously bad hair, deep down he was a man's man.  

Rather than lie down and spend the rest of his life having sand kicked in his face, Ezra took action.  Here's what Ezra did to prove for all time that Ezra was The Man:

1. Ezra spent the rest of his life ranting against the Jews, who were responsible not only for the corrupting the world's financial system, but also for making him a sad, lonely mediocrity with curiously bad hair.  

2. Pretended he understood Chinese, Mycenaean Greek, and Middle Etruscan.  

3. Gave money to talented people in return for being allowed to hang out with them.  

4. Chopped bits out of The Waste Land, a good poem by another person, and left other bits in for no discernable reason.  TS paid Ezra a compliment at the top of the poem, but Ezra couldn't read it because he'd exaggerated his Italian skills and was too embarrassed to ask what it meant.  Tragically, Ezra died in 1972 without ever knowing that TS had said something nice about him.  

5. Wrote the Cantos, a Big Poem by a Big Man.  Don't listen to the nay-sayers: in quality this poem is somewhat better than The Divine Comedy by the Tuscan poet Dante, but not quite as good as "Open Up and Say Aaah!," the classic 1989 album by Poison, GODS of hair-metal.  It's that good.  If The Cantos seem to you like a catastrophic train-wreck of bogus-profundity produced by an unhinged wannabe try-hard skinny guy from Idaho with curiously bad hair, that just means you're stupid, not Ezra, OK?
