With a title suggesting strong emotions, hard questions put and harder answers given, I was intrigued by the idea of an American author attempting to describe and interpret non-American views of the U.S.A.; an awareness and understanding of non-American viewpoints evidently a major failing of Americans at present.

Unfortunately, foreign perceptions of the U.S.A are only the ostensible subject of this volume; we see very little of the opinions of Hertsgaard's interlocutors and too much of Hertsgaard's own, rather commonplace, views.

With this mundane work, Hertsgaard merely perpetuates a perception that Americans, 'liberal' or not, are solipsistic, trite, and sublimely indifferent to the views of the foreigners whose lives are so affected, unwillingly or not, by American global political, social and corporate adventurism.  

So, for this reader, no fascination and no fury, but as one feels with so many American products, just contemptuous amusement and weary disappointment.
