I agree with a lot of the other reviews here; this book is more geared towards the childless than the childfree.  There is a huge difference.  The term childless applies to anyone who wants a child and cannot have one. The term childfree applies to anyone (straight, gay, or bisexual) who plans not to raise or bear children for a variety of reasons.
If you're looking for a childfree book, this isn't it
