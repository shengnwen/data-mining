This series started off strong, but it has unfortunately gone downhill quickly. The character development is very poor; you only get a superficial idea of who Annabelle is, and you really don't care, because there's not enough information about her to form an opinion. Her assistant, Kate, is extremely annoying in this book. In every chapter there is at least one example of Kate messing up an idiomatic expression such as "out with the old, in with the BLUE." No one is so stupid as to constantly screw up well-known sayings. It was distracting, annoying, and it affected the credibility of the story. The plot was o.k., but again, the constant dead bodies turning up stretched credibility. As a wedding planner, Annabelle would be much to busy to get involved in solving murders. While the reader does have to take such light mysteries with a grain of salt, the book pushed it too far. I would skip this entry in the series, and think twice before getting any future ones
