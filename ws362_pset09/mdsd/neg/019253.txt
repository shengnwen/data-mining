This is the most ponderous garbage I have ever read...the fact that Ms. Hakims books are geared to children makes me very upset. This is NOT a history book but a collection of her OPINIONS. Her portrayal of our American veterans in Vietnam in slanderous at best. Her facts are skewed in area's and plain wrong in others. Im a sister of a vietnam vet ( Yes, Ms. Hakim- he was a very honorable man ) and her dipiction ( they had killing weapons and killed many, many innocent people )of our soldiers is the most slanted and disrespectful I have ever read. Clearly she did not bother to speak to any veterans. No mention on what they went thru or the treatment they received when they returned. NO MENTION of the genocide/slaughter that took place in Cambodia. Please if you want your children to have the facts and to have respect for those who serve their country - keep this book out of their homes and out of their classrooms
