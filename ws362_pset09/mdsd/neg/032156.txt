I liked Terry McMillan's "The Interruption of Everything", so I was really looking forward to reading this book- but it was one of the worst, most frustrating books I've ever read. First of all, the writing is on about a sixth-grade level. Example: "...Charles asked me if I wanted to dance. I said yes. So we danced. He danced like a man who was sure of himself. He watched me. I watched him. He smiled at me. I smiled at him." That's when I rolled my eyes and gave up. Unfortunately it was on page 365!! From then on I scanned the rest of the pages, just to satisfy my curiosity about what would happen to the rest of these characters.
Secondly, most of the characters are complete morons, except for Gloria, who seemed real to me. (Working mom, single, trying to do the best for her son...) The other three jump into bed with EVERY man they meet, usually within the first three hours of meeting him. Then they whine and moan about how there are no good men out there. Well, DUH!!! Perhaps this is the point of the book, self-fufilling prophecy.
I do like the title. It describes that feeling of waiting while what you want (husband, job, baby, etc.) hasn't happened yet. But this book was a disappointing waste of time.
