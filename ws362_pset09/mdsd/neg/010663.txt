I'm not sure if Joan Bauer is planning another book about Jenna, but it seemed to me from the end of this one that she needs to write one in order to clean things up.  Although I loved "Rules of the Road," I didn't find this book nearly as compelling.  Jenna was still her strong and determined self, but the supporting characters were a bit bland.

Mrs. Gladstone didn't have as much of a presence in this book as she did in the first one.  Jenna's love interest was only barely described, as was Tanner, the good-hearted theif who I kept feeling Bauer really wanted to make into Jenna's love interest.

This book felt like only half a story, which would make sense if there is a sequel intended, but it is a bit weak as a stand-alone book
