This slim volume of the lives and stories of Amish women is a pleasant work. It is a small collection of interviews and anecdotes of Amish women.  The book is a simple, cleanly written work, giving the reader a taste of  what life is like for Amish women. It is, however, just that: a taste.  There is no depth to this book. It almost seems as if it were a work  published by a vanity press operation. It is more like a book one would  write and then have printed up in order to give it to friends and family.  There is really not too much to it, and it has a certain affectation about  it. It piques one's interest but does not satisfy an appetite. It is too  bad, because the author herself was raised in an Amish household.  Obviously, this gained her entree into this interesting, though narrow  world. It is unfortunate that she was not more insightful in terms of her  material
