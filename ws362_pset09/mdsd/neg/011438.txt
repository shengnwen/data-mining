Trefil's ideology got in the way of his using his common sense.

 To make a long story short, Trefil writes that scientists can manipulate eggs, in order to cause them to develop into embryos.  Therefore, all eggs are embryos.

There is a BIG difference between a manipulated egg and an unmanipulated egg...just as there is a BIG difference between a fertilized egg and an unfertilized egg.

Trefil says the fact that this manipulation of eggs is possible, implies that pro-life women who shed unfertilized eggs each month should be concerned that they are actually having abortions.


Weird idea? You bet.  Don't forget to put on your "thinking cap" when you enter Trefil's world of science fiction.
