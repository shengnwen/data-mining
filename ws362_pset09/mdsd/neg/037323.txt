Get the book, this one covers off on some of what he went thru but falls flat on the time he spent in combat. I remember AMC showing this movie and the host commenting that Audie Murphy went thru a lot trying to get his book on the screen. Basically, they sanitized and cleaned everything up to the point where if you were young enough, you might think war is not that bad even if you get killed. I have had a copy of the book for about 20 years and have read it about 3 times, viewing the movie once ws enough for me. It is amazing how "all is quiet on the western front" made much earlier when standards were even more rigid was able to pack a bigger punch, make a point and be more satisifying than this watered-down mess. Get the book, wait for the movie to come on TV
