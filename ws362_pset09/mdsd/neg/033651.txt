In reviewing this book, I am not going to get into matters of Simpson's guilt or innocence. I'm simply writing this review for those O.J. trial fans who might want to purchase it to get a different perspective on the crimes.

My opinion? You probably shouldn't bother. There are numerous books out there written by members of the Dream Team that can give you the perspective from the "he was innocent" camp. This book is merely O.J. trying to raise money for his defense (he admits it in the book). Because "I Want To Tell You" came out *before* the trial, there is really no information about the legal side of things or about the trial itself.

Also, since O.J. hadn't gone to trial yet, there was much he couldn't discuss on his lawyers' orders. So, you get watered-down protestations of innocence, but very little specific info.

Skip this book unless you want to hear O.J. protest (feebly) his innocence without any real arguments at all backing up his claims
