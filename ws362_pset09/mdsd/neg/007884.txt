Despite what the book title "Grammatically Correct", this book is mostly about punctuation usages.  Grammar is limited to a thin, single chapter.  There are not sufficient materials on grammar to alert you on incorrect usages, let alone correct them.

I would recommend "Painless Grammar" over this title
