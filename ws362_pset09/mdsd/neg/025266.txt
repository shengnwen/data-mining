I am a huge fan of Alain de Botton's nonfiction, especially the Consolations of Philosophy, so it was a real shock to dive headlong into this novel and find that the water was only a foot or so deep: the book was shallow. It gave me a headache. It made me fear that what I'd interpreted as comic overgeneralization in his essays -- the clever little diagrams, the sweeping witticisms, etc. -- might actually have been statements that Botton meant us to take literally. Or worse, that Botton feels such a boundless contempt for his readers that he imagines we might actually swallow this stuff whole.

The conceit of the novel's structure is that each chapter represents a stage in the relationship's progress: "Idealization", "Intimacy", "The Fear of Happiness", and so forth; within each chapter, paragraphs are numbered, giving them the feeling of an outline that is supposed to scientifically illustrate the course of a "typical" relationship. Unfortunately, this results in one of the most boring, typical, conventional, utterly predictable love stories I could possibly imagine, since at every stage the characters are doing exactly what popular common sense would expect them to do. Like inhuman little puppets, they bump together in the dark and then fall apart.

As an example, this is how the narrator describes his girlfriend's faked orgasms: "an untruth lasting 3.2 seconds fitted into a series of eight 0.8-second contractions, the first and last two [3.2s] of which were genuine... Her usual number of contractions was replaced by an exaggerated activity, possibly designed to divert me from her lack of true involvement in the process."

Presumably, this clever writing is designed to divert us from Botton's lack of true involvement in the writing process
