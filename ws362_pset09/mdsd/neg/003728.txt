Okay, so the purported author is a rambling old woman in her 70s, but that doesn't mean you will want to bear with this meandering narrative. There isn't much to pull you through--smashing idols with feet of clay? Yawn. Gore Vidal is so much more satisfyingly acidic. Concern for any of the characters? Not much. Fanny T. escapes what little peril she's in during one short chapter. White's descriptions of the characters who populate are marvelous but it's not worth the long sludgy haul to get to them. I'm fond of some of White's other work and thus am disappointed in this one
