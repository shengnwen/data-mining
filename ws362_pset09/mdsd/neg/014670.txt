If you already know how to cook, I wouldn't suggest this cookbook.  Here's why:
1) many recipes were bland and uninspired (nothing was bad, but many needed intervention to improve/add flavor)
2) geared towards novice - not for the seasoned cook, and certainly not gourmet
3) recipes call for dried herbs - why not use frozen fresh herbs?  Just as fast and WAY better taste.  I buy fresh herbs and freeze them in water in ice cube trays, then store the ice cubes in labeled ziplock bags in freezer, and always have fresh herbs available when I need them. Now THAT's fast (and cheap) gourmet.
4) not enough diversity in recipes - many seem like variations of each other
MY TASTES - I've been vegetarian for ~10 years, and I prefer Mediterranean, SE Asian, Indian, English, French, and Soul food.  (Read: lots of flavor, not afraid of fats or seasonings)  So you should judge my opinion in context.
