I just returned from 2 months in Guatemala.

I was a little disappointed in this guide, and would recommend any newer guide to take with you.  

Things change quickly in that part of the world (roads, political climate, etc.) and the most up-to-date information is the best. Actually, the best guides I saw during my visit were guides from Germany; so I guess if you speak german, you're in luck.  Guatemala and Central America are very popular places to visit for people from Germany and I met more people from germany than any other country.

This guide was generally helpful, but but outdated.  Having spent most of my time in Antigua to study Spanish, I was disappointed to find many of the best restaurants were not listed, and only a few of the many travel agencies were reviewed (travel agencies are a must for arranging buses, etc. to travel the Central American region).

I would have liked to see recommended trips or travel paths for the country, like some other guides.  Guatemala is kinds tricky when it comes to travel, due mostly in part to the many Volcanoes and mountains there, and the best way to see the country is definitely debateable.  Looking at a map doesn't always mean you can apparently get from point A to B.  Again, this is where travel agencies come in so handy - they are a wealth of information.

In addition to your guide, I would recommend as another source of travel information the Rough Guide website, were you can read (for free) about other peoples experiences there
