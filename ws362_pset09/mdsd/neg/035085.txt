It's from this book that Led Zeppelin's reputation as rock n roll "bad boys" is largely responsible. If you are a teenage boy or have the mentality of a teenage boy, it no doubt illicits great admiration and hero worship and you will enjoy this book. But to anyone else the individual band members simply come across as sh*ts. Even so, I still think they are worthy of a better book than this. Wild on the road behaviour-which is the main contents of this book largely- is really very common place for a band from that era. I just simply can't understand why it's represented as being so unique. When infact, what is really great about Led Zeppelin is their fantastic music. The writer really fails to capture this or what makes the band as individuals tick. Although he can deliver some salcious tales it becomes pretty obvious he knows very little about them. The photographs are pretty uninspired too. I think the real Led Zeppelin story is full of the heights of success and the lows of human tragedy, and various trials and tribulations inbetween which constitutes their real growth as individuals and musicians. But I have quite honestly never seen any writer particularly, let alone this one- tackle this skillfully. Anything very meaningful tends to be brushed over in favour of petty gossip-mainly to impress a certain type of male fan.  I still think the definative book about them which is more truly representive of their lives and music has yet to be written.
