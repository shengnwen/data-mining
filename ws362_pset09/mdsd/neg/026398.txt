This is the most misinformed intolerant religious right wing propaganda I have ever read.  The author obviously took many assumptions about paganism and stereotyped the entire group.  His arguments against it hold as little logic as he claims the pagan community uses in their own beliefs.  I would strongly recommend not purchasing this book of intolerance and social hatred
