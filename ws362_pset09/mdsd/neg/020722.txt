In all, I think this story could have been written in about ten pages in The New Yorker, or some publication like that. Mr. Sierra simply took too long to get to his point and rambled about topics not relevant to the crux of his book. Because it was originally published in Spanish, part of me wonders how much was lost in the translation. Then again, that would only account for a better read, not a better plot
