There's a wealth of fascinating, behind-the-scenes detail to this book, but on the whole I found too many instances where the author was plugging the gaps with his own imagination. Unbiased works about Nixon are hard to find, and I didn't find one here. It would be refreshing to come across a text that seeks neither to vilify nor redeem Nixon's public image. Perhaps, given the damage he did to political idealism in this country, it simply isn't possible to approach him without an agenda. Or maybe we just need more time to go by before we try to digest his impact on American life
