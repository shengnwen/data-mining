I enjoy the recipes in the back of the book.  The characters however, are extremely obnoxious, with the exception of Drayton.  Theodosia is an unlikeable busy-body, know-it-all, arrogant character who seems to be in continual competition with the police in attempting to solve crimes.  Haley is irritating beyond words.  The books are full of sentence fragments and the way the characters talk is stilted.  I've given up on this series and will go to the library, page to the back of the book and browse through the recipes.
