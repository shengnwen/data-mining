I can't look at a dog in the street without wondering whether its Chris under there.  This book was repulsive and actually embarrasing to read.  I was constantly paranoid that someone would lean over my shoulder and read the filth on those pages.  With those thoughts running through her mind, I really dont know how the author isnt institutionalized. Even once I got past the vivid nature of the book I was still emotionally shocked that that animal of a woman (the author)  wouldnt even let Chris stay with her owner.  She stole my innocence and any love i've ever had for dogs. Walk passed leash and go straight to the harry potter. you'll thank me
