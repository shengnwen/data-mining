We can only see what we are is a theory of quantum physics.
Therefore when James Patterson makes his serial killer a vegetarian
and his detective a ribs eater, he is projecting his own guilt
at being the serial killer of animals, at being the payer of
the hitmen at the slaughterhouse.

In actuality, violence is correlated so strongly to the murder
at the slaughterhouse and the consumption of cadavers that
in the 19th Century, butchers were not allowed to sit on British
juries.
