Let me start by saying that for almost any baseball fan, this book comes off as an interesting read.  But the Pinocchio Gepetto reviewer said it best--trivia, not analysis.

I'd like to add that at no point does Perry actually either (a) define what is a "great" team (not to mention a "good" team) and (b) uses some needless or unsubstantiated invective in taking pot shots at certain players' ability or even character (if you're not going to say why you think Nolan Ryan is highly overrated then don't mention it - twice!). 

What I was expecting from the front cover and from flipping through the chapters (each chapter is titled after a putative role on a 'winning' team--The Slugger, The Glove Man, The Speedster, etc.) was a sober analysis of winning elements of teams that have risen above their milieu.  I even expected some controversial claims (as the cover says, "It's not what you think").  Instead, as Gepetto indicates, the book is just a collection of lists of characteristics of all 124 that have made the playoffs from 1980-2003.  So what?  They have about as much in common as the next best 124 teams that didn't make the playoffs, which is to say, not a whole lot.  He would treat the 1984 Tigers and the 2005 Padres, for example, as equally 'great.'  

Finally, as a sour Yankee fan, I ask, how can a book purport to answer the question of how winning teams win when and feature an entire chapter deriding the stolen base without even MENTIONING Dave Roberts' game- and series-turning steal against the Yanks and Mariano Rivera in the 2004 ALCS?  I don't care if the stolen base only adds 3.6 runs to a team's total during the season...selectively applied, has it been or could it be a strategically useful device for a winning team?  Perry never even approaches that kind of analysis.

Good read, but not worthy of the sabermetrics pantheon
