I was hoping to learn something valuable from the man who earned New York State Teacher of the Year more than once. Something I might be able to take into my classroom and motivate and inspire my students to achieve greatness. There is nothing here in this book that helps me understand what it is that makes John Taylor Gatto a 'different kind of teacher.' The entire book revolves around his premise that public education is some kind of government scam to keep people from thinking for themselves and loving their families. I stopped reading the book halfway through when J.T.G. made the claim that the term 'child labor' was invented to keep children in school where they could be brainwashed and not out with family members learning a useful trade and thinking original thoughts.
On page 131, "In spite of the successful ancient practice of children and adults working side by side as an efficient and humane way to socialize the young, the term "child labor" began to appear in book as condemnation; upper-class vigilantes formed associations to harass poor and working class families who persisted in these traditional ways. Children were encouraged to avoid work as long as possible, replacing it with nonspecific benefits of schooling."
While it's obvious that there are a number of things wrong with our public school system, I cannot go so far as to agree with all that J.T.G. proposes in his book.
And although J.T.G. argues that public schooling keeps children from thinking for themselves, I believe he attempts to do the same in his book. Every chapter is designed to brow-beat you into agreeing with his belief.
If you are looking for an insightful book about teaching, this is not the book for you. If you believe that public schooling is a sham and should be dismantled altogether and need 1,000 reasons to back up your argument, by all means, buy the book
