What probably started off as a good idea over drinks late one night, this book looks like it was hurrily stitched together the next day like Frankenstein's monster. It seems like the author clipped up all his old People magazines and, along with every file photo he could lay his hands on, slapped together 2 pages for every celebrity/group he had. That's when the trouble starts. The pictures, more often then not, don't highlight the tattoos (or other body art) because they weren't shot for that purpose. They were just rounded up for Gerard to hang some lame (often smarmy) information around. This info is broken down into 4 categories : The Inside Scoop (a quickie bio), Raw Data (real names, birth [and sometimes death] dates, accomplishments, etc.), Skin Deep (obviously incomplete info about the celeb's body art that doesn't even list what is clearly showing in the accompanying photos), and Strange But True (Ripley's Believe It Or Not need not worry). The most glaring error of the book occurs when Gerard describes the tattoos that adore each of the shoulders of the late Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes of TLC. If you were to look at the pictures showing these 2 tattoos, you would immediately notice that both are shown to reside on the left shoulder (the 80/falcon tat on page 144 was indeed on the left). While I didn't expect to see every marking on each celeb's body (at least not here), I bought this book expecting to see a little more. The back cover advertises &quot;Up close (strike 1) and lavish (strike 2), here is the ultimate collection (strike 3 - yer out) of beauty marks for beautiful people&quot;. I'm glad I didn't pay full cover price for this turkey. Truely disappointing
