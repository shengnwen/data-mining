This was the first book I saw in the store in my search for a good summer read.  The cover intrigued me and so did the description of a young African Elvis impersonator trying to make a life for himself. Who wrote the summary of this book?  Did they even read it?  It's not what this book is about at all.  

This book is interesting at first.  As I read on, I kept trying to find where this book was going.  This is difficult as the book switches between the past and the present; unfortunately the two are never reconciled.

About half way through, I found myself skimming through the remaining pages, scanning for a semblance of a plot.  No luck.
I gave up on this book- it's just too much work.
