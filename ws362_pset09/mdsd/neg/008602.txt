Absolutely DO NOT use this book if you are taking the new ICE exam.  I used this book about 2 years ago to study for the original TEA.  I was cofident and felt very prepard.  I was dead wrong.  The math section seriously gave me a panic attack - I am terrible in math and the TEA book did not prepare me whatsoever.  SO, I failed, but I took the ICE test just a few months ago and passed.  I used the Arco Special Agent book which really, really helped me.  The math sections are so helpful.  Even read the logical reasoning sections.  When you take the exam, you will realize how much easier the logicals are compared to the book
