The author had unlimited access but tells a very unbalanced story.

My main issue is (like Thucydides20) that the academics are totally ignored.  That is such a huge part of life at the Point, as various grads have told me.

Also, the regular Honor Code scandals is another point ignored in the book.  The book talks about the Honor Code with a "see no evil" mentality.  Yet every 10-15, regular as clockwork, there is a cheating scandal related to that code.

While we are at it, there is very little written about the teachers.  It is a shame Lipsky chose not to spend any time with them.

I also had major problems with the format of the book, it jumps around way too much.  Just when you are starting to get a feel for a cadet, you are jerked away from that person.

I have spent a lot of time at the Point and have great affection for the institution and its people.  It is a shame that given unlimited access, Lipsky did such a poor job
