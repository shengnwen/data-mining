 Reading this book I could not get past the fact that my own parents stories are far more compelling. My father fleeing the communist Rushkies and my mother joining him from Italy. Proud hard working people who embraced America. Learning to read, write and work here as well as teaching themselves to drive. Both have told me that they would never have come here illegally. My father fled Lithuania due to persecution under threat of imprisonment but still would not have come here illegally. How could he flee lawlessness only to enter a country by breaking the law? The writer and readers of these books can't grasp this type of character and courage.They hide from the truth by using terms like undocumented workers. Leaving the incorrect impression that their lack of citizenship is only a clerical error. Decieving only themselves. My parents are the real thing and those who enter under a cloak of darkness are mere law breakers no matter how you spin the truth
