I read the other reviews and I guess this book does give you a lot of information about a lot of baby products but I found the majority of the information so useless. It tells you things like if you are living in the city, and you are going to take the subway, you should look for a lightweight stroller. I knew that - I just wanted information on the best/safest/most durable lightweight strollers out there. That information is not in there. The most helpful section was maybe the cribs but the rest of the items' descriptions from baby bottles/nipples/breast feeding to strollers just told you what features to look out for... I was hoping more of a review of the actual specific products and which had certain features- this book did not do that.
