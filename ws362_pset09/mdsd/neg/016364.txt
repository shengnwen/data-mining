The tale of the "Sharon" is an interesting one, indeed. Ms. Druett is a knowledgable historian, and perhaps a very fine text book author.  However, this particular book is disjointed.  It is extremely frustrating to the reader when one of the main  principals in this storyis "never to be heard from again"  WHAT? after two hundred pages, I would have liked at least some rumors of his fate.  Another dies an early death, time and place noted, but NO CAUSE of death.  AARRGGGHHH.  Also distracting are the continual references to Herman Melville, who was neither present, nor directly involved with the story at all.  In all, the story could be interesting, and I hope someone else will take it up, because I felt somewhat cheated
