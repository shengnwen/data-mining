As in the other books in this series, this book is really thin in the plot area, and in this one the motive for the killing is not plausible, but it's still a funny story in it's own way.  Readers must be die-hard cozy fans to enjoy this series, and they must be willing to give the author a lot of latitude since Ms. Myers really needs an editor for her books.  This book is about what appears to be a hit-and-run murder, and at first glance it looks like it might be local Amish boys that did it.  That is why Melvin Stoltzfus deputises Magdalena to help him solve the mystery.  I'm really not sure about this series.  Each book seems more disjointed than the last one, and they make less and less sense.  But I do finish the books, even though it seems like an almost guilty pleasure
