I probably would have never read this book had I not received it as a gift.  However I am a fan of the occult and unexplained phenomenon, so I gave it a shot.  The book is entertaining; if only for the fact that her assertions about things like crop circles, the pyramids, and Atlantis are outlandish and fanciful.  Her research is morbidly flawed, she sites several websites, and never bothers to site any credible references.  It's important to note that the book has no bibliography.  Many of her conclusions are a result of information received from her spirit guide Francine, and it occurred to me many times while reading this book that perhaps Sylvia should take what Francine has to say with a grain of salt.  

The book is rather light on content.  She tackles several "secrets & mysteries", however only dedicates a few pages to each.  Her chapter on alien abductions is barely three pages long.  For someone really looking to delve into unexplained phenomenon, there are plenty of books out there which explore these things in much greater detail and with more credibility.  But if the book happens to fall into your hands, you might as well read it.  It's good for some chuckles.  (Of course, it's not supposed to be funny.
