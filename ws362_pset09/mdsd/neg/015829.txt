If you're looking for a thoughtful critique of the media, look elsewhere.  This book contains more name-calling within its pages than a junior high school does within its doors. The author indiscriminately hurls the epithet "right-wing" to describe just about everyone who isn't a Democrat.  Did Ted Kennedy ghostwrite this?   Bill O'Reilly is not "right wing" or Republican but rather a grandstanding populist.  John Stossel is not "right wing" or Republican but rather a libertarian.  Brock can't even give them the dignity of using an insulting term that actually describes who they are.  The left simply loses credibility and strips "right wing" of any discerable meaning when they brand everyone from George W. Bush (the biggest spender since LBJ) to the Cato Institute to Adolf Hitler as being "right wing."  Maybe most people in politics don't think about the meaning of words, only what effect they have, but readers of a long book deserve to have their intelligence respected.  Brock doesn't.  The errant insults, hyperbolic generalizations, and misrepresentations go on and on in this book.  At least Ann Coulter's off the wall attack books are entertaining.  Brock's sense of humor is apparently still under development, if he has one at all.  Yes, the book has some information in it that some people may find useful.  But the sneering writing style, for me at least, totally overwhelms and negates any value I may have otherwise derived from this hatchet job of a book.  So I'm giving it only 1 star
