I was assigned this book for a class in East Asian-World Politics, so I read it thoroughly and was thoroughly disappointed.  The assumptions that this book is based on are fallacious and misguided, and the authors seem to  have no understanding of either Chinese political culture or the nature of  international relations. To begin with, the book spends most of its time  highlighting and exaggerating sources of tension between the two countries,  and seems to assume that every tension between two states will inevitably  lead to full-scale war.  This assumption is sadly mistaken.  In fact, the  United States and Canada have outstanding disagreements on a number of  issues, yet experience close relations and have the longest unguarded  border in the world. The book relies mostly on provacative statements made  by members of the Chinese Communist Party to support its thesis.  It  ignores the fact that it is common practice in Chinese politics to speak  loudly and negatively about whomever China currently disagrees with.  Just  because a member of the National People's Congress says war with the United  States is inevitable over human rights doesn't mean it will happen.  Have  the authors ever heard Jesse Helms (or many other senators, for that  matter) speak?  Note their reluctance to use force to settle the Taiwan  issue. The entire book comes off as a heavily-biased college paper on  US-Chinese relations.  The fact that they use virtually no primary-source  material or Chinese-language material not already translated adds to this  perception.  It appears that the authors decided the hypothesis of the book  beforehand, and simply searched for information to support their theory.   As flawed and biased a book as I have come across in a long time
