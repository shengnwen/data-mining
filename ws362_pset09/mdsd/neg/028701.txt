The techniques described in this book are not something to play around with. If someone seriously attempts to follow these practices, there is the real possibility of becoming severely, phsycologically unbalanced. These  practices are meant to serve a purpose, but the author of this book NEVER  mentions that purpose. Without a use for the 'cultivated energy', energy  levels WILL build up to dangerously high levels. Be warned
