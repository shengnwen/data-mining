I bought this book from the publisher because I received a direct mail piece that worked its magic on me and I ordered it, unfortunately at the higher price of the publisher vs. the lower price at amazon.com.  The book goes into some depth about various beauty treatments and if you have no knowledge whatsoever about the topics like skin treatments to reduce effects of aging (from newspapers, magazines, general information)...you might learn something.  I didn't.  Worse than not learning anything new, were the "ratings" of cosmetics which really weren't "ratings" at all.  A number of products of several companies (and not the majority of manufacturers found in the drugstore or even in the department store) are listed by company with the author's comments on the various individual products.  However, the "ratings" do not present the information in a chart which rates the different products against each other.  The author comments on different versions of a single product type like all the mascara products of L'Oreal or Cover Girl (or other manufacturers).  I didn't find this helpful.  The fact that only a few manufacturers were rated was annoying, and even more annoying were endless pages of products by the individual manufacturers - that the majority of consumers do not buy or buy only very occasionally.  For me, the book was a waste of money - and an indication to me that I should not be sucked into purchasing a book on its marketing materials alone.  Shame on me since I worked in marketing for many years and employed the same tricks myself!
