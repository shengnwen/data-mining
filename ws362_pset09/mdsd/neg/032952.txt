If you're expecting a lot of picture to show you the correct ballet positions, you may want to consider a ballet video.  There is ONE picture at the beginning of each chapter, with 95% of the book describing (in words) what to do.  It's more of a ballet teachers manual than something you'd give your daughter or someone already in ballet.  I don't mean to be overly critical, but it was a disappointment
