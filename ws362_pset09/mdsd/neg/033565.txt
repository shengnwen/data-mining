God, this book was awful! Not just the story, it was the construction that turned me off. The storyline is weak and the writing immature. Characters seem to sprout and wither with all the imagination of a photocopier. There is nary a connection between personalities and their responses to events. I can go on but I guess I need to be more concrete.

A sprite introduced within the first 45 pages suddenly develops ventriloquistic abilities for just one scene. Nary a mention before or later of that ability. While it is the prerogative of the author, a little more finesse would have been nice.

There is an unnecessary page or two of pontification before each of the five parts that comprise the book. For a work so shallow in its content, this essentially has a "insult-to-injury" aura.

Guenhwyvar is totally wasted/domesticated in the book. There was some evocation of majesty associated with the panther in the first book. In this third book, he had all the majesty of a tomcat. Also unbelievable is a battle towards the end where the panther is unable to dispose of the pet dog of the bad guy.

Then there's Montolio, what can I say....for a couple of chapters I thought this might be a promising character, especially with the blind archer bit. He even defeats the great Drizzt in battle, seemingly teaching him a "valuable" lesson. Then dies a few months later of old age. C'mon!!

With this book I give up on Robert Salvatore, never mind the ringing endorsement given to him by Margaret Weis in the 'Introduction' (strike one for her)
