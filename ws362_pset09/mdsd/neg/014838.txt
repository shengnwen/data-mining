Don't be scammed.
Do yourself a favor and do a search of the web using "quackery" and 
"Jordan Rubin". Read about the fake degrees, bogus organizations, and other surreptitious means used by these modern day flim flam artists to line their pockets. If afterward, you are not convinced that you are being scammed by these cons, then you have either not read enough or you are not being honest with yourself.
