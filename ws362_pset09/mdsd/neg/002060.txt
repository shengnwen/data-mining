This author is obviously very well versed in alot of material as you know from everything he has written.  He remarks that he will only use from acupuncture what is real and forget the hocus/pocus.  I feel that Mr Chaitow highly underestimates the powers of acupuncture medicine. I am a western trained physician who has just trained in this ancient wonderful world of acupunture. There is no methodical or conceptual description for point selection, but a mere lists of points for pain in areas of the body. For headaches-points A,B &amp; C. For backpain--points X,Y &amp; Z, etc.  I have no regrets in the purchase, but I like it only to supplement my other material
