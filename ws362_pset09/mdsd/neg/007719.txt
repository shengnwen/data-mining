    What can you say about a book that introdouces three characters in one chapter? Or has a character thats entire vocabulary seems to consist of "Hotcha, Gotcha" and says that nearly 10 times a chapter. I would honestly not care if all the people upped and died. This book has no surprises but one, a "plot twist" that was obvious 6 chapters away. Did I mention I hate the annoying, underdeveloped, characters. Oh yes. I usually like Bruce Coville, but with this book, he has bought himself to a level of unreadability that is only outclassed by the sequel
