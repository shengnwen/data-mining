I purchased this book, hoping it would examine the _ancient_ Egyptian source of the ideas within the Corpus Hermeticum. But, in that respect this book is entitled in a misleading manner. The author is a researcher for the Center for _Greek_ and _Roman_ Antiquity of the National _Hellenic_ Research Foundation in _Athens_. And, as the name of his foundation clearly implies, his academic zeal begins and ends with Greece and Rome.

Yes, everyone knows that the Corpus Hermeticum we now have was written by Greeks. But, my interest is in discovering the Kemetian source those Greeks worked from to come up with their Corpus Hermeticum. Alas, this book was no help.
