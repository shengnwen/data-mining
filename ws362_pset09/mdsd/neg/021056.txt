My son read this book at the beginning of this school year (5th grade).  He struggles with reading and spelling.  He so totally identified with the main character, Sam, that he labeled himself dumb, stupid and learning  disabled.  This is not a triumphant story.  This is a tragic story.  The  protagonist does not feel he has overcome or mastered his learning  disablity.  Instead, he feels worn out and akins his small victory to  having swum a great distance, only to realize that he must do it again and  again.     I believe that there is a political agenda at work here.  Masked  behind an attitude of sympathy is the deeper message that children should  equate special education with learning disablities.  Furthermore, it  excuses the classroom teacher from having to deal with student difficulties  by making it not only okay, but acceptable BY THE STUDENTS to send children  from the room to another, &quot;special&quot; teacher.  Basically, this  leaves the gifted and talented in the main classroom and separates the  &quot;normal&quot; from the &quot;not normal&quot;.  This book is  subversive and an insult.  It should not be in the classroom.  It gives  children access to a vocabulary that they cannot possibly fully comprehend  (nor, I suspect, does its author).  It provides students with tools to  label themselves, thereby easing the burden of the school systems.   Proponets of this book can only have the political and monetary protection  of the institution in mind when promoting it for classroom reading. While  seemingly innocent on the surface, a critical reader will see beyond the  surface to the deeper meaning and hidden agenda.  Of course, fifth graders  aren't critical readers, they are victims of school politics
