I am awestruck...not because the book is terrific but because some people have figured out (or found agents who've figured out) how to write books about incredibly obvious things -- and make a handsome living at it.  Furthermore, I love it when rich people tell me to put my feet up and savor the "good life," a life they probably wouldn't be able to savor themselves if they didn't get handsome checks for writing dreck like this.  I haven't learned this much from a book since Suze Orman told me to look behind the sofa cushions for spare change
