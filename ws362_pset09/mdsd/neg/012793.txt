I unfortunately could not get through this book. T.R just went on and on, getting a bit carried away with his own wit and literary skills. I wish  I could write a better review, but I can't get past the second chapter. Perhaps further on down the road I will give it another try. In the meantime I recommend all Tom's other novels.
