The author denies that your thyroid problem is your own fault, telling you you need to get involved with all the medical aspects and tell your doctor what you need.  If your doctor doesn't listen to you then find another doctor.  Monitor your TC levels through blood tests (if/when you can afford them).  Then the last chapter is all about how much Thyroid therapy can help (as in 12 step programs) to discover that your stresses and life problems probably started the whole thing in the first place.  Athough it is NOT YOUR fault.  All the while insinuating that it, in fact, IS your fault.

Weird book.  I would NOT recommend it unless you're very young and have never heard of a 12 step program and have 24/7 hours a day to monitor your progress.  Then, go for it.

Otherwise, find a better alternative.
