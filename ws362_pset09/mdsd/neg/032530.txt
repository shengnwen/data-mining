The title of the book held great potential.  The first half of the publication was okay, however, from there on the author appears to have run out of interesting things so say.  It just became run of the mill text.   Some authors do that, you know.  Stuff a book with more text than is  needed.  This is the case here.  I did not give it a very good rating and I  recommend you do not buy it
