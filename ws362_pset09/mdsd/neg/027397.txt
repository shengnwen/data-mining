From such a much-publicized expert as Prof. Sternberg, this is quite a disappointment.  Not representative of a doctoral candidate at all. As if suffering from attention-deficit-disorder, the novel-length assertions could have been pared-down to half its length with a more-deserved focus on the claims of the last 10 pages. Instead, you wade through tedious defects of tests and personal family events that reveal a very ordinary insight.  Early on, (probably his underclass research assistant) we are tipped off to its underwhelming conclusion when we come upon &quot;some of the studies(this one too) showing that IQ tells you little of what you want to know about what makes for success, regardless of life pursuit.&quot; When finally heading down to the crux of the book, Prof. Sternberg digresses once again about one of his own &quot;love theories&quot; that has little to say about the persistence of successful intelligence.  This tome should be placed several libraries away from the erudition of William James or John Locke, who both reveal at every sentence the working of an intellect. Ted Kaczynski has more thoughts on why successful intellects struggle in today's society than the professor could uncover. Compares to the topical fare of Dr. David Reuben
