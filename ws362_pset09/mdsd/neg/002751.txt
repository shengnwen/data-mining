To use a Mets phrase, "It's amazing" that Jeff Pearlman can make a living focusing on the dark side of people. Baseball players are people - period. They have talent to swing a bat, run, throw a ball, but this does not make them enlighted, beyond temptation or anymore newsworthy than my father, an insurance executive who drank too much, was abusive to his family and as great as he was at work, could have been so much more. 

This team is a microcosm of the real world and there are companies out there that make the story of the 1986 Mets pale in comparison. 

Yes, Gooden and Strawberry could have been Hall of Famers, but they were strong at baseball and weak at life. This makes them human, not tragic. 

We do love to put people at pedestles, simply to knock them off and watch them fall. 

The 1986 Mets are my favorite team of all time. They had heart and they went into the season with the highest of expectations for them, and won. 

What more did you really want from them?

Spend your money on a book with an ending that you don't already know.
