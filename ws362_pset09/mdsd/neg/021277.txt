There are so many posts from people who obviously ignore the truth of fat, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism.  Everyone seems to be showing all the information in this book as fact when in reality they have not even looked at REAL research on MEDLINE.  I'm sure you have lost weight on a low-carbohydrate diet.  Anytime you completely cut out a macronutrient you are going to be eating less and losing weight.  IT'S ALL ABOUT CALORIES PEOPLE!  A lot of the initial weight lost is water.  I recommend going to mypyramid.gov.  You can get a food plan listed in servings you need.  Go to a dietition.  LA weightloss is better.   I rated this book a 2 because it simply lacks real information that you learn in a college nutrition class, but since people have lost weight...buy it if you like.  You'll only gain it back.  Lifetime weightloss can only be acheived by a LIFESTYLE CHANGE.

I love the reviews that say "excellent for low carbers" and "dieters".  That makes it sound like it's a hobby.
