An earlier reviewer was correct: This is story after story about immature fathers who come to the "big realization" that they actually need to be good fathers.  And we're supposed to find this inspiring?  

In addition, perfectly good stories are ruined by bizarre, out-of-the-blue religious non sequiturs such as "God was remodeling my son."  Huh?  As if the father has nothing to do with helping his son.  One guy prays to God that his son will catch a fish.  Yeah, people are starving in Africa, but God's going to make sure this kid catches a fish. Uh huh.

In another case, a father "asked the Lord to help back off a little" when a son is benched.  Does he ask the Lord to help him go to the bathroom, too?  Sheesh.  There's something pathetic about fathers who take no responsibility for their actions--whether admirable actions or immature actions.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised about the pervavise religious content when authors include evangelists James Robinson and Chuck Swindoll. 

If you want to hear God mentioned every 3 pages and want to read about immature fathers, this is the sappy book for you
