The author who is Jewish spent far too much time on Koufax being Jewish.  As a biography it was poor.  Jews may appreciate the book, but gentiles probably won't.  The book didn't take you through enough of Sandy's life or his career as it seems to emphasize 1965.  I usually like to read biographies rather than auto biographies, but I've read many auto bios which are better.  The author may have been hampered by the fact that Sandy is so quiet and reserved that he makes a poor subject for a biography.  There's a caption under a picture about Sandy being twice divorced, but only a few sentences about his first marriage.  Don't waste your money on this book
