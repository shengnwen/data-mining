This book is no different than any other book on the subject of menopause except that it informs you that if you have sudden menopause the symptoms appear at once instead of gradually. You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure that one out! In sudden meopause you experience the symptoms immediately instead of over a period of years and the solutions to dealing with the symptoms are the same whether menopause is sudden or gradual. Do not waste your money if you have read any other book on the subject of menopause because you will not learn anything new
