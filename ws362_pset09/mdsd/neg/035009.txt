I'll repeat what surprisingly only a few people have mentioned so far.
Unless you're an expert in military lingo and with the different types of military hardware you're going to find yourself lost and disinterested.  

The first few chapters were actually quite good and laid the groundwork for what I thought would be a good story.  The remaining chapters had little connection to this however.  The book ended up being nothing more than endless military talk, little character development, tedious descriptions of military and submarine encounters.  Even Clancy's much maligned Red Rabbit is far superior to this
