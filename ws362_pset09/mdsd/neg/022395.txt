It is definitely not fair of me to offer a review of Neil's book because I have not read it yet. However, it seems important to me to address some of the reviewers comments. Many readers have noted how Neil seems bored or burned out maybe about touring. 30yrs in any profession will take its toll on a person! Can you imagine in that length of time how many times "Tom Sawyer" has been played in concert? As a devout Rush fan, that has got to be draining after a time. Even Geddy and Alex have stated that there are certain songs that they simply do not want to play anymore. 
As for Neil ignoring his fan base, what can you do? Maybe he does come across as a bit ungrateful. I always figured him as being a really private person, but being private doesn't necessarily make you a jerk either. Time changes everything, especially 30yrs worth. It is not 1980 anymore. All of that promise and enthusiasm of a young band has changed. At least Neil is being upfront and honest with everyone. Hopefully soon I will get to read the book and if I'm wrong, I will be the first to apologize to everyone
