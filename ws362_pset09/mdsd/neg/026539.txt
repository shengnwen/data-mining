Heinlein is a great author.  When he sits back and tells a story, he's one of the best.  Glory Road and Citizen of the Galaxy are wonderful, and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan.

This, however, is an awful book.  It's not merely one of Heinlein's worst.  It's one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.

The problem isn't that there's no action, although there isn't.  The problem is that there isn't anything of substance to replace it.  There's lots of sex, but not in enough detail to be titilating.  There isn't a love story either; you can't have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason.  The book just rambles aimlessly until it ends.

Maybe Heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity, but if so he failed miserably.  The characters in this book aren't just from a different culture; they aren't people at all.  They're too flat.  If you want to think about such things, ponder them on your own or read a different book.  I suggest Left Hand Of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin.

I Will Fear No Evil reads like an old man's rambling personal fantasies.  Someone must like it, but I can't recommend it even to the most devoted Heinlein fans.  If you're tempted, do yourself a favor and re-read Stranger In A Strange Land instead
