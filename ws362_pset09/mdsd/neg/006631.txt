Unfortunately, James Clavell and his publisher fought during the last few years of his life.  The result was that his final Asian saga novel, Whirlwind, is out of print.  Escape is a watered down version of that  novel, developed for a movie script.  The core story is still there, but to  get Clavell's intended story, buy Whirlwind at a used bookstore or online  auction site
