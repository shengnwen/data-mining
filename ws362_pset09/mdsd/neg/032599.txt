I read the works of folks like Vince Flynn, Lee Child, and, I thought, Nelson DeMille, for the escape--the action--intrigue. Someting to make the plane flight go faster.  I don't read for thinly-veiled, current-events, quasi-political commentary.  (There are recognized exports available for that sort of thing.  For example, a tour-of-duty in Vietnam gives neither me, nor Nelson, "expert" status on the conduct of warfare.)

DeMille, as he matures as a person and a writer, has taken to slipping his "agenda" into his storytelling.  Consequently, the "story telling" aspect of his craft has, in my opinion, atrophied.

He, of course, has that right. But I, for one, am done reading his books. There's always the news if I want current events commentary. And better suspense writers if I desire an entertaining escape.
