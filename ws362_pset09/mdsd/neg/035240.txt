A dull tome, uninteresting and overpriced.  Might make a good doorstop perhaps, or be excellent for starting fires, but I wouldn't suggest the book to anyone I might run into again.  

The author seems to have only a slight grasp of the subject.  Important concepts are overlooked, and it seems to have been written for ego gratification or to drum up business, rather than to explain the concepts of asset protection.

Take a pass on this one.
