I bought this book because I thought there would be more material concerning fantasy.  Aside from the chapter "Turtles all the Way Down" there is little to do with fantasy, some chapters even have passages along the line of "fantasy maybe, but we're talking about sct-fi."

There are also several mixed messages.  One chapter says "Show, don't tell" and the next chapter says "Tell, don't show."  The book as a whole doesn't agree on issues of the importance of plot v. characters as well.

And this book needs revisions to be useful for readers and writers of the 21st century; typewriters seem obsolete and there are no websites listed.  Its a very dated book
