Being from Paris and now living in the US, I looked forward to this book.  I thought I would get a review of history and maybe find out new things.  The history is OK but very slim in many instances.  What disappointed me the most was that there were almost no pictures.  It would have been fun, for example, to have both historical illustrations and modern pictures of an area being described in this book.  Many things are described but it just is not the same as seeing it in pictures.  Most illustrations were obscure and not explained within the context of the book.

All in all, better to get two books - one on history and the other on architecture.  Trying to do justice to both does not work
