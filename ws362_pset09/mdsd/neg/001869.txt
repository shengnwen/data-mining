 The reason I have chosen to write this review is that I want express how depraved and offensive I found this book to be.

 Zacharias attempts to blame rationalism for immorality.  So, therefore if one was to follow this train of thought to natural conclusion any Philosopher who attempts comtemplate human existence rationally and logically is encouraging immorality. Excuse me??? Any thinker who after honestly engaging in serious contemplation reaches the profound realization that they cannot ethically and honestly subscribe to a belief in God lacks a moral centre.  Excuse me???  The role of the Philosopher is to search for the truth.  It clear, however, that Zachiarias' purpose is to twist the truth to trick people into subscribing to organized religion, specifically Christianity.  This is extremely obvious through his constant use of the term "anti-theist".  Instead of referring to individuals who have decided that they cannot subscribe to a belief in God as Agnostics, Atheists, or nonbelievers.  This is just one method which  Zacharias uses to go out of his way to demean and harass such indicauls by any means he can.

 The claim that all nonbelievers lack a moral centre is absolutely insaine and repugnant.  There are plenty of nonbelievers who live exceptionally moral live i.e. Oskar Schindler.  Therefore this is a completely morally bankrupt and dishonest book.
