To the point; The plot is boring, the herione is boring, the storyline and characters are not believable. Total waste of money. And a disgrace to a wonderful piece of american liturature. I am willing to read a parody, spin off, or background story based off of Mitchell's GWTW. However, Ms. Randal did a poor job and wasted good paper on this flop. She could have made this story MUCH better.
