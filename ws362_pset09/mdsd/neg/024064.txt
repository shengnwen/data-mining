I recently started reading books on theoretical phycics, so I am no expert in the field.  Nevertheless I found the book quite intersting at times but it has one major flaw that is inexcusable: no illustrations.  I guess the writer was purposely trying to confuse his readers; I mean, some parts were very easy to understand, written in layman's terms and giving good examples.  However, there are parts in the book that NEEDED drawings.  Also, the book tends to talk in circles
