OK, Buenos Aires is a spanish speaking city; but when every other word of a sentence in this book is full of spanish, it makes the book very very hard to read!!!! "Facts about Buenos Aires" is nothing but that, a list of useless facts emblished with unnecessary adjatives: "...something that differentiates Buenos Aires' people from their North American or European cousins - a striving melancholy and a desire for something greater." HM??? What we travelers want is an easy to read book, not a trash compactor, TOO much information one after another in a paragraph with vague english + foreign words is a waste. The few pictures in this book don't do justice to the city, take a look at any "paris" book out there, your response is usually "WOW, I would like to go there." after reading this book, it's like "hm... why do I want to go there?" Choose a different book; don't waste your time and money
