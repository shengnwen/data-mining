James Patterson created a great character in Alex Cross and I have faithfully followed the series even though the last several have disapponted me.  The plot and character development have become weaker with each book. Yet I kept buying the books, even knowing that Patterson is more of a franchise that an author.  
In CROSS Patterson has Alex wonder why his daughter wants to read the same book over and over.  When I read that line I realized that Patterson is making fun of his readers.  That's it for me. I'll not buy another
