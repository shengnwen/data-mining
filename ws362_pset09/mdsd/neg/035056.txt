The book is cute and well written.  The various math possibilities and problems are engagingly presented and are fun.   However, in the midst of an enviornmental speech, the sender of the penquins  says that because penquins are an endangered species, they cannot be exported.  So he "found an expensive but secret way" of getting around the law.   Buried in a delightful story is a disturbing concept: laws apply to others, not oneself, if one dislikes the law.  For this reason, I will not read it to my students, let alone my grandchildren.
