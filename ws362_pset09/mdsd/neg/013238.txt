I always make it a habit to read a book and pass it on, never expecting it to be returned.  My book is in the pocket of a plane in Paris, hopefully waiting to be thrown out.  I read, and read, and read, with my expectations never being met.  The book was shallow, unbelievable, and way too long.  She could have given her message in the first 100 pages, because there was no message.  I think that she needs to write journals in the areas that this doctor is familiar.  She should stay out of our "fiction" world.
