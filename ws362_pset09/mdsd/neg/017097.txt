I have found that this book was a weak and uncreative attempt to brand "BLUR" as a modern innovation of conducting business when it has simply re-spun and devalued traditional business practices into a dot com unsustainable ideal. This book preaches that there is little need for the tangible bottom line for the intangibles of business out weigh the value of the actual assets. That may be partially true; however, what actually happens when that model is embraced is uncontrollable corruption in the market. If you are a beginner in the business world and have trouble reading, you will find a few good business ideas and examples within the double spaced, trivially written text. However, as it was published in 1999 most of the ideas are now a BLUR of the past. There are better books out there. Don't waste your time
