I am not good at using Amazon reviews but I wrote one a few days ago about this book. I can't find the review I wrote on this site, but maybe I am not good at this.  I said the book was upside down and backwards (which was true). I'll ad mit I was not enthused with the content. Amazon did not reply to me but the author, Yali Friedman sent the 2nd edition to me with a hand-written apolgy for the poor construction of the book I bought. I think this is admirable and impressive.  I will read the second edition and maybe, if I can figure out how, provide a review.
