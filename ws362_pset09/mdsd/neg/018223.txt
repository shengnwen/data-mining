This book covered a lot of what was not on the MPRE, and very little of what was.  After studying the book, I aced the practice MPRE that was provided.  I went into the MPRE confident that I was going to do just as well.  However, the actual MPRE bore little semblance to anything I had been prepared for.  Bottom line: I'll be taking the MPRE again.  Thank you and goodbye Supreme Review, hello BarBri
