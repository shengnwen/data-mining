This story follows a young athlete as she trains for the new Olympics, which include intellectual competition and a de facto death sentence for the those who fail to take the gold. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Ah, well.  I have read of number of Larry Niven novels, and I understand the premise  that maybe a book can be just a ripping good adventure, and not a  contribution to world lit. But, ack, this was horrible. You will find the  characters cliched, the plot &quot;twists&quot; too easy to figure out, and  the ending is  either a cop out because the author had filled the requisit  number of pages, or a cheap way to prep for a sequel
