In John Coleman`s book The Committee of 300, his publisher has book advertisements for some  occultic topics; the worst being Nostradamus. Nostradamus constantly used astrology,as verified in his book preface in  &quot;The Centuries&quot;.               If a reader wants to know more  about whats going on,by a Christian source,might I recomend Dennis L.  Cuddy`s book&quot; Secret Records Revealed &quot;,or Joan Veon books.Both  very strong Christian authors
