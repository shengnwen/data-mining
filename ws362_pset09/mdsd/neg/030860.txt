We loved "One Hundred Hungry Ants", written and illustrated by the same team, but "A Remainder of One" is flawed by having language that is more advanced than the mathematical skill it is intended to teach. I would recommend it for a child who is advanced enough in language to have no problems with the meanings of words such as "former", and "infantry", and yet slow enough in math to need the lesson that 25 leaves a remainder of one when divided by 2, 3, or 4, but not 5. I spent more time explaining to my six-year-old child that the sergeant is Joe's boss, and that "former" means what he used to be but no longer is, than I spent on reading the book! The attractive block-print illustrations lack the clever jokes of those found in "One Hundred Hungry Ants", as well
