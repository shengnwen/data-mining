From the very first chapter of this book I felt put off. I had read the first two books about three years ago while I was fourteen and I had really enjoyed them. Recently I decided that I should finish the series and so I began reading 'Who I am'. The character of Cailtin seemed to me to be nothing more than another spoiled little hypocrite almost everything she said in the book was a contradiction of something said earlier. I felt that it tried to manipulate the reader into thinking that ONLY christians are good and saved and that any other religion is wrong it also put me off when it came to the issue of race and sexuality I really dont think the subject matter was handled in a responsible way. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone except a deep christian or someone over the age of 18 after they have decided THEMSELVES what is right and wrong because this book has the power to manipulate and guilt people.
