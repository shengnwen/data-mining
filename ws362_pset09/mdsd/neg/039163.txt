After having read Baldacci's "Camel Club" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really "know" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article..
