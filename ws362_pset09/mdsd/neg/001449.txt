I don't want to hate on Mr. Farley's effort. It is evident that he performed a significant amount of research and interviewed key individuals in Bob Marley's life. However, I've read just about every book and article written on Marley and with Farley's effort, I found myself reading identical quotes and stories that have already been published. 

I'll admit that Mr. Farley did a decent job of linking Marley with post-modern theories in popular music, especially Rap. But I can't honestly say that this book provided anything fresh on the Tuff Gong. 

The stories about Marley's white father raised an eyebrow and perhaps were an indication as to why Marley was so driven and motivated to have an identity in music. Though overall, the book is flat. 

If you've never read anything on Marley before this book would be interesting, but I'm an old head who has been following Marley's message for 32 years. So it might not be fair to be so critical of Mr. Farley. But when it comes to the greatest musical artist of our time, excellence is the norm. Unfortunately, this book falls short of that.
