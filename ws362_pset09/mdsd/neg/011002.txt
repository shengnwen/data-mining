I like readable prose.  This is more like poetry with meaning that must be disciphered or intuited.  I am disappointed and am sending the book back.  I bought it on the basis of the first reviewer but it didn't impress me as much.  I think it would be better to write rather than read more esoteric writing about writing.  I would pass on this one
