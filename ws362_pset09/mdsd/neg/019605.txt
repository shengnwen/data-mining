First of all, this book mentions "the heart" and strays from the truth of scripture terribly. God's word says the "heart is deceitful above all things and who can know it?" There is nothing good in our hearts, apart from Christ, and whatever "good" there might be in there comes from Him. Scripture tells us that in the last days the church will go into apostasy. This time has come like no other time before. There is a move to to throw out scripture and move past it, ignoring what God has already told us. What we need to know is in scripture--especially those things we need to know about Him and what He requires of us. This move in the church today to "feel" God and go "to a deeper level" is a reawakening of mysticism which does not belong in the body of Christ. The truth and objectives of scripture are not mystical, for a reason. Jesus Christ was and is not a mystic. This movement is called "contemplative spirituality" and it is subtle and dangerous. Sadly, even Eldredge has taken this route. How many more good authors and great men of God are going to forsake the completeness of God's word to turn inward to "self" and think they will find something new? Solomon said, "there is nothing new under the sun." The devil wants us to think we can reinvent and invent "new" outside of God's marvelous confines. We need to stick to scripture and stop reading books like these written by men who want to offer us something more than the Lord commanded us. We are treading on shaky ground, but all we need is His glorious word and to do what He said: "Keep my commandments.
