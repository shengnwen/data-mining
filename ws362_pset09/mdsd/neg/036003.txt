I was disappointed in this book.  The title is promising, however, the content is sophomoric - a rather juvenile style of writing.  This is basically a woman's journal entries, chronicling her personal growth through her reading experiences.  Her reading material is dated; there are many newer and finer sources for personal growth opportunties.  Her frequent comments of, &quot;you might not be interested in this but, . . . &quot; are tedious.  Her frequent pauses to listen to a tape and then writing, &quot;I'm back . . . &quot; are irritating.  I don't know how the editor let her get away with her repetitious non-information.  Wait, yes, I do.  The reason this book was published is the gimmick of a ninety-year-old woman writing her memoirs.  Given all that, if you need a reading list for personal growth and enjoy the ramblings of a woman who is constantly working on personal growth, then this book may be for you
