I wish I hadn't bought this book.  I love the magazine so I was hoping that the book would be like a whole bunch of the magazines condensed into one huge helpful book.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.

There weren't that many pictures with tips and most of the book seems to be a collection of comments on all the weddings Martha and her family and friends have ever had, from her grandmother to daughter to close friends.  That was a little odd.  The pictures were beautiful but not very helpful.  There really weren't too many new ideas or good tips. I was very disappointed.

As long as you don't expect this book to be like a condensed version of the magazine, you might like it.  I read the whole thing and put it on the shelf.  Hopefully I can pass it on to someone who will appreciate it at some  point
