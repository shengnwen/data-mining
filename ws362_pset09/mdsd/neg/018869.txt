After reading the reviews I was really looking forward to getting this book. And while I was reading it I was trying hard to like it. But it didn't happen. The book is more about attitude than actually what to say or do to close a sale. But attitude is real important, thats why I gave it a 2 star rating. There are some closes in here where he tells you to lie. Don't know how he does that and sleeps at night, but I'm not going to do it. If you want actuall closes read Tom Hopkins, damn good. Overall I wish I hadn't spent the time reading this and put the time in something more worthwhile. I won't be ordering the closers 2
