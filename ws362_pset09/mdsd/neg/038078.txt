I went to see this play at the Royal Court Theatre in London after having heard how good it was.  When I got out of the theatre, I felt like I had been called a horrible name by someone who didn't know me at all.  This play really seems to insinuate that men are all in some big club together and are all out to get women.  It is cheap and easy to put sexist dialogue in a man's mouth.  Lifetime does it all the time.  This is another silly play that portrays all women as courageous victims and all men as conflicted and brutal.  Gilman needs to put down the brush with which she paints such wide strokes and take a long look at something a little harder than racism or sexism.  Get real
