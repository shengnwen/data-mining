All that one can say about this book is that it's "Gothic". Yeah, right. Here are ghosts, witches, mad wives in the attic, black cats and other mandatory attributes. But probably, "gothic" decorations are not enough for a book, there should be something else. Something that I failed to find. The novel is tedious and empty. A weak attempt to create a thriller rather failed, the plot is hardly glued together, the episodes that are probably supposed to scare remind a bad horror movie that is full of dark rooms, ominous music and crazy screams, but simply does not frighten, period.

I finished the book, but it was a waste of time. If you want a good thriller by Joanne Harris, read her "Gentlemen and players" instead
