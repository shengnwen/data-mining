Let me start by saying that I have never read a deLint book before, but I've heard very good things. After reading Valiant by Holly Black I was looking for another Urban Fantasy and the Blue Girl has an intriguing plot. It lacks nothing in the imagination department and the writing of the first page drew me in immediately. 

**It went down from there. Be warned. I bought this book instead of Terry Pratchett(my heart) and was not happy with the purchase. This is going to turn toward half focused rant. Skip to the bottom for a quick summary.**

Imogene started out a great character - witty, rebellious, sort of girl I personally would befriend. But I felt as the book pregressed that deLint was out of his element portraying a high school 'punk grrl'. Her language - as if! - was hardly representative of any teenager _I_ have seen in all my 17 years, one or two curses strangely placed. Now not all teenagers curse, but most are consistent (Dang one day and damn the next?) Her life within the real world was entirely too simple. Perfect friendship, perfect boyfriend, perfect mother and brother (no arguments ever?), perfect behaviour despite having run with a gang? There's nothing to make the supporting characters likeable and only Imogene's alleged tough girl personality (I say alleged because it's apparent in word not in action) makes her interesting.

I feel part of a young adult novel is conflict, a certain amount of teen angst, some sort of realistic difficulty deLint just doesn't fully allow Imogene. Vapid bitchy cheerleader? Violent football star? The real world was never so fake and cliche.
I found it incredibly dissapointing, perhaps because of my high expectations or because I read Holly Black just before, whose teenagers I found to be on the wild side though immensly more relatable. 

Two stars for imagination - an intresting blend of fantasy themes - but no stars for characterization and real world plot
