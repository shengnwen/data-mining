Thomas M. Disch approaches what should be an engaging topic to any SF lover with a holier-than-thou attitude that is both condescending and unappealing. I purchased this book believing it would study the impact of SF on American culture-as the title suggests. Instead, Disch taints his diatribe with his own offensive bias.

Perhaps his sourest assertion is that of SF as the ultimate Boy's Club-run for and by the Men. Why, Disch is so enamored of this male-dominated theory, he proceeds to deny Mary Shelley as the true founder of the genre, and instead raises Edgar Allen Poe to the pedestal instead. His weak reason? He asserts that fewer people read Shelley than Poe. Furthermore, he credits Shelley's parents and husband as the reason behind her success at all. Because God forbid a woman might have laid the foundation for Disch's beloved genre. 

The entire book is tainted with these sort of chauvinistic opinions. What I thought would be a dissertation on SF in American culture is little more than one man's attempts to inflict his bias on the public. Spare yourself the indignation of reading such arrogant and bigoted opinions as this, you'll find nothing but rage at the ignorance of some folk
