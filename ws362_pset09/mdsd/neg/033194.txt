I was unimpressed and also left quite uniformed on several issues concerning me. A lot of words here, the authors seem quite verbose, but the words ring empty. I would say I found it difficult to find anything I wanted to locate in this work. In all actuality there was truly nothing of substance to find. Metaphorically I was left empty handed.
