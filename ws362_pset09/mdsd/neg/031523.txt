The purpose of In Love With Night is to examine both the legacy of Robert Kennedy, and America's continued fascination with his tragic family. It does this by giving a biography of the man through the lens of the times in which he lived. Particular emphasis is given on his relationships with his father and his brother Jack, but the meat of the book is the conflict between the `good Bobby' and the `bad Bobby'. According to Steel, Bobby Kennedy was not the angel everyone thought he was. No big surprise there. After all, who was the angel everyone thought they were? In the end, this book seems to be about how Ronald Steel thinks the Kennedys are overrated. Again, no big surprise. Skip this one and read any of the far better books on RFK and his family
