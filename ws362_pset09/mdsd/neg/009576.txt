I think I never want to see 
Another stanza by A.E. 
I pity now the friends of Terence, 
And eke his siblings, pets and parents.

For oh, good Lord the verse he made-- 
Too grim and too much in the shade: 
The doomstruck lad, the Severn missed, 
The Ludlow fair where he got pissed,

The London blues, the snow-hung orchard, 
Young life cut short in syntax tortured, 
And favorite of all his themes, 
The Shropshire schoolboy's martial dreams.

Brave verse to stop a soldier shirking 
By one whose work was patent-clerking. 
"Stand up, be brave, lad, if you please, 
So poets here may live at ease.

"And we shall rhyme and wring our hands 
When you're cashiered in distant lands. 
For really, 'tis not bad, the grave-- 
No care, no pain, no need to shave.

"So blah blah blah by Severnside,  
And good for you, young suicide." 
Well, he's dead too, now, old A.E. 
Arrived where he most longed to be.

What's done is done, some good, much bad, 
But still he toils, this Shropshire lad, 
Producing yet from under plow 
Some wholesome food for Shropshire cow
