This has gone too far. This is not science. This is not theology.

This is secularsciencism brainwashing forcing Scripture as reinterpreted to agree with its worldly-darwinistic conclusions and theories from godless theory-spinners like Carl Sagan, Edwin Hubble,Stephen Hawking, and earthly-wisdom educated astrophysicists.

It is a travesty when astrophysics presumes to tell the Bible what it means. Rather, the Word of God tells astrophysics to submit itself to 6 normal calendar earth-rotation days as the Genesis Workweek of the Lord as Moses understood. If Moses didn't have a PhD in astrophysics when writing Genesis and believed in a Sunday-Friday literal creation yoms of 24 hrs, then of course that's what the Bible's original intent and meaning today is.
