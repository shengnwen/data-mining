This is yet another book in a long line of books from either the far right or the far left that do nothing but try to divide the country.  There is no issue that is black and white, there are more sides to issues than just the right or left.  

This book may be for you if you are a mindless sheep who is to lazy to think for yourself.

And this is only my opinion.  Judge it for yourself.
