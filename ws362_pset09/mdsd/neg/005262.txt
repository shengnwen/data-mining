Mick Taussig's fetishism with fetishism is shown at new levels in this book.  This pomo work of fantasy is almost a parody of the stupidity with which anthropology has retreated from a world inhabited by real people with real problems to a never ending exercise in self exploration.  This book shows Taussig to care only about himself and his whims in ways betraying not only his own narcissism, but that of contemporary anthropology as it praises such self important musings while ignoring the voices of other cultures.
