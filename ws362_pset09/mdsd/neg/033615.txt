I had never read the Scarlet Pimpernel, nor seen any of the films. One day when I didn't have time to finish a chapter, I thought I'd start the Introduction. I was enjoying the mystery-style nature of the story, then, in the first three sentences of the introduction they tell you who the Scarlet Pimpernel is! I have quit reading the book because of this. I plan to start again, in hopes that their spoiler was not far off anyway, but it was a terrible let down - on par with when my sister gave away they end of "The Sixth Sense" - which I could not enjoy, knowing what the big secret was. If you get this edition - or any edition, just in case - don't read the introduction
