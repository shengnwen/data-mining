I just began the book, but I already feel angered by how poorly written, and uninformative it is so far. I have read the first few chapters, and a good chuck of Keane's included original screenplay. This screenplay is utterly awful on so many levels. The formmating it outdated. Action descriptions are often written in ways you cannot show. A total no-no. The characters are shallow. The dialogue is banal, and does not flow. Most of the time, I do not even get the sense the characters are talking to each other. As for the first few chapters, lines like "Celluloid snakes through you body." Um. What? That doesn't make sense, and mixes metaphors. Cellulod and snakes? Whoah. Followed by "Your blood runs at frames per second." Silly, just silly. Finally, "Your eyeballs are projectors." Even as a metaphor, it doesn't work. Eyeballs take in information, not project out. You get the point. Don't waste your time on this drivel. Read some other books like Blake Snyder's Save the Cat!, or How NOT to Write a Screenplay
