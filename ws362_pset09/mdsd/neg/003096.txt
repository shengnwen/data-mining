Ehrenreich is the kind of journalist I despise. One who thinks her insights are so important that it doesn't matter how much she inconveniences others to make her point.
She constantly drones about how difficult it is to find housing on the wages blue color workers earn.  The market is to tight, that oftentimes one has to use a huge percentage of one's pay to stay in hotels while looking for apartments.  Does that stop Ehrenreich from competing for those coveted apartments?  Of course not.  She has to do her research, and she is the only reliable subject she can find to satisfy her curiousity.  If jobs and apartments are so hard to come by, then leave those jobs and digs for the people who so desparately need them.  There is nothing one learns from Ehrenreich's experiences that one couldn't have learned from professional interviews of blue color workers.  But that would have taken away Ehrenreich's righteous indignation.  
Don't encourage this kind of writing.  See it for what it is. Gratuitous research that could have been easily conducted without firsthand experience.  And that while doing it, some very needy people were out of work and living in substandard housing conditions
