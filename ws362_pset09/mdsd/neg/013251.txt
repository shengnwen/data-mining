I know I'll sound like an uneducated dolt, but after you look thru the pictures once or twice, there's really not much else to do.  Don't get me wrong--it's visually quite a pleasing book, but my kids are young enough (below kindergarten) that part of the draw of bedtime is words and rhymes that we do the same way every night.  Sitting in silence and turning pages doesn't work too well with three kids, because they can't all sit in my lap at the same time.  And did I mention there's very few words??  No thanks..
