Just read Podur's review after seeing link below.  He also wrote "Although he [Deibert] tries to tiptoe round the record of Latortue and his foreign backers, Deibert sets clear pointers as to the major culprit. `Aristide had not run out of cards to play' he writes of a clash on 7 March 2004, a week after the invasion, when the ousted president was being shuttled, a virtual hostage, between African airports. A joint PNH-MINUSTAH assault on a Lavalas demonstration in September 2004 is described as `an explosion of violence by Aristide partisans'; Deibert uncritically reproduces the Latortue government's unsubstantiated--and scarcely credible--assertion that `Aristide's financial and moral support of the rebellion from South Africa' was to blame for the deaths that ensued."


Someone should also mention that Deibert has supported the Latortue dictatorship  at every turn.  No wonder that apologists for imperialism such as Michael Shifter would write a glowing review.  Shifter's Inter American Dialouge is in part funded by the World Bank which has long been after a privatiztion of Haiti's public assets! 
What the hell was seven stories press thinking???
