This book was a waste of money.  It's meant for beginners that aren't familiar with the terms and concepts of stock trading in general.  If you don't already know these terms or the basic concepts you shouldn't attempt to day trade.  If you do know these terms and concepts, then this book is a waste.  The day traders survival guide is a much better intro book and I highly recommend it over this one.  Other recommended trading books to start you off are High Probability Trading by Marcel Link and Trading for a Living by Alexander Elder
