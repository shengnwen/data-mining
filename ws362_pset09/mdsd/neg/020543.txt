I am a huge fan of the Series Of Unfortunate Events & found this book only slightly entertaining.  It in no way added anything to the series in any way.  If you have read the books & the Unauthorized biography then you have all the info you need to not waste your money on this book.  If you have not read the Unathorized Biography I would recomend spending you money on that first!
