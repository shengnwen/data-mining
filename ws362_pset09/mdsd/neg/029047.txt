Have you ever seriously regretted spending money on a book that you thought was terrible? If so, congratulations! You know how I feel. This book was lame, lame, lame. It was sooooo boring! I was actually about halfway through this book when I got bored with it and stopped reading it. It was probably three months later when I picked it back up again to finish it. Then I kinda wished I hadn't. This was like reading an attempt by your 14-year-old friend to write a novel. Man, I could have written this book! I felt like I had heard this same story like fifteen times before. I gave this book 2 stars because some of it was kinda cute, but it was so unoriginal. I have a feeling that the same problem is going to overtake teen fiction for girls in the future
