This book was really a disappointment. Some passages were lifted verbatim from her other books--which made me feel ripped off. In "Moving On," she describes how the clutter in her house got out of control to the point where she had a psychic specialist come in. The psychic said the house was "weeping." Sarah then found out soon after that her husband was having an affair and the house was "protecting" her with its clutter. That's an interesting enough story--EXCEPT that she told the exact same story in "Simple Abundance," only the person having the cluttered house problem was her friend--not Sarah. So, which story are we supposed to believe?

This book seems so thrown together. I think she should've taken another year or so to flesh it out, to use all new stories and to find a really good editor. 

I just don't feel the same about any of her books now
