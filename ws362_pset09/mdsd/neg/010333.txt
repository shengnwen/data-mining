I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the "laws" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS
