This book has been recommended in Catholic circles for some time, so I finally purchased it.  I shouldn't have.  I was very disappointed.  I didn't even crack a smile, until the chapter on trying to pray the rosary with children.  That one was hysterical!  Still, it is only a few pages out of the book.  I think the reason it falls flat is because it is so impersonal.  You never feel involved with the family.  Most stories are too vague (the children don't even have names) and focus on the setting more than the people.  I know there are a lot of glowing reviews here, but you'll probably be happier with another book.
