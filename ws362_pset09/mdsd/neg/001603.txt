I expected something much more creative. I also expected information more focused on second weddings kind of weddings. Not all the froo-froo stuff. There are a few interesting ideas; the bill of rights for weddings for grownups is great--it should have been the first thing she covered in the book. But while she says repeatedly to do it your own way, the information is geared to the very traditional wedding but without the checklists, etc. of other books. If you are looking for a traditional wedding, this book might be helpful. If you are looking for less stuffy, more individual--look for the Anti-bride Guide and Priceless Weddings Under $5,000 (and every couple, traditional or not, should find the book Bridal Bargains invaluable)
