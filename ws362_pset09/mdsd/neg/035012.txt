This is not one of Kellerman's best books.  I was so looking forward to the book coming out, but I was sadly disappointed with it.
  The premise of the story was fine, Dr. Alex Delaware receives a scrapbook in the mail containing murder scene photos. These photos bring back haunting memories to Delawares friend, Milo Sturgis, who is a homicide detective.  As a matter of fact, these photos look familiar.  This was a great way to start the story, and I was hooked, but soon it all became confusing with too many characters and in a effort to keep the identity of the killer secret til the end of the book, the plot got fuzzy.  I usually love his books, but he missed the mark on this one.
  If you are reading Kellerman for the first time, don't get this one.  If you are a returning fan, skip this one and use the 8 bucks for something better
