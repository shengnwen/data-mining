The idea of the book is great! Returning the home to the male lead role.

However, the author repeats the same aruments over, and over, and over, and OVER AGAIN!  After a while, its a REAL turn off to someone who is looking for real theological content? After all, isnt that why I buy a book, for the content?  This book was a real labor to read, repeating the same arguments over and over and over again!

Also, the book uses a big font, and the pages are double spaced.
The book would only be approx. 150 pages with a normal font and single line spacing.

This is a good topic for the book, but the content of book itsself left me asking "Why am I reading this?"  

I fianlly gave up 1/2 of the way thorough it, and started to read parts of the book here and there, instead of reading it straight thorough.    I cannot help but feel VERY DISAPPOINTED with this book.
