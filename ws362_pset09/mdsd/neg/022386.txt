I had high hopes for this series after reading the website.  Light His/Her Fire is flaunted as a replacement for marriage counselling.  If an audio cassette could fix every marriage, every marriage would be perfect.  The women's tapes suggest that the wife (or girlfriend) should give and give and forgive.  Although these are ideal attributes of a loving wife, each situation can be different and each husband is definitely different.  I listened to the women's tapes, but could not get my husband to listen to the men's tapes.  I was afraid to listen to the men's tapes for fear that I would resent him even more.  We finally saw a counsellor, who helped us a lot.  Our biggest help was from seeing our pastor.  He knew us better than the counsellor, so he was able to talk to US, not the typical wife and husband with problems.  I would not recommend buying this set at full price - it's a waste of money and could cause a divorce for spending that much without the spouse's consent.  A better relationship book is "Men are Like Waffles, Women are Like Spaghetti"
