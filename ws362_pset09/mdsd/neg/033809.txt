If you are prepared to invest a lot of time into your guidebook, there is a lot of information contained within Insight's Rome City Guide. It has detailed essays and beautiful photographs of 15 main areas within Rome. That's it for the positive.

Overall, I found the book boring and difficult to use. The key problems are:
1. The good information is buried. It is not the sort of book you can pick up, jump to a section, and get good information. It will take you a while to find what you are looking for, and then you have to read a lot of words. 

2. The writing style is very dry - similar to a textbook. All too often when reading this guidebook I drifted off and would lose my place on the page.

3. The maps are difficult to use and hard to read. I never got my bearing of Rome until I bought another book.

I gave up on this book after a while and went and got the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide to Rome. The maps are better and it's easier to read. In fact, the DK guides are an absolute pleasure to read.
