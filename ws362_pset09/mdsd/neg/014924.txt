this book gives us good info about one of 20th centuries greatest aritists but i thought it is not well-constructed. In fact i think its poorly written. i think it is not interesting for someone that knows the essential basic story gould... If this is the best bio of gould, like many reviews are saying, then i won't bother reading the other bios..
