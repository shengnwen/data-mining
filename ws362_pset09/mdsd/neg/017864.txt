This book is almost totally useless in teaching gin rummy to a relatively  new player.  It utilizes primarily an anecdotal approach using exclusively  examples from games in which the author has played.  While this may be  interesting to the author's friends and competitors, it is of little or no  interest to a member of the general public.  Do not waste your time with  this book unless you know the author
