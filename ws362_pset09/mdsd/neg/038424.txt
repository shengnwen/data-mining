Many people have mentioned the embarassing cover art to this book. I agree and it is also very misleading. The characters in the book do not even resemble those guys - the main character's love interest is an artist who looks nothing like the clean cut characters on the book jacket.

Things we can do without in gay fiction from now on:

1. A spoiled egotistical self indulgent main character. Yes this may apply to some gay guys but its just BORING now in the books.

2. A distant disapproving father and eccentric mother. YAWN

3. The flamboyant gay friend (usually black) 

First this book starts as a character study - will this selfish debt ridden loser get his act together? - then it morphs into some sort of romance (never worth your time) - then has a whole chapters about the running of an escort service (fairly interesting) and ends with a kind or frenetic black humor. It never gels.

I kept waiting for the big romance and it was incredibly lame. Was my heart supposed to be warmed about him doing threesomes with his new boyfriend and a client????

If you want a real book about running and escort agency read the MAYFLOWER MADAM's book. At least it's interesting.

If you HAVE to read a book about a selfish gay man - I recommend "California Screaming" and forget this trash.
