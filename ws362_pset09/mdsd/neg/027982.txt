Rather than growing the story further. The author created subplots that are really pointless, particularly the diatribe on this dude who want's to be king, thus affecting the war effort. But seriously, who cares. Readers want to read about how the battle between the good guys and the bad guys turns out. Not waste 50-100 pages on how the good guys are bitching about each other.

And naturally, the protagonist - Pug. After getting captured, get's trained by the enemy, absorbed into the community, and elevated to a level where he is 'above the law'. I mean, seriously, the logic is pretty flawed. 

The ending was wrapped up pretty quickly as well, and naturally, against surmounting odds, the same old formula of a 'saviour' appearing from no where that cleans up the mess and saves the day was used.
