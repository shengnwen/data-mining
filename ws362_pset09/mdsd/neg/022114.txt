The only worthwhile part of this book is the 3 pages on carbo loading.  The rest is a total waste of time.  I assumed that since the book was titled &quot;Eating for Endurance&quot; it was geared toward endurance athletes, who I assume had a certain level of knowledge when it comes to nutrition.  It appears that Ms. Coleman has targeted high school health class with this book.  Example:  she devoted an entire chapter to the 6 classes of nutrients: carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral, water.  Are you kidding me?  Like I couldn't have figured that out myself.  Any information contained in this &quot;book&quot; can be located for free in many places on the internet.  Save your money and research nutrition and/or endurance training.  Do not buy this book, please, DO NOT buy this book
