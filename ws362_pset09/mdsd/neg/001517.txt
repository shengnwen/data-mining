there's no music, as it were, in what a.s. byatt does:  i have read three of her novels now and i'm, i think, in a pretty good position to judge her stuff as utterly pretentious and banal.  read just one page of hers and compare it to a paragraph (a single sentence?!) of James Joyce.  i am an english prof--hence all the lit allusions in this novel just kinda made me sick.  she drops so many names/quotations you need an imaginary broom to sweep them away.  dreadful dreck.  you need something Englishy to read--investigate William Boyd or Julian Barnes.  byatt is like a parody of good writing.  only salman rushdie's fiction is more onanistic (though his criticism's pretty cool).  byatt is the literary equivalent of Stevie Nicks!  Icky!!!
