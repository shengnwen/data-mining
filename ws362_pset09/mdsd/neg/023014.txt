I didn't find the book very helpful.  Part of its title is &quot;creating your mission statement&quot; yet less than a third of the book is devoted to accomplishing that.  Among other things, Jones asks me to think about what my relatives wanted me to do with my life and what my parents wanted to do with theirs but didn't.  My mission is about what I want to achieve with my life, not about what my relatives wanted me to achieve with it, not about what my parents didn't achieve with theirs.  Furthermore, I think there are more rational ways to create a mission statement than picking exciting verbs and causes from some necessarily short lists.  We are multi-dimensional and I don't see how I can create a mission statement in a short single sentence that encompasses all these dimensions yet still provides me with that focus to propel me forward.  Certainly, like most of us, Jones has a family yet she offers no discussion of how one's family relates to one's mission.  I need to look for other assistance to express that central part of me that I can use to govern my future actions
