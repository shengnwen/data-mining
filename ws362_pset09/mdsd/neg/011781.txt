After reading the book "Ask and it is given" and realy enjoying these wonderful teachings I was very excited to learn that a new book is available. I could not wait to order it and the day I received it I started to read right away, in excitement  to find more teachings. Much to may dissapointment I found out the the book "The amazing Power of deliberate intent" is almost a total copy of the first book, with the same storys and even the same excercises
