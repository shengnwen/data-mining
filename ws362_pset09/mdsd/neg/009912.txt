There is precious little excitement between the pages of "My Silent War" to titillate the reader. We should remember that no spy worthy of the name would sit down and bare his soul, spilling trade secrets. Philby is no exception. Very little is revealed in "MSW". There are 3 points of minimal interest: The first is to observe how Philby jockeys and maneuvers for position in a competitive bureaucracy-the British Secret Service. That would be the same Secret Service he sold out. The second is a surprisingly strong introduction, which gives the plot context that Philby failed to provide. The third entails his brief station in Washington (circa 1950) as head of British counter-intelligence in the US. The noose closes in on fellow spies Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and the author himself. (Suspicions again arise about his '"loyalty" upon his return to England.) No point justifies the purchase price! The bottom line is that Kim Philby was a hard core Communist spy in the best Cold War tradition, He was a traitor to his country. He broke into small pieces whatever oaths he gave to England and his Queen. Added to that mix is his overtly snide contempt for his readers. (He is so much smarter than we are, you know). The best example of this is on page 193 when under suspicion in England and evading his surveillance, he meets clandestinely with his Russian handlers. "What passed there", we are informed, "is of no concern to the reader". No concern? Then why reveal the incident all! What a conceited little snob! The British have a word for books like this: "RUBBISH"
