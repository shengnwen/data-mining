Gosh, I'd hate to be a student in a Wong classroom. Wong's book is an endeavor in positivistic manipulation, a recipe guide aimed at reproducing good little consumers who never question the authority figures in the Foucauldian nightmare world Wong and his fellow behaviorists have conjured. What Wong does not seem to realize is the children he obviously sees as objects in need of control and manipulation are going to be adults with little capacity for critical thought and decision making after 13 years of suffocation in any school under the thrall of the Wong way. Add the fact that the "practical" tips in the book are completely useless in 99 percent of the public school classrooms, and the Wong book is not only a waste of money, but a real danger to students subject to teachers sucked in by Wong's platitudes
