Pat Conroy's first literary effort does provide us with far too brief glances of the writer he would become with his future efforts like The Lords of Discipline and Prince of Tides. The Boo is a biography of an Assistant Commandant of The Citadel when Conroy was enrolled at the South Carolina military college. The book does too little in the way of actual factualizations of Lt. Colonel Courvoisie's life, but chooses instead to focus on descriptions of the large amounts of memorabilia and paperwork that The Boo was involved in during his term at The Citadel.     While it is clear that Colonel Courvoisie was a fascinating individual and worthy of the respect Conroy and others have given him, the God-like status he is provided is a bit much to swallow.     I'm glad Conroy left the biogrsphy format behind and focused his future efforts on fiction. His later books are a wonderful and significant contribution to the literary world. This one can be left behind
