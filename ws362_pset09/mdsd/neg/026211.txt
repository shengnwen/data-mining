I picked this up at at quilt show because it played up the &quot;quilting&quot; angle on the cover -- but quilting is tangential, at best.  The mystery keeps you turning the pages, but I agree with the other reviewers that Benni is the empty center of the book -- the &quot;supporting&quot; characters are far more interesting.  Benni never really comes alive; she's just an annoying twerp asking questions and jumping to the wrong conclusions, only to get rescued by the more interesting characters.  I was more concerned when her dog was missing that when she was seemingly being tailed by a couple who seemed to be more (or less) than they claimed.  I doubt I'll bother with the other books in the series, and I'm a dyed-in-the-wool mystery buff (and quilter)
