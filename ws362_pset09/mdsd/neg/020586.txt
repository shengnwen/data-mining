If the authors of this book spent so much time researching (11 years according to the Kirkus Review above) then one wonders why their historical contextualization is as sloppy and superficial as it is. Let me cite one egregious example. On page 274, the authors explain that Elia Kazan's  naming names fed Joe McCarthy's ambition which resulted in the blacklisting  of the Hollywood 10. In fact, McCarthy had absolutely nothing to do with  the Hollywood 10 (who were blacklisted in 1947--McCarthy didn't rise to  fame until 1950), and Elia Kazan wasn't brought before HUAC until years  later. Any high school history textbook will be clear about this. Also, the  melodramatic quality of this book, especially in its fictionalized  dialogues, leads the reader to question whether the authors had any  intention of writing a factual book, or whether they wanted to invent a  history that was dramatic and would sell a lot of copies
