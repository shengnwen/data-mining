The plot seemed forced, contrived and just plain ridiculous.  The beginning of the book focuses a lot on the twin boys, relying on the "cute factor" but then they just disappear for the rest of the book.  Thin and unsuspenseful story line.  Romantic relationship not up to par with other Linda Howard books.  I feel cheated - was really looking forward to another satisfying LH book.  Oh well, maybe next time
