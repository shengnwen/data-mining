I've loved other Southern Living cookbooks and read some reviews that greatly overrated this book's appeal. I wasn't able to preview a copy at my library and was very unhappy with the results. Boring pedestrian recipes that might be quick and easy but look tasteless and boring. I was hoping for some quick innovative ideas but instead was presented with many recipes that involved mixing "a can of" with processed frozen foods. Yuck!!! Definitely not up to the usual standards of Southern Living
