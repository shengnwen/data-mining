I have used this book as a reference tool for a few years now.  When I take my finished product to an agent, he laughs at me and asked where I learned to write.  When I told him that I used Sceenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting by Syd Field, he laughed at me even harder.  He bascally told me that I had the BASIC concepts down, but if I wanted to follow a "good" writer he introduced me to The Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier.  

This came from the William Morris Agency, so I knew I couldn't go wrong.  He liked the story and decided to represent me if I offered him a better product.  I went home a little discouraged.  I came online to Amazon and purchased the book.  After I read it and looked over my screenplay, I saw where I made the mistakes.  

Now, I have sold a few movies/treatments and have another project being looked at by another Hollywood staple.  All thanks to Mr. Trottier.

In other words, pay out a few extra dollars to get the Screenwriters Bible and do it the "right" way
