I bought this off of the New York Public Library website.  What an utter waste of $40.  The book that comes with the software is somewhat helpful, but honestly there is no new information to anyone who has been collecting books for a while.  The worst part is the "software" that you are supposed to use to catalog your books.  First of all, it is difficult to install--this is always a sign of a inferior product: no product that was properly QA'd would be released in such condition.  Second of all, the product is just a fancy version of a spreadsheet.  I could literally use Excel or MS Access to catalog my books just as well as this software.  You actually have to input EVERY piece of data associated with a book.  There is no excuse for anyone with an Internet connection to have to manually input book data.  I state again: it is very surprising that the New York Public Library would include this product in their stores.  It is a major, major rip off and there are far superior cataloging products out there.

The product I finaly ended up using is one called Readerware (http://www.readerware.com/).  Readerware, for the same amount of money ($40), allows you to scan in the barcodes of your books--the software comes with its own CueCat scanner.  Then the software looks up the barcodes you entered, (using the Internet),  and updates each barcode with all the available info on the book. I scanned 800+ books in about 4-5 hours.  BTW, you can also use Readerware to scan in all of your DVDs and CDs, (you have to pay more to get the full version of Readware that supports books, DVDs, and CDs).

Of course, you don't have to take my recommendation to buy "Readerware", but please don't waste your money on "Your Home Library.
