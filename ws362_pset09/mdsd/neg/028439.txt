I bought this book to prepare for running my third marathon and found it to be extremely confusing, condescending and un-motivating. I have been running for years and have run many races somehow this book still managed to make me fill as if I was not worthy of running. There are great marathon training guides out there but this is not one of them. If you are looking for something that is clear and inspirational try checking out The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer
