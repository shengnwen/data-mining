I would rate this book at 0 stars if I could, but 1 star is the minimum. Just think about the fact that this book has an infinite number of pages which narrate the history of car audio, the first amplifiers and how they worked, the first transistors,bla bla bla. - All of this without explaining some usefull information such as wire connections, amp channel manipulation, etc. I bought this book but I was very disappointed. I read a lot of books about auto audio, and I must say that this book is not usefull at all, especially to beginners. Dont repeat my mistake by buying this book
