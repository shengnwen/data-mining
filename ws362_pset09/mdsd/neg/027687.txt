It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better
