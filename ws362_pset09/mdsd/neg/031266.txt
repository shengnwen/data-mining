I was blown away by Dan Simmons' Hyperion series (and I'm not a sci-fi fan), so I was eagerly anticipating this book after reading all the rapturous reviews.  I didn't find it scary, just gross - and, overall, terribly sad. It paints a horrible picture of Calcutta, with filth, vermin, death and disease everywhere.  

It probably says more about me that I have no problem whatsoever believing in vampires, ESP, monsters, ancient gods come to life, etc., but I just can't see why anyone would bring their infant to such a nasty place! ;
