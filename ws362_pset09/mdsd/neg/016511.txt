As usual, the atrophied intellect that is Allan Bloom successfully attempts to rape a classic piece of philosophy with his mediocre, lackluster, ogrish brutality, which is his norm, towards true academia, knowledge and wisdom. If Rush Limbaugh re-wrote the Constitution you'd get an idea of the ruse that masks itself analogous to Mr. Bloom's feebility towards writing and thought contained within this boorish tome.

If you just want to read the Republic as it was intended, to the best of our Anglo-Franco-Germanic understanding of the last two centuries, steer far clear of Mr. Bloom's literary abortion within these pages. 

If you further care of preserving your ability to reason, unfiltered and unprejudicially, I suggest looking into Mr. Bloom's history and agenda towards the upheaval of education, truth and attitude(s) toward integrity and intellectually honest liberty before considering wasting your hard earned currency on his insidiously dishonest dribble
