As an Iranian-Jew who grow up in Tehran and was exposed to many points the book raised, I was surprised and disappointed at how this Memoirs painted such a negative and gloomy picture of Jews in Iran. As I remember it during Shah's regime, Jews were a key group of minorities in raising the economic standard of the whole contry and themselves. Yes, there were also many Ghetto's and poor areas for Jews and all other minorities, but that was a SMALL part of the story, the bigger picture was much happier, ballanced and positive. The author failed to share that Iran in pre-revolution was a great place to live for ALL-- specially minorities!
