i was so disappointed in this book, it made me angry. It was the first time I ever wanted to rush out and buy a book and pay full price upon hearing reviews. People were gushing over this thing. While Messoud is a beautiful writer, I beg to differ. This was stinky chic-lit. I was insulted by the stereotypical characters and didn't really see any "twist" to them at all. I thought the use of the events of Sept 11 to be really blah. The characters don't seem to grow. they all just seem like whiny, pathetic, bougie snobs. I really expected more. Don't bother buying this book. Just drive by my house and pick it up out of the trash.
