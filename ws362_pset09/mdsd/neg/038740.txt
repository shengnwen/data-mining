It is terrible shame that the best affordable set of reproductions of Hildegard's images is by Fox on Fox.  His text is a series of misquotes  which misrepresents his source throughout all his commentary, juxtaposing  quotes to put words in Hildegard's mouth, often ones which would have  enraged her.  There is a costly but much better reproduction of the visions  by A. Fuhrkotter published by Turnhout, Belgium in good library collections  or for those who can afford it.  I encourage anyone interested in Hildegard  to go for the reputable scholars like Newman, Flanagan, Davies, and Hart  just to name a few
