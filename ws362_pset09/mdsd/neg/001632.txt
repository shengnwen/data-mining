Jon Katz is an idiot.  Anyone who sells him a dog better be prepared for him to kill the dog rather than deal with any issues.  Although this book is being sold as a nice dog story, it is anything but.  Jon Katz once again decides to kill his dog rather than put himself out.  (In an earlier book, he killed his supposedly beloved labs because he couldn't bear to see them anything less than 100% healthy.)  In this book, he decides to kill his supposed "soul mate" dog Devon AKA  Orson, because he does not want to be bothered to manage the dog's enviroment.  Orson bites a couple of people, and Katz decides he doesn't want to be bothered keeping the dog in an enclosed yard because it would "be a prison".  If you are a dog lover, do NOT buy this book.  You will just be pissed off by Katz's behavior.
