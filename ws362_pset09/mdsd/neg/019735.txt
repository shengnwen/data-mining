These two authors wrote another book (The Stone of Heaven) about their search for 'lost' jade and it, too, was more about them and their search than the titled mineral and its history.  After reading 'Stone of Heaven', I felt I had been conned.  Sucker that I am, I tried again with 'Amber Room', only to have that feeling confirmed.  I was hoping against hope that this book - on a subject for which there is ample historical information available elsewhere - would really be about the Amber Room.  Alas, more of the same. Save your money, look up the topic in Wikipedia and know that you have missed nothing by not reading this book.
