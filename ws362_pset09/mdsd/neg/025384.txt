Who wrote this book?  Surely not Ms. Braun. I checked out the audiobook from the library and am delighted I didn't pay good money for it. I am sorry I spent an evening listening to it though; a complete waste of time. The book has no character development, the plot (such as it is) is completely unresolved; and, finally the book just ends!  I actually backed up the playback to be sure I hadn't missed something. 


This book is a tragic end (I hope) to what was a wonderful series. Whoever edited this disappointing effort should be fired.
