And Suddenly, there was a flash..   and so starts at least 4 battle scenes.  We never learn how the task force gets it's intelligence to be where the terrorists turn up, how they get into position, what planning is done or if there is any plan.  Each time, they just suddenly appear at the right time and surprise the terrorists.  

The action in each of the battles is slow. You can almost count the minutes that the task force is standing around idle whilst the terrorists are firing away.. and of course, most of them get away each time.  

The dialogue between characters is incredibly weak and could easily have been written by a 14 year old. That is not to insult any 14 year olds, just a comparison to the language that you would expect from a young teenager of today.

Overall, extremely poor written book and boring cartoonish action.
