When I looked inside this book I was stunned and disappointed. No where in its description does it mention that it is of little use to those not teaching in a Christian/Bible/Sunday school. The ideas for moving bulletin board items away from the background are not new. The graphics are done in a style appealing to children but are useless to most teachers. Obviously, I did not read the reviews further down the page or I would never have bought the book
