Lured into purchasing the book by its phenomenal popularity in the US (I studied theology in Europe), I regret the money I spent on it. I found the author's portrayal of events not outright aggressive. Rather, he subtly undermines certain aspects of honest history and integral faith applying a modernist type of historical-critical method. Buy the Teuchle Bihlmeyer History, St. Eusebius, or Crocker's Triumph instead
