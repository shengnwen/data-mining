It's not a bad book but you don't really get what's going on until the end of the book.  I think there's a lot of empty spaces in Rayne's life.  The book jumps from the time she lost her virginity at 17/18 to her life as an adult around age 27/28.  That's a ten year gap and we all know in ten years a lot can happen.  Rayne don't trust relationships, not even with her best friend since 3rd grade, but the author never explores why she doesn't. The reader doesn't have a good understanding of Rayne's life with her mom its assumed. In a nutshell, it's one of those books that don't hold your interest so you put it down often and when you pick it back up you have no idea what's going on so you have to read back a page. Of course you finish the book just because......  Somewhere near the end I understood where the Author was trying to go with the book and appreciated the epilogue.
