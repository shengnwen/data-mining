Bought Ken Henderson's Guru's Guide to T-SQL, hoping to build on my (very) basic skills as a beginning developer.  Looked very promising and I was really looking forward to working through it using the code in the book and on the enclosed CD.  However, there is no cross-reference in the book to which files go with which code samples, resulting in a lot of hunting around to find the right files.  And then, quite a few of the code samples simply won't run.  Even with the corrections referred to in the Errata section on his website, I got many more errors than I can fix.  Between trying to find the correct sql files from the cd, and trying to fix the errors, I've pretty much abandoned the book altogether.  Not much use trying to learn from bad code.  Wouldn't spend the money on this one, if I had to do it over
