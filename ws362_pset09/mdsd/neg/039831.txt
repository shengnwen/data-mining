This book held a lot of promise for me.  As the mother of a 7 year old son with autism, I was hoping to read about how these children started on the path of intervention and therapy at a young age, and had terrific outcomes.  What I got was instead rather depressing.  First, it is not an easy book to read.  The author seems to get mired in side information, such as the use of the word "genius" for far too long, distracting from the stories of the lives of the characters.  
While I know my son will live with autism for his whole life, we always hold out hope that some of the behaviors that manifest in his place on the spectrum will be outgrown.  That did not seem to be the case for some of the people in this book.  I was very disturbed at Andre and his use of puppets as an adult.  I fully understand that as an autisic person, he needs to use whatever strategies he can to cope, and I have no judgement on him.  I can only keep working with my own child to try to lead him out of these behaviors.
I would not recommend this book to parents of young autistic children.  I think it has the ability to dash some of the hope we need to have.
