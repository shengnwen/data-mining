I have read over 30+ books on self development and this was another addition to my library. Title looked very promising so I bought this one. 

Very well written and presented in recipe book format.  It tells you what is a 'Theory' and what you need to do. 

Step 1 is the step and most important step for anyone is to clearing your mind from negative thoughts and that is a challenge. 

It wants you to clear your house physically but what about clearing and suppressing your emotions and so clearing your mind. 

It never worked for me as how can you cheat your mind and thing positively and greatly about little pains in your life like health issues or bills or recurring losses in business and still ignore the thought and let it go ?..  How can you let the thought of recurring financial loss go from your mind when you know you still have to pay that bill ??..  

Part I wants you to get rid of those negative thoughts but hey.. let's face the reality.  Who is going to pay this bill?.  Who is going to suffer?.   It is hard to let go of thoughts and fool yourself when you are experiencing the pain every day, many times in a day, perhaps every moment.  Is that a Real You??...   

I am not sure how genuine these reviews are or they are written by those who are just "fascinated by the thought that they found a great book", which works in (only ) theory but not in reality.


These principles never worked for me as if nothing works if Step I does not work.  Step I is basically 'Fool yourself and think Great, no matter what happens'

Great book but mostly impractical and it does not work .
