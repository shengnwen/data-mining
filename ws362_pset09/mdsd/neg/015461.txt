I just returned this book because I hated it.  Ugh, what a series of cheesy, pretentious remarks!  Couldn't stand from the beginning 'cos it's so boring, but esp. when I got to the point where the author began talking about some psychological issues, e.g. childhood abuses, etc., as if it's nothing.  For someone like this author, who were lucky enough to have no such experience, it may seem like a lame excuse.  I'd say it's absolutely insensitive, better shut up if you don't know much about it.  If you find this book helpful or encouraging, I guess you weren't that bad to begin with, then better off reading much worth-reading books than wasting your time with this superficial self-promotional success story book.
