This book was a complete waste of money for me.  Not only that, but I didn't even feel right about reselling it, so I threw it away.  The author picked apart the Old Testament, saying the gospels are the only part of the bible to believe.  He also talked about "Hell" as being a "realm" where the spirits of people who died were full of hate. He did not mention the fact that there is a real hell with fire, anguish and complete separation from God awaiting those who do not accept Jesus as their savior. He also said many other things that were way off.  I have heard so many stories of after death experiences that all agreed, making them believable.  However, his description wasn't even similar to the others.  I was very disappointed.
