This is the 2nd Law-of-Attraction type of book that I've read.  I bought it at the same time I bought Joe Vitale's "The Attractor Factor." After time, I have concluded that Losier's is the better book.  I've read other books since then too, and would like to upgrade my rating to three stars, but cannot change the star rating....

As I state in the title, I can't say with confidence that this whole metaphysical angle works.  I haven't had any significant successes with it. 

I can comment on Mr. Losier's presentation of the material, though: It is, in a word, bloodless.  The information isn't bad, mind you--and if there is anything to the Law of Attraction stuff, his method may well work fine. But part of the trick to making this stuff work for you is believing it will, changing the way you *feel* about your relationship to the world and to what you want from it.  This book does very little to offer inspiration.  The prose is lifeless (with some really embarrassing writing errors that an editor should have caught). 

A smattering of anecdotes revealing success stories would have added some flavor. 

The anecdotes don't prove anything, of course.  But they can serve as an inspirations.

The worksheets that you can download to accompany this book are hardly worth the effort.  There is nothing there that is any better than writing on a piece of notebook paper, or typing out on the computer.

This book isn't bad.  The instructions are clear and straightforward, and you could do worse than begin with Losier's book if you are investigating this discipline
