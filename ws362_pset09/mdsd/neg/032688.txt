I'm beginning to think I must have read a different book than everyone else. I'm not sure how anyone could give this book any kind of rave reviews. I've read some wretched literary endeavors in my time and this certainly ranks up there with the worst. Reading it was like trudging up a mountain through hundreds of feet of snow. By Chapter 4 I was ready to weep with boredom. The dialogue is hideously written. Honestly, my 6 year old could come up with more imaginative conversations than E. Lynn Harris. My money could certainly have been spent better elsewhere
