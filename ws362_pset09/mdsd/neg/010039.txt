Enjoyment of Hardison's book depends on the purpose of your reading--for leisure or credit.  I first read it as a requirement for a class I was taking and did not appreciate it on its face.  It gives a picture of 20th century art, architecture, poetry and science. It offers up interesting comparisons of artist's oddities and scientists inquisitiveness and how each prejudiced the other throughout the century. It is an interesting picture.  If you are familiar with 20th century art and technology but strive to gain a deeper understanding of culture and technological changes, this book is for you
