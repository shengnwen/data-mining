I ordered this book thinking it was new - it isn't.  She just retitled her 2004 book and re-published it.  And the 2004 book wasn't all that great to begin with - a new title won't help the contents.  When I ordered the book, it had just come out and there was nothing anywhere on the Amazon site telling me it was just a new title for her same old book (no Making Work Work reviews attached at the time).  That is definitely operating in bad faith. 

To be fair, I only write reviews when I love something or when I really think something stinks.  I thought Morgenstern's first book was one of the best organizing books I ever read. That's why I bought Making Work Work when it came out.  I didn't like it.   Was hoping when I saw this new book that it would be better - was willing to give it a chance anyhow.  Big surprise.  At least she could have revised parts or claim to have.  I've definitely been taken advantage of.  Kind of says something about an author who does stuff like this.  Maybe she could write time management tips for other authors:  save time, just retitle an old book and re-issue it. Now that's efficiency.
