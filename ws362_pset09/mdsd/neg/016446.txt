This time last year I bought Potatoes Not Prozac (PnP)after I stumbled onto the radiant recovery website.  Having suffered from mild depression for over 20 years this book gave me hope to overcome the depression and also lose the weight I gained from overeating.  I found PnP to be an excellent read because Dr D was able to clearly express the science involved in sugar sensitivity.  I have followed the plan fairly closely for the past year, and while the depression is still there, it's not as bad and I've lost 30+ pounds.  Initially I resisted purchasing YLD because I thought there wouldn't be anything new.  I should have followed my instincts.  The book is a definite disappointment - nothing much new, little or no &quot;science&quot; compared to PnP, and largely just 200+ pages of rambling.  She spends far more time telling the reader how they will feel (too many testimonials that remind me of TV advertising) than what they need to do to get there.  Too much time is spent on nonsensical topics like &quot;finding your personal style&quot;.  It seems Dr D was intent on capitalizing on the success of PnP and squeeze a few more bucks out of her readers
