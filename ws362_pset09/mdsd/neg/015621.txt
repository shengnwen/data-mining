Glenn Hammond Curtiss appears to be a fascinating and underrated participant in the development of human flight. Unfortunately, I don't feel I know much more about him after reading &quot;Unlocking The Sky&quot; than I did before.  For whatever reason, Seth Shulman seems more interested in attacking the Wright Brothers (apparrently for what could be considered simply protecting their ideas and inventions) than in describing Curtiss's acccomplishments.  I've seen many errors and unfair comments pointed out in other reviews by folks with much more knowledge of aeronautics and flight history than I have. To this list I'll add (or point out again, if its already been covered) Shulman's constant mocking of the Wrights for some of their ideas that became &quot;obsolete&quot; some time later.  Should we also mock Alexander Graham Bell because we moved on to dial telephones, touch tone phones, cordless phones, and then cell phones? Or more to the point, should we mock Curtiss for his courageous and historic flight over New York because such a flight became routine in a relatively short time?  2 stars for what information one can gleam about Curtiss from this book.  No more because of the bizarre Wright bashing.  This being said, I recommend this book along with James Tobin's &quot;To Conquer the Air&quot; (instead of using the &quot;instead of&quot; option), for two differing views of the Wright Brothers
