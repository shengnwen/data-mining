This is the second CD I bought to have my baby listen to something Italian (since I am Italian)  but again I was disappointed because the songs are translation of American ones and they do not really work in Italian... they do not rhyme and even the sounds of things are wrong!!! I do not know who did this CD, certainly not Italians who live or have lived there recentely!!! Absolutely not worth it!!! Not the music I want my baby to listen to!!
