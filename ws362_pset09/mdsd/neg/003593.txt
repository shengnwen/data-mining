This book was rather fun to read but I am not convinced that the authors have as deep an understanding of the phenomena they are writing about as they would like the readers to believe.  The book reads like a narrative, full of assertions that are not backed by rigorous analysis of hard evidence.  The authors do not critically explore causal relationships, nor do they talk about research that has done so.  They present only one particular perspective on the unfolding of events, and they do not defend this perspective against potential criticism.

My experience with economics has always reinforced the idea that causality can be difficult to establish, and can often operate in unexpected ways.  An economist must proceed skeptically, being careful to explore alternative explanations and being prepared to defend assertions with theory and data.  The authors do not seem to share this view, taking instead a more naive approach.

Maybe I was expecting too much; after all this book is meant to be accessible to non-economists.  However, making a book more accessible does not necessitate a lack of rigour or the absence of critical thought; the authors could have removed some of the redundancy in the book (their writing is far from concise!) and replaced it with explorations of alternative perspectives.  The book would be greatly enriched by adding more discussion of research that supports (or opposes) their views
