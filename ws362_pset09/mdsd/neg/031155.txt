While this book is somewhat entertaining and mysterious, it also leaves the reader in a whirlwind of overly descriptive scenery. The prose was quite heavy at times, and the book was not the quickest or most joyous read. However, Hawthorne does give his readers an amazingly picturesque and intimately detailed travelogue - if, in fact, the reader cares to read so deeply. The characters were bordering on unrealistic, difficult to symphathize with, and failed to hold my interest for very long. My opinion: only read this if you're interested in Hawthorne's work, extremely bored, on plan on comitting a crime in nineteenth-century Italy
