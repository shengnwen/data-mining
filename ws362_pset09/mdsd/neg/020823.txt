This is not the best version available of this fairytale...Stephen Carpenter's is much better.  In this version, the illustration and text don't even match.  The troll is described as having a nose as long as a poker and eyes as big as saucers...but the troll in the pictures has a bulbous nose and unremarkable eyes.  I don't know if it's an exact translation from Norwegian, but the grammar is occasionally ackward.  The metaphors in the speech given by the biggest Billy Goat to the troll have to be explained to a younger audience...which isn't bad in itself but contributes to the uneven flow in the text.  The pictures are good, too bad the writing isn't
