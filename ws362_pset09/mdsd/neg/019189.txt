This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY???
