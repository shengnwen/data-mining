I really didnt find answers to anything regarding the meaning or essence of money.  Only the authors confused philosophy.  He is obviously brought up in a Jewish household which holds money tantamount to the highest esteem one can get from life.  Money is an energy, nothing more.  I dont want to hear anymore neurotic ramblings on about this subject from this guy
