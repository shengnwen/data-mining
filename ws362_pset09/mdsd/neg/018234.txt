Nothing could be more trite and predictable that almost every detail of Above Suspicion.  If you even occasionally read crime fiction, you'll recognize every plot device and character in this novel.  This is a poorly written book, the likes of which have been published literally dozens and dozens of times before.  New cop Ms. Travis is pretty, but quite self conscious.  She is now working a tough serial-killer case (her first murder investigation), and she's really trying to live up to the memory of her father, a great police detective.  Even though she has zero experience in murder cases, she seems to consistently make breakthroughs so the investigation can move forward.

Any good assignment in this investigation is given to her, so she can flirt and blush and simper around her boss.  The chief suspect is coming onto her, and ooohh, it's so flattering that I can't ever be sure if he's bad or good!!  Ms. La Plante obviously wrote this as a made-for-TV movie script.  This should be a MIRA book on the romance-readers' summer beach-reading list.  Skip this at all costs
