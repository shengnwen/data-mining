I didn't like how the author has chosen to label the character's anxiety as his "autism".  This book conveys the message that his autism is the label of his bad feelings or his feelings that are out of control.  I wish the author had chosen a different word to describe the character's feelings, such as anger, impatience, or anxiety.  Instead, they are labeled as his "autism".

It's an uphill battle to fight against the negative impressions of autism.  My message to my kids is that their autism is part of what makes them interesting (and it's true).
