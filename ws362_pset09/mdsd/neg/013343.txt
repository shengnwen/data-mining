Junger revises his story in the final chapter inducing the reader to believe Smith is innocent and DeSalvo, although there is not one shred of evidence against him, is the probable culprit. After writing earlier that the Goldberg family lived over a mile away from the Jungers, we are told that Bessie Goldberg was the lady who lived down the street.  When the crime is first described Junger tells us that Roy Smith lied to the authorities concerning the time he left the Goldberg home.  In the last chapter Junger tells us that Roy Smith never lied to the police. Junger describes Smith as a career criminal who spent many years in prison including one 6 year term in Sing after his conviction for attempting to shoot a woman in the head at point blank range. In the final chapter Smith is canonized as a saint who according to Smith's nephew (who has never met Smith) would never kill a white woman. 
 Where are the interviews with the prosecutors and the defense attorney who have spoken on television about this book?  It would have been interesting to hear the from a surviving jury member. Alan Dershowitz said when interviewed on NBC Nightly News regarding this book, "Journalism essentially lets the facts speak for themselves.  This case has a thumb or maybe another finger or two on the scale of how it presents the facts."
