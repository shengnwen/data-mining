If you are serious about learning Japanese then don't buy this book. All of the pronunciations of the Kanji are written using romanj, which is an unnecessary crutch and will only lead to problems later on. If you really want to learn Japanese then do yourself a favor and learn the Hiragana and Katakana. Honestly it is much easier than it looks and will pay off in the long run.
