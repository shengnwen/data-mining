I ordered this book after being put on bedrest for pre-term labor and found the chapter on this subject to be anything BUT encouraging.  The author makes it sound like pre-term labor is a death sentence for your unborn baby because of the experience she had, and according to her, there is virtually no hope of having a baby anywhere near term if you have this condition.  There are other subjects in the book such as Gestational Diabetes, PIH, etc, which are less drear, and I'm sure they are of help to women experiencing these conditions, but as a whole, I was disappointed with this book.  After several chances, I stopped reading this book because of it's bleak outlook on a common pregnancy complication
