I've been fascinated with modular knitting for years and teach the technique at yarn shops.  This book has some unusual techniques to share and the designs are first-rate.  HOWEVER, there are errors galore.  I've worked my way through about 4 of the 'tutorials' and hit the wall every time due to errors in the pattern.   I had some experienced knitting friends attempt the tutorials and patterns as well and they all had the same experience--errors galore that make it impossible to execute the designs.

The author apparently wants the readers to join one of her discussion groups to get "help" with the patterns (she won't admit that the book is lousy with errata).   My feelings are that if she doesn't have the time to properly edit her book, I certainly don't have the time to join her silly discussion group.

If you like puzzles, this is a great book.  If you expect a well-written knitting book with accurate instructions, save your money and buy one of the other wonderful books on this technique on the market (Hoxbro, Luters, etc.).  My copy will probably go to the recycling bin.

PS: Sorry Iris,  I've been knitting for over 30 years and the 'problems' in this book are not due to my lack of understanding.  Get yourself a good editor
