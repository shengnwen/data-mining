I didn't find this book to be very useful at all. It was basically a short review of general dog care focussed on city living. However all the information was very breif and didn't go into very much detail. if you really want to learn more about your dog I suggest getting a book that is more focussed on just one subject. I highly suggest the book "Rover, Don't Roll Over" for positive training. This book might serve someone well as a general reference, but if you have any troubles or questions that need answering or even trouble shooting don't bother with this book. I aslo didn't like their training style, it wasn't harmful, I just don't think their particular techniques work as well as in Rover, Dont Roll Over
