I was intrigued by this book because of the glowing reports I read about it on several homeschooling websites.  The entire text is available online, so I thought I would read a section to get a feel for how it is written.  I chose a subject that I have done a great deal of research on, and was amazed that hardly a sentence in the entire section was correct.  It was full of misinformation, long discredited theories and even character slander.  I am very disappointed both in the book and in the websites that are recommending it
