Reading the book one wonders if Joseph Goldstein has read his own introduction. He tells us a very nice story how a Korean Zen monch and a Tibetan Lama misunderstand each other. So obviously there is a problem with buddhists from different traditions understanding each other. More than a thousand years of different development of Zen and Tibetan buddhism have made it difficult to define the one dharma that unites them both. And there are other schools. Now how does western Buddhism comes in? Can it perhaps help to define this one buddha dharma? Or is it perhaps inventing something new? Very interesting questions, but no answer will be found in this book. It reads much more like a traditional introduction into buddhism written by a western teacher with some emphasis on Theravada. Nothing wrong with it, I liked to read the book, but the title just does not fit. The books of Lama Surya Das are clearly superior in approaching the question of an emerging western buddhism. And hard to beat
