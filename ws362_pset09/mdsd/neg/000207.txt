Benford is one of those writers who wax hot and cold.  He is acclaimed to be a science fiction writer's &quot;scientist&quot; in that he deals with a lot of &quot;hard&quot; science.  In this case, the result is pedantic and - the ultimate sin - boring.  The main character was not exciting nor interesting - just smart.  The great experiment and the result were so-so.  I kept waiting for something - ANYTHING - to happen but soon realized that this was it..a globe that was tested, studied and explored. I am reminded of the poem...&quot;this is how the world ends - not with a bang but with a whimper.&quot
