Am I the only person who found this book to be shallow?  I actually couldn't finish it!  I got about halfway through and got tremendously irritated with two things: the first one is the author's focus on apparently gossipy details - like Tenzin Palmo's early love conquests.  It seemed an awful lot like the undertone was "Look at this woman!  She became a nun, and it's not because she was socially shunned by men!"  This introduced a note of melodrama that really doesn't suit the subject matter.

Now, the second part that really bothered me: The title of the book is "Cave in the Snow" not "Small cottage in the mountains".  I had to put the book down when I read the sentence about the DOUBLE GLAZED WINDOWS that were installed in her "cave"  COME ON!  It is amazing what she did, living in the himilayas on her own (except for those annual shipments of goods to last her the year).  I would have been interested to read about that.  But the author had to create melodrama and insinuate that Tenzin Palmo lived in a cave - the cave was bricked in, repaved, installed with a window with DOUBLE GLAZING, there was a patio out front, and a terraced garden.  
I'm not saying that Tenzin Palmo doesn't deserve all the credit that she has received - she has truly blazed a trail for all women in buddhism, however the author's attempts to create interest border on melodrama and significant inaccuracy.
