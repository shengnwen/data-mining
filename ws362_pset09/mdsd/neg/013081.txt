My husband was given this book when we first got pregnant. Don't be deceived by the title: this book is not informative at all. It is merely a collection of stories about how the author reacted to his wifes pregnancy. It is self-indulgent crap. Crider's writing style tries to be cheeky but just comes off obnoxious.

For a very humorous and informative book for new or future dads, check out the book "Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for Dads.
