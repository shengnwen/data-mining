Notwithstanding some particularly long winded (and quite passionate I might say) reviews that preceede, I would just succinctly categorize this book as a weighty collection of truisms, half-truths and spectacular untruths. Fantastic conjectures abound in Mr. Jan's book. To elaborate a little, one such conjecture appears in the title itself: "...leading Pakistan to Inevitable Demise...". Now if demise is inevitable, then what difference does it make if musharraf is leading to it? It is bound happen to anyway. The prototypical example illustrates a key aspect of Jan's Work: Its about as informative as calling a dog a dog, sort of like pop-science or pop-art.

Pakistan and its politics are complex to the point of being enigmatic. The fabric of this nation is intrictically woven from the strands of religon, ethnicity and history. And what's more, the situation is fluid. To the Western observer, its somewhat like looking into a keleidoscope. Let me assure you that it would be a complete waste of your time to wade through this trash if you really want to have a rational perspective on Pakistan and more importantly, if you really want to "know" what Musharraf is upto.
