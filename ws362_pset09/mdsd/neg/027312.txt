Speaking as someone trained in drafting, I agree with other reviwers that the drawings are pretty poor. Above all, they don't follow normal drafting practice and are confusing even to me. Given enough time, of course, someone familiar with drafting and machine work can figure it out. This is definitely not a book for a novice. In any case, for a general idea on how to build a 50 BMG, the book will at least get one headed in the right direction.

I won't hammer the author's effort too much, since he makes it clear in the intro that he is up in years, almost blind, and has Parkinson's Disease
