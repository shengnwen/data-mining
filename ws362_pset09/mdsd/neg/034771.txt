&quot;A Medieval Feast&quot; is a children's book on a feast held during the Middle Ages.  Since I was looking for a book on Medieval Cookery, and this title came up, I purchased it.  I shouldn't have.  It's a picture book  for young children, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with Medieval  recipes or cookery.  If It wouldn't cost me the price of the book in  shipping, I'd send it back.  However, for children who would like a story  with a Medieval flare, this book is perfect for them, with lovely  illustrations by ALIKI
