I was disappointed in this book when I received it.  I was looking for ways to make my H.S. History class more exciting, but I found that most of the suggestions in the book were geared more for the elementary school  levels.  The format of the book is set-up more like a comic book than an  academic book and is filled with cartoon drawings and funny sayings.   Although it was fun to read, I really did not feel that I acquired any  useful knowledge from it
