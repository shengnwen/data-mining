This book was written in 1921.  Read by my grandmother, mother, and now myself.  My Grandmother gave me her copy. My mother always said how she would have loved having a lunch box with compartments like Elnora's.  My grandparents were pioneers in Southern Alberta and times were tough and money sparce. School was not free and it was hard work getting there.  This book shows us how to focus on what is important and what it takes to get there. Though Elnora is fictional, there were thousands of young women trying to get educated in that time period. Thank you Gene for a beautifully written story of triumph and love
