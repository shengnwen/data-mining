Peter Novak certainly has some interesting theories, however there are a couple reasons why you should save your money:
1) The man is insane. Peter Novak lost much of his credibility with  the online community when he offered to do astrology readings for many people and then ended up telling them all they were going to die within 15 years. He told them this even though many had specifically asked him not to reveal any such information relating to death. This was at best, highly unprofessional and at worst, a sick joke. Either way it destroyed much of this authors credibility.
2) Most everything in this book can be read on the authors website for free. Any search engine can find it readily enough and you'll have no need to purchase this book after visiting.
3) The author's theory is a work in progress that he constantly revises & updates which he then uses to sell future book releases. This particular book is one of the outdated versions.
