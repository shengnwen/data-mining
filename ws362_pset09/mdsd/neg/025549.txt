Next to Branson's "Screw It, Lets Do It", the most poorly written book (short or long) I have ever read. Like his "Screw It..." book, appears Branson got this one published only because he owns the publishing company. Ditto from my review of his "Screw It..." book -- appears making a few bucks on his earlier "Virginity" book made him think he could rephrase content and sell as two more books with more or less merely different titles.  Apparently Branson runs his business world better than he writes.
