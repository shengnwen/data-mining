I like this author, the Hot Zone was a marvelous book and the fiction version was not that bad.  These were the only two reasons I picked up this book.   The description of the book sounded somewhat interesting, but without the author I would have passed on it.   In hindsight that was a mistake.  The author really did try his best to make a business case study more aptly used in a college class then a mass publication book, interesting to read.  He could not pull it off.   The good flow of the book and the fact that it at least tries to keep you interested is due to the skill of author.   Yes there is a lot of detail about this new form of making sheets of steel, but unless you are in the industry or a gluten for punishment I would stay away from the book
