This isn't really a book. It is a magazine article with expanded type to make is seem like a book. I can't imagine a worse author of how to deal with the international scene than the guy who thought it was a good idea to fund interational terrorists in the hopes of drawing the Soviet Union into Afghanisatn and creating a Soviet "Vietnam". While he may now claim credit for being able to walk the streets of his native Poland because the Soviet Union collapsed, he really has no idea of what he is talking about. Just like the New York Times gets to pick people to write on its Op-ed page, regardless of whether they know what they are talking about, Carter picked this blowhard to head up national security for the USA, and we will pay the price in thousand of American lives for generations to come. This "book" is an insult to anyone who knows two cents worth of current international affairs.
