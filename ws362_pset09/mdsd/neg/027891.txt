The first third of the book was interesting in a Tom Clancy-esqe near future meets the past with a bang sort of way.

However, after the inital encounter, no one from 1942 behaves the way that real Allied leaders would have behaved in 1942. The task force from the future had enough information and firepower to take out the leadership of all the Axis powers *easily* and likely end the war immediately, yet they do nothing of the sort. 

But that would mean no sequel books
