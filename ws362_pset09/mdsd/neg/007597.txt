This book was very bizarre. It was recommended by a friend who said it was her favorite book of all time. I honestly couldn't wait until it was over and I almost stopped reading before page 50. A soulless, scentless perfumer in 18th century France becomes a serial killer in order to extract the unique scents of his victims and create the ultimate perfume. The point of the book (if there is one at all) is that human beings are nothing more than easily manipulated animals, victims of our own instincts and physical desires, and that our arrogance of anthropological superiority is an illusion.
