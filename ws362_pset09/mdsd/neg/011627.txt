Most of the other reviews have said it well, this book is a total waste of time and I wouldn't have told my wife to get this for me for x-mas had I seen who the &quot;authors&quot; were (I was basing my want for the book based on the title which sounded like it could have been very cool) Most of the &quot;myths&quot; aren't, has some very bad, inacurate and distorted facts, poor writing,  I could go on and on---I think the only reason I even finished it (mostly when taking a crap) is for the laughs I got on how stupid and ludicrous it was---If I could give this a negative star I would, in fact it pisses me off that I have to give this 1 star ---don't buy any Beatle book by these &quot;authors&quot;  they all stink
