This was a neat concept for a book, but sometimes concepts are better left undeveloped. Huler's attempt at a series of essays fails to capture the true meaning of what it means to be a Browns fan. The book's plain cover is for once a viable avenue in which to judge the rest of the work. Segmented books masquerading as novels are often a hard sell, as are collections of essays. This book is both. The highlight of the entire work is Martin Mull's afterword.
