After listening to and enjoying Charlaine Harris's Grave Sights on audiotape, I headed to my library to check out her other books.  I'd read good reviews here of the Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire series, so I began with Dead Until Dark.  I must say that I found this book's prose stilted and the dialogue and plot somewhat juvenile.  I found Sookie and her vampire boyfriend, Bill to be shallow characters and the plot vapid compared to those of Harper Connelly and her brother, Tolliver in Grave Sights.  In the future, if I want to read about vampires I'll stick with Laurell Hamilton's edgy and well written Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter novels.
