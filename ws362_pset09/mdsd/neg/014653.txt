This book is dizzying and very disappointing.  It is mostly a compilation of run on sentences.  The summation on the back cover claims that Chasing the Gender Dream "has all the answers".  This is a telltale sign given the most renowned physicians do not even make this claim.  The author was SO OBSESSED with having a girl that after 2 sons she became fixated on conceiving her "Gender Dream".  The author documents her "long/hard" journey - ultimately choosing Micro-Sort,a high-tech gender selection (the answer to her fixation), "got her girl" and was so ecstatic that she published her "notes" and conversations with others in the gender selection dilemma.  There is no new factual information for those who keep up with this topic.  If you are serious about gender selection, stick to books written by MDs and medical professionals
