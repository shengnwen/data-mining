Simply put, this is one of the books that shattered Schlesinger's credibility as a legitimate historian once and for all.  Once he was "Artie," the precocious high-flying historian/prodigy, amazing his peers & elders with his dazzling talents as an author & scholar.  Now he is a superannuated peddler of Camelot nostalgia and a defender of a school of thought that has been so thoroughly discredited over the years that it truly is a wonder that anyone takes Schlesinger seriously anymore.  Really, the only author/historian that is worse in this field is possibly Manchester.

How can anyone regard this stuff as serious history?  It is as though Schlesinger has sustained a sort of man-crush on JFK for all these years and cannot bring himself to be even remotely objective about a rather undistinguished administration.   He really contributes nothing to this field of study, so save yourself the effort of reading this tripe
