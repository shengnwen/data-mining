For somebody who was not alive in JFK's time, this seemed like a great way to get a feel for the politics and history of the 1960s.  This approach, though, gives only a few minutes, five at most, of each speech and so the  listener gets a famous highlight, but no depth of experience.  I am excited  about the primary exposure, but much more content and length is necessary  for this to be of much use to a serious fan of history or politics
