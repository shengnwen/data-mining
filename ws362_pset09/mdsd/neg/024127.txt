Conservatives will probably dislike it.  Liberals will find it a good, fresh rally 'round the liberal flagpole.  I'm a liberal, so it was fun for me.  But have you noticed how the word &quot;community&quot; is becoming the new flashword among liberals?  &quot;We are all in this together,&quot; says Mario, so we had better take care of ourselves.  Like Hillary Clinton's &quot;It Takes a Village.&quot;  The use of &quot;community&quot; is like the use of &quot;opportunity&quot; by the conservatives.  Both are code words for points of view that, taken to their extremes, can be far more detrimental than helpful.  Americans ultimately prefer the middle.  Just remember that, folks, and no one will get hurt
