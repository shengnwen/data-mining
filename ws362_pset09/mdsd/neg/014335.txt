Were Remembrance Day simply a thriller I would rate it five stars. It is fast-paced and some neat science is woven into a suspenseful plot. Its deadly pyrotechnics and interesting locales suggest that its targeted market is viewers rather than readers.
Its great defect is in its misrepresentation of the Anglo-Irish conflict. It assumes that the reader is fully disinformed by Brit propaganda. In reality, Ireland's 834 years of Brit rule has been one long genocide varying only in its intensity. Liz I, Cromwell and Victoria each murdered more than half of Ireland's population. The author presents ex-IRA-man Lindow as an ex-terrorist. He depicts Lindow's Irish mother as evil to the extent that she is a patriot. As antitoxins to such gross propaganda buy Ten Men Dead or Eye-Witness Bloody Sunday or (Sutton's) Index of Deaths From the Conflict in Ireland. Author Porter is refuted by the official murder record. For example; wwwdotterrorismirelanddotcom shows that, of the 173 child-murders in this post-1969 phase, 20 were by Irish forces; 153 by Brit forces - the actual terrorists.
