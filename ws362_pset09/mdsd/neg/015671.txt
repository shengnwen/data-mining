After reading Ms.Henrion's first book and utilizing her herbal remedies as  well as relaxation techniques I found my health greatly improved. I was  eager to learn more and looked forward to reading Healing Alternatives for  Beginners. Like her first book it is  very concise and easy to read. I do  miss the teddy bears from her first book but the affirmations scattered  through out the book are great. I like that the information presented is  backed by research as well as Kay's personal experiences. Highly recommend  this book to anyone who is fed up with &quot;traditional&quot; medicine  where we pop a pill for anything and everything that ails us
