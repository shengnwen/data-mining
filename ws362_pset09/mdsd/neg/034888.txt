This book is completely worthless.  I bought it for a class only because I had to.  It doesn't have anything in it that's not already common sense.  I didn't learn anything except for a few new-fangled terms for stuff that I, or for that matter anyone who's ever held a job, already know.  If you are looking to improve your management skills, don't waste your time with this book
