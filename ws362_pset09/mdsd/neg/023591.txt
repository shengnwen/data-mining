Amazon.com praises this book:  "Her examples are fascinating and eclectic--including anecdotes about A-list leaders such as Hillary Clinton and Paramount Chair Sherry Lansing."    Yes.  Very eclectic?   A Clinton and Hollywood?   Hardly.  

This book is obviously getting renewed interest in order to help the Hillary project.    Women long ago closed the leadership gap in most fields.    And Condi Rice has closed it at the national administration level.
