im moving over from vb to c#, so naturally I would like to see examples written in c# so I can get the semantics down.

This book does not do that.  Half in c#, half in vb, fully useless.

Next time release 2 versions of the book.  Or better yet, write some of it in vb, some in c#, some in python, some in perl...
