I can't believe my sister owns this book.  No wonder her life is such a wreck.  What can you expect when you try to meet men by getting plastic surgery, never returning their calls, use sex as a weapon of control, and so forth.  Read GOD IS A WOMAN: DATING DISASTERS for real good advice and to really undestand how guys think.  Also, A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR THE BOYFRIEND is good but that's more for when you are in a relationship.
