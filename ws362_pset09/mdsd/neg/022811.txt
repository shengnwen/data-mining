Generally, MS-Press Self Paced Second Edition books are good. Especially they did a great job on 290 and 291. This book, however, is an exception. This book does not cover many exam areas at all, and I am not talking nuances. There is no mentioning in this book about PKI certificate archival (new feature in Server 2003 family, well tested on 293 exam), or the GC placement, and several other areas. Those subjects that are covered in the book, are not covered in depths, in fact, they look like poor summaries and will not prep you for the exam in any way, nor will they prepare you for real life situations. Author jumps around same topics and is not able to clearly explain most of them. Practices are not worth installing a fresh copy of Server. There are no good "Exam Tips", like in other MS-Press books. I doubt that Craig actually took this exam.  
I understand that no exam preparation book alone is enough to prepare for the exam, but those that I read so far, did a pretty good job on it. I was able to ACE several Microsoft exams using Self Paced guides and Testout videos. 
This book tried to trick me into thinking that 293 exam was peace-of-cake. It is not! Do not be fooled. Exam is probably as hard as 291. It may seem easier after taking 291, but without that preparation 293 would be close to impossible to pass for the first time. Yes, it is in some ways similar to 291, but it covers whole bunch of different topics, and focuses on a different agenda. This book will not help you pass the exam. Book is a joke.
