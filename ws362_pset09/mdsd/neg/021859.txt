I thought the book was a bit tedious. The authors spent a good deal of time laying out concepts and brain chemistry and describing various psychiatric disorders.  The portion on the wellness program, I felt was just skimmed over briefly.  They also tend to spend a good deal of time addressing the need for medications and don't go into any detail about what might work for a person for whom medications have proven to be ineffective
