Three baby owls awake one night to find their mother gone. Alone in the dark and understandably frightened, the older babies discuss where she may be while the youngest cries, "I want my mommy!"  Mom owl finally appears and assures her babies that she will always come back. Although this book addresses a common concept familiar to toddlers and pre-schoolers-Will Mommy come back if she leaves?-I have to say that it should have remained a picture book. Although the black ink and watercolor crosshatched illustrations on a black background are very realistic, they set an ominous tone that, in tandem with the plot, I am not certain should be introduced to very young children; at least not introduced before bed time..
