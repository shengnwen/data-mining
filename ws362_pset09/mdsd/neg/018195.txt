I would agree with most of the negative reviews this book has received so far, and history has indeed been re-written. While Mick Taylor's role in the Stones' career could not be overstated, it is Bill Wyman's virtual absence that is the most shocking.  Most of the band's shots from the 70's, but especially the 80's and 90's seem to deliberately leave him out.  This is insulting to any self-respecting Stones fan and quite a disappointment (although not a complete surprise).  As everyone knows, Bill was an original member of the band and his career as a Stone lasted almost 40 years.  The Mick'n'Keef show could never have existed without the steadfast rythm section that anchored the band throughout most of its history.  Shame on the other Stones for going out their way to practically eliminate Bill Wyman from this biography.  And who exactly does Mick Jagger think he is fooling when he sings about neo-cons, then proceeds to pick Ameriquest, one of the worst predatory lenders in America, as a tour sponsor?  Who said the Stones aged gracefully?  Get Bill's book instead.
