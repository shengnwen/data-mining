This book was a new choice from our professor who was teaching our mechanism design class. In my opinion, the three authors who wrote it each took a section and slapped their parts together. Totally different writing style as you go throught the book. In addition t is a small book and you constanlty are turning pages to makes references to figures which makes it hard to read with good flw. n addition a lot of the diagrams are unclear and dont necessarily say what they represent. Our professor ended up hating the book himself. A good reference maybe but not for the beginner
