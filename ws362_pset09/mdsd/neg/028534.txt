This book is such a downer.  Besides the ridiculous sibling rivalry between two grown-up sisters, and all of the complicated problems between Julie & Romeo's families, we have an eight-year old, Sarah, running the show in Julie's house.  Besides watching Charlie & the Chocolate Factory endlessly, she manipulates adults in to buying her lottery tickets!!  They have their very own Veruca Salt living in that house!!  

If you want to read a depressing story about an extremely dysfunctional family and a woman with no backbone, this is the book for you.  It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first one.
