People wrote books like this about the "mysteries" of invention decades ago, without shedding any more light on the process than Schwartz's lightweight contribution to the genre. Only recently have inventors and engineers in the West learned of Genrich Altshuller's Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (which also goes by the Russian acronym TRIZ), based on an intensive study of the principles implicit in mainly Soviet-era patents, though also incorporating information from patents in other countries. TRIZ shows how the haphazard "methods" traditionally used by inventors waste time and resources, whereas the algorithm developed by Altshuller and his colleagues parses away the irrelevant information and identifies the exact "technical contradiction" the inventor has to resolve, along with a matrix of techniques for tackling it. 

Yet neither Schwartz nor the American inventors he interviewed in his book reveal an awareness of Altshuller's revolutionary discoveries. "Juice" comes across to me like a popular physics book published in the early 21st Century that shows a complete ignorance of developments in 20th Century physics like quantum mechanics and general relativity. Borrow it from the library, if you must read it, but don't waste your money otherwise
