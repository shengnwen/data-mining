MacKinnon writes with smoothe, poetic prose, that disguises her petulant and arrogantly low estimation of the average women.  The logical flaws only start there.  The book is deeply myopic in its interpretation of history,  just as Marx's work (MacKinnon's ideal) was.  I recommend it only because  of the woefully influential effect it is having on the U.S. judicial system  - know thine enemy
