I have been using this book for six months in two different courses, and have nearly completed it.

While the content is fine, the number of errata in this book should not be tolerated. 

On the book's web page, numerous errata are listed, but there are many more that have not been reported or compiled.  While trying to study this book, the errata keep getting in the way of understanding the material, as there are wrong equations, bad tables, etc. 

This book is in its tenth printing, and it is simply inexcusable that this many errata are allowed to remain in the book after so many printings.

Another reviewer (an educator who has the edition with answers in the back) mentioned the number of incorrect answers in the educators edition as well. 

So, if you have a choice, look elsewhere for an elementary surveying text. The authors and/or publishers of this one obviously do not care enough to correct the numerous errors which confuse the student
