I enjoyed Dick's short stories and was expecting the same quality from those in this book, i.e. an engaging plot and interesting characters. Scenes play out tediously with characters and their mind chatter ceaselessly flowing (to a point where it becomes annoying) with bits and pieces of information and occasional dialogue that tries to move whatever plot there is along. There were numerous characters none of which were very interesting or that one could attach affection to. It got to a point three quarters of the way in that I said to myself "Who really cares what happens?"
It's really a person's preference whether this type of fiction is page turning or not, as some have said, for me it was not. This was hard labor to get through and it's books like these that make me wonder whether reading a novel is worthwhile, because I for one dislike wasting time with nonsense. Fortunately it's a forgettable piece that I'll probably have no recollection of reading a year from now, thank goodness for that. 
From now on I'll be more careful with what I buy that's written by Philip K. Dick.
