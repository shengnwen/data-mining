After reading all of the reviews on this book I was left confused by the extreme selection of critiques. After seeing the beautiful carrot cakes on the cover I decided this could hardly be the work of a "sloppy" decorator and went ahead and ordered. What can I say, the cover most definitely does not reflect the level of work inside, which can only be described as ..well.. sloppy! My 12 year old daughter had produced better looking cookies than these!! I can't say anything about the recipes because quite frankly none of them inspired me to try. The only thing that interested me was the explanation on how to make checkerboard or pinwheel cookies, but I didn't need to buy a book just for that. So, if you're undecided about whether to purchase this book as I was, my advice is save your money
