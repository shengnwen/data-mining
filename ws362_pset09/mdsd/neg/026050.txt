There is some helpful advice here on the basics, but nothing that one could not find elsewhere.  Additionally, this book leaves one with the impression that the authors are not trying to help young men become gentlemen, but rather how to appear to be gentlemen whilst getting away with behavior that is distinctly ungentlemanly.  

Because of the unsettling and slightly slimy feeling one gets from reading it, it occurs to me that Eddie Haskell might have been at least an editorial consultant, if not the author.
