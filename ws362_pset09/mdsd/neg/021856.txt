I, along with several others from my adult and aging class, purchased this book because we were under the impression that it was actually the BOOK. We were all excited that we were saving about $100 dollars to buy this book from you.  The picture shown was the exact same as the book that is required for the course. It wasn't mentioned that it was a workbook to accompany the text book.  For future buyers, maybe you should change the picture to the book you are actually going to sell people so you don't fool them as you did my class
