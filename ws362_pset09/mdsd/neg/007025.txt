This is a useful cookbook for reference, but it is not something that I feel is absolutely necessary in my cooking library. As a regular cook and a breast cancer patient, I found the recipes to be basic modifications of ordinary recipes. 

If you are struggling with a specific side effect of cancer, then this book does offer helpful organization of foods/recipes for that purpose. It is useful in that way. On the other hand, I think most cancer patients find a core group of foods that they tolerate well, and stick with them through treatment. Also, talking with other patients and reading internet articles has been more useful to me than this cookbook. Sorry -- but I really think this is just another way to market something to cancer patients. We're vulnerable once we're diagnosed, so watch out.
