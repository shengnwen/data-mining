Being authoritative enough to convince people in the writing business is essential and Drosnin does that and he has "experts" to back him up, but why do we need a code anyway?  A little bit of research and you'll find that all these ideas about the future are already out there. There is no doubt the world is going to hell in a hand-basket.   Mankind has always been on the brink of war or at war, continuously.  Nothing new and few will be surprised if we blow each other up.  

Books like these are just another way to generate an income for both writer and publisher while the going is good - they can't lose if wrong because the money's already been made and author's always can leave themselves a back door, in this case something like a catch-22 phrase inferring more than one possible future, etc., etc. to cover themselves.  Ultimately this books sells fear.  This is a market rich in opportunities these days.  We need more books on practical solutions to the human problem.  The book is sensationalism trying to be serious. If one considers themselves a genuine Christian, this subject is useless to waste time over.
