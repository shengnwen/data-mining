Future War would have been a great work of fiction.  It's intriguing subject matter and there are some really entertaining scenarios that would keep you turning pages long into the night.

However.  If you're in the market for a well-researched, factual account, you should probably look elsewhere, especially if you are, like myself, a relative new-comer to the whole non-lethal weapons field.

Col. Alexander gets some extraordinary things wrong.  He uses Ruby Ridge as an example of law enforcement gone wrong and to point up the need for non-lethal alternatives to lethal force.  No arguments there.  But he must have been thinking of a different Ruby Ridge, because in this one, Kevin Harris doesn't survive.  I found that interesting, seeing as how Kevin Harris ended up giving a report to the FBI and getting tried in a court of law after the standoff ended.  Reports of his death in this book are greatly exaggerated.

Col. Alexander would also like us to believe that Tazers don't burn.  Even in the Nineties, law enforcement was aware that Tazers burn the skin.  Several court cases have included evidence of the burn patterns unique to different models of stun guns.  He also seems to take great pleasure in claiming that they are never lethal, which is an interesting claim to make about something meant to deliver tens of thousands of volts of electricity into the human body.  "Never" is a word that an ostensibly learned man should not have employed to describe such a weapon, even given the state of knowledge in the 90s.  

I won't spend this space dissecting the plethora of other errors I've found.  I just want to present a caution to anyone incautious enough to buy this book: before getting excited about any one claim, make sure you get the facts from another source.  You can't trust this book to be right
