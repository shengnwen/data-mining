It's a wonder how people (99% anonymous) can write glowing reviews of this book and throw around words casually like "compelling", "powerful", etc. It's also a shame to see people so blindly read the INTERPRETATION of what this woman read as being her grandmother's history. 

Another point about this novel - Who cares! It's a book about her supposed discovery of her heritage, of which she researches, writes, gets published and gets paid for. Does your story really warrant a book? Why don't the lot of us do exactly as Ms. Lee does and discover our own lost heritage, write about it, and package it as our own [insert background title here]? Apparently since her publishing, the likes of which people strangely lap up and call "amazing", Lee is now on the lecture circuit, going from one university to another lecturing on this. Is this for real? Is she now a certified expert in Korean history? Do not pass Go, do not collect your PH.D in History, instead write a fictitious book based on archival information and go straight to expert? Give me a break. This book is contrived. 


1/5 stars.
