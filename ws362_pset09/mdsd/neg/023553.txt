I was looking forward to this book as Martina's story is a fascinating one, but the book didn't deliver what I expected.  It is quite badly written and seems to jerk along from topic to topic.  I didn't feel connected to the author in any way when reading it and it ended up being "just another book about diet and exercise" with nothing really new or inspiring
