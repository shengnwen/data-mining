This is my first review mainly because it's the only one where I found my perspective to be dramatically different than the other reviewers.  I bought the audio version based on the reviews I read on line and was looking forward to reading a new author.  What I found is a book that is full of cliches and choppy dialogue.  Although it's a very quick read I found myself frustrated with the ridiculous dialogue and characters that failed to keep my interest.  I must confess that I did find myself laughing out loud at some of the very bad cliches.  I will qualify my review by stating that this was an audiobook and I found the reader to be very poor, using accents for different characters that were wildly exaggerated.  It could be the reader's characterization that amplified the poor writing.  Needless to say I will not be reading any other Swain books
