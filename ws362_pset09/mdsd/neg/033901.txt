This book is giving me a headache to read.  It is like being in an alternative reality -the reality described by the narrative character is should I say bent, warped, beyond bizarre...  Not sure why I am continuing to read this book?  I should probably skip to the back chapter so I can find out if the main character is actually suffering from a mental illness which alters her view of reality since there is nothing similar to a normal reality in this book.  I should probably have written this review after I finished this book, but I'm not sure I am going to be able to finish reading it.  It is truely bizarre - just  strange.  FYI - this is my first review - Reading the reviews for this book prompted me to write. I have to say I can't believe anyone would find anything desirable to read in this book.  It is truly a puzzling book.  My questions for the author is "What were you thinking?"  "What am I missing?"  I just don't get it.  The only reason I may continue to struggle to read it is to see not what happens in the story but if there is really a story.  It is so disjointed. . .I would love to be a fly on the wall listening to a book club discuss this book.  That is how strange this book is
