I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on. 

I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life
