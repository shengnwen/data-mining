The previous reviews are quite accurate, and should be read before deciding to purchase. For my part, I was overall content with the book, since I was more interested in the ship statistics and some of the "historical" descriptions than the artwork, so the admittedly disappointing nature of the ship renderings did not put me off as badly. However, the omission of key ships (see below) was a major disappointment, particularly galling was the insistence on describing things I could care less about, such as the Midas Array, "worker bees", etc. If one is going to limit oneself to 128 pages and 30 ships, then perhaps a little more common sense ought to have been devoted to selecting which "ships" to describe!

Another problem I had with some of the more exotic alien ships was a lack of information on their statistics, especially the Species 8472 bioship. While one cannot reveal all secrets, having everything listed as "unknown" is more than a little unsatisfying. At the least simply state observed qualities (i.e. maximum warp (observed) 9.46) or something similar.

I also agree that the line drawings of the ships were not as useful as they could have been. I would suggest either replacing or perhaps augmenting them with more standard 3 view drawings (front, profile, and top) as are given in the Star Fleet Technical Manual, for example.

It is my sincerest hope that a revised and heavily expanded 2nd edition will be released. Should the author(s) read this, here are some glaring omissions in need of being added:
- Excelsior class
- Ambassador class
- Constellation class
- Oberth class
- Daedalus class
- Borg cube
- Borg sphere
- Borg tactical cube
- Enterprise NX-01
- Klingon Negh'Var battleship
- K'Vort class cruiser

Very nice and much appreciated additions would be:
- Vulcan ships from Enterprise
- Klingon ships from Enterprise (a number of new designs are in evidence)
- The Romulan ship from Enterprise (the minefield episode)
- Other Earth ships from Enterprise (particularly the 2nd season finale)
- "Kobyashi Maru" Neutronic Fuel carrier
- Freighter destroyed in STIII by Bird of Prey
- Tholian ships
- Kazon ship

In spite of the unflattering reviews, this is a neat little book. For the price (on Amazon, that is), it is not a terribly bad buy. Wouldn't pay any more for it, though! However, there is much room for improvement, and I fervently hope the authors will take it upon themselves to release a vastly enhanced manual in the near future.
