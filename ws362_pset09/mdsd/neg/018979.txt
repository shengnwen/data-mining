This book really is controversial.  I would suggest more research and self education because some of the information provided is just not true!  It gives a neat perspective on things but not a book to use for diagnosis!  I would suggest supplemental reading if you are serious about your health.  I found a great report on Inner Health available at librarydepot.com  It includes a nutrition benefits chart that links nutritional support needed to many diseases/disorders
