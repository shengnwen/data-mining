I'm a huge fan of Ted Dekkar, but lately I've noticed that his books have been lacking. Showdown was a wonderful read, and I was completely engrossed in it, thinking I would feel the same about SAINT I bought it. I think the most dissapointing about this book was that it was actually a sequel to Showdown, yet you don't know it till halfway through. I found this completely rediculous, and even though the story was somewhat interesting at times, it never really seemed to go anywhere...and never really ended either. There is never any true complete ending, and it leaves you feeling like you read a whole bunch of words instead of an actual story
