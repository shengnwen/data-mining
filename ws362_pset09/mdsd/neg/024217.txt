I found this book to be relentlessly wretched:  An endless stream of negativity as an abusive 'mother' lies to and disappoints her children, exposing them to pain and danger.  The payoff of Angel overcoming a bad situation was not impressive enough to warrant the emotional meat-grinder you have to go through to get there.  "Engaging" in the same way that rubber-necking a fatal car wreck is 'engaging'(for those to whom it is).  "Bad" should not be mistaken for "deep."  I don't care what awards it has won, be willing to admit this emperor has no clothes!
