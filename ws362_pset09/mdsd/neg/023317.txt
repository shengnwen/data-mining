I used this book for a fluid mech course and I thought this book is terrible.  The derivations of the equations are though but that doesn't make up for what this book lacks.  The problems are quite difficult since the material covered in the chapters doesn't match what the questions ask.  I don't expect a textbook to entertain me but this one put me to sleep a lot.  There are (literally) hundreds of references to video clips demonstrating different topics covered but they weren't put on the included CD.  And speaking of the CD, it is completely worthless.  Don't even bother wasting your time looking at it since it contains very little useful information.  There are a few more detailed explanations of a few of the topics in a few chapters but that is it.  There is no real meat there.  I gave this book 2 stars only because I did like the thoroughness of the derivations other than that this book is a waste of your time and money.  And if one opinion may not count out of a class of 35 about half of us hated the book (it was doubtful the other half had even read it).  If you have to use this book, good luck
