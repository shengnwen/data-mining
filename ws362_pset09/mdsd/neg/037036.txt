Being a fledgling opponent of strong AI, I picked up this book hoping to learn the weaknesses of the strong AI argument. Alas, this was the wrong book to pick up.

I am not even sure what Penrose's main argument is; of course it may be there but was lost in the 450 pages of mostly irrelevant details on physics. To say in the least, his attack is not coherent or well structured. He seems to admit that his position is very vulnerable himself: he constantly admits to mere speculation and weakness of evidence on his part. 

If he abridged this book to may 100 or 200 pages, it may have been more effective. When I was half way through, I nearly quit reading because I could tell he was going nowhere, but I figured if I had already wasted this much time, I might was well finish it. I regret that decision now. 

TENM may be just another example of a grandiose physicist touting an interesting subject like modern physics as accessible to the layman. If it is accessible, Penrose is not the one to do it. There seems to be a market for these pop physics books (i.e. Elegant Universe) because yuppies out there want a feeling of wonderment about things they don't understand. How much they actually get from these  books questionable. 

In the end, Penrose somehow wants to say that modern physics presents an obstacle for strong AI. I hope there are books out there that actually might show this
