I like Jo Beverley and the Mallorens, but this one was quite boring.  If Genova was so good looking why does she seem so insecure?  After all, she was engaged to be married and broke someone's heart. Why don't we see that she is attractive to other men and that Ashart is jealous. There was too little tension between the lovers and too little passion, for me.  Also, too much about old ladies
