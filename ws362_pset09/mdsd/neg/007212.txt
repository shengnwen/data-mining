As the reviewer from Jackhorn, KY stated, this book lacks original research.  If you read the section on the "house church movement" and then go to the website for The Homechurch Homepage, you will see that Mr. Wolfe hacked away at many of the articles on the site to obtain his "research."  For the many quotes he used from the website, not once were any of the authors contacted by Mr. Wolfe in order to do any original research.
