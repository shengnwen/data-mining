Being an art history major and having read numerous books on 17th and 18th art, I found Minor's work to be one of the least helpful or accessible.  He arranges his text by subjects instead of chronologically or by artist or by country.  Though an interesting approach, it makes it difficult to follow the development of the arts through the centuries.  Anyone really interested in Baroque art and culture should look instead to Julius Held and Donald Posner's classic text
