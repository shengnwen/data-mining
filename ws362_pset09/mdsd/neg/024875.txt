I'm more than mid-way in this novel.. I'm struggling to finish it. 
the core of the story is fine. I mean a man looking for his son. 
but the temptation of the writer to make this book into a history book of south africa is killingly borring. 
and what's whith the repeated parts ! no one needs to read the same paragraph twice! 

I've heard soooo much about this book that got me interested into it. now I wish I just continued being interested without reading it. 

seriously, know the main part. which u can know from the back of the book
