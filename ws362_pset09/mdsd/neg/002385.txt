I agree with the review posted by darkgenius below. The book simply does not provide enough documentation for its claims. Many of the stories seem to rest on the slenderest foundations. For instance, the authors recount a tale of George Washington encountering a ghost - or angel - at Valley Forge in 1778. This lengthy, detailed narrative, written in a pseudo-Biblical style, is attributed to Washington himself. However, we then learn that Washington didn't write it, after all - it was written up by a &quot;young aide, Anthony Sherman, who many years later, in 1859, retold the account&quot; to a reporter. So what we have is a second-hand story circulated 81 years after the alleged event (and bearing obvious references to the Civil War - astoundingly prophetic in 1778, but not so remarkable in 1859, when the war was imminent). Things get worse as the book continues. Nostradamus is dragged into the discussion. We hear of a ghost story reported by &quot;an unnamed source&quot; in &quot;a national tabloid.&quot; The Bible Code makes an appearance. All credibility is lost. In the Foreword, Joel Martin says, &quot;We wanted this book to be more than merely a collection of anecdotes.&quot; They failed
