This book's patterns are seriously flawed.  My attempt to follow the "outdoor snuggly" for a 0-3 month old baby resulted in a 32 inch waistline snuggly with legs that were too long and arms that were too short.  In addition, the photos of the snuggly did not match the pattern's instructions.  My cousin used the baby poncho pattern and had a myriad of similar problems.  Do NOT buy this book
