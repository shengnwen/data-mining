This book should have a warning on the cover which states "Most material in this book will offend non-Christians." The author used what could have been a wonderful resource for homeschooling families as a soapbox for her own fanatical religious views. 

Because many families do homescool for religious reasons, I have come to expect a religious slant to most books on the subject. Most authors, however, are able to present the material so that their writing is able to relay useful information without infuriating the reader. If I wrote a secular homeschooling guide and ripped apart Christianity the way this author does to non-Christian thinking, I would probably have trouble getting it published and receive bags of Christian hate-mail if it were published.

This one is going out with the recycling as I wouldn't want to subject anyone else. I received no valuable information from this book.
