First off, this book's not even by Spider. I'm not vertain why he lent his name to it, much less wrote the introduction. The book itself is a loosely connected series of ramblings of a proto-typical dope-fiend from the 60's  San Francisco scene. It's a bit trippy, and even mildly insightful once is  a while, but was certainly not worth picking up if you're expecting  anything like the quality of writing and storytelling that Spider Robinson  imparts to all of _his_ works
