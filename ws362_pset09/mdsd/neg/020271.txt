I was very interested in ayurveda and how it can make your skin look and feel better. After reading many reviews and researching the topic a bit, i decided to buy this book. And was very dissapointed. The information in the book itself is very good and useful but the style in which the book is written is horrible. Getting through the first chapter alone was impossible.  In fact I only read 2 complete chapters of the book. After that i skimed the book... it was the only way i could stay awake. Also the book seems to advertise the author's products. That is not the job of a book. All in all i would never recommend this book to anyone ... i considered it a complete waste of money. Lets face it if u can get a book with the same information plus a better and more interesting writing style, why not get it? Why stick to this book? my advice: move on, look at the other books
