The pages are interesting glimpses of possibilities on "the other side". This is a book of artwork presenting different points of view of an illustration.  The book starts with drawings of how to make a paper airplane.  The next illustration is a little girl practicing a cello and seeing a paper airplane fly past her window.  Turn the page to see the air outside of the apartment building filled with paper airplanes which a little boy has thrown out of the window.  I really enjoyed looking at that idea of "the other side".  It got strange from there as disconnected scenarios trying to be connected are presented.  I couldn't quite figure it all out from front to back; back to front; and middle to outside even with the help of friends.  I concluded that it was just different illustrations. I found myself "on the other side" and I didn't get it.
