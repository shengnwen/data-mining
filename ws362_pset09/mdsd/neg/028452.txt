I was disappointed in The Writers Guide to Everyday Life in Regency and Victorian England, but gave this one a try.  Unfortunately, I think the editors of these books are just lazy when it comes to information.  Both  books covered history with broad generalizations.  There are some useful  items in both, but both are poorly laid out and badly written
