How anyone can believe that there is a power to help people live a long life
goes beyond my comprehension. This is what Estes claims in this book. What about those who live short lives?
The whole book is geared at American middle-class readers who in general, even though 
 they have college-education, are very naive. The language is that of the fairy-tale, or close to it,
 which suits a tv-fed and tv-indoctrinated people. Estes says that pain will clarify everything.
 I pained myself through her book and nothing was clarified
