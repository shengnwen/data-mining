Berger is anything but readable.  To start with, any given sentence in the book contains anywhere from one to five neologisms the author himself has spawned (most likely in a laughable attempt at clarity).  Sentences like &quot;the nominizing act intends a comprehensive order of all items that may be linguistically objectivated, that is, intends a totalizing nomos&quot;, is among one of thousands of obscure artifacts of Berger's logic-gears that serve to make this book, in three simple words, *anything* but readable.  I award it five stars for containing excellent ideas, and subtract four for managing to render them virtually indecipherable
