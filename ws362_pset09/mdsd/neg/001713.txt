There is no doubt that Elizabeth George is a marvelous writer. I have previously read and own all of her novels. Prequels can be interesting reads in many cases, but this isn't one of them. Writing in dialect is a dangerous chance a writer takes because it makes for a difficult, often boring read. This novel is 548 pages of tedious dialect representative of a lower class that is well done enough to draw us into the sad story and begin to understand how they speak. I'm sorry but it is much more than I want to know. As a mystery buff, I read for enjoyment and the suspense of the story--NOT in order to raise my social consciousness. This novel is NOT a good choice for a fan of George's work. I wish I hadn't bought it
