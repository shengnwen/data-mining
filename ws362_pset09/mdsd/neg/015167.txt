This was a book that discussed art, and tried too hard to be a work of art itself.  Most of the characters were flat and unlikable.  The author takes us into three time periods, one melodramatic (the life of Chatterton), one boring (the life of Wallace), and one surreal (the life of Wychwood). 
On the positive, I did learn more about Chatterton, and had more of a feel for what it would have been like to feel the way Romantics felt.  But all in all, I couldn't wait for this book to be over.
