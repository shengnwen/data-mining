I just finished the 4th chapter and took the review test. Like all the other chapters, I missed 50%. I might as well be studying klingon. I barely have a clue what they are talking about. I'm A+, Network+ certified, using study guides from Que publishing. These study guides were a walk in the park compared to Linux+ from Sybex. I'll go ahead and finish the book because I paid good money for it, but I can see now, I'll never pass the exam with this study guide. This guide was written for people who already know Linux, not for someone trying to figure it out. If you already know Linux, this guide would be great reference material, as it has hundreds of commands and switchs, but very vague explanations of what these commands and switchs do. I'm also using CBT Nuggets Linux+ video training and have Red Hat 9 installed on a box I built from scratch. Even with all this, I'm still only obtaining about 50% of what I'm studying. I'll still need more and better explanation of linux to ever pass the exam
