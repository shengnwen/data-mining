Of all the Anna Pigion books I have read, this is the worst. The charecters are shallow and stiff, the dialog stillted and meaningless, and the park is not well described and in no way seems like a place one would like to visit. This mystery seems to be a big &quot;so what&quot;. Not nearly up to Ms Barr's best efforts
