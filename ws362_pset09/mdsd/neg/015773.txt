I've read quite a bit of Zen literature, including translations of the original sutras, koans, etc. but I'm most disappointed in this tape. The tape, and I assume the book, has the quality of a harangue, with the reader constantly admonishing the listener.  Much of the tape has the form, . . .&quot;and if you don't understand this, you will never understand anything about Zen.&quot;  After a while, it grows tiring.  Buddha didn't phrase his lectures as cryptic, snide criticisms of his audiences capacity for enlightenment, and that's how this tape comes across. In contrast, listen to &quot;The Teachings of Zen: Master Dogen&quot; for a deep and empathic description of Zen philosophy
