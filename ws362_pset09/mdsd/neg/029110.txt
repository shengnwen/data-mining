I recall reading 'Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine' in the '80s, and discovering quite a few of the now long out of print paperback anthologies, which purported to be 'edited' by Hitchcock himself, along with ghost-written introductions. All of this was in the manner of the classic 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' TV series, with which the magazine is the longest-lived tie-in.
The glory days of the magazine(and the anthologies) were filled with short, concise, suspenseful little tales in which the bad guy would reach a suitable end, with an appropriate  twist of fate (and plot). 
Only a few such stories are in evidence in this volume, perhaps because the best work has already been reprinted in numerous places.
This 'comprehensive' 50th-anniversary collection suffers from the same problem as  many anthologies, with perhaps a few too many riches. Although there are a few well-known authors, and some occasional nuggets among the stories, nothing in particular sticks in the memory, and in fact, skipping a few stories altogether won't make too much difference. 
The 'Hitchcock' magazine has somewhow managed to last half a century, so it must be doing something to satisfy a (relatively) small but loyal audience. As an example of a declining breed-the a short story anthology magazine-this is worth browsing through as a curiousity, but the reader would probably be better served to dig deeper into the works of the reprsented authors. I get the feeling all are capable of better things in a different forum
