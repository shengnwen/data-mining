I learned about the "Diamond Method" from Tony Robbin's Living Health seminar and of course I now wish I had done some research before I wasted my money (on both Living Health and Fit for Life).

Turns out the diet is based on Natural Hygiene pseudoscience. You may lose weight following it, it is a diet after all, but everything you "learn" about food-combinding, fermentation etc. is factually wrong.

Amazon has a great selection of books on diet, this isn't one.

Do some research before you jump on the bandwagon. Here's a start: http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/fitforlife.htm
