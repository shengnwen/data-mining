Although Neilsen has a lot of good information in here, the information is hidden beneath layers of writing. Every point is repeated several times, and the author is incredibly wordy. As a professional writer, it astounds  me that someone could go on about usability without having the faintest  idea of how to make his own writing usable. If edited properly, this volume  could be reduced to half the size and give exactly the same information.  The passive voice just about slaughters this book. One gets the impression  that the author thinks he must write in this boring, textbook style in  order to be considered &quot;The Book&quot; in the industry. This is  unfortunate, because many readers simply won't make it through this book,  despite the important information it has to impart
