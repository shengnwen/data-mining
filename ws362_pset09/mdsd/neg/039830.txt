ended too quickly and with too much left unsaid.

The first 200 pages or so were very interesting with great plot and character development.  The characters were really well done, and their interaction with each other was very enjoyable.  

Then everything abruptly changed.  The author dedicated the book to a pet she lost during the book, and I have to wonder if that happened around page 200.  In the last 100 pages, suddenly, the rug gets pulled out from underneath the reader and everything is tied up very fast and messily.  

It really feels like this book should have been at least another 100 pages in length, with more in depth exploration of the characters and slower resolution to the conflicts that she'd developed.  Instead, everything goes to hell in the course of 4 chapters or so.  

There is also no closure to the story of the main character.  After things go to hell, before there is any attempt at recovery or damage control by the main character, we pick up with a couple of minor characters and the book then ends.

All in all it started out as a very good read, but ended off leaving me feeling like I needed to read the last 100 pages again in a desperate attempt to try and glean some meaning from the car wreck it turned into
