I look for two things from a self-help book or tape.  First it should motivate me to make changes in some parts of my life.  Second, it should give me some practical tips on how to make those changes.  This tape fails in both respects.  While the stories are of Keith Harrell's life are impressive, I often found them difficult to apply to my own situation.  And his suggestions on how to improve attitude were vague and didn't give me enough to hold on to.  There were some valuable sections on these tapes, but overall I was disappointed
