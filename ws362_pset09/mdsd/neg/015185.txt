I find it hard to believe that the author has even visited Cuba, let alone lived there. Not being an American, I have legally spent quite a bit of time in Havana myself - and not as a tourist, either - and there are so many glaring inconsistencies between this book and the realities it describes, I would have sworn it was written by someone who was only going on third-party descriptions and their own wild imagination.

Jineterismo is indeed a gaping wound in Cuban society, but it certainly doesn't work the way this book describes it - quite far from it. There is a lot of uncommon ground between Cuban-style jineterismo and generic western-type prostitution, and this author's take is remarkably closer to the second one. To give an example: no Cuban jinetera would be "sitting by herself" anywhere, let alone at a "cafe near the Habana Libre Hotel," and with a "stack of papers" in front of her no less. That picture is straight out of the US, and anyone doing said things in Cuba would never, ever be mistaken for anything other than a foreigner, not even by the naivest American tourist. More importantly, the jineteras sell romance more than they sell sex, which is amongst the most alluring things about them. One may pay them, but one is always left with the impression that they're being generous and "helping out" someone with whom they had a good time, not contemptuously paying a professional for services rendered as described in the book.

The book may be enjoyable as a read - I don't know, as personally I was unable to finish it for being so annoyed with the false picture it paints. My own impression is that it is naive and rather sophomoric. If you do choose to read it, please keep in mind it is pure fiction. If a literary glimpse into modern-day Cuba (shocking underworld included) is what you're after, there are far better books out there by Cuban authors, and even an excellent relevant collection of short stories and book excerpts
