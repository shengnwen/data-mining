If you are looking for a book that will take you through the SQL standard, explaining what each part means and how to use each feature, then you need to look elsewhere. If you are an expert SQL user, and interested in some of the intimate detail of the standard, for example the way time and dates work, and why they work the way they do, this may well be the book for you, but it?s still expensive for the number of pages. If you known the basics well already, and want to become a power SQL user, then I?d recommend Joe Celko's SQL for Smartie
