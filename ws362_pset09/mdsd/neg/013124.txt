Wow. Henry Rollins is kind of an idiot. That actually surprised me. I was really looking forward to reading this. I was severely disappointed. It'd be sad to read about the never ending misery of his chosen life as the singer of one of the most esteemed punk bands ever (yeah, tough life pal), if it weren't so apparent that he brings it all upon himself with a tunnel vision that ignores anything outside his head (yeah, that's a song). We don't hear much at all about his bandmates, the bands Black Flag played with, interesting people he met or uh ... stories. The pearls revealed are things like, "People hurt. Things hurt. It just hurts. Alone doesn't always work ... together doesn't work well either." or "I died. Not much going on.(?!)" Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie a break! Hey! There are other people in the world besides Henry Rollins! Try talking to some! The self-love/hate this guy has for himself is just ridiculous. It really becomes funny after a while to see how into himself he is while ignoring everyone around him. It's like reading a typical teenage diary or the journal of a confused caveman. Everything is redundant and lacking in any insight. Boring. Stupid. I'm all for self-exploration and trying to come to terms with the human condition, etc., but I can't find any sympathy for Mr. Rollin's pain. Some people just love being a Martyr. Ha ha.
