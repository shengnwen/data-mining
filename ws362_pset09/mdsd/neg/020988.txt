I cannot believe how bad this book is, and I am only on page 94! It is a pointless, rambling piece of garbage. There is no point. Nothing. I am such a huge fan of the movie that I decided to read the book, and I am sorry I did.  The movie moved along at a good pace and was fascinating to watch. It was funny, depraved, interesting and horrorfic.  The book just rambles along.  If you want something that gives ou information on name-brand clothes, restaurants, perfumes, colognes and hair gels and interesting places to visit, this is the book for you. If you are intetested in reading an interesting story, don't waste your time. This book sucks. Go see the movie. Nine out of ten times, the book is always better than the movie - not this one! The book cannot even compare to it
