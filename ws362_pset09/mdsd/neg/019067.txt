I was pleased with the orginal edition of The Secret World of 007 and felt this was worth getting for the updates. But to say this book has been updated with Die Another Day "and Casino Royale" is deceptive. The Die Another Day section is nice and complete, but the Casino Royale section is only 2 pages and not even presented in the same style as the other sections -- no "mission to Madagascar" or anything. Just a large pic of Craig and the Aston Martin spread across both pages and the film title (and a few smaller pics -- all of which we've seen). I was expecting cutaways of the casino and Venice house, etc. Nothing. So this book is updated with Die Another Day. That's all. Factor this into your decision to buy
