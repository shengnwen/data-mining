I received this book as a Christmas gift because I was interested in the Laci/Connor Peterson case. I'll admit that although I followed the case for a good amount of time, I stopped paying attention to news coverage once I found out about Amber and Scott's relationship. The whole thing disgusted me so I stopped watching/reading the news. When I got this book I was thrilled because I figured it would be neat to hear Amber's side of the story.

This book goes into detail everything about Amber's life, before Scott came along, during, and after. Amber uses this book to defend herself from the media's attacks on her personal life. I find it disturbing that she makes herself out to be a good, Christian girl (mentioning it several times throughout the book) and yet she admits to doing pretty "anti-Christian" things. She also defends her relationship with Scott, claiming that the two of them were in love, although she also says that she knew that he lied to her about his relationship with Laci. She portrays herself as a victim in this case yet she contradicts herself in so many ways. 

If you don't know much about the Laci Peterson case, I suggest you read this book. As a warning, however, I will let you know that after reading this book you will have a strong dislike for Amber. And she certainly brings it on herself
