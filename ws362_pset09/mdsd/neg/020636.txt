Alas, I've joined the group of dispointed consumers! I love Alton Brown, but this so called &quot;book&quot; is less (WAY less) than steller. I actually saw this at Chapters for $1.99 and couldn't bring myself to part with the Twoonie required to purchase it. All the previous reviews sun up my feelings - but I just had to add my two cents
