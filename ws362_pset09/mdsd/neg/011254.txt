I am not inclined to read self-help books, but out of respect for the person who gave me this book I started to read it. After 100 pages I was gripped with a negative thought I could not shake, and that was that I would spend more time out of my valuable life reading this book.

This book is filled with infantile thoughts and sentences. Examples: "Thoughts are powerful"; "Positive thoughts...have positive results", "Negative thoughts...produce negative results..." People pay money for this kind of writing? This is the kind of writing that generates good reviews?

The author also opens up this book with an elementary and incorrect, from my viewpoint as a biologist, discussion of the flight or fight response. He incorrectly incorporates the flight or fight response, and its associated physiological changes, into our daily lives.

In short, this book is nothing more than a grab bag of quotations from other people, some common sense, and a few pleasantries mixed in with some text to hold it all together. There are many, many excellent books of literature, science, or history available. Do yourself a favor and save your money for those.
