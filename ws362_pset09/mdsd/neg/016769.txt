This biography on the Wrights is a confused mess.  Adams tells the story by visitng locations where the Wrights made history, but during these travels we learn more about his modern day random encounters than what the Wrights actually did there.  Adams goes on for pages about capturing moths, a boy and his heroic dog, and other such tales which have nothing to do with the Wrights.

This biography also neglects describe the Wrights childhood and what might have made them the brilliant engineers they became.  The book really focuses on everything after the Kitty Hawk flight.  This is its biggest strength in describing how they traveled the world to show everyone their flying machine, including moments of triumph and tragedy.

The book finds down by focussing on the Wrights' sisters love affair.  I got the feeling that the author felt their needed to be a romance somewhere in the book, and since the Wrights were more focussed on machines than women that he needed to waste our time with this barely relevant affair
