If you're not a Universalist Asatru, you will probably NOT like this book.  There are far to many instances of the author going on about this or that which can NOT be verified by any records of the Germanic people.  In truth, much of these ideas are New Age in origin and Wiccan in practice.  While there is nothing wrong with Wicca, and I have no problem with Universalist Asatru, the book does and extremely poor job of pointing out where historical fact starts and Personal Gnosis starts.

Galina Krasskova seems to be fairly knowledgable on Germanic religion, but her writing style makes it extremely difficult for a newcomer to assertain where the lore stops and Galina starts.  And the long-time student will know the information in this book already.

It may serve the Universalist community well, as well as Galina's own Kindred.  However, it didn't come close to serving my purposes at all
