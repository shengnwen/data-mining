I got this book for undergrad because it had a perfect score back then and I needed something to help explain my required textbook. I admit it helped to a certain extent but not by much! However, in grad school it didn't really tell me anything new. The author I think over explains things, which depending on the subject in quantum can be needed but often times can be boring! While this author does try and explain a lot and I can't fault him for that this book gets a low rating because it fell apart on me in the middle of the semester and it fell apart on my fellow students too! Be forwarned that if you buy this book chances are pretty good that it will fall apart on you too! So while it may have a good intro and stuff this book is just destine to break apart. In retrospect, giving this book 2 stars may be generous
