 About this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing. For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food, for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child. But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil. 
                                           --Hebrews 5:11-14

I picked this book up because I've heard the author speak and have much respect for him; he is smart and well-spoken.  But I was sorely disappointed by this book.  Its advice is shallow and tired; I've heard it all before a hundred times.   It's not bad advice, it's just... milk.  The same old basic things any pastor includes in a sermon on marriage: listen to your parents, love is a choice, die to yourself, etc.  Blah blah blah.  

Worse yet, his use of scripture is shallow and questionable.  He's one of those authors that offers an interpretation of scripture that might be true as if it is inarguably true.  I need the arguments.  I want to be convinced.  

I suppose there's nothing wrong with milk.  Certainly there are people who need it before they can get to solid food.  But I expected more from Mr. Zacharias.  

(Disclaimer: I only made it through 100 pages of this book - which is more than halfway - before I decided there would be better ways to spend my time.)
