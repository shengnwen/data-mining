I had never read a novel by Tom Wolfe, and I certainly won't read another one.  Tom Wolfe is so out of touch with Southern culture, youth culture, and the 21st century that I actually felt embarassed for him.  With impressive diligence, Wolfe painstakingly mapped out the Southern dialogue for the reader with complete disregard for Georgia's actual dialect.  Hey Tom, not every Southerner sounds like a 19th century Savannah plantation owner.  Secondly, at times, I actually became physically uncomfortable with Wolfe's attempt to manufacture rap songs and names of rap artists.  In fact, his book seemed to be a never-ending stream of stereotypes elaborated with self-indulgent purple prose. Third, where was the middle-class?  Virtually every character was either "living on the hill" or "by the railroad tracks".  Wolfe focused on only the most superficial aspects of Atlanta culture--including his tedious and pointless descriptions of downtown Atlanta.  Finally, when I crawled my way across 800 pages, it seemed that Wolfe just gave up on any kind of ending; a former tycoon became a Stoic Evangelist (give me a break!), a convict turned himself over to the police...The End.
