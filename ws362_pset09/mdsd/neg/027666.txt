I enjoyed Beverly's first bookm as well as the film based on it.  This book resembles the first only in occasional vivid passages.  What ever became of quality editors?  Donofrio thanks two in her acknowledgments, but why?  They passed on a text that is wildly unstructured.  The Medjugorje trip simply doesn't work as a structural device.  On p. 195 we read of a congregation in San Luciano that &quot;over twelve centuries ago, ... was entrusted to Brazilian monks.&quot;  Apparently Christianity made it to Brazil in the 8th century, about 7 centuries before Columbus!  A silly mistake, but that's what editors are for.  This is Viking Press!  BTW, why, without explanation, is her junkie husband Raymond Boudreau in the first book, but Stephen Budrow in this one?  Beverly is talented, but truly needs some writing discipline -- and better editors
