Evidently the Pequots didn't speak with this guy. I can see why. The book is really tendentious. I'd suggest instead &quot;Hitting The Jackpot&quot; by a former Washington Post reporter. I heard about it in the local newspaper and it's very good. Much more informed and balanced and powerful. Whichever book you like, get educated on this
