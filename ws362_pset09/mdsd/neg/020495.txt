The author of this book likes to complain about why the &quot;folk art&quot; of Information Security and the &quot;CIA foundation&quot; is currently missing the mark. After the first four chapters I was more than  aware of the author's opinions on this. I wasted too much of my time  reading what is wrong  and not enough time on making it right. There is  useful info in this book, you just have to get through the pessimistic  viewpoints
