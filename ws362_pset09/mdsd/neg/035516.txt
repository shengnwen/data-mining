I've worked on SoC's and do not consider myself an expert but this book is not worth the money.  From the title you would expect this book to be about design and test of SoC's.  The author does not present any new or insightful design techniques or testing strategys that a person who has designed an ASIC before does not know.  He covers basic rules in very general terms with out real specific details.  The books seem to be just an ad-hoc hodge podge of every day asic guidelines that are summerized in 200+ pages. Even if you have never designed an ASIC before this book would not help you it is way to general and very vague.  I would invest in talking to an ASIC designer in one's company. This books is not worth the money even for the new ASIC designer
