The CD-ROM that comes with the book is almost completely worthless.  Some idiot decided it would be cute to use Flash for the interface.  The result is something pretty but impossible to use.

When you search colleges, they are listed five per page (yes, five).  If you try to print them, you only get five colleges.  For sixty colleges, that's twelve pages, whereas everything could have been on one page.

They give you no ability to sort the data and getting the data into a form that you could use in a spreadsheet seems a formidable task.

They also fail to include any quality ranking in the search criteria other than the very broad and inconclusive competitiveness rating.

They have gone out of their way to cripple the product
