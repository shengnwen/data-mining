this book is okay for a beginners intro to iran but it misconstrues completely some of the facts of iranian history.  mossdaegh did NOT assume dicatatorial powers, and at times it seems that ms mackey feels sympathy for the shah.  the crimes of SAVAK, the shah's secret police, arent well documented either.  dont waste your money- I recommend THE LAST GREAT REVOLUTION by Robin wright or PERSIAN MIRRORS by Elaine Sciolin
