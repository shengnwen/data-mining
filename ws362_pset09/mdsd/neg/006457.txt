I bought this book on a whim while stocking up on "current events" titles.   I couldn't get past page 30.  If you like sentences, meaning sentences like this one where the writer interjects a second thought before finishing the first thought of the sentence, where there are lots of commas and you have to study the sentence to get the point, then I think you'll like this book.  For me it is an utter chore and a bore to read. The book is full of subjective reasoning with little bother to support anything.  It's the type of book where I have to read each paragraph 10 times because my mind is wandering after the first couple statements.  Oh, what, I didn't understand that.  Hmmmph... it must be true.  Too bad I just didn't peruse the first couple of pages before buying it because I never would have bought it then.  A great book to read and tell yourself how smart you are for reading it.  And just to give you an idea about myself, I'm an eight year college grad. So I am capable of understanding the book.  However I will not be understanding it because I refuse to read anymore
