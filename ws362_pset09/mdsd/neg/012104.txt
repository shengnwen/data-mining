If you're looking for a novel with accurate historical reference, this is not it. Not only does he claim George Custer was killed in the Civil War, he places Lee's surrender at Monocacy Church, Maryland on August 31, 1863 (something I'll bet would have been welcome news to those that fought until 1865). The book is riddled with mistakes and omissions. Not what you would expect from a former Speaker of the House and a professor of history
