Because Hinton's is the first Joni Mitchell biography I've digested, I was hoping for something that didn't leave a cheap, plastic taste in my mouth.  The known parts of her life that are inspiring to me were reduced to banal fodder mentioned in passing, while darker aspects became reasons for the author to step up to her vehement defense--these outbursts were nauseating and usually at the expense of someone else, leaving many questions largely unresolved.  Hinton tends to shuffle back and forth between regurgitation of objective fact and jarring personal opinion.  Incidentally, I like what one reviewer said about this book reading "like a last-minute book report".  The fact that he completely destroys my favorite JM album in his woefully amaturish musical critiques doesn't help either.  This book does not do justice to an artist such as Mitchell
