The premise of the book seems to be that you won't recover all of the money you spend on improvements let alone make any.  The book references remodeling magazine as a source of obtaining a dollar cost and value added.  Again, cost is always higher than value added.  

Another fitting title might be "improve the value of your home by 100,000 dollars while spending 130,000 to do it!"

I strongly recommend that people read through the table of contents and possibily skim through it if you have the opportunity.  Read one of the chapters and you'll see what I mean, then decide if it's right for you.  Most of the chapters follow the same format with different projets.  Unfortuately for me, I already bought it based on the amazing scores everyone else gave it
