This book is a follow up to another book which was flawed in the first place.

How convenient that current events that have just past are "suddenly" revealed in Drosnin's second book. If they were there, why didn't Drosdin tell us about them the first time and save over 3,000 lives in New York? Or tell us about the hanging chad problem so it could be fixed in advance and save people a lot of heartache and anquish?

The very purpose of prophecy is to build up people's faith and warn them about potential dangers, even if they have to go through them. Where was Drosnin BEFORE it all happened? 

Since all written language is mathamatic at its core, a guy can find any kind of words he want if he just keeps hunting and pecking long enough. This is especially true of a guy copying his interpretation of prophecy from all the other sensationalist prophecy teachers out there.

This book is just more of a bad thing. 

For a real book about the real Bible code, read "the Character Map" by Eickleberry. The code he found shows us how to read all prophecies, and, more important, how to live
