By the time you get to this book, you probably already know you should take classes, get a good demo etc.  What you need to know is how to market yourself.  To that end this book is a waste of time for the novice.  Sure, if you're already a singer and have connections in show biz, why not switch gears and try out for voiceover?  That's what the author did.  This book irritated me -the author is pompous and the book is shallow at best.  He doesn't spend enough time on how to market yourself, but encourages you to spend about $10K for an in home studio - if you REALLY want to make it in this business.  This guy's condescending and as you take his advice, remember, HE's the only one doing any banking with this type of help.
