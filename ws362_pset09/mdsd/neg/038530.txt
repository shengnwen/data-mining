Unless you're a total Proust junkie, I'd recommend that you steer clear of this volume: it's no &quot;A la recherche...&quot; What saves it from being totally tedious are one or two excellent passages of writing. The rest, however, is a patchwork of observations, very badly stitched together. Most of the episodes end in mid-stream with no resolution, nor any but the most tenuous connection to the preceding and following episodes. Clearly, for some, anything Proust will do, even if it's a collection of early experimental scribblings
