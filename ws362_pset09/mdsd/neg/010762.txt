Road depiction is very vague. Difficult to read. Somewhat useable with AAA maps. For the best maps see the series by Benchmark Maps. I have used their maps in New Mexico, California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona. Unfortunately, they do not have many states. I use the Delorme &quot;Utah&quot; with my AAA maps
