I wanted to read this book because of the impact of 'Midnight Express&quot; and was curious as to why he then had such a sparse career. Now I know. His tragically short life is sad, as it is for anyone...but I  couldn't get past being annoyed by how careless he was with the people in  his life and careless about his career.  He was good, then he seemed to  blow it with bad behavior. I know there are reasons for it, but I could  only feel sorry to a point. A lot of my annoyance was the &quot;name  dropping&quot;..Susan's reference to would-be stars &quot;then&quot; and  informing us as to who they have become... as if we the public would not  know.  I have the feeling she wanted some vindication for what she went  through, some acknowledgement for her perseverence...and some legacy of  value for her husband. Who can blame her. So many people have died of AIDS,  so many horrific stories of ordinary people who never had a voice. I guess  I get annoyed that people look to Hollywood for their heroes
