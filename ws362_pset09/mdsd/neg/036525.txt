When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.  

In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.

Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner...
