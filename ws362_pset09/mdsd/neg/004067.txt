Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this book. It is redundant nonsense. This is the best marketing book I have read in years. Yes that is right, marketing. "My book yaddayaddayadda says this..., my show is about this ..., or my game teaches this..." These two have no intention of helping people other than taking money from them in order to tell them how to peel a banana. If you want financial literacy read books like: Contemporary Financial Management, Finance for Dummies; or, if it is real estate you love: Learn about Appraisal, Real Estate Finance (single and multi-period analysis), and Investment Feasibility. Take their advice and educate yourself by investing in yourself, not in scams.
