I bought this book as a senior psychology major, hoping to gain insight into my possible career options. Instead, I found a very brief and basic book that would be more appropriate for a highschooler toying with the idea of applying to colleges with a major of psychology in mind.

This book spends large amounts of space discussing the college application process and a few pages briefly discussing career alternatives(When I state 'briefly', I mean aprox 4 sentences for each career option). Additionally, it consists of some autobiographical prospectives from individuals who graduated with a BA in psychology. Unfortunatly, the perspectives offered are not really realistic portrayls of the mainstream career choices. Counseling with a MA, PsyD, or PhD is not really discussed, nor is a career in research. 

I would NOT recommend this book unless you are a junior or senior in highschool considering a major in psychology. Even then, I would suggest you try to borrow it from the library instead of paying the high cost.
