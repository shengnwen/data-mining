Faux-Advaita drivel for the lazy and the naiive. The sad thing is, this poor man really seems to believe he is Self-Realized. 

Anyone who has had even a glimpse of their true nature, the Self, would never characterize the experience by saying "literally, nothing happened." (pg. 205). An experience of the Self is a beautiful and powerful moment of Grace that cannot be mistaken. A presence peers from oneself that is distinctly "other" than anything one has ever experienced before. 

Do not believe those who would tell you that "no effort is required", "you are already awake", etc. There is no such thing as "drive-thru enlightenment". 

If you have a sincere interest in Advaita look to works by Nisargadatta or Ramana Maharshi. Also there is an excellent book available free online titled "The Imposter" by Michael Langford. I don't know anything about the author, but he presents a serious no-nonsense, approach for anyone who is serious about awakening and not just interested in playing with concepts and pretending.

I actually dumped my copy of this book into the recycle bin rather than try to sell it to a used book store. I would not want to be responsible for this being passed onto someone even by accident
