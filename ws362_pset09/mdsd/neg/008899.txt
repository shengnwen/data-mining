the book describes the problems with bicycle seats but does not give any practical infomation about selecting a seat. It is more theory about the problems, than help. In addition, the book focuses on medical problems from bicycle seats for men, but not on thos for women. I would not recommend this if you are looking for a book to help you select the appropriate seat, expecially if you are a woman
