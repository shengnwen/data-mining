Abbey is the type of person that you will either love or hate.  There is no middle ground.  Personally, I find few things in this book that do Arches the justice that it deserves and I can't tolerate Abbey's selfish militant eco-hermit gibberish.  That being said, I'm a scientist and I realize the importance of preservation of our wild lands and I constantly encourage people to become involved BUT I will never become so selfish as to propose exclusion of these places to handicapped people.  Futhermore, I could never place a snake's life in higher regard than a human unless the human is a worthless piece of sh*t.  So, you can tell I'm not on the majority's side here...I won't glorify this Abbey's book like others have done in these reviews.  Do yourself a favor and VISIT Arches and see these things for yourself.  Its the most beautiful place you will likely see out West.  For something really enjoyable, read anything by John Wesley Powell...won't be written about Arches but will describe the West in its early, unexplored days.
