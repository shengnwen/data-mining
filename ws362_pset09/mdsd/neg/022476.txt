This book is terrible. If you are a certified HVAC specialist, it is for you. However, if you are new to this then it is a total waste of money. Explanation is bad, example are nowhere relate to the section discussed. And worst of all, there is no answer keys. You will not have a clue if you are correct or not. Every chapter there are as least half of the review question are calculations, yet in each chapter there will be probably one page showing how calculation is done. Example one of the simplest thing:
COP = Cooling Effect / Power Input. If you look up the index, you cannot find the word "cooling effect", find out whichever chapter they discuss, or show you how to calculate the "cooling effect".
You are in luck if you do not have class that uses this book. You have bad luck if you have a "good" teacher that using this book. You are doom if you have a "bad" teacher who using this book, might as well drop it. Waste of time and money.
