Although this may be a good marketing book for writers, I found the lack of professional typesetting bothersome: using lines of hyphens between entries, instead of subject headers or bullets; using bold AND italics for book titles are just a few problems. But the biggest error is that there is no index in the back of the book. A book such as this begs for a lengthy index of author's names, subject headers, book titles, etc. I found it frustrating trying to navigate through this hodge podge of advice.
