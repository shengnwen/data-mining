This book sucks..........Schwartz is impossible to read!  I tried to read The Living Energy Universe, and the Afterlife Experiments, which I could not finish....when a friend gave me the TRUTH to read I thought it would be lighter and more fun, but I was wrong, I could not finish it either.  Schwartz is definitely not a writer
