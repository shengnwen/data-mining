This book fails to present any new argument for the treatment of women historically.  It does point out that women have been ignored over the centuries but most of us already knew that.  The use of technical language, assumed foreknowledge of historical figures and an overestimated understanding of historical process make this book inappropriate for most undrgraduates.  Graduate students should be able to muddle their way through most of the book and it is also a book for academic collections
