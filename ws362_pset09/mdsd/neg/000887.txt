I liked the book, but I am a rookie who has little to no experience.  It was a quick read that only raised more questions for me.  Veteran body builders won't like it much as I have found that they already know most of the topics in the book.  One thing did put me off.  I found it hard to believe the statement in the section on steroids that he (Columbu) didn't know about steroids when he first won the Mr. O the first time.  I shared this with a fitness news group (MFW) and several people also found it hard to believe
