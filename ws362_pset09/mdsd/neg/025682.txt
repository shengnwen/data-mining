Disappointment is an understatement, I can't believe this was a Booker shortlist. Neither the story nor the characters evolve from their pitiful persona and circumstances. The whole effect is suspended in a souless vacumn especially Part 2 Arun. Prose was uninspiring, the conversations remind one of stilted actors interacting in a pseudo-profound play .  This may be my first and last Desai book. Perharps I'll check out Clear Light of Day as Desai's redemption. To each his own, I suppose..... For those keen on exploring works of Indian authors , I recommend Rohinton Mistry, Rushdie, Arundhati Roy , Lahiri, all masters of their art.
