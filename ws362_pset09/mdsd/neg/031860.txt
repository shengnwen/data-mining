Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??"
This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it"
