I ordered this book in a moment of inattention thinking it was something by the US Army Historical Section.
It's certainly an impressive book in physical terms, weighing in at 5.8 kgs. (12.8 lbs). It is also lavishly illustrated, but to call it a "complete history" is overstating the case. It is a chronological overview of the high points (the low points are carefully skipped - don't expect to find Mi Lay in the index) of US military history with a heavy emphasis on the heroic and red, white and blue patriotic sentiment. The preface states something like "Our soldiers are moral warriors who defend unchanging values etc. etc."
If you're a patriotic American and want to present a handsome gift to your local high school library, a gift that, who knows, may inspire some youngster to embrace the profession of arms, this book seems like an excellent idea.
But if you're looking for 50 dollars' worth of serious military history, I would advise you to look elsewhere.
