I thought the "mafia did it" theory had been thoroughly discredited by now. Actually, it has been discredited. With all due respect to Mr. Palamara, this book is hardly the best book on the JFK assasination. It's not even close to being the best. The best book on the murder of JFK is John Armstrong's 'Harvey & Lee', a thoroughly documented tome that proves that there were two people using the name Lee Harvey Oswald, one a native Russian speaking man who's family came to the U.S. and who was put into a "false defector" program run by the State Department and CIA (Harvey), the other the real Lee Harvey Oswald (Lee) who was working with Ruby, Ferrie, Shaw, Bannister and others in gun running and anti-Castro activities and who helped set up Harvey as the patsy. Armstrong's book puts everything into perspective. Ultimate Sacrifice is barely worth your time to read.
