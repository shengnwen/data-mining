Hoffman has offered meat in the fat.There is nothing like a good stew.Whether one agrees or not with his imagination his opinions are mind expanding.What man can think of he will probably create.One example that he points out is the lack of awareness or concern about illigal immigration.Probably the greatest threat to the security of the western world.A brainwashed western world.Who and what is the senate and congress of the US,and what, and why are they doing, what they are doing regarding immigration.Maybe we do not deserve to exist.Secret socities,the Masons seem to be the bottom line.Who was the founder,and what is the end.Maybe the old boys culbs gone berserk.The end justify the means.Maybe the apples are not here for you.Some say there can only be one king of the mountain.Somebody said let them eat cake.Symbols are all around us,just start lookind and you will see.Oswald,Ruby,Dallas.Who and what is Mr.Bush,what kind of family ties.One needs a knowledge of soial science to understand Mr.Hoffman,and one should also question is motive,for many things are not as they seem.I think the book is outstanding.
