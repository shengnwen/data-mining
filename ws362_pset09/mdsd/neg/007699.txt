I fell in love with Matthew Reilly's fast paced, action packed writing style with Area 7.  Since then I read Ice Station, Scarecrow, Temple, Contest, and now 7 Daily Wonders.
Wonders was a HUGE let down.  Reilly seemed to allow his plot constructing abilities take a back seat to a Indiana Jones, run through traps, scenario that seldom made any sense throughout the entire book.
The plot was more of a "Let me give the characters an excuse to run through the corniest traps I can think of" than it was actually well written or well executed.  In truth, I was SO reminded of "Pitfall" on the Atari 2600 that I found the book boring.  
Even with the suspension of disbelief of "How do all these traps work after 4000 years?" I still wasn't happy with the do or die atmosphere that everything hinged on.
On top of that, VERY unlike ALL of his other books, this book was a poorly veiled statement on his disagreement of current American military actions.  It came across as very anti-American and almost told me that he hated Americans.  I almost threw the book away during some rants of ethic superority, and America "sacrificing" troops "just to test the waters".

As to those who say, "Why not anti-American when normally it's anti-someone else?"  I say this.  This book attacked America as a people, as a culture, as a complete ideology.  Other books have bad guys/groups that are obviously separate entities from their cultures.  This book mentioned many many times how America is a country of war-mongerers, and the population really wants nothing but global dominance.  A far cry from having specific special forces units butt heads in a search for dominance.


Congratulations, Reilly, I doubt I will give you another chance
