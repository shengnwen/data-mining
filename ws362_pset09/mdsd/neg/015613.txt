This book was a great disappointment to me.  The author has fallen into the trap of reading what she needs from her sources, whether they provide the evidence she wants or not.  I will admit I couldn't finish the first chapter and it may improve further along, but her rational for her conclusions escapes me.  The handwritten recipe books/journals/scrapbooks she studied could have provided a fascinating look at how women's lives and priorities have changed over the centuries, but her insistence on broad societal conclusions from these very personal documents left me cold.  When she directly discussed the documents and individuals she did a wonderful job, but when she tried to apply to the society at large their was a huge gap between her evidence and her conclusions
