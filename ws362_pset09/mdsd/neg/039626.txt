I was looking forward to the "last Elric novel" and hoped that Elric would play a larger role in this book than in the two previous ones in the loosely connected trilogy that began with The Dreamthief's Daughter and continued in The Skrayling Tree. But this novel is downright boring. Much of the text describes the random thoughts of a twelve-year-old girl who is the chief character in the book (despite what the title might lead you to believe, the "White Wolf's Son" plays a very minor role), her various kidnappings and periods of captivity, or the numerous cast of supporting multiverse characters who pop in and out of the book. The multiversal muddle with its numerous versions of the same city wears thin quickly, as its involves lengthy explanations about the moonbeam roads, the relative nature of time, etc.
