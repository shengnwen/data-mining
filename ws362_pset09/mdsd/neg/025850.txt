I bought this book based upon the experience I had with other Hacking Exposed books... but this one has disappointed me
The examples are based on commercial tools only - while I'm certain that there are many open source tools available also.
The book contains more than 100 pages of forms and explanations of the legal process, which is nice, but not what I would have expected from a Hacking Exposed book
