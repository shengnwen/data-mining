I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start. 

I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad. 

I really couldn't recommend this book any less
