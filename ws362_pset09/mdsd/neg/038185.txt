I have not even read the book as of yet. I have just skimmed over reviews written by some of the readers. I understand that this can be an emotional subject for many different reasons. If you come a background in which your anscestors had not been enslaved or lynched or gassed, you may not get why some readers become emotional with this subject matter. I do have a fact based on what I was told from the horse's mouth. Egyptians do consider themselves to be black. I lived in Turkey in 2000 and on my flight back to the U.S., I was waiting in the terminal at the airport in Izmir. This woman kept staring at me. I assumed it was becasue I was the only black woman around and I had grown accustomed to the interest I drew while living in Turkey because it was sincere and genuine. Anyway, she finally approached me and said, "My brother and my nephew and I do not mean to seem impolite, but we are just so happy when we see a brother or sister," I asked what she meant and she said, "Oh, we are black like you, our mother is Egyptian and our father is Turkish, we are black, like you". I noticed their complexions were darker than mine and their was of the same grade as mine. It never occurred to me that they were "black". I noticed that they took such pride in being recognized as such. It really all comes down to what an individual feels he or she identifies most with and what they were taught to believe and whether or not they were taught the truth
