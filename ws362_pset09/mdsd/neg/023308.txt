I was disappointed in this novel.  I was expecting science fiction and got fantasy.  

Morrow seems to want to be Kurt Vonnegut.  His plot twists, unfortunately, don't measure up to those of Uncle Kurt.

The Lewis Carroll references were overdone.

I can't see this being recommended along side THE LAST SHIP, ON THE BEACH, and similar books.  If you are looking for apocalyptic fiction, look elsewhere.
