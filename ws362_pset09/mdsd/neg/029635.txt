This book won't turn me off to JP, who I admire very much for his style of cooking and pleasant personality; but the book was a bit boring.  Once I gleaned the book, my usual "How can I decide what to cook first?" didn't hit me.  I picked up the book again with the same results -- just not enough inspiring stuff there.  I haven't looked at the book since; so I can't even say this or that recipe was lackluster.  I only remember my response to the book.  It wan't the 'fast food' concept either because everyone needs quick recipes in the cooking repertoire.  I cook a lot.  I'm not a cookbook collector; my cookbooks are stained and tattered.  I'm afraid "Fast Food My Way" will remain in pristine condition until I can give it to someone who will assign it more value than I can.  Each book I have on the shelf has to carry its weight or it's off to the pantry -- my culinary Siberia for cookbooks -- where this cookbook now resides.  For some reason I found JP cooking from this book on TV much more pleasurable than entertaining the idea of cooking from this cookbook.
