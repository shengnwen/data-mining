Ms. Jagose does as well as can be expected in explaining a &quot;discipline&quot; that is anything but. A strong point of her tour of this academic freakery is in making it clear how the overwhelmingly male  queer population came to be the caboose on the train of radical feminism.   Those with the endurance to complete this introduction will understand why  queer theory is the phlogiston of the social sciences.  A more concise and  less arcane view of some of the same terrain can be had in Leo Bersani's  &quot;Homos,&quot; also available from Amazon.com
