This book contains information that you can get free in the internet.  It outlines your rights for you, gives information about the credit bureau but that's about it.  Most of the book does not even directly address credit repair but acquiring credit and keeping good credit--these are of course helpful but not if your immediate concern is credit repair.  The only saving grace this book has is its discussion about credit repair companies but then again this information is also on the web.  If you have a few hours and would like to save money go on the internet for free resources before buying this book
