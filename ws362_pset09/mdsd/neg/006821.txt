The title promises firework for your brain, but really doesn't deliver. After 100 pages or so I noticed I was getting bored with it. A lot of examples, but no more thought provoking ideas. If you're interested in exploring new ways for doing business in the future, I can recommend &quot;The Visionary's Handbook&quot; by Watts Wacker and Jim Taylor. More thought provoking. The Dream Society is only recommended for casual reading
