I enjoy reading Wodehouse books - twice - once to find out the twisted plot and the 2nd to enjoy the language.  This is one of my favorites - I dearly love the old man butler/Lord.  There is a 2nd book with him in also - sorry, can't remember the name.  I would recommend this book to any who likes Wodehouse books
