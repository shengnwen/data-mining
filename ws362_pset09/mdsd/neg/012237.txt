A comic masterpiece?  Hardly.  Didn'tlaugh once.  Might have been funny in 1886, but it sure isn't now.  Anyway, the book is not what I was looking for, which was  serious historical fiction--an imaginative re-telling of this intriguing, long-lost story.   I found it afterwards in the novel by Donna Woolfolk Cross, which is very well-researched, beautifully written, and deeply moving.  That's the one to get, not this boring and unfunny "comic masterpiece".
