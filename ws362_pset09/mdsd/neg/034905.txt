I think this is exactly the kind of textbook that should be distributed in abundance throughout all states wanting ID as part of their science curriculum. This will not only guarantee my two daughters a great deal less competition in medical school, it will also help fill the need for astute, critical thinkers in the food service industry. 
An EXCELLENT BOOK!
