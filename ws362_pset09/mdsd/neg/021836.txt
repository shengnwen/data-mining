One would imagine Mr.Warren having a very intense imagination and perhaps he might be able to embark on a carreer as a science fiction novelist. Actually this book would rate as a long and drawn out rendition of one. If  you want a more realistic outlook on the RAF / Bentwaters story , please  avoid this book and look towards Col. Halt's book. Otherwise this book is  fantasy at best
