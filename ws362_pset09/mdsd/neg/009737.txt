Yes, actually I do. To warn potential readers from reading the most crappy book in the face of the Earth.
Gerald betraying his adored Ellen?
Mammy betraying her most loved mistress?
Ashley being gay? (Since when is dereaming gayness? And didn't he love Melanie?)
Melanie killing a slave out of anger? (This offended me the most, because I have always loved Melanie)
Rhett prefering this lame loser wannabe to Scarlett?

It's an insult to GWTW.An insult to Margaret Mitchell. An insult to the south.

Just because some plantations had mullattos doesn't mean everyone had to.

If you have read GWTW, don't let this horrible, disgusting object cheat you out of your time, or your love for one of the most beautiful books of American literature
