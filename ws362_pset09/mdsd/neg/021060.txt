Truly.  I bought a used copy and was surely glad of the savings.  I would have hated to waste full price on it.  The basic issue/problem with this book and probably more specifically, its author, is that it ignores the most important of all facts concerning the Celtic church:  it was Orthodox.  Yes, Big 'O'.  In other words, Mr. Hunter appears to be blissfully unaware that his theory of "pub churching" is so erroneous as to be almost blasphemous, as entertaining as it may seem in a popular culture.  It is in short, absurd.  Mr. Hunter appears to isolate minute detail and parade it through his pages as "facts" that "support" his theory.  The only trouble is:  Mr. Hunter's religion is only about 500 years old, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to that of St. Padraig, and Celtic Christianity dates to at least the third century, possibly the second.  (Depending on which history you lean toward and whether or not you accept the Coptic Connection theory. ) 

I dislike writing "bad" reviews.  But this one is so deserved, that I almost, but not quite, enjoyed writing it.  To enjoy bashing a book and/or its author, is to be un-Christian, definitely un-Orthodox.  Assuredly Celtic, however.
