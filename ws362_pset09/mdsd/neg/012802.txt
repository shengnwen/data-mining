Some may disagree, and in fact, many have asked me why I disliked this one so much; so, here is why:

- scratch 'plotting'... by this point in the story, 'plodding' is more accurate. 

- caracatures over characters. A staple of the series, 2d characters; but by this point, when new characters keep getting introduced this late in the story, it becomes an annoyance, a drag and overkill. 

- virtually zero gain. 
the entire first half of the book is a rescue mission for a minor character and the mission, once accomplished (or not) is forgotten by the end of the book. The third fourth of the book finally starts to swing thigns back to the original LB premise of end times doom and gloom thanks to the horrific judgments; sadly, it's very boring and slow. However...

-... the book doesn't get good until the last fourth. 
And that, my friends, is not good for the overall quality of this entry in the series. 

By this point, it's obvious that the authors were REALLY stretching it. However, as I said, things got really good in the last few chapters and led into 'Armageddon', one of the best books in the series. How ironic. 

Thumbs way down for Left Behind: The Remnant. It's sad when the best part of the book is a scene involving the antichrist sunbathing on a rooftop.
