I was hoping for a book that would illuminate some choices for baby names, while pointing out any unfortunate associations I had not thought of.  Only to receive a book that was short on credible information, and long on personal judgement.

I was truly disappointed in the seemingly arbitrary way in which the authors claimed some names to be outdated.  While I understand that Cherry could be a torment to a young girl, lumping Cheri and Cheryl in with these was absolutely silly.  Having grown up in the eighties with that name, I was never once called a name referring the former.  Asking two friends - a Cheri, (ten years younger than myself) and a Cheryl, (four years older) if they had ever been teased in that way, they both laughed and said no.  Many times the author's reasons for dissuading parents from choosing a name seem to be based only on the author's personal preferences and peccadilloes. 

I found that many of the names the authors' gave their seal of approval to, were names that were probably most trendy at the moment they were writing.  They blithely recommend, good god... California?  Not realizing that place names, (like Brooklyn, etc.) are already being ridiculed as tired and silly in magazines.  No doubt in a year or two, they'll be recommending Apple and other fruit names, once they too are no longer trendy.  

The most unfortunately thing is that the author's emphasis on trendy or common names, may warn parents off of some unique and delightful older names.  In the end I could have saved myself the price of the book and done the name research on the internet.
