A very poor effort from the point of view of a child.  There are many errors in the book that will be caught by a four-year-old. Examples, Mesosaurus (a non-dinosaur marine reptile) and Eryops (an amphibian!!) are classed as dinosaurs and my four-year-old found these and about 8 others immediately.  This book does have a saving grace, though, you can use it to introduce the child to critical thinking skills
