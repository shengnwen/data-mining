In all fairness I was looking for a different book -- when I got this in the mail it wasn't what I expected.  Though the title would have you believe it would be a suitable replacement.  I was planning to drive from LA to San Diego and was looking for some cool landmarks.  Well each state gets 2 pages, so you can image the ideas I got for stopping points.  Zero.  I looked up Massachusetts, my home, and all it seemed to talk about was Howard Johnson's.  Given HoJo's has burned a place in local memory and was an important early player in the motel business,  no evidence exists of it today.  So bad road trip book.  Mildly interesting history book
