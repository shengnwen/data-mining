I purchases this book after reading the other rave reviews.  It does include some interesting words, and I really appreciate the examples of usage in a sentence.  However, for the person who is searching for creative wording, the book does not offer a large selection of choices.  This book might be a nice supplement to a substantive thesaurus like Roget's, but don't expect it to be a great reference.  Personally, I wish I hadn't spent the money
