I've never read a book that was so difficult to finish. Don't get me wrong- I'm a huge fan of Tori's music or else I wouldn't have bought this. But she goes on endlessly about myths and deities and more myths and the profound negative effect that Christianity had on her psyche. Alternately pretentious and egotistic, I was totally put off by the tone of this book. When she describes her songs as 'beings' that come and talk to her it made me wince. As a songwriter myself I get the gist of what she's saying but it just comes off as a bit too much. She also periodically refers to herself in the third person which I found incredibly irritating. I did learn a few interesting things about Tori (her miscarriages and her dealings with the music industry for example) but ultimately I found the experience of reading this book- you guessed it- positively draining. However, if you're not familiar with the major figures of mythology and would like to know more about them this might be a good place to start
