This version of Stone Soup leaves a sour taste in my mouth.  At the beginning I was especially disappointed that there were no polite words like please and thank you.  The boy also tells instead of asking.  The other thing I don't like is that the old woman basically lies about not having anything to eat.  Both of these issues are bad examples for my child
