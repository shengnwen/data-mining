   Well first off, I did not like the book nor the movie, both have enough plot holes to make a swiss cheese look like art.     On the other hand, I take excption to some of the neagtive reviews listed here, as some sound very anti-american in their reviews.  We being good Americans are intelligent enough to read good books and tell what stories make good patriotism and what does not.   We do not have to justify this to anyone who lives outside of the American experience for that.  If you do not understand this, TNEN BE QUIET ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND
