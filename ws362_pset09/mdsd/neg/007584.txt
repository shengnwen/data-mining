I enjoyed She Walks These Hills and was shocked to discover that this book  was written by the same author.  The plot was silly, the mystery was  uninteresting, and the characters were one-dimensional.  It read like a  draft for a course &quot;Learning to Write Mystery Stories&quot;.  Ms.  McCrum should have kept this one in her botton drawer
