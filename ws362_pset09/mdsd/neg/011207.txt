This would be a good college text book for &quot;Concrete and Masonry Theory&quot;.  What I was looking for is a good text book for a &quot;How the Heck do I pour concrete and lay bricks?&quot; class. This weakly illustrated book with black and white photos was written by an architect and not a mason and is more suited to the general contractor or construction inspector. If you are looking for a hands-on &quot;how to&quot; book skip this one and buy a step by step well illustrated book with color photos
