I purchased this book for my friend to help him understand what his kids were going through and help him learn to deal with a bitter ex-wife.  I thought the book would offer solutions to co-parenting issues or offer advise on how to work with a less-than-amicable former spouse.  Instead, this book focussed on women who were dealing with deliquent husbands - how to make them pay, how to keep them involved, etc.  It would have been more helpful to additionally offer advise on how to make her share the kids, how to make her co-parent with him, how help her move beyond the fight of the parents to the health of the children.  I know the roles can be reversed in either case, but the author obviously felt that women were more likely to nurture the children.  This, unfortunately, is not always the case
