I ordered the book through Amazon, because my local book store told me it wasn't available anymore in the Netherlands. It got sent my way very fast, I received in only a couple of days. But the inside of the package dissapointed me somewhat. The front of the book had this standard MS Powerpoint-like texture, which wasn't mentioned on the website. The pages are very, very thin and the images look kind of blurry, because "this book was printed digitally and produced in a standard design so that Hodder Arnold can ensure its continuing availability". I appreciate the possibility of byuing the book at Amazon, but one should have mentioned on the website that it was a poor substitute for the original book. A little bit disapponted I must say. I hope my next purchase will be more to my liking.

Best regards, mr Anne-Krijn Piersma, the Netherland
