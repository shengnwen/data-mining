This guy conducted absolutely no research and bases his thoughts on things he's noticed.  This may be appropriate for a biography, but it certainly is not appropriate for a book describing an ethicity of people.  He stereotypes his own people without giving any merit to his thoughts in form of other sources.  This book is extremely brief, and you'd be better off learning about Korean Americans from a biography or from a more documented source
