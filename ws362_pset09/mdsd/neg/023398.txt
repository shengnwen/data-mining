I'm sorry but I must agree with others here that this was a very slow, confusing BORING book! I've heard about Linda Barnes and was told she's a good writer - not in this book! I think maybe it could have possibly been better by cutting at least 100 pages! (Yes, I put all those extra words in on purpose!) I really do NOT have to know every stupid detail about how she gets from point A to point B! Really! I haven't read (nor will I ever read) any of her previous books so the whole thread with her Little Sister was confusing and ... no necessary. I only gave the book two stars for a great premise. Too bad it was wasted
