This is essentially a a very expensive pamphlet with a copy ofthe @Risk software on trial. As one who bought the "book" because of its subject matter and its author I feel roundly cheated. The pamphlet itself has some introduction to the subject but essentially this is nothing more than an attempt to distribute some trial software at cost.

I suspect the audience for this pamphlet already know of @risk and its competitors.  Equally they will probabaly have this or a competitor software already.  

I do appreciate the quality of @Risk - but this seems a "cheap" way of earning some extra revenue without really extending the user base
