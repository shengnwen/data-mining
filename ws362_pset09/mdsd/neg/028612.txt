This is a great book, but it is just stretched  way too long. It starts out great and keeps the reader glued to the pages. Then the book starts to end the same things happen over and over again and you just think when id this book going to end. Personaly i think this book could have ended about 50 pages befor it did. I think the book would have had a shot at the Newbery if it didn't go on as long as it di. That just goes to show that you cant hve a super-de-duper start but then your ending just really stinks your book wont be that good. You need to have a good ending and a good begining in order to have a good book
