I bought this book to help study for the Windows 2003 server exams.  Unlike the other Techno-Geek Dummies books, this book does not contain ANY exam practice questions or a CD with a sample exam.  This book is also not as humorus or entertaining to read as other Dummies books.  The first 9 chapters are a basic review of simple networking, like cables and how to install a NIC.  You probably won't see much from the first 9 chapters on the Windows 2003 Server exam.  Chapter 11 starts getting more technical and explains Active Directory fairly well, but this chapter also says that many topics are "beyond the scope of this book".  This book is geared more towards a novice who has never setup a server before.  I still think it's better than most of Microsoft's MOC books though.  At least this book has real world examples and cuts through Microsoft's hype.  If you are looking for an all in one study guide to pass the server exam though, keep looking
