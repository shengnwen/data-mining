I work as a technical writer for a telecommunications company that markets enhanced directory assistance in the wholesale and retail markets. Since my primary audiences are engineers and technicians, I write about and have to understand the technical aspects of how switches, telephony, and telecommunications applications function. About this dictionary (the 3rd edition), though it appears to have many definitions, when you look into it, it's amazing how many concepts it does not cover. For example, it has very poor coverage of SS7 terminology. Further, McGraw-Hill writers don't seem to understand that people often refer to the same concept using slightly different terminology so the dictionary lacks &quot;see also&quot; references. This is an area where Newton's shines. Even if the term is in the McGraw Hill, it's hard to find. I was excited about the CD-ROM, but it's a only PDF file of the hard copy manual. The PDF does not include any search functionality beyond what the book offers itself. The CD-ROM would be much more worthwhile if it took advantage of modern-day help system technology to make an online document with advanced search features and multimedia presentations, neither of which are difficult to create. Overall, the McGraw-Hill dictionary has definitely not been worth its price. If you're looking for substance and ease-of-use, buy Newton's
