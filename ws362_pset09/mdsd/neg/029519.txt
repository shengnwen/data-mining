The book was okay, but I really loved the movie.  There are major differences in the book that completely change the tone.  First of all, she's British and more closely resembles Bridget Jones than her movie counterpart.  You see a lot more of her friends in the novel.  

Also, she seems thoroghly preoccupied with her weight.  She is not described to look anything like Debra Messing, but rather an overweight "squishy" girl, which is completely fine, but it is not fun to read abotu her obsessing about her weight while downing a box of chocolate cigarettes.

The writer is British, I believe, so it has more of the British slang, which at first is a little confusing.  It's not Thackeray, mind you, but don't expect any American tones.

Their relationship is more drawn out, which is fun to read.  

Still, what I remember most was how we envision all the characters (Domonic included) as a little chunky.  They aren't size 0 models, we get it! Now get over it
