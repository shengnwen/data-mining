i am a orthomolecular-nutritionist and i treat many add\adhd children and a lot of what is suggested here in this book is true,but as far as the mother\father of the add\adhd children is concern this book gives to the  parent only general pieces of information without an organised conclusive  treatment program(even that we know that it should be monitored with a  nutritionist\doctor).vitamin b3 does not damage the liver only to those who  already been damaged by medicines\or other poisions.the book of dr.allan  cott:dr.cott's help for your learning disabled chid  is the best book,  after it is :dr. hoffer's abc natural nutrition for children  by:abram  hoffer   and the book of marcia zimmerman:the add nutrition solution. the  book of dr.cott is a divine boo
