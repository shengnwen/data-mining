First let me say that my father was a crewman on a destroyer that helped save many crewmembers of the franklin that were in the water so my brothers and sisters were all looking forward to this book as I was. 

In a nutshell Steve Jackson does attempt to tell the reader of the story and rescue of the Franklin in WWII and his work is a noble effort. However either because of his limited knowledge of military hardware or because of an inept editor this book contains so many blatant and obvious technical and historic errors that I found it difficult to slog through. I started noticing these errors and then started counting and then finally I lost count all together. They are distracting to anyone who relishes true history. I haven't seen as many errors in a book since Stephen Ambrose's Wild Blue Yonder.

And the format of the book is disconnected because Jackson skips from the Franklin to the Santa fe, forgoing rhyme or reason in doing so. I understand why he does it but at times I had to stop in mid sentence to go back to see what ship I was reading about. (I wonder how many other readers had the same problem?) I could barely put heads or tails together. And my brothers and sisters all had the exact same problems with this book and that is why I am taking the effort to write this review. 

We all know it is not the subject and the men have a fasinating story and we do not want or intend to take anything away from these heroes. It is just the way Lucky Lady is edited. 

This book is a good story and I give Jackson an A for effort. But reading this book was work. A reader should never have to work to read a book. I was exhausted when I fianlly finihsed it. I just couldn't wait to put it down.
