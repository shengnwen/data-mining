This book is part of the "Everything" series of books, so you would expect it to have a little bit of "everything" about potty training in it.  Unfortunately, I had to read the entire book to find out that the author's clear bias towards infant potty training continues into the sections on toddler training.  I was hoping for a less opinionated book, one with more general information.
