Cuba has done an amazing job of switching over to organic, local food production. They did so to survive the assinine embargo of thier island, but in doing so they have shown the way for all of us to move to a sane mode of food production.  You would want this book to be a delightful description of that process.  You would be wrong.  It is a leaden, tedious exercise in socialist writing with all the wit and charm of a phone book.  Skip the book and just go to Cuba and see the results for yourself.  Then come home and plant a garden
