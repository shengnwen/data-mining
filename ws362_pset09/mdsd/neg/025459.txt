I graduated in Statistics, and so I know boring books.  And, this book was more boring than any of my Statistics texts.

It is written in textbook format.  It is also written by a bunch of different authors, so it's really disjointed.  As an example, the chapter guest written by an attorney in boring legalese is probably the most interesting.

And, they misspelled McDonalds.  In a book about FRANCHISES!  I could understand if they misspelled Wal-Mart in a book about franchises, but how can you write a book about franchises and misspell McDonalds?  See the misspelling on pages 86 and 196.

Also, it is written to franchisors, not franchisees.  Since the marketing of the book makes it look like it's trying to appeal to everyone, it took me a few chapters to figure out that it's actually written to franchisors.  Repeat: It is NOT good for franchisees.

I did complete the entire book.  I'm not one of those reviewers who calls the book boring after reading a few pages and throwing it away.  I am someone who plugged through so that I could warn everyone else
