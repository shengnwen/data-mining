I've read a couple other books by Bill's books and always loved them.  Great characters, great story line, involved and wonderful.  This book was missing all of that - and then some.  The main characters are SO uninteresting that I had a hard time continuing to read.  I could have cared less if the old billionaire lived or died.  Does the married eco-freak couple actually keep the baby ... WHO CARES.  

The story revolves around organ transplants, the drive of an old wealthy man to procreate and cure himself, a couple fighting for the rights of the environment, a third world organ thief of a doctor, and a crazy orphan who sells himself for a living.  Yes it has promise.  No - the story line does not deliver.  Please don't buy this book.  You'll only be disappointed
