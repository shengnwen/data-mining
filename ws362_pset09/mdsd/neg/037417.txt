Under no circumstances will I recommend this book for first time learners of the German language. Its poorly structured and fails to thoroughly introduce nerw learners to german grammar. If one has a background in German, then the book will be good for them but if one desires to learn for translation purposes, then this book is not for you. Furthermore, i was alarmed at the inclusion of very many imperialistic german passages....!!
