I used the James Stewart 5e for the first quarter for calculus.  But I switched schools and this school used the Hughes Hallett book.

Pros:  None

Cons:

There not enough reference pages.  

There only a total of 2 pages back and front for the whole calculus book.  This book is used for 3 quarters of calculus and this book ONLY has 2 references.  It would be nice to able look back in reference page to refresh my head from first quarter calculus formula but this book has a short list.  James Stewart is better in the way that it takes an extra step to include lots Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry formulas.  

Solution manual only has every other odd.

I bought solution manual without looking at it.  They only have a solutions for problem 1, 5, 9, 13, and etc.  The review problems are the same thing where they only work out every other odd problem.  I was able to return this solution manual.  I am super happy I didn't have waste any more money into this book.

Those two cons make me hate this book.

I would recommend that if you had to buy the book, look to other books for reference pages.  Unless your teacher assigns every other odd, I wouldn't buy the solution manual
