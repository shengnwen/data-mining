In recycling Blakney's translation from the 1950's, Signet is trying to get something for nothing, namely, your money for a lousy out-dated translation.  Not only does Blakney misread the Chinese grammar in several places, his interpretations are both under-thought and under-written.  If an inexpensive translation is what you're looking for, Penguin has a $5 D.C. Lao translation that isn't all that bad.  If, however, you want really excellent translations, here's my advice:  For a more interpretive Neo-Taoist reading, pick up Victor H. Mair's.  This is a good place to start reading the Tao Te Ching, in my opinion.  If, however, you want a truly excellent translation, Philip J. Ivanhoe has done quite nicely.  Moss Robert's translation is just as good overall, but also includes notes on the differences between the MaWangDui and Guodian texts compared to the Wang Bi (which is what he and everyone translates), so that'd be my ideal choice.  Don't buy this book, it's a cheap way for the publishing house to try and score some sales from nothing at all.
	I'm currently working on a research piece on translations of P'u in the English texts, so these critiques come as the result of my working with all these books
