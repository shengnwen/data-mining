I'm going to wait until it gets cold enough to burn this guy's book. "Oblivion," couldn't be a better title, while reading these stories--I couldn't actually bear to finish even one of them-- you feel as if you have entered some circle of Hell, and your punishment is to have to read all this crap. This guy makes me mad, his prose actually bores into your skull, it feels like torture to read and you want to say enough, yes, I will tell you anything you want to hear, but please just shut the blank up
