I do not understand why this book is rated so highly.
Most of the proofs are very confusing. For example is the proof to the Post correspondence problem which I had to read about 6 times before I understood it completely.  And no, I do not think it's because I'm dumb. The whole section about reducibility was also really vague. The problem with this book is that some very important aspects of many proofs/theorems are skipped or unclearly stated. I really have no clue why this book is this popular. On this topic I have only read Peter Linz's "An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata", which is hated by many and covers not as much material, but at least it is clear! It's crystal clear compared to this. I know this book is supposed to be of higher level than Linz's book, but that is no reason to make every part of the book intentionally confusing
