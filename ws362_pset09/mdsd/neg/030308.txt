I hoped that this book, being a "Technical Introduction", would get me up to speed as quickly as possible on the nuts and bolts of web services. As a programmer I had a real world requirement to build web service client functionality into one of my programs immediately ("yesterday") and bought this book to put me in the picture about the web services framework from a technical point of view.
But after having ploughed through the first jargon-laden five chapters at no time did I feel I was getting any closer to completing my task. Not until Chapter 6 does Deitel introduce SOAP, but still with no crystalline description of the client-server interaction.
I abandoned the book at that stage and sought out magazine and web articles, dedicated to my programming language of choice, that gave examples and background descriptions of hands-on building of SOAP clients. Ultimately that's what enabled me to get the job done. What I'd read in Deitel didn't put me in much better position than if I'd never read it.
For example Deitel covers the Microsoft SOAP Toolkit in less than one page. I feel programmers of all persuasions would have benefitted from a detailed description of what it does and how it is used, even if they ultimately don't end up using that specific tool.
I'm not saying this book wouldn't be useful for non-technical people who want some sort of clue about what web services are, how they can be used, and vaguely how the operate.
Perhaps it's not Deitel's fault I was misguided by the word "technical" in the book's name, and thought this book would be orientated towards programmers
