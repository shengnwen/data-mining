I read this book and I thought it was a waste of time.  First, the author has the irratating habit of using exclamation points at the end of sentences.  Second, she doesn't go anywhere with this book.  She talks about her experiences, but they are watery and pointless.  What is she trying to say?  It's all marketing and no substance.
Some people may find it helpful, in talk of loneliness and so forth, but it was pointless to me
