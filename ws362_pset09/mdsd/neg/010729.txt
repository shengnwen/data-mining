The book is laid out decently enough, with plenty of pretty full color pictures.  It appears to be intended as merely an overview and/or basic review.

The book attempts to provide a broad range of topics:
1-History
2-Botanical Facts
3-Cultivation
4-Techniques, Effects, and Customs
5-The Connoisseur
6-General information

However, each of these topics has very little depth.  It will not provide any more insight into growing, use, or culture than what you could find on either of the two large online cannabis forums.

There is much missing in this book, and many inaccuracies.  Included recipes leave out how much to put in.  Growing recommendations and expectations are patently wrong.  The cultural history is incomplete.  It's hard to believe that a former High Times editor put this together.

This isn't a terrible book on cannabis, but there are so many better ones out there.  Don't waste your time with this one
