I enjoyed the book but the author's errors occurred in areas that I'm very unforgiving of.  In one place he mistakes semi-automatic firearms for fully-automatic firearms.  Even if the author doesn't feel obligated to do much research for light fiction like this, the editor should have caught something so blatantly wrong.  

I enjoyed some of the ridiculous characters that always show up in his books.  But, like Stephen King, I'm beginning to notice that he has certain characters that he uses again and again.  The hermit in the woods that knows everything.  State troopers are always perfect and dedicated but feds and city cops are dummies.  Throw in a scene that involves a complicated sexual position.  It just seems a bit lazy.  I know it's light fiction, but I like a bit more flesh to my beach reading.

I should mention that I didn't actually "read" this book, I listened to the unabridged audio version
