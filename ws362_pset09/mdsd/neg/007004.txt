Perhaps it was because I have yet to read Voltaire's Candide, but Southern's Candy was completely lost on me.  There was enough perversity and bizarreness to keep me reading until the end but I was left feeling that it was a bit incomplete and a bit pointless.  Nevertheless, I get the feeling that Southern is a talented writer, and perhaps this just wasn't one of his better works
