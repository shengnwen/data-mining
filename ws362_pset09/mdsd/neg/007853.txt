My professor for separations was really smart, but like most chemical engineering professors that I have met, they are too smart for their own good. He chosed this book because it was "easy to understand".
Chemical engineering is hard enough, and the fact that this book is used in most separations classes does not help. Each chapter starts off with an industrial example, which is confusing if you're not familar with it already. The authors just throw out concepts that you've never heard before and assume you're an industry expert. As thorough as the book is, you won't feel like a better person after having read it. The authors don't seem to want to teach the subject but rather flaunt their knowledge. The most annoying thing is when the authors get to solving problems. They just start applying equation after equation and don't tell the readers where they get it from. Sometimes, it's not even an equation from that chapter or from the book!
I don't consider myself a bad student, but I seriously could not do most of the assigned problems at the end of the book. How do I become a chemical engineer then? I prefer McCabe's Unit Operations in Chemical Engineering. Although it is not as thorough, and the equations are presented differently, I actually learned something and was interested in the subject matter. The authors relate the theory to real life, and it actually makes sense. In fact, I had to use the McCabe to solve some of the problems from this hellish book
