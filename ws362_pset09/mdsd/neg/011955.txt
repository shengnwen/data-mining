Don't believe the hype about China and so-called thousand year traditions.  This is a bane of modern life, and in fact is a post-modern myth.  An analogy:  it was found by anthropologists that certain tribes in Papua New Guinea practiced cannibalism (that spread harmful prions).  Upon further research, it was found this practice was not thousands of years old as claimed, but about 100 years old.  This justified eradicating this deadly 'tradition' by force (and put an end to the prion disease).  See Richard Rhodes excellent book "Deadly Feasts".  

Now what has this to do with China?  Nothing--and everything.  The Confusius traditionalist will say that China is the way it is because of thousands of years and layers of history.  Bunkum.  The average communist Chinese knows nothing of these traditions, except what it sees on TV (like you and I, but even less so due to censorship).  In fact, a closer analogy would be Africa and the development pains it faced post colonization (and in turn most Africans don't recall colonization, being too young).

Caveat emptor:  China, like any developing country, has traps for the unwary.  And China, BTW, has a GNP about the size of Italy or France--roughly 60 million European people.  Not over one billion.

Thesis, antithesis, synthesis --as Marx would say in a slightly different context.  A good book, Mr. China is, albeit not yet read by this reviewer.
