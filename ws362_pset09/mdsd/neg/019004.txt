One thing is for sure - if you really intend to start your own retail business, Retail Business Kit for Dummies will not take you far. It is very rudimentary, to say the least. My real disappointment is because of the CD that came with the book, supposedly full of useful forms, reports etc. They looked as if they were written with a typewriter.Anyway, regardless of your profile, I do not think that this book will help you open or run a successful retail business, nor significantly compliment your existing knowledge.
However, it does make an interesting read, and offers good common sense advice based on the authors many years in the industry.
