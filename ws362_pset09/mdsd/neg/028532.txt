I'd like to think most Floridians know not to get too exhausted out in the heat and drink lots of water but this book takes the time to spell that out for you. Finding a shady spot for midday gardening is great advice if you have a shade garden, otherwise, you're gardening wherever your plants happen to be.  This trivial  information really grated on my nerves and is what earned it just two stars.
 The lack of pictures is a big disadvantage especially when the author decides to use common as opposed to botanical names.  
I find Home Depot even uses different names from week to week on certain plants and it's impossible to determine just what is being talked about without a botanical reference.
The calendar was a little disappointing as that was the main reason for buying this book.
I can find something useful in any gardening book so it does have some value, it's just not what I was looking for
