This book slams families with more than one child.As an only child myself I took this book out of the library out of curiosity.Mrs neuman is obviously against the traditional family and glorifies the idea of having one child.As an only child I have to say that the research is seriously FLAWED.The parents of onlies will not live forever,friends and other relatives will never be as close as a sibling.I can honestly say that I would give anything to have a sibling and I deeply resent my parents selfish decision to have one child.Not all onlies are confident or social butterflys as she boldly claims,very often the opposite is true.Very often the so-called MYTHS about onlies are in fact true.This is a sad attempt to sell a book .The greatest gift that any parent can give their child is a sibling.I have 5 children,they are well provided for,we dont live in poverty or chaos,we dont need to spend thousands on classes galore,we certainly dont drive a station wagon,or live on macaroni and I stay home with my kids.Mrs Neumans negative view of large families and stay at home moms is sad to say the least
