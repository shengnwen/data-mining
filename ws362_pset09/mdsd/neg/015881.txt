The was a very uneven story. I couldn't tell whose story it was and I found the dialog unnatural and at times comical.
I was disappointed that Ms.Miller did not portray the relationship between Daisy and Duncan for what is was-A predator and a victim. I was equally disappointed that when Daisy's father finally is aware of the relationship, he does not share the information that Duncan is a pedophile, thus allowing Duncan to get away with his behavior.
All in all, the book misfired on several levels
