This is a book for people who do NOT work on designing video devices.  If you want to build something based on this book, your design will most likely fail since there are many ERRORS in the book.  BUT if you want to FOOL your boss on some paper design or FOOL some employers to get a JOB, this is a book for you since it is easy to read and you don't need any knowledge beyond high school
