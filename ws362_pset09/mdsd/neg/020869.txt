This was one of the most frustrating books to read on the subject of eating disorders because the emphasis seemed to be on the wrong things.  When we think of eating disorders we must realize how much we still need to  learn.  There were so many references to &quot;ideal&quot; weights and  dieting that it would be counterproductive for a patient with an eating  disorder to read this book.   Some interesting facts about eating disorders  and pregnancy were mentioned in this book, and these seemed to be more in  the authors' area of expertise. There are many other books written on  treating eating disorders and the key seems to be treating the patient with  compassion.   There was confusion in the book in defining the different  eating disorders because there aren't any international standards.  In the  U.S. we typically  use the DSM-IV for diagnosis guidelines, but the  guidelines used in other countries are somewhat different making this more  difficult to understand
