I'm not sure what's with all the 5-star reviews for Bad Haircut.  I did find it mildly amusing.  Nothing seemed too laugh out loud hilarious though.  It's more of a chuckler, with some nice memories thrown in.

After awhile though, all of the stories and themes started blending together a little too much.  Too many stories seemed like stories I had read a few chapters ago.  

And lastly, the stories often end abruptly without any sort of ending.  Period.  End of story.

Bad Haircut was a nice, quick easy read though, but after awhile, it lost my interest.  Tom Perotta may be better as a novelist, but I don't think I'll read him again to find out
