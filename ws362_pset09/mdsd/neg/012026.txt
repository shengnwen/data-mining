I bought the Wharton's Stretching book and liked it, finding it very useful as a martial artist. This book, however, merely rehashes everything in the Stretching book, but in an inferior manner. Although it has photos instead of drawings, the Wharton's Stretch book clearly shows acceptable ranges of motion for each stretch. In addition, the Back Book has a section on training with weights that bordered on ridiculous. The author's clearly know little about neither weight training as therapy nor weight training for strength and flexibility. This book was a real disappointment. Buy their first book, avoid this one
