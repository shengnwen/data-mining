Just finished this read and I am still wondering why.  It started out well enough; the story idea was original and interesting, but I should have figured it out when the "Indiana Jones stuff" started. The writing FOR THESE EXCITING PARTS WERE BIT OVERDONE!!!!  And then we are back to normal again, NO WAIT!  SOMETHING EVEN MORE EXCITING AND LESS PROBABLE IS HAPPENING NOW!!!!  Anyhow, I felt my 8th grader could have probably written this book.  So I had nothing more to read and I continued.  I should have stopped, because as you know if you have read the other reviews... the Davinci Code junk started.  What a load!  Jesus is now gay?  Couldn't come up with a variation of those gnostic views huh?  So lets make some stuff up and cause a controversy so we can sell books.  I really hate to tell you Mr. Reilly but thats not a new idea either. Very low quality read, in other words don't waste the time reading this when you can watch paint dry, water boil, or even watch a cake bake.  And if you are a late night reader as I am you would be better off going to sleep
