Agree with the other reviewer...this is simply the Premiere 6 Adobe user's manual with the bible cover. The only real diference is that they use more pictures (screenshots) to illustrate. I read the Adobe manual, and it was fairly useless. I looked at this book for about 30 minutes at the university bookstore and it literally followed the same sequence as the manual. Clearly, not worth $40+ as there are better books available
