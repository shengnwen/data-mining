This was my first Carla Neggers read. I was surfing through on-line reviews (which I am very big on) and came across a recommendation for Dark Sky by Carla Neggers. As I'd never heard of her, I did some more digging and came upon nothing but accolades for the author. So I ran out and purchased Dark Sky and began reading. Before I got too far into the book, I figured out that there was another book that preceded it, and thought I'd be less confused if I stopped and read that one first. 

So, obviously I did, and was totaly dissapointed. HORRIBLE. But I did FORCE myself to finish it through shear determination. The writing didn't flow well. There were a lot of errors in my copy, which got under my skin, but might not have if the book had been better. The plot and charachters (not to mention their actions-especially of the inn owners) were unconvincing. There was no build up. The suspense was flat. No chemistry between Rob and Maggie. I MEAN NONE. But yeah, they had sex. But we expect that. GIVE ME STEAM. I want some CHEMISTRY. The only redeaming quality about this book was the interation between Juliet and Ethan. They get the one star. If not for them I would probably never read one of this authors books again. For my interest in them, I'll read Dark Sky. The word "wanderlust" was used ad nauseum. Surely she could have come up with another word or description. Borrow if you must, but don't by. Better yet call me, and you can have my copy
