This book is extremely basic and full of fluff.

Who needs two chapters of fonts coverage??

Reading the overly positive reviews with one line make me suspicious that the author had their friends write reviews for them to up their overall ranking. Especially the fact that the reviews keep referring to the authors by their first names only.

This book was a let down for this techie
