"Prey" is the first book I have read by Michael Crichton. I was intrigued by the premise of an artificially intelligent being based on nanotechnology. The plot is captivating at first, but there are so many scientific impossibilities that it was impossible to suspend disbelief for long. The way the bad guys are dispatched of is especially bad, reminiscent of old "B" movies. Key plot details are given cursory explanations in the last two pages. Overall, I felt my time would have been better spent elsewhere
