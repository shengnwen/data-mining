During a $20 Tarot reading at a Spirituality exhibition, the very un-insightful Tarot reader (who told me nothing significant about my future), recommended this book to me.
But I did not buy this book on her recommendation, why would I? She was awful. It was my Mother, who is everything new age and spritual (and the reason why I was at the exhibition in the first place), who bought the book and suggested I read it. 
There is nothing profound about this book, in fact if i follow just one of this Authors suggestions, such as talking to every stranger that i lock eyes with (because apparently they have a message for me) not only would i not get anything done, but I would probably be dragged off to the nearest hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.
A spotlight reviewer gave this book 5 stars as a comedy, good on him, for seeing the brighter side of this book
