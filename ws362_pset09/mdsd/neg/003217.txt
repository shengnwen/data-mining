I'm still reading this book and the more I read, the more bored I become with Kram's writing style.  From what I've read, he tries to take a historical event and play into it a creative writing story.  I don't like the writing style because of that.

He's too blurry and indirect in his descriptive and superfluous in his use of innuendo and allusions.  After awhile, the myriad allusions are too scattered to really to the point of incoherence.

He also hints at Ali's cowardness towards his Islamic Brethren.  I find this fascinating, but unfortunately, Kram's writing style is vague.  Possibly he writes in this vague manner to avoid being sued by Ali for slander?  I'm not sure.  But the elusive style makes the reading boring when it could have been down right fascinating.

So far, I've gotten the most of what happened in the famous 1975 "Thrilla in Manila" boxing match between Muhammad Ali vs Joe Frazier from Frazier's autobiography.  This book serves more to confuse the reader than to help shed light on either the life of Ali, Frazier, or that great boxing match in Manila in 1975.

I give it two stars for Kram's original take on this event, but I take away the other three stars because so far, it hasn't been effective and the reading his been more of a headache of trying to interpret lousy 1st draft "streams of conscience" nonsense, than anything entertaining or interesting
