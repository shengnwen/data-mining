The book is very well written. It is the detail description of somehow mysterious pop group, which is placed just after Elvis and Beatles, as far as the number of sold records is concerned.
You will not find here something completely unexpected. Insteed, you will find a lot of details which are not easly available.
So, for anybody who is a real fan of ABBA - this book is a must !
