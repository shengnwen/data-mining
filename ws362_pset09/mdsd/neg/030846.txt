Why can't books of inspiration and insight have some humor that illustrates the points being made.  I found this tape to be maudlin and overwrought with poignancy which did not inspire me nor shed any new insights.  The stories were ok, but there is a lot more to golf than what I heard on this tape.  Needless to say, I was disappointed
