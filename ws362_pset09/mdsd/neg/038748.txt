When you have a kid on the autism spectrum that isn't talking/developing appropriately, sometimes things work out OK on their own.  That's pretty much a summary of this books contents.

However, all too often, they do not work out on their own, and any parent that buys this book because their child isn't talking/developing appropriately, and decides to do nothing or delay testing and treatment, is making a horrible mistake, a mistake they will pay for later after sleepless nights filled with regret and self blame.

Yeah, some kids don't talk late and turn out fine.  But walk into the "special needs" section of any school or hospital, and you'll see the ones that haven't, and each one is heartbreaking.  Early intervention is key, in helping kids on the Autism spectrum.  If you purchase this book and "buy" what the author has to say, then you're gambling with your child's future.
