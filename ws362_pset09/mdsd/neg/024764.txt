For a book that is titled 'The Basics', there was way too much jargon with no explanation.  For example, there is a paragraph that tell the reader to 'learn the difference between the two types of hands, the fixed and the following', but then there is no explanation of the differences or even what either means.  It also references different parts of the horse without explanation, such as the 'withers'.  I did finally find an appendix that explains some of the terms, but it is never referenced in the book, and it does not explain all of the terms
