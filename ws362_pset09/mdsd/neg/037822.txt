Previously bought the Chez Panisse Cookbook, was disappointed and then  bought this one thinking it might be an improvement. Something about the  recipes in these books leaves me cold. Either the recipes are unappealing,  or they require exotic ingredients that are difficult to find in this part  of the country. Also, not a lot of content for the price. I would not buy  this until I had browsed it in a regular bookstore. Two mistakes are  enough
