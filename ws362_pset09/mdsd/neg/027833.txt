Ann M. Martin is a marvelously talented children's book writer, particularly for white, upper-middle-class suburban kids. This book was  obviously NOT written by her, but by someone hired to help her get out the  ridiculously high number of books she is under contract to write. Anyone  familiar with the early BSC books will recognize how out of character the  characters in this book are. Besides, the plot is tremendously boring and  stupid
