From the late 1700s to the mid 1800s, Western and central Europe put forth several major works of literature that examined the relationship between men, and between men and society.  These include On Liberty by J. S. Mill, Leviathan by T. Hobbes, Capital by K. Marx, and The Social Contract by Frenchman Jean Jacques Rousseau.  This book examines the origins, nature, logic, and inner workings of relationships between three entities.   These entities are man the individual, men as in a collection of individuals, and the state, where the state includes laws, government, and other institutions.  I first read this book in a high school class.  I tried to read it later when in college.  I could not finish this book either time; this is the most difficult book I have ever read.  Unlike other discourses on politics, this book is heavily influenced by philosophy, and written like a text in philosophy.  I would not recommend it for any but the most determined reader
