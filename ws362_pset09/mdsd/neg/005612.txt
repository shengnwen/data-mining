With the hotplate and microwave on the cover, you might think that this is a book of recipes that are prepared using those two items.  This is not the case.  Yes, there is a hotplate chapter and a microwave chapter, but a large number of recipes in the other 11 chapters require an oven. And even the microwave and hotplate recipes tend to require counter space, extensive preparation, and a large number and variety of ingredients.

If you really do live in a dorm where you will have very little room, and only a mini-fridge and microwave, I suggest either finding another book, or just making it up as you go.

Or if, like me, you live in a tiny studio with no counter space and only a fridge, microwave, and hotplate, it offers a few more options, but not much.  Most of the recipes require too much preparation.  And, if you are concerned about energy use and safety, many of the recipes also have fairly long cooking times. 

Overall, I'd say this would be a good book aimed at the beginning cook.  Perhaps for someone who just moved into their first real apartment with a full kitchen.  This is not a good book for anyone with limited space and resources
