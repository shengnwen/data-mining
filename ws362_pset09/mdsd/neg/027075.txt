I couldn't even read half of this garbage before wanting to throw it away! Vicki Iovine tells a very negative story of Motherhood, and as a first time Mom to be, I couldn't be more nervous aobut it. Thank God I read many of the other reviews which claim this book is highly exaggerated. I am going to try to return the book tomorrow. Do not waste your time here unless you want to be depressed about Motherhood
