I purchased this book based on a good review in Upside Magazine, but I have to confess to being rather disappointed. Ms. Ferdinaldi never really describes data warehousing per se; the book is more of an instruction  manual aimed at novice managers to help them figure out how to ask for a  data warehouse. I was anticipating a review of warehouse types and  technological issues, but instead got a primer for B-school freshmen about  how to suck up to upper management and make nice to the  &quot;technicians&quot;. Further, it is written for an audience of Fortune  1000 type managers - she spends far too much time on dealing with  bureaucracy issues that just wouldn't exist at smaller companies, where  data warehousing is just as critical an issue. About 10% of the text is  educational, the rest is pretty much &quot;duh&quot;. And the writing style  is repetitive redundancy - the author states the same thing numerous times.  In short, if you are a businessman (read - non-techie) who wants to learn  about data warehouses without getting a computer science degree, then look  elsewhere
