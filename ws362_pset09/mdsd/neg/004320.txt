The book is too general and it's not likely that a traveler will visit the who US. For the 4 states that I visited, the information was scarce. I regret of carrying all that weight. Should not include hotel info since it changes a lot and good deals are found better at other sources. Should include maps of most important cities like NYC, NYC metro, etc
