As a student reading this book for a class focusing on the French Revolution I found it too dense for someone who has no previous knowledge of the revolution.  Doyle packs A LOT of information into these 425 pages.   He does not place emphasis on any particular people or events which makes  understanding specific turning points difficult.  However, I can imagine  this book would be ideal for one who already has a thorough understanding  of the French Revolution and is simply looking for a new perspective
