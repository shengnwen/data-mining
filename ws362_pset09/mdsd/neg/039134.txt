I did not like this book very much. The author treats her subjects as if they were some sort of cockroach species under her idealistic American microscope.  It is more accurate to say that this book is an account of how expatriates "survive" in KSA and not a true representation of the nation or its people. It is full of supercilious generalizations and patronizing commentary. It fully conforms to the biased view of Muslim nations presented in the Western media.  I know many Saudis and they are nothing like the examples presented in this book. To the contrary, they are some of the most hospitable and genuine people I have come accross.  If you want the "Fox News" version of Saudi, by all means read this book
