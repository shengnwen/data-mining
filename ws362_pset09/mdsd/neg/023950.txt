the consept of giving the number 2s their due credit is good enough, and the stories and facts make for great reading and entertainment - in addition to serving several trivia purposes.  Improvement for the next issue must be pictures of all the artists - we know how they sang, now we also no why - but how did they look in their day?

Still - a great book!
