This book is not what the cover appears to indicate - although ording online, it was the title more than the cover that attracted me to it. Sure it has some sections on restoration - which to me indidcates retouching, but a lot of it is about photo illustration.

Very well explained and well put together, this small book shows a good representation of some of the ways one can integrate photos that result in something that is nigh impossible in one shot alone. 

The book covers restoration, body manipulation, sky and contrast fiddling, montages, photo art and commercial artwork. The problem with this book is each chapter is different from the rest. I see no need to have all of these together, rather split them up into an expanded book for each section. I had no intrest in the artwork of a photo illustration of a woman in the sky, but was interested in the body manipulation and the photo restoration. But each of those chapters were not detailed enough. You will run into many different situations and one photo or example is not enough. 

More please - so I can select the titles that pertian to me. Its like putting fine cabinetry and house framing and boat building in the same book because you want to appeal to those with a saw as a tool instead of Photoshop as a tool. Photoshop is used in many different facits and never to the breadth by one that this book would like one to believe.

Limited appeal until its broken out into a series and added with more depth
