As a physician, research scientist, and former engineer, I agree with the author, Michael LeGault, that there is no substitute for a disciplined, evidence based, and carefully reasoned approach to thinking and problem solving.. no matter how intuitive or inspired one may feel.  I also agree that our education system is failing miserably not only our children, but the future standing of our Country - by totally abdicating it's responsibility to inculcate such a cognitive skillset in our children.  What I object to, however, and frankly find apalling, is the author's oversimplification of complex issues like CO2 emissions & Climate change, or his insinuation that ADHD may not be a legitemate clinical entity, or his lumping Daniel Goleman's book "Emotional Intelligence" with Gladwell's "Blink"..  This last gaffe I found particularly grating, as LeGault presents a false dichotomy between the (as Goleman calls them) "high road" mental processes like objectivity.. or disciplined, carefully reasoned thinking, and "low road" processes like intuition; which so vitally subserve the gut level social smarts that every day, guide us through our myriad social interactions, and help us survive and even thrive amid the harsh political realities of our "workplace", be it a newsroom in Toronto, a Research Hospital in Philadelphia, or a grammar school playground in Mississippi.  Mr LeGault's book would be fine if we all lived on Planet Vulcan..  Seeing as how we do not, however..  I would strongly recommend to anyone interested in reading this book, that they also read Daniel Goleman's new book "Social Intelligence".  Contrary to LeGault's opinion, the two paradigms are complimentary to one another, and both absolutely necessary if one is to be high functioning and at the same time, human.
