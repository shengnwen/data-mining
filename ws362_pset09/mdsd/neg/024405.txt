I am glad to know it wasn't just me. I was really disappointed by this book. I have tried to read everyone of Cornwell's books and picked this one up based on past experience. It does not even come close to her usual skills. It may be that it was written for serialization in a magazine. It should not have been allowed out as a book. Her publishers did not do her a favor by letting this go out to the public. It is possible that Win and Sykes could become interesting characters in a well developed book; they were interesting in this book and I liked the setting in Cambridge, but it wasn't enough
