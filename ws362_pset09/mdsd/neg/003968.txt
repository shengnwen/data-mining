The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful.
JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen. 
But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound
