I could barely keep my eyes open through this one. It's so theoretical and dry. There's nothing practical in this for parents. Maybe more so for the professionals. And I HATE the clumsy and awkward &quot;he/she&quot; all the time and all over the place. It's very distracting and highly unprofessional
