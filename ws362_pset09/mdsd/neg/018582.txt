The Democrat Party has for years been considered by many average voters as less tolerant for people of faith. 

It didn't used to be that way. During the Cold War, Kennedy and Johnson and the rest of the Democrats stood up to the atheists running the USSR and never apologized for doing so.

Things have changed, and to the Democrats' loss.

It is not George Bush going apoplectic when someone says "Merry Christmas" instead of "Happy Holidays." How many Republicans are trying to root out school prayer and ban the Pledge of Allegiance? Who is it that looks down on people who go to church and support the Ten Commandments? 

It sure isn't Bob Dole or Dick Cheney.

The reality that Bill Press needs to address is what can the Democrats do to make themselves credible in religious-based issues. Senator Joseph Lieberman should be his model of choice, for it was Lieberman who stood alone when he publicly denounced President Clinton over his affair and subsequent lying regarding Monica Lewinsky. Religious values and morality were written all over his speech. And no Democrat dared to condemn him for it
