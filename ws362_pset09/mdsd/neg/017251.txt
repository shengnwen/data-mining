This book is a well-needed antidote to those who think Islam is a "Religion of Peace." Since its inception in the mid-seventh century, Islam has been on the warpath; it conquered half of Christendom (all of North Africa; also Spain, Turkey, and the Balkins). Robert Spencer has done a fine job documenting Islam's unremitting attack on Christianity, and Christianity's only aggresive reply, the Crusades. This book is heady reading, and necessary especially in this day and age.
