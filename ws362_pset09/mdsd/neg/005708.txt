Robert Atwan is an absolutely marvelous editor of this series.  But the guest editors, lately, are not literary enough--or rather their choices aren't.  When you reread essays selected by Elizabeth Hardwick ('86) or Cynthia Ozick ('98), they hold up beautifully.  I'm not sure Orlean's pieces are as timeless.  It must be hard, after all these years, to keep finding distinguished new guest editors, so I certainly can't blame Atwan for turning to glossy article writers
