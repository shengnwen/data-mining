I looked at the title and thought - Yes this looks great.  Then I read the first sentence and came across "blood splatter".  Not the correct terminology and an immediate let down.  The correct "technical" term is "blood spatter".  

This may seem a small matter to some, but it immediately made me dubious to the authenticity of the rest of the material, and whether more of the content portrayed incorrect technical information.

This book maybe a good read, but is not for someone who is looking for CORRECT procedure or technical insight
