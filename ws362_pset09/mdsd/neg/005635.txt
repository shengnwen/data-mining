     The only thing good about this book is the title.  THE DREAMS OUR STUFF IS MADE OF: How Science Fiction Conquered the World would be a great title for a book about how science fiction ideas, technologies, and authors influenced the real world.  Clarke and communications satelites.  Star Trek and flip-phones.  Heinlein and the space program.  SF as a whole and science teaching. 

     This book is not about that.  It yearns to be a scholarly treatise on the origins of and changes to science fiction.  Disch decides that Poe was the father of SF, because he thinks lots more people read Poe than read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.  But he bases the SF paternity claim on Poe works that virtually no one has read. And even if fewer people have read the original Frankenstein than have read Poe's "The Raven" or "The Pendulum", I would certainly say the image of the Monster and the idea of a man of science reaching too high are much more a part of our popular culture than Poe's creations.
   
     Another major thesis is that America is a nation of liars, and that SF is the art form best suited to tell lies.  Since all fiction is by definition, not true, why SF tales are any more "lies" than, say, mysteries or romances, I fail to understand.  Disch then goes into a rant about Viet Nam and Oliver North and Big Lies, which, while I largely agree with, has nothing to do with SF or its impact.

    He spends a lot of time on how the "New Wave" writers of the 60's taught us to accept the idea of a post-nuclear wasteland world -- which I find incongruous in that I think Star Trek, at that same time, was showing us that a future Earth without a nuclear holocaust was possible.

    I don't have room to go into depth about a lot of his other objectionable (and often insulting) statements, so I'll summarize:
    -The SF audience consists largely of 12 year old boys, and women were seldom tempted by classic SF, as they were too busy enjoying gossipy romances.
    -Robert A. Heinlein is a fascist, racist, sexist hack (Disch spends many pages trashing RAH, while never understanding his Libertarianism, nor discussing his impact on everything from the space program to the boomer generation.)
    -Ursula Le Guin is the only female writer he mentions at any length, and most of that is attacking her for editing the Norton Anthology of SF into what he sees as a biased feminist manifesto.
    -The only area where he actually talks about SF's influence on the world is its inspiration for Scientology and various cult religions, mostly suicidal, millennial, and whacko.
    -Chapters of boring personal reminiscences and name dropping about New Wave writers, whose influence on modern SF is frankly doubtful.
    -SF has become a medium attracting largely counterculture "avant-gardists" because it celebrates "sex, drugs, and the right wardrobe."
   
    He concludes this extremely pretentiously written work by deciding that:  
    -written SF is moribund, that it will lose to movies and TV (because of improvements in special effects technology), 
    -written books in general are doomed, except for interactive novels, which he says will become common,
    -future "fictional environments" will be written by teams of writers, and "will doom the soloist author to extinction." 

    This is not a book about How SF Changed the World, it is a book about How the World Changed SF, and it is mostly wrong.

    In conclusion, I would recommend this book only to someone taking a college literature class taught by a professor who despises Science Fiction.  The ideas in the book, and the writing of the book itself, will give the student many fine ways to put down the entire genre, and will no doubt get the student an A on his term paper by reflecting back the prof's prejudices.

    For anyone else, particularly anyone who actually likes SF, I'd say, "definitely don't waste your time".
