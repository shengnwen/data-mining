I bought this book in hopes of a guilty pleasure.  But the only one who's guilty is the writer -- of extremely bad writing.  The whole thing reads like a painful freshman exercise in creative composition.  The analogies are excruciating and the whole story is what comics would call "hack."  Search for better trash elsewhere, perhaps an "old-reliable" like Jackie Collins or Judith Krantz
