I must agree with previous reviewer comments.  This book attempts to describe the Directorate of Science and Technology, yet it focuses on the bureaucracy of upper management and has little discussion regarding the programs and technologies created by the DS&amp;T.  This organization has played a cricial role in shaping modern history, yet the book is dull and uninteresting to read
