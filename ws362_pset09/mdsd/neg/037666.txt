I thought it would be really cool to be part of a society that wore red hats in public.  Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me.  But then I started reading the book.  I found the characters non-believable.  The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive.  Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind.  The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination.  The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind.  And the ending?  It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven
