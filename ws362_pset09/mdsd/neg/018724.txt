Upon reading and studying this book thoroughly, I have to say I find that  while these two authors have expanded the original Carole Jackson's Color  Me Beautiful system to include 12 seasonal types rather than just the 4  original ones,which needed done,I agree,I think that this book lacked a  spark of something the origonal had even though it was not definitive  enough.I also did not find the color sample patches large or clear enough  to follow-they look like they were made with a wax crayon!I think that with  some re-doing, this book could be a real winner, but as it stands I have to  give it one less star than the origonal had.I am looking forward to reading  this book's update..
