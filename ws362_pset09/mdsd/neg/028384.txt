The book covers 15 professional fields: Advertising, Architecture, Clergy, Legal, Dentistry, Education, Firefighting, Journalism, Law Enforcement, Life Sciences, Modeling, Moviemaking, Politics, and the Sex Industry. Within each topic are some job descriptions, a bit of day-in-the-life, education, and salary. It's a pretty broad brush that might be okay for a short story or for a minor character, but there's nowhere near enough information for a fully-fleshed character in a novel-length work. 

Personally, I would recommend looking in the Career/Job Search section of your library or bookstore, and at the government's Occupational Outlook Handbook. Information in these resources is often more detailed - career paths, personality traits, day-to-day tasks, etc.

Generally, I like Raymond Obstfeld's books, but this one just wasn't one of them.
