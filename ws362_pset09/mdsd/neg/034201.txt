If you want gobs of disorganized and arcane information get this book. Unless you already know a lot about Dreamweaver, this is NOT the book for you. It is overwritten and convoluted. The information is strewn about through chapter after mired chapter. The repeated excursions into comparative differences between this version of the program and previous versions leave the newcomer lost immediately. There is no clear step by step process outline in any one location and terminology is thrown about wildly without definition or reference. The program itself is far more intuitive than this book.I'm sure the author really knows his stuff, but he is incapable of expressing it clearly and concisely
