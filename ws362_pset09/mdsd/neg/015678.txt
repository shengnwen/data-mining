I thought that Preacher's boy had an intresting first couple chapters but after that i started to notice it got boring.  i think there should be more of a plot in the book.  it is basically about 2 boys named robbie and willie who pull pranks and get in trouble. After Robbie meats Zeb and Vile it gets a little better but I still think it could of been a little more well-written
