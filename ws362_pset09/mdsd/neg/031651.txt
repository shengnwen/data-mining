This books is a load of nonsense. A prime example of pop spirituality. 

There are things in this book that are factually WRONG!! 

This nonsense is to philosophy and spirituality what a fastfood hamburger is to cuisine.... you know what? That comparison is unfair. This book is far worse to the spiritual well being of a person than hamburgers are to the physical.
