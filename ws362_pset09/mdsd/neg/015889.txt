Other reviewers note Stewart's courage and his recent service in Iraq. Certainly, he chose a difficult and challenging journey. Nonetheless, I found this to be an often unsatisfying read. Stewart offers us scholarly history and a glimpse at a land rarely seen even by Afghans. Unfortunately, he's a big whiner, approached his journey with an enormous sense of entitlement, and displays a lack of cultural insight or sensitivity. He makes ludicrous claims about the benficience of the British Empire and often comes across as a Calvinistic scold. These negative traits are most apparent in the first third and last fifth of the book. Stewart has made other journeys, on foot, in difficult geography and seemed to expect Himalyan hospitality in war torn, tribal Afghanistan. Once he stops complaining and focuses on his surroundings, the journey is fascinating. Unfortuately, the overly entitled foreign service officer reappears as the story ends. 

Unlike other grouchy travelers, like Paul Theroux, Stewart seems devoid of humor and an ability to see himself in context. I'm not sure I want to read his Iraqi chronicle after seeing where he claims that his administrative innovations in southern Iraq should be implemented countrywide (in places far more heterogenous and strife-torn). It seems like it would just be more of the same
