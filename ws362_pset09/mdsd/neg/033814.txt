Historical imperative is mercyless:Federations do not survive.Anybody who asserts that a group of heterogenic nations in every respect-cultural,linguistic,religious,racial,ethnic.-could coexist within  one virtual border and where like Brown's Movement will persist difusion of  uniformitarian tendencies that serve to create  common identity,is simply  ignorant utopist,that fails true vision of history and &quot;Us and  They&quot; factor as product of vigorius separatistic forces which promote  diversity,quite unlike authors solipsistic &quot;unity in diversity&quot;  social outlooks.Convergence is not the option and it could contribute  towards escalation of particularistic sentiments,and it is absurd by the  virtue of its own egalitarian sentiments because creolisation which will be  created will exhaust itself in capability to promote generation of  acceptable to all cultural modalities,unlike the model of clearly defined  social coexistence,which has infinite potentials for progress within  balanced preservation of complexities of group identitys.Interesting is  that a new kind of identity has suplanted ancient ethno-cultural loyalities  namely continental identity.Thus people speak of themselves as  &quot;Europians&quot;,&quot;Africans&quot;,&quot;Asians&quot;-as if  Irish,Greeks,Swedes or Japanese,Philipinos and Aphganistanians are  something different from others,and this is clearly case of subconciouss  emulation of Mondialistic identity model,nurtured by those Social Engineers  like Marx,Popper,Russell and others who would assert that &quot;global  citizenship&quot;,presumably one that is born under Guiding  Force-temporarily functioning enforcing center(role that U.S.S.R. tried to  play once),will eliminate regionalisms and lead to Eternal Peace,where  conflicting defence systems would be merged into &quot;planetary  police&quot;.It is precisely that unnatural policy that has lead to  &quot;Heider Phenomenon&quot; in Austria.Xenophobia will ultimately show  itself victorious over mediocretisationing of masses,streching their  collective identity too far into wide areas of Cartesian deductionist  aculturisations ,and it would be impossible to establish illusion of  neutral relations in such collectives,without massive,faceless bureucratic  machinery.It is living truth that majority of those people who were engaged  furiously in ellimination of communism during 1989,had sympathy for the  regime,that claimed virtualy the same ideals, without mental  reservations.All those &quot;dissidents&quot; and &quot;martyrs&quot; who  were persecuted,tortured,maligned,barefooted,derogated,maligned  again,marginalised etc. are only product of their own conformism,and if  some other &quot;ism&quot; were to be triumphant it is likely that many of  them will join the mainstream,representing evilness of curent social  reality.With regard to N.A.T.O., it was perhaps pragmatic nessecity of the  time,but now idea of collective deffence,under the euphemism of  partnership,is as absurd as Planet Earth's football team.It is clear who  are Russians and who are Estonians or Armenians within the Alliance.History  will witness massive resistence within the N.A.T.O member states to risk  their citizens lifes and resources,for what are somebody else's  problems,even when outcome may be benneficciary. Simply,Greeks and  Americans are not 300.000.000.And they are partners-but only complementary  up to the certain point,and rigid enforcement could provoke only ambivalent  relations.Therefore,N.A.T.O. has reached its fifteen minutes of glory and  speaking of its future is highly hipocritical euphemistic exposure of  relation-Hungary was occupied,but now it's partner,U.S.S.R was ruthless  Empire,but West is voluntary created Commonwealth.Hopefully, perhaps such  globalistic ideology will transform itself peacefully,in accordance to some  of its own ideals,and that there will be no need for illusions of  &quot;security guaranteed&quot; within what seems to be a fast evolving  Power Monopoly-evolving into advocate of everything that was against for
