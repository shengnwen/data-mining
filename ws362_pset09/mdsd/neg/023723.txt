I bought this book because I thought it'd be fun and interesting, but I was wrong. There were many tests which were interesting and I didn't mind taking the time to answer the forty to sixty questions. What bothered me was when I finished answering all the questions I was left completely confused. I'd find out my score for a test, but it didn't tell me if my score was a good thing or a bad thing. Instead it showed the results of other people, which I really didn't care about. I only wanted to know about my score, which I didn't get. I hope others were able to find this book helpful because I sure didn't
