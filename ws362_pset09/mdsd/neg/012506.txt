Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language.  I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs.  Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years.  Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one
