I've read a few Brad Meltzer books, trying to find the fascination that some others have found in them.  Nope, I still haven't figured out his allure yet.

In a radio interview, I heard the interviewer gush over Melter's dialogue. He commented that it's the most realistic dialogue that he had ever read.  I have two problems with this.

a) While some of Meltzer's dialogue is indeed catchy and does sound like your two siblings arguing with each other, Meltzer has no depth.  By that I mean, even the cop's witty banter sounds like he is arguing with his younger brother and the grocer's wisecracks, ad infinitum.  It gets old quick.

b) Who wants to listen to their siblings arguing with each other.  I'll give Meltzer credit for being able to create the image, but most or all of his characters ultimately come off as sounding extremely whiney and self-serving.

I could continue with numerous other complaints, but if knowing about Meltzer's amateurish dialogue doesn't turn you off, you're probably going to buy the book anyway and overlook the one-dimensional cardboard characters
