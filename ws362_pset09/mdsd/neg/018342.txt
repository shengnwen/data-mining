I thought I was getting a paper back text also, I wrote to the seller twice and they said the text is in the cd rom, this means my son has to carry his lap top to school all the time, I would have never bought it, if I did more homework, next semester this Amazon stuff is not worth it, I am just going to pay extra from the book store at College so I know what I am getting!!!
