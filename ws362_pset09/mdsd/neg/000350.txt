I couldn't go three pages without running into something that was sloppy, incomplete, or just plain irritating.

Full of many good examples that back up the book's main idea (using lessons of history to guide current decision-making), the book unfortunately is also full of hyperbole, flawed argument, inaccurate generalizations and over-simplifications.  

It's easy to show how the lesson of a historical incident can validate a decision, if you ignore all interpretations of that historical incident except those which confirm the decision you're trying to support.  Tautologies are convenient, but they prove nothing.  A little more precision, a little more discipline, and the thesis of the book would have been a lot more convincing.

Even worse than that: too often, the author asserts controversial opinions as though they were accepted fact; too often over-generalizes to the point of meaninglessness; too often slips from chatty informality into factual inaccuracy.  

I really, really wanted to respect this book, because I am always looking for works that synthesize the lessons of many different historical periods.  The idea behind this book was intriguing, which is why the poor execution of that idea is so disappointing.
