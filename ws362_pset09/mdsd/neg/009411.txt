Regrettably, Lerner has &quot;covered&quot; the impressive original research and intellectual synthesis of Ellen Leopold's book &quot;A Darker Ribbon: Breast Cancer, Women, and Their Doctors in the 20th Century.&quot; Leopold's is the first book ever written on the social history of the radical mastectomy and breast cancer in this century, including previously unpublished correspondence and new information. Lerner makes a passing reference to Leopold's book, mistakenly dismissing her as a &quot;journalist&quot; and &quot;radical feminist.&quot; Neither appellation is accurate. She is an architect and economic historian. Alas, she is not an M.D. For readers who want the insights of the intelligent female discoverer of this 20th century terrain rather than the sanitized medical perspective, I recommend &quot;A Darker Ribbon.&quot
