I was disappointed in this book. It just didn't hold together. There were too many elements mixed in - romance, the supernatural, murder, but it didn't tie in the end. The romance was vague and I couldn't understand why  the protagonist chose Andy when it looked like Michaels was setting her up  with Walt. Michael's characters as usual were wonderful but as a whole it  fell far short of her other, excellent work. Nonetheless, she is a  wonderful writer. I remain a big fan
