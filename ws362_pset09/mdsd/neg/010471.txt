I've only read about 50-60 pages and decided not to waste anymore of my time with this book.  The dragons are absolutely retarded in this book.  I hate reading books where authors make the main characters all Rambos and stupidifying powerful enemies or creatures so the Rambos can mow them down in a lame attempt to show how "awesome" the main characters are.  This book also reads like you're watching somebody play a game.  Somebody almost dead?  No problem, here's a healing potion.  Gored by a dragon?  No big deal, here's a healing potion!  If not a healing potion, then a handy cleric with the cure dragon bite spell.  And while we're at it, let's chug some acid resistance potions to make that acid from the dragon useless!  Being instantly revived from fatal wounds totally cheapens combat scenes, and having a seemingly endless supply of those healing potions or healing spells is ridiculous.  I was half expecting somebody to say they got 2,000 experience points after killing a dragon.  If this sort of thing turns you off, don't buy this book, because I imagine this book would continue with the stupid dragons & instant cure themes.  I know I'm never buying a book from this author agai
