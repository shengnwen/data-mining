The size of this book and the subtitle give the impression that this book covers the whole field.  It doesn't.  This hodgepodge of Ordinary Language and other approaches to the philosophy of literature is not the whole picture.  See "A Book Worth Reading" for a different and systematic approach to this new branch of philosophy.  
The articles in this anthology are almost all by philosophers who have only a passing knowledge of literature.  The results are sophistic and at time sophomoric.  
Missing also are some famous contributions to the field, such as Sartre's What is Literature? a book which raises some serious problems for literature.  Also, the work of John M. Ellis.  
If you can afford it, buy all four books.  If not, you're better off with A Book Worth Reading.
