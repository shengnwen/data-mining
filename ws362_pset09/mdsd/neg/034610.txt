"I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and dog-gone-it, people like me." That seems to encapsulate Ms. Vanzant's approach to spirituality.

I don't know about anybody else, but when I look inside myself, I see that despite my best intentions and genuine desire to be "good," I often act in ways that trouble my own conscience. Ms. Vanzant's assertion that this stems from the fact that I have not yet really embraced my God-ness leaves me troubled, empty, and confused. 

The fact is that it doesn't really matter if one's soul "opens up."  The question is what is one's soul opened up to?  If you are looking for a book that will tell you what you want to hear about spirituality (that you are a god, that there's nothing essentially wrong with humanity, that evil comes only from lack of enlightenment, that everything that you need to be fulfilled is already inside of you, etc.), then this is the book for you.  But if you're looking for a book that deals  realistically with the problem of evil, with human nature, and with what it means to grapple with both a human and a spiritual  nature, then don't give this book a second look.

I believe Ms. Vanzant's book is an insult to the reality, the severity, and the complexity of the human condition
