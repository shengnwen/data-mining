I have read every one of Stephen King's books.  This was the only one that I have not read.  I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one.  The style of Peter Straub stinks.  Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about.  Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.  This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read
