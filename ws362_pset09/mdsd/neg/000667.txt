I purchased this book because it was assigned as a part of a literature curriculum for 7th Grade.
I am very glad that I read this book before allowing my 12 year old son to read it.
This book is about gang violence (although it is initially sugar coated as being fairly harmless pranks assigned to frightened students by one of the gang leaders.)  The book is also about angry, jaded, hateful teachers and administrators in a religious school and how they allow the gang to function in order to serve their own purposes.  
The ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience (while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill.)
  Before he is taken away in the ambulance, the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do.  
The message here is do not buck the system, no matter how corrupt the system is.
Within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation.  (Another re-curring topic.)  I knew that it was questionable whether or not I would allow my son to read this book.  I read the entire book myself hoping that there would be a redeming message in the end that would justify the rest of the book.  There isn't.  
This is the first book that I have ever thrown away rather than passing on to someone else.
Save your money.  I don't care how many awards this book received.  It is pure trash
