I am writing this review after hearing a lengthy discussion of this book by the author and sevreal critics on a radio show.  I have not read the book.

My basic comment is that this person does not seem interested in simple, rational logic.  He repeatedly gathered all good qualities recognized by people under the rubric "manly" and then asserted that any good qualities women are seen to have are not manly.  Why not?  Because women have them.  So, he has developed a metaphysical quality called "manliness" to which he attaches all goodness.

A simple example was provided when a critic cited examples of female courage, such as the ferocity with which women will defend their children, failing no sacrifice for them.  Well, that's not the same as manly courage, it seems.  Women won't "step out in front" to defend others.  THAT'S manly!  Of course, in a society during the past centuries of which women were not allowed to take leadership roles in the military or the government, how would they display this virtue?  No matter, the circumstances prove his argument.  And so it goes on
