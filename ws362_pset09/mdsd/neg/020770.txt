This book, Meditations on the Tarot, is for the ardent spiritual "seeker" what the Davinci Code or Harry Potter are for the common folk. All cater to the perennial desire to tap into the hidden powers seemingly latent in the cosmos and man via, what the (anonymous) author, "Unknown Friend" calls, "the authentic experience of mysticism, magic, and gnosis."  Even though the book carries an afterward by Cardinal Hans Urs Von Balthasar, it can in no way be reconciled with traditional Christianity based on faith and reason. The author attempts in this book to present a universal spirituality combining such genuine Catholic mystics such as St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa of Avila with the occult doctrines of such as Eliphias Levy and Louis Claude de St. Martin. This occult theosophy, as recounted by the author, is generally based on a supposed innate divine potential of man taught by the mythical Egyptian sage, Hermes Trismagistus, and the doctrine of "coincidentia oppositorum" or fusion of all opposites;above-below, heaven-earth, male-female, light-darkness, good and evil. 

This is a fascinating and seductive book, however, caveat lector, all that is spiritual is not good or of God. Remember the 1976 words of Pope Paul VI: "Evil is not a deficiency, but a highly efficient spiritual being who is both pervasive and perverting. This is a terrible reality, but true."
