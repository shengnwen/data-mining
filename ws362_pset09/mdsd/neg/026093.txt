I read the book and felt really bad for the author. According to his account in the book, here was someone who was battling psychological problems, sought therapies to try and solve his problems, and then when that course did not work, turned to a religion with the hope and expectation that it would solve his problems. When the religious course did not work, he became angry at the religion. I don't want to be harsh, since I find the author to write fairly well and it is always somewhat interesting to read about someone's life. But it seems that he should have solved his psychological problems first, before becoming involved. Or, he should have had a larger focus than  on himself and solving his issues, which seemed to be the thrust of his religious journey. I felt alternatively sad, compassionate, and embarrased for the author, as he expressed about his problems before the religious course and afterward. I deeply wish him well, and hope that he can address his underlying pain and anguish, but this seems to be a book by someone in pain who hopes that expressing this pain will be a therapy. It is probably a book that should not have been written, or at least not written until he overcomes his fixation on himself and can provide a more objective view. And, to be honest, everyone can write a book about their life and struggles, but should everyone write a book
