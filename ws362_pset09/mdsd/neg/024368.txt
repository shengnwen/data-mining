While I am very careful to avoid discomfort and injury when learning a physical activity from a book, this book was so difficult for me to follow that I ended up experiencing pain after my first session.  Not only that, but this session was only meant to familiarize myself with the stretches and assess my flexibility!!  Luckily I could sense the problems well enough to stop after about 8 of the stretches.  The only way I will attempt this method in the future is with instruction and close supervision by a qualified person.  As others have pointed out, maybe there are better AIS books to learn from, but after this experience, I am extremely skeptical to try with ANY book
