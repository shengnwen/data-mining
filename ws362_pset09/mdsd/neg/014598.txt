He called for the 2000s to "roar" just before the tech bubble burst and the 2000s sputtered.  He predicted at the beginning of 2005 that the Dow would hit 14,000 by year end.  Hmm...maybe his theories are just wrong.  

Why would a careful investor want to risk his money in a bubble of a market anyway?  Even Dent acknowledges the "bubble boom" will end badly.  The coming crash will catch most investors by surprise.  It won't come on Dent's schedule, anymore than the 2000-2002 crash did (he didn't see it coming).  His predictions of what will happen year by year into the future are ridiculous considering his totally off the mark predictions for 2005.  No one can see the future.  But a lot of investment gurus are arrogant (or dishonest) enough to try to convince us they have special abilities to see what the rest of us can't.  Dent even throws in some "Elliott waves", a form of numerology that has proven to be irrelevant at best as a forecasting tool and has caused most people who swear by it to underperform the market (wave theory guru Bob Prechter has been trying to short the market for over a decade, convinced by his "wave count" that the Dow will go to 400...obviously Dent has a different "wave count" -- one that points to 40,000.)

My advice is to not put everything in stocks and to have at least 15% of your investment assets in gold and commodities.  This has been the "bubble boom" so far in the "roaring 2000s" -- even though H.S. Dent has not recommended commodities
