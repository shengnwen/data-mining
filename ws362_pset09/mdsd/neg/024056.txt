I was expecting to find the values for saturated fats and sodium for items listed, but was disappointed to see this relatively important nutritional information missing.  Instead, it wasted space by listing the net carbs (which seem to be the carbs less the fiber, which are both included).  I have been following the &quot;Body For Life&quot; program, rather than the &quot;Atkin's diet plan&quot;, so I don't know what is important to you Atkins' followers.  The Body for Life program encourages well balanced, nutritional meals, and NOT simply the reduction of net carbs.  I was hoping this small, handy guide would help me plan a lower sodium, nutritionally balanced meal while I was on the road.  Without listing sodium or saturated fats, I find the listings incomplete and the guide almost useless.  It didn't meet my needs at all
