My preschool classes have all loved MUD PUDDLE.  The repetition with in the story is great.  We love to have an excuse to shout, "Hey, Mud Puddle." We've even made up actions to go with the bathing and dressing portions of the story.  I love this author and this is by far my favorite of his stories
