by far a worthless book on options, 
the cover looks great, but this has no 
value; I learned more on the optionsxpress 
website than this book, anyone who has 
read an options book would not 
appreciate this book it assumes you 
know nothing about options and really 
tricks you into thinking that the author 
knows what he is talking about.
