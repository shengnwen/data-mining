I came to this book with an open mind, wanting to find these other reviewers were wrong about it. No such luck. 

In my progress through the book, I haven't read one profile where someone answered their question of personal meaning -- they're still looking. I finally got fed up after the third consecutive profile of a six-figure yuppie with an ivy league degree whose big-name job wasn't fulfilling them. Big freaking whoop, right? This just wasn't a helpful book at all, and it lacked the redeeming qualities of Bronson's prose in The Nudist on the Late Shift
