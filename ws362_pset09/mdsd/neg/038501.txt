I was bored - really bored, which is why I picked this book to read from the free book trade shelves at work.  It has a good basic story but is so formulaic that I was able to predict the ending after the second or third chapter.  Being a medical professional, it was difficult to read about procedures that are outdated now and remember when they were cutting edge.  Perhaps it's also a bit scary to remember those I've worked with in the past who have had the same narcissistic outlooks.  

I think I'll pass up the other books by Dr. Cook that I have not read as of  yet.  This is the second one of his that, in my opinion, bombed miserably
