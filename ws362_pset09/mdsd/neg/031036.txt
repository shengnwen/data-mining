Berberian's work is one more example of why writers, especially first-time writers, should write about what they know intimately.  It is painfully obvious from his ponderous and endless recitation of his character's physical training techniques and his love for particular kinds of foods, that Viken has nothing else to talk about.  Existentialism?  Hah!  More like pedanticism.  Berberian's characters are flat, uninteresting, and tell us nothing new about the Mideast.  Where is the conflict in his characters?  Where is the multi-layered (and therefore believable) mileu of the cyclist's world?  Where are the characters that could provide an alternate perspective on, or at least discuss, the objective reality of terror?  Most unforgivingly, where is the drama?  Pass on this author, until he decides to write about something he at least sparingly knows, and doesn't have to research from square one
