My first Finder book was a library audio book read by Scott Brick. I thought the corporate world of electronic sales made a nice backdrop for a thriller and initially I found the story fresh and entertaining.

I later found the story to be too unrealistic with too many unlikable characters. 

Finder does an excellent job illustrating the villain Kurt Semko (I kept seeing country star Trace Adkins with a haircut) and moving the story along at a nice clip, but the protagonist kept coming across like a wise-cracking schmuck which supressed the entertainment value for this reader
