Modern creation theories are proving that an infinite God is the origination of our finite universe.  The consequence is that there is no celestial world.  Instead, God empowers and enlightens our world directly through a holistic spiritual atomic system.  Some of these atoms are human mind/souls.  Since the creation only contains wholes, mind/souls-bodies relations are never lost, making reincarnation a natural process.

So, channelling and paranormal sources must be questioned.
