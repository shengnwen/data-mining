Joel Osteen almost never mentions the word "sin."  He's so popular because he tells people what they want to hear.

As for the book, it's garbage.  He says to stop thinking only about yourself and start thinking about others.  But the whole book is about thinking about yourself.  He says that you should be happy with what you do have rather than what you don't have.  But the entire book focuses on getting what you don't have.

He says Christians can get what they want by just visualizing and saying that they will get those things.  Does anyone other than Osteen actually believe that?  What about Christians who live in Rwanda, San Salvador and other poverty-stricken parts of the world?  Or does that way of thinking only apply in affluent societies?

He says Christians deserve special treatment.  But try acting that way at work or at a store and see how much others like you for it.  Don't read this book
