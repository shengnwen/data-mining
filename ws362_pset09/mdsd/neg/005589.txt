If you never grew up on Italian food or if you are not a Italian born, there's no way one can regognize the true authentic flavors of real Italian food. You can certainly try to immediate it, but its like comparing Leather to Pleather.   I see Mario multi talented in his huge glossary of fancy words that describe history and perhaps description of foods in a high ranking cooking university.   He is best suited somewhere in northern alps of Italy teaching Italian foods to the very elite and most sophisticated snobs who would be very interested in learning Italian Mario abstract-style and maybe paying a few hundred dollars for a fancy odd meal
