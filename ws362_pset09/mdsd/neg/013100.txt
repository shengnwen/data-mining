Harrison writes as though he desperately wishes he had something interesting to say, but knows that he does not.  To cover this lack (including that of a decent story) he attempts to copy the writing style of some of Samuel Delaney's more chaotic books, but with none of Delaney's flair.

Nearly all of the book is tedious and filled to bursting with boringly insipid gratuitious sex and violence.  Sadly, his characters also lack plausable motivation for their actions.  There is little internal coherence to the story, and far too much reliance on attempted shock/weirdness value to carry the story, such as it is.

It takes Harrison some 200 pages out of a 300 page book to finally start telling the story the way he should have been doing  from the beginning.  The only reason I give it a star at all is because of the last 50 to 90 pages and because of one idea he mentions in the last couple of pages.

I'm severely disappointed that so many of my current favorite authors reviewed this book so highly.  I can only think that they have a policy of not pissing off anyone who may later be asked to review one of their own books
