Pretentious language and marginally insightful axioms let this book down.  The historical parts are somewhat interesting, but only seem to serve as the author's attempt to give credibility to his ideas on what it means to be a man. The result is a bizarre book full of drivel for gentleman-wannabes who would be better advised to find a different path to man-dom than this silly book..
