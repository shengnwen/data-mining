the only thing i liked about this book was the introduction.
i am a white, professional, upper middle class female, 40 years old.  there wasn't any story that i could relate to.  most of the women went to ivy league schools, or at least seemed very upper class and snobby.  i can't imagine many people really relating if i couldn't.  also a story about a woman who had sex with her best friends boyfriend and struggles with the idea that that friendship ended...hmmmm, what a surprise! i can't think of anything more ridiculous and boring to read about.  get real.  that's what i say about the whole book
