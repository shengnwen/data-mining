Never could connect with the main character in this book.  She mostly seems cold and impersonal to me.  She's described as "nice" by other characters in the book, but she's mostly condescending and rude to them, as when she tells the postman to "bugger off" after he tells her "good morning".  Didn't feel any warmth or affection for her family either.  They are superficially drawn and seem to have little connection to each other.  The husband is uninvolved and disinterested in his family's life.  Mostly disagrees with wife on everything.  The village seems lackluster and full of unhappy, discontented people.  Nothing charming or engaging about it to make one feel that it's "cosy".  Bleak and dreary is more like it.  Not much to the story line either.  I figured out the basic plot early on and I am usually the last to know what's going on.  Don't recomend this book at all
