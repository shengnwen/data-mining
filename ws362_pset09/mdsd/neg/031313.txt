The Evolutionists is an endlessly repetitive, poorly organized book, replete with spelling and grammatical errors.  Worse, it is an uninspired introduction to a fascinating and important topic.  Morris appears to have expended as little effort as possible researching this book, and evinces only a facile understanding of the issues he engages.  The Evolutionsists reads like a third-rate middle school book report.  It's about 5 pages of content morphed into 200+ pages of text (how many times can Morris report exactly the same findings about stickleback fish?  I lost count...).  Though not popular science writing at its worst (Morris at least comes across as a neutral reporter, and his facts are generally correct), the Evolutionists is popular science writing at its most mediocre.  What a disappointment.  Are Morris' other books this lame?
