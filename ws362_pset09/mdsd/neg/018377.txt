It is true that the authoress quotes much from some primary sources, however the book is basically an expression of her political/social opinions and is not a history.  Her liberal biases, ardent feminism, lack of respect for Christian values, and her very limited understand of Southern culture and history, are overwhelmingly expressed.  If you are an historian who was taught to evaluate primary sources without your personal biases, and if you are interested in a true history that reflects these values, you'll be sadly disappointed with this book
