This refers to the 2nd edition, 6th printing.

I had the 2nd edition, 3rd printing of this book from our library and was quite happy with it -- see the other reviews about the quality of the content.

So I decided to buy it... however what I received was the 2nd edition, 6th printing, for which the term "printing" is not quite appropriate. It looks like if you had run the 3rd printing through a scanner and then printed it using your favourite bubble jet printer. What was gray in the 3rd printing appears as black, there are stripes in black areas, and thin lines in the drawings tend to disappear. Moreover, all the text characters have black speckles around it and white speckles inside the characters. This is not only at some pages, but throughout the entire book.

So if you intend to buy it, have a look at the figure on page 1, and judge for yourself if you are happy with the printing
