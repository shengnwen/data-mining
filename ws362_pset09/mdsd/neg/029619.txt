I was amazed by this book because of its lack of actual information that related to drawing storyboards! There are many chapters telling you how to dress for your interview and pages dedicated to checking you attitude for  working in the industry. Subjects of various aspects of the fields inner  workings. Sadly the number of pages used to teach storyboard techniques  from methods of describing camera tracks and pans and all the other  essential descriptions are bascially nonexistent. There may have been 2  pages in which the author attempted to poorly describe a pan or zoom in. I  was very angry and confused that the title had been so misleading, if this  book is used in classes as I have read in other posts, then that is the  class to avoid! Mark Simon is a very poor artist also and relys often on  other storyboards to illustrate the few examples in this silly waste of  paper. Among them Alex Savik, who was once a artist for Marvel comics. I  had often wonder where he had gone to? Aside from that, there was nothing  of value within these pages that could not be gotten from viewing better  artists boards. This seems to be an attempt by an artist that doesnt make  money doing boards to bring in extra cash without giving out any additional  information on storyboarding so as to not enable any others to take work  from him, if he should get so lucky. This is not a scathing review merely  obvious
