I purchased this book because I like deviant art, but this one goes beyond deviant..it's just crazed and illogical.  I'd like to state for the record that I have personally killed and helped gut hundreds of chickens.  When you are hungry and dealing with the processing of a winter food supply, sentimentality is a luxury you can ill afford.  I did not believe then nor do I believe now that chicken killers are "Nazis" perpetuating a holocaust.  Sue Coe exaggerates the grim reality of farm animal slaughter, taking it to grotesque extremes.  By attributing human-like emotions to the animals, she tries to get her audience to identify with the victims and respond with pity.  Her portrayal is more melodramatic than accurate.  In fact Sue Coe, like many animal activists, exhibits an almost unhealthy obsession with pain, death, blood, and torture.  The animal rights purity trip allows these gothic animal rights types to guiltlessly wallow in their perversions in the name of a "good" cause.  I don't have any problems with kinky art per se but Sue Coe just goes over the top with her sanctimonious go-veg shock tactics.  While some of the drawings are strictly representational most of them seem self-indulgent and just plain nuts at times.  It's actually a valuable book for the non-believer trying to  understand the animal rights mentality, that's why I am giving it two stars. Perhaps Sue Coe reveals more of that mentality than she really intended. If I was a parent who found this book in a pre teen's room, I'd be seriously concerned.  Sue Coe is definitely not for everyone
