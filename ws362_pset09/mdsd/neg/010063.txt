My mother always loved Danielle Steel and she collected as many of her books as she could find throughout her life.  She died several years ago and I still have a lot of her stuff.  I really like to read and I came across the box of her Danielle Steel books.  I've read a few books out of the box over the past few months and Passion's Promise was the latest.  I was very disappointed.  I really enjoyed the other books I've read so far but I didn't like this one very much.  I don't think Danielle Steel spent much time brainstorming and planning the book.  She spends a good length introducing Kezia.  Then she spends another good length of time talking about Kezia and her love affair with Luke.  Then you're almost done with the book and the end is shoved into like 20 pages.  I was not satisfied with the ending.  It seemed like she spent all this time setting up the rhythm of the book and then suddenly stopping it at the end
