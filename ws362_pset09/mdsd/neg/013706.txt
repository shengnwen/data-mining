Peter Falk's book was nothing but a few stories.  He only talks about a few Columbo episodes, He is so brief and uninteresting. Also , he talks about his buddies too much. Who cares about John Cassavetes!  He talks like he's some filmmaking genius.   If you want to read about Peter Falk and his life as an actor, it's sadly left out. He doesn't even talk about how he met his wives.  Sadly, a very dissappointing book.   Not recommended!
