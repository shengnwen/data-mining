If you've looked at this book and you think it's complete - you're right - it's completely wrong.  Many of the songs have incorrect tab and chord listings.  I have compared many of the songs in the book to how Harrison plays them in the Concert for Bangladesh and the chords are definitely wrong. If you're looking for George Harrison guitar tablature that is correct don't buy this one
