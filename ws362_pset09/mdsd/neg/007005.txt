I was unfortunate enough to receive this book as a "gift" from my mother (along with Where Does a Mother Go to Resign").  As a gay Christian (yes, a GAY Christian), I find Mrs. Johnson's writings decidedly disturbing and un-Christian.  The Bible does NOT clearly condemn gay people (if one researches historical and language origins of Biblical writings) and to base her reaction to her gay son on Christian beliefs is just wrong.  So yes, I think that makes this a bad book
