I found myself skimming through entire pages of this book trying to get at the meat of the matter. While the plot was interesting, I think it could have been better told as a short story. I found the novel to be unbelievable and the characters to be shallow. The writing style left a lot to be desired. I had four pages left to read in this book and had no problem putting it down for the night before finishing.
