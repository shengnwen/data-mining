John Fowles is a talented writer, and I think that if you end up buying this book, you will not be disappointed. It has some interesting points in  it. Many deep thoughts, some interesting chapters. But, the problem is that  I don't think that the story of &quot;Daniel Martin&quot; is a good one. It  is not fascinating, atleast it didn't raise my interest. At some point I  started to dislike this Daniel Martin.. He seemed boring and dull, just  like any stupid, chauvinistic, self-centered, egoistic middle-aged man you  can see. Maybe there is a point in describing a person like that, but  frankly: I am not very thrilled to read about a man like that, I think I've  met too many &quot;daniel martins&quot; in real life
