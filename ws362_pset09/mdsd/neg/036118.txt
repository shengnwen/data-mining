First, to any stray Zep fans, this book is nothing like the books you're used to reading about the band. The book is written by an associate professor of music, in hideous modern academic jargon. You know, the blocky, obfuscating style the professors deploy to make their subjects or themselves seem more profound than they really are. Examining a Jimmy Page solo note-by-note is of extremely limited interest to anyone but graduate musicology students-and has high music culture declined so much that they now have to fill their syllabi with Zeppelin's catalog? Sure, I'd rather listen to "Gallows Pole" than some atonal serialist composer, but this book is laying it on way too thick. Tedious and unrewarding
