I didn't want to believe it.  I wanted it to be the diet that finally works for me.  Foolishly I ignored the reviews here before I purchased it thinking the reviews were so much sour grapes.  I was dead wrong.  The only purpose of this book is to line the author's pockets so he can afford to live in the Hamptons.

Another reviewer mentioned that all of the postive reviews must be from employees or plants to trick us into buying the book.  That reviewer was right.  There are several positive reviews, but in my humble opinion they simply don't have a ring of truth about them.  

This book is worthless.  Dont' waste your money
