There are a few quite good letters here, but many of them appear to have been selected either because the writer was famous or the editor was just desperate to fill the book. Nearly all of them are from before WW2 and most are from before the 20th century. As a result, most of the letters have language that would seem very stilted if used today. But even old age doesn't excuse the writing that in some cases made me cringe
