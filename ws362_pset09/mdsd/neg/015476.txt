This book is more a prententious piece of art than educational material.  If it weren't for the bright colors and 'easy to rip' pages my toddler wouldn't have an interest in this book.  What does it teach children?  Nothing at all.  All the animals look the same to toddlers with nuances only an adult can distinguish.  The only reason this book won an award it appeals more to adults who are bored of the common formula found in most children's books.  There's a reason we keep finding the same formula in books- "if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
