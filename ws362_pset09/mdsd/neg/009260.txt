I bought this book and opened it thinking that it wil be the strong version of The Animator Survival Kit, then after just 5 minutes I realized that it was a serial loose of my money because it not worth the money I paid. It has nothing that helps you to animate , is just the story of some Disney old animated movies. And the rest of it is to read a full scale of bla, bla, bla, bla that don't help in anything. But if you are a collector of Disney old stories it will be ok, so before buy it just think if you wanna draw to animate or just collect a big & heavy book with a Disney name on it
