This was my first Patterson book, and while I may still try some of his other works, this one was not interesting or gripping in my opinion.  The character development was weak.  The novel is full of twists in the plot, and has a few good moments, but the people seem too simple to really grab my attention.  If you have not read this author before, I would try a different book first.  I have heard that some of his other books are quite different from the books in this series.
