In a land where the cops have to run away from gun toting street gangs because the so-called law won't let them do anything about the problem, how can you consider the government anything but extraordinarily liberal (read socialist)? 

If our nation's government today, or in the 1980s, had any hint of fascism in it, why does it, and why did it, encourage immigration from third world nations en masse? 

And, of course, one must wonder how a nation whose foreign policy is so often determined...err...influenced by the State of Israel can be anything like a fascist dictatorship. Surely AIPAC, not to mention the SPLC/ADL/ACLU, haven't allowed us to stray from their chosen (socialist) path?
