For a book about fashion and dressing, this book was laid out poorly.  Because there is an overload of text, it really needed to be better organized visually so that the user could quickly find sections of interest and grasp the main points.  I feel like I'm being forced to read a text book.  The editors should have looked at the InStyle 'how to dress' books and compare the difference.

I'm sure Duke knows a ton about fashion and have great information to share.  It's too bad the communication of it is blocked.
