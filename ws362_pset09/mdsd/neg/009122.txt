I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone as a first Kellerman's novel.
There are too many medical jargons and terms as if Kellerman is trying to show off his medical knowledge. There are just too many unnecessary references to either the rarer or more serious and feared disorders unrelated to the story and thus causing a lot of side tracking which to me is a pure waste of time reading and boring to readers especially those with medical knowledge. It took me a long long time to finish this novel and thought of discarding it numerous times even when I was more than half way through the novel! This is especially so after having read the very exciting Robert Crais's "Demolition Angel" followed by Lee Child's "One Shot". 
The story in this book are also full of loop holes and I cannot buy the idea of a Conspiracy Club using Jeremy to get to the killer and allowing more murders to take place while he was stressfully doing so.
However, I must admit that I did enjoy reading a couple of Kellerman's other novels "Murder Book" & "When the Bough Breaks" quite some time ago
