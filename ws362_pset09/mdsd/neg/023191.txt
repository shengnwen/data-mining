Pretty salty and hip but I kept having to look at my big map to figure out how to get to the places it was referring to.  If I have to comment on a major fault, it is with the directions.  It doesn't stand alone as the only guidebook to maneuver you through San Francisco streets.  Luckilyl I met many friendly locals who helped point me in the right direction.  It's a fine city and has a splendid old park to stroll
