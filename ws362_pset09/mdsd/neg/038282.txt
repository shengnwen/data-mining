There are many good things to say about Mr. McWhorter's book. Manty other reviewers have done that.  I want to add a warning.  Mr. McWhorter's book is about the theory of language dynamics.  It is not about any particular language, culture, people, place, or time.  Mr. McWhorter explains the processes that cause languages to change over time.  He does a remarkably good job of this.  However, he makes references to actual languages and actual statements only as they serve to illustrate changes over time.  If you are looking for some understanding of some particular language at some particular time, you will sadly agree with me that this book constantly changes the topic.  If there is a sustained discussion of one language for more than ten pages, then I cannot find it.  I must admit that I could not finish the book, after several tries.  The subtitle should be removed from the book.  This book is not a history of languages.  It is an excellent exposition for the general reader of the dynamic forces behind language change.  However, it contains nothing about any particular language
