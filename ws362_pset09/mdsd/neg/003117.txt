I was MISLEAD by the title of this listing, since there is no picture I thought it was an actual textbook, only softcover.  When it arrived it turns out to be a study guide to the textbook!?  I am a struggling college student and I lost $45 shipped on this one.  (you dont need the study guide unless you have money to burn and and dont know how to take notes in class;p) I had to buy the hardcover textbook of course, another hefty $120 at the time...good going amazon, next time put a picture, or dont offer it for sale
