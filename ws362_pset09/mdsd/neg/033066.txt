I LOVE Suzanne Brockmann's writing. If she were any other author, I'd give it 1 star. This one just didn't do it for me. I didn't like the heroine Jane (who seemed irritating & immature) and I didn't care about Cosmo (i guess the character development was lacking). I couldn't identify with the gay FBI agent and the intern chasing the in-the-closet actor storyline was a flat out bore. I read romance for escape - one of the last things I want to do is escape into a homosexual love story. I never finished her last book (an extremely disappointing read - the one abt the CIA agents). I don't know if i'm going to finish this one. I certainly hope Max & Gina's story doesn't follow this pattern of poorly developed characters.
