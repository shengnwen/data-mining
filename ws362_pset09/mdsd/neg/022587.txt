Though I buy tons of books, I'm never one to write reviews.  But this is so bad, I felt it was my duty to.  I am insanely disappointed with this book. I read it cover to cover and there is not one new idea in here.  Half of it seems stolen from a website I frequent of a woman who has lost 130 pounds.  I wish I would have saved my $.  Oh, and the food is totally bland.  Ick!
