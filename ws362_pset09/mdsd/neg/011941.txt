I don't think I've ever written a negative review on Amazon before, and I'm sorry to feel compelled to do so.  But this book got in under my radar with the droll concept and amusing cover.  I feel as if someone who looked like they might become a new friend slapped me in the face, not once but repeatedly.  I avoid books that signal early on that they will be full of fat jokes or dripping with contempt for fat people.  As an author, I think that's the laziest sort of humor--like currying favor with prejudiced people by telling racist or sexist jokes.  Let those who find that funny subsidize such humor.  This book waited till p. 14 or so of what had been an amusing story, and by p. 47  I was offended enough not to want to read the rest.  Life is short.  There are many books. I don't have to read books that insult fat women.  I won't totally avoid other books by this author, but I will examine them carefully before buying
