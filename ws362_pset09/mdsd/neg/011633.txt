The credibility of this book has now been destroyed- see "Margaret Mead and Somoa" by Derek Freeman for proof- most serious academics now see this book as an emberassment, a bad joke perpetrated by an eager to please twenty three year old neophyte in the grip of ambition and groupthink.  A heady mixture indeed Ms. Mead.... The noble savage you say?  The malleability and innate goodness of human nature you say?  History now points an unwavering finger and pronounces you a liar.  What a shameful legacy.
