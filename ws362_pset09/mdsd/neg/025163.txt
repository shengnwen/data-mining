I've read (and enjoyed) all of Shermans previous books. This one plain stank. Horribly. Painfully. 

Bought as light reading while sitting in my hotel room, it went into the garbage can very quickly, pretty much unread.

Summation: Not worth reading even when suffering from terminal boredom. Even watching "Jerry Springer" on the TV isn't as painful or nauseating as this book
