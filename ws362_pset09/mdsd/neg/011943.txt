I think not!  As someone who has reached that stage of life where I find ritual a very valuable and reassuring aspect of life, I was completely disapointed by this book.  It should be called &quot;Burn a Candle and  Smell Something.&quot;  Her only approach to rituals are things that the  normal populace would find just a tad suspect.  I don't need to  ritualistically burn mementos to special music by the light of a specific  colored candle while inhaling sandlewood, etc.  Genuine ritual has great  value - this just trivializes life transitions
