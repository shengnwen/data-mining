With a dragon on the front cover I thought this would be heavily into medieval fantasy, Dragonlance-style book covers, and game art. There is but ONE artist in the whole book who is a medieval fantasy artist (dragons, elves, etc.). The rest are rather hard to describe. Some just seemed to push the limits of what we will put into the so-called fantasy genre (perhaps because it won't fit in any other genre?). 

Don't get me wrong...I appreciate the effort these artists go through to produce their artwork, but unless you have a very non-discriminate art appreciation it's just not for everyone. Just be forewarned that the artists covered in this book belong to a vast array of genres, and while all may be talented in their chosen medium, you will have to be VERY open minded to appreciate all of it. 

Even as an aspiring fantasy artist myself I found this book to offer little in the ways of inspiration. For some of the artists it doesn't even say where the works were used or displayed, or how the artist otherwise became well known. 

If you are buying this book because you are a medieval or sci-fi fantasy/game art enthusiast, you will be sorely disappointed. Don't judge a book by its cover (I wish Amazon.com had a "search inside" option for this book!).
