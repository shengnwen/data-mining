Goldman's ranting and raving will soon get onto your nerves, especially  since he frequently shows himself to be a hypocrite. In several places he  speaks of his dislike for special effect-filled blockbusters, then in other  places he says how he loved movies like &quot;Independence Day&quot;. It  also seems odd how Goldman hasn't written a solid screenplay for some time  now, and has written a number of scripts for those blockbuster movies, yet  he whines about the &quot;junk&quot; screenplays Hollywood uses. (By the  way, he's writing the screenplay for &quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot; - even  though he voices slams against Spielberg here!) Everything to him seems to  be Hollywood's fault, though he never mentions how even before &quot;Star  Wars&quot;, audiences were starting to stay away from movies like  &quot;McCabe And Mrs. Miller&quot;. He certainly never mentions how many  independent films come out each year that critics love, but the audience  doesn't go to. In short, the audience decides what movies get made. If  Goldman is reading this, I dare him to answer these charges. But he  probably won't - his next book will probably be more whines yet again about  how the final votes in the Academy Awards should be revealed, how movies  are &quot;worse than ever&quot;, yadayadayada. Goldman, put up or shut up -  not only for these charges, but the screenplays you write
