I was surprised to find 4 pleasant reviews about "Madeline Says Merci" because contrary to what everyone else has written about this being a delightful book, my daughter (5) and I found it to be dull and boorish.  

The principal reason for our disappointment was the absence of a plot.  Instead of a story there were discussions on the following topics:  

"Hello"
"Please and Thank You"
"Kindness and Consideration"
"Sorry"
"Good Night", 

Now books can be an excellent way to reinforce lessons taught at home, but usually they succeed best if they are entertaining.  In this case, one might just as well have read from Miss Manners.   

So my suggestion would be that if you are looking for a first Madeline book, chose another one and don't try to combine a `lesson' with an introduction to a series.  Find a book that is fun first and later come back to this one.

"Now that you have what you desired, 
The words thank you are what's required.  
"You're welcome" is the thing to say
After thanks have come your way
