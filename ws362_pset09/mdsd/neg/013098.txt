The first thing I noticed about this book is that on the first page there
was a drawing of a bird-headed Egyptian diety, and the masonic symbol.  Since
I see free masonry as conflicting with Scriptures, I suspected the book was
not the Scripturally based book I'd hope it was when I ordered it.  Within
just a few pages the author started giving her belief that there was a pre-Adamic
race of subhuman beings and that they were black.  I did not find her
Bible verse back up, nor her archaeological back up, for such beliefs to
be justifiable.  But if you like believing that because your skin has
less pigment in it than others, that you are therefore a superior being,
you will probably enjoy this book very  much
