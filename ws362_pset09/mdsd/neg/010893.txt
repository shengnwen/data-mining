This book is sort of a "how to see creatively" kind of book.  It has decent photos and gives a nice theory behind seeing pictures.  My main two problems with the book are the following:

1) Despite basically trying to teach composition, no compositional art terms are ever mentioned (ie, rule of thirds, etc).

2) None of the photograph captions (besides a handful in one of the chapters about shutter speed) show any sort of shot information like shuter/aperture, and only some show focal length.

This book is not designed to be a technical book, so if you need to learn how to use the camera or learn about lenses, depth of field, or what aperture/shutter settings to use for a given composition, you won't find it here.  On the other hand if you'd just like a book with decent nature photographs, and what is essentially a pep-talk throughout the text, this one will fit that bill.  It is essentially a beginner's introduction to nature photography composition, I believe.

There is another book on amazon that I also owned called "Learning to See Creatively", and though it did not deal strictly with nature photography, it seemed to be a bit more experimental and pushed you to actually be more creative in your compositions.  It also has all the lens/aperture/shutter setting information in the caption for every photograph.
