After reading reviews I had imagiend this book to be a master piece.  After received I was simply not impressed.  Many of the photo's focal point was illy placed in the binding.  A lot of photos were blown up to the point of distortion.  None were that breath-taking.  You'd be better off buying a book with photos by Oliver Tollmi
