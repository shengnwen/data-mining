Was very disappointed with this book.  Not only did it cover only the most touristy places, but it left out many more interesting, not as common, sites.  The real tip off is that he lists places that "guarantee the price listed here if you show them your copy of this book" or offer a "10% discount" with this book.  That isn't really objective reporting in my opinion
