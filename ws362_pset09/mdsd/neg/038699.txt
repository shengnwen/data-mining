This was my first and last Joe Weber book. The story was predictable and the characterizations were not compelling. It's not that Weber is a bad writer, it's just there are others who are so much better. I would rather read a bad book by a good writer than a good book by a bad writer. I love Clancy type books but this fell way short. He gets 2 stars for effort
