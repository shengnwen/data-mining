Quite frankly, this was just not my type of book.  I definitely feel compassion for Bauby.  I think it is absolutely amazing he was able to dictate a book in this condition.  I am not familiar with "locked in syndrome" and I admire Bauby for his determination under these dire circumstances.  However, I am not a big fan of a book where the focus is more on metaphors and writing style.  I think it takes away from the emotion that can be projected to the reader.  It is a possibility Bauby hid behind the words and phrases and I do not blame him for this.  This book just wasn't able to leave that big of an impression on me.  I feel bad about that but not guilty.
