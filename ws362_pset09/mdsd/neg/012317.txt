Burglar on the Prowl" starts off strong, but loses steam about 2/3 of the way through. Block recycles the "suspects all in the same room" ending from one of the early novels in this series and the the book finishes on a less than satisfying note.

The "Burglar" books have always relied on loose plotting that strains credibility and oddball characters. The smartass humor is there, along with the eccentric oddly named characters, but the result seems labored and seems to recycle elements from past books (names, plot devices); there are even footnoted entries that direct you to other books in the series that explain why he has a Mondrian, etc.

I'd hoped that the long drought since the last "Burglar" book was a good sign, particularly because Block seems to have revived the Scudder series after a series of clinkers. May be the next one will be better.......
