I loved &quot;The List of 7&quot;, but this book pales next to it, and is a disappointment.  The characters and story are good. But Sparks' fall from grace and the things he does during it are disappointing and I think unnecessary to the story.  It takes away from his lustre as being the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.  This is not a book I will read again
