Not that I haven't enjoyed the puzzle book - but shouldn't the game guide not make the game even more complicated?  I've gone half blind trying to figure out the maps.  Certainly my favorite is when the master map is wrong, the thumbnail picture is wrong, and the tiny map in the thumbnail picture is wrong.  I feel collecting the horseshoes and photo ops is one of my greatest achievements as the guide is actively plotting against me.  Even the mission guides are of little use, as all they do is tell you what the game already told you, "go upstairs", sweet.  I remember the GTA III guide used to tip you off to the occasional short-cut or some such.  This one both sucks and blows.  I want my $14 back.
