I bought this book just after buying Poser 6.  I am a new user of Poser, and I still found it quite useless.  This book is just a rehash of almost exactly what is in the reference manual that comes with the software.  In fact I think there are sections where some of the information is practically "verbatim" from the reference manual. That said, it actually covers the material from the reference manual in "less" detail rather than more. :(

This book is largely a waste of money, it's only redeeming qualities are a few "somewhat" useful sidebars that have some specific instructions to 'test' certain functionality out.  This is not enough to justify the cost of this book in my mind.

I'm very disappointed, and very surprised there are such "glowing" reviews for this book.  I expect these glowing reviews are from people who either: expect way too little, are friends of the author or publishers, are the author or publishers themselves, or are people who are completely uninformed of what a good book is.

The only reason to purchase this book is if you don't have a copy of the reference manual because you downloaded the software or bought it second hand.

P.S. This is the first review I've ever posted on Amazon.com.  Typically I don't post my opinion anywhere but I was so disappointed with this book I felt it necessary to inform people so they hopefully don't make the same mistake I did in purchasing it
