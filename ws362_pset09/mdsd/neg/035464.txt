Yes, OK, Montessori is a great way for children to learn with play. Yes, many children can benefit greatly from this method. Yes, this book explictly lays out guidlines for this method, and includes lots of activities for preschoolers to do.  BUT, even as a stay-at-home mom, I cannot imagine doing more than two or three of these activities at home.  WAY too complex and involved. If you are a teacher, this book is for you. If you are a mom looking for educational activities to do with your children, look elsewhere.  I was very excited about recieving this book, but it just didn't cut it for me. I don't have a sand table at home, and I don't have time to read this whole book (which is surprisingly substantial). Can't I just do flash cards or some fun crafts instead
