When I got this book and paged through it, I was delighted with the baby blankets and I've decided to knit several of them. I was also excited because I love the "Yarn Shop" series.  Debbie Macomber captures the spirit of a Local Yarn Shop beautifully. 

So was I bitterly disappointed when I looked up the recommended yarns for the project.  These are yarns that are available in large chain stores, not in local yarn shops. I can appreciate that people  are interested in knitting affordably, but there could at least be a mix of yarns.  Much of what I loved about the original books is the knitting community that takes place in a local yarn shop.  Having ALL of the recommended yarns in the pattern books come from chain stores betrays the premise of the stories.  The stories could not have taken place anywhere else, yet the companion books send you to buy yarn from the very stores that are driving small shops out of business
