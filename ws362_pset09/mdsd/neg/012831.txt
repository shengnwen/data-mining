Larsen's treatment of spirituality is severely lacking.  In fact, to put "spirituality" in the title of this book is extremely misleading.  The text is simply a concise treatment of basic systematic theology written at about an undergraduate level.  The only thing Larsen includes that might possibly justify the title is a small section at the end of each chapter that asks questions about how the principles he lays out are applicable to life, but that's a far cry from what he set out to his readers.  

Now, I suppose if you're looking for a very simple, basic text on Christian systematic theology, this would do the job fairly well, but to state that it is directly related to Christian spirituality is simply false.  For a theological treatment of spirituality, a much better text is Simon Chan's Spiritual Theology
