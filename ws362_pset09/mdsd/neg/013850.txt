I've only been in a dendrology course two weeks to know this book has far too many errors to be taken seriously.  My largest complaint is the writing of the scientific names.  NEVER do you capitalize the first letter of the species name!  The author/ editors were entirely inconsistant about doing so.  While they would capitalize species derived from names (eg. Pinus banksiana), they did not capitalize those from states and "americana" (even though the normal English guide they were following would have made them do so). This error occured 17 times in the guide, highly disappointing for a publication.  Obviously, they knew general guidelines, but they need to better understand the science behind taxonomy.  Teaching people to write names wrong is not a way of expanding knowledge.  Also, when writing the common name, NOTHING is capitalized unless it is a name for a PLACE: on page 4, American Elm and REALLY American elm (they avoided this by carefully capitlizing EVERYTHING later in the finder), and just for further information, jack pine is written like that, all lower case because "jack" is not a place.  I'm sure there are more errors, I just haven't gotten that far.  Anyways, I'm sure it's a cute little book to bring on camping trips, but it does little good in real science, missing key facts that distinguish one species from another..... as well as family names (a NECESSARY component of understanding linking relationships!).  If you want to spend the 3.50 on it, go ahead, but be sure not to think of this as a "book," it's only a general, non-scientific, uninformative key for distinguishing common trees in North America
