Although I do enjoy many of Charles Warren Eaton's landscapes, I found this book to contain alot of black and white reproductions of artwork and alot of text to fluff it up. The cover enticed me to purchase this book, a wonderful painting with vivid color and bold brushwork. But the interior color plates are not nearly as exciting, and too few in number
