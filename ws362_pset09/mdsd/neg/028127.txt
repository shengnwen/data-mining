"Tribulation Force" picks up where "Left Behind" ended, and like that book, this one's slow. After the first one, I thought maybe things would start to happen in this one, but they don't. There are a few plot elements that are connected with endless filler. And none of the things that do happen in are completely devoid of suspense. There's one major event that we're told after the fact via a TV newscast. You might think that a book about the end of days would be interesting, but these authors obviously don't know how to write a thriller. It's just endless soap opera. This book and "Left Behind" should have been one volume. If all the books are the same pace, the whole series should have been a trilogy, but of course, then they would make less money. 

Don't waste your time on it and don't encourage these talentless hacks by buying their books
