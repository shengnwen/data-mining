This book is well researched, but draws some very silly assumptions,  beginning with the almost Freudian obsession with her being placed with a wet nurse.  There are some very good insights but most of the commentary (which is not always easy to differentiate from the fact) is unnecessary (and questionable) opinion.  My biggest complaints are these:  (1) the book should be entitled Eliza de Feuillide: A life, as JA is sometimes a minor character or not mentioned at all for pages at a time. Eliza is interesting, but not what I bought the book for.   (2) Her mentions of Fanny Price are all very politically correct for the late 20th century but I doubt they have anything at all to do with the way JA saw her.  She says she is &quot;intolerant of sinners, whom she is ready to cast aside, just as Mr. Collins recommends that the Bennets should cast aside the sinful Lydia and Wickham. Austen, the novelist, was interested in the way religion could be invoked in different causes and practiced in different styles...&quot;  This entire statement IMHO makes no sense.  Mr. Collins did recommend that the Wickhams be &quot;cast aside&quot; and is roundly mocked for his intolerance by Austen.  FP on the other hand is not casting aside a sinner, she is chosing not to ally herself in the most intimate way with one whom she has no reason to trust.  That is not intolerance.  That is prudence. If the author looked more objectively at the issues, I think she would see a huge difference.    I believe that the last sentence in the above quote should read &quot;Tomalin, the novelist, is interested in the way religion could be invoked in different causes and practiced in different styles...&quot
