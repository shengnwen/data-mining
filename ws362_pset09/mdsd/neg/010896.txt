I'm a very spiritual person and I was expecting this CD to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the CD is rather boring and not very inspirational.  I'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it.  Fortunately I have a Christian radio station that does a lot more for me.
