How absolutely assinine this book could get at times is beyond me....to quote the Bible like some fundamentalist zealot, claiming GOD made/caused a better deal on an Oldsmobile rather than a PT Cruiser is childish drivel and not worthy of publication.  If fundamentalists would spend MORE time helping out fellow mankind than attributing serendipitous coincidences of daily life to some mystical "God" intervention, the world would be a better place to live.  Save your money---go put your religion to work and volunteer to help feed the homeless or a family in need and give them the money you'd have spent on this book.  Sheesh! How embarrassing for women in general
