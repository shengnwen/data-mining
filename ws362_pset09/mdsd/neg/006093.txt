I didn't like this trilogy. I have to confess i bought it after watching the movie based on the first book.In my opinion this is one of the very few cases when the movie is better than the book. the story is just not as intense as it is in the movie, Tom's fascination with Dickie is more implicit in the book. Maybe because of the time it was written? In the book Tom dislikes "queers", in the movie he seems to be one of them.
About the second and third books... Tom helping this pseu-do english painter who feels guilty about forging the works of a long time dead artist... why does he get involved in the first place? He has a beautiful house in France, he is married to a rich blonde Frenchwoman, why risk it all again? I guess he just has a passion for complicated lives...And later he gets involved in the German mafia, corrupting a cancer patient. The last book is way over the top, specially all the shooting in the last chapters... I guess you have to be a crime fiction fanatic to appreciate Patricia Highsmith's unrealistic plots..
