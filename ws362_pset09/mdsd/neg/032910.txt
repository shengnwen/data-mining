This started off really well.  Then it took some very fast twists and turns that left me wondering if I wasn't reading a book that was missing some chapters.  This was an interesting idea for a story, but eventually you begin to consider Svir and Cor as the protagonists and Tatja is just an annoyance.  By the end, you are depressed because the characters you've come to care about most (including Anchu) have been killed off and Tatja's future is - well - Grimm.

Too disjointed and too depressing for me.  I only give it two stars.  My favorite Vernor Vinge book so far is A Fire Upon The Deep
