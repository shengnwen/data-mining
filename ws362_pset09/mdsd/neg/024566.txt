I"m easy on fiction books. I don't care if plots are similar, or charactors underdeveloped or whatever. I am not a professional to critisize that kind of stuff. As long as it's fun to read, has some action, and not too unreal, I"m ok. But this book, which I actually finished, was the worse I have ever read. I liked when the wind blows and when I saw this on sale, I quickly grabbed it. (No wonder it was on sale!) The plot and writing was just so lame. (What was the plot anyway?) There was absolutely nothing interesting or exciting and the main idea was just so stupid. I am not a real Patterson fan but from what I read (When the wind blows, Jack & Jill, Along came a spider, Cat & Mouse) they were all good reads. This was urrr......... Not recommended.
