This book is deeply disrespectful of SF readers.  Even if you can overlook the clumsy moralizing, the clichéd characters, the myopic focus on a single region of the earth and the thoroughly human aliens, the book only tells half of a story.   The book simply ends halfway through the story (practically in mid-sentence: if your plot invoves a countdown and the countdown is only half finished at the end of the book, then it's only half of a book) and you have to resort to the sequel to find out what happens to most of the characters.  There is no indication on the book anywhere that it is only half of a story.

So, it wasn't enough for Dietz and Ace to disrespect us with a lousy piece of work.  They had to go that one further and only give us HALF of a lousy piece of work.  Note: I'm not against books with sequels or even books that are part of a series.  I just feel tricked when a book is part of a series and I didn't know it going in.  To find out that I HAVE to buy the sequel to finish the story is more than disappointing, it's dishonest.  I was tricked into buying half of a story.

An author who will trick me once will trick me twice, so I'm not planning to buy any more of Mr Dietz's work at all.

I bought this book in a bookstore where there were no reviews to look at when making my choice.  It's that last time I'll make THAT mistake..
