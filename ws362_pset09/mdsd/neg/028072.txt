I might have liked this book a little better if it wasn't almost a complete rip-off of Elseworlds: The Golden Age series.  Golden age heroes fighting WWII, a Nazi "Superman"... The Golden Age has done this all before, but much better.

The art might have saved it, if only I could tell who was who.  There faces all seamed the same, and when they are in plain clothes there is not much else to determine one from the next.

Plus, The Golden Age was much more emotionally involving than Liberty Files.  You give more of a damn about them when you see their growth and torment.

The two stars may be a bit harsh, but I'm always disappointed when I see characters with so much potential being redrawn into a bland version of a previously good comic.  Check out The Golden Age
