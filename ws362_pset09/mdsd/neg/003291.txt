I bought this as I am a Seattle resident (also 20s/30s female like the main character).  I thought it would be cool to find a book that combined the story of a woman's growth and a setting in Seattle.  

Unfortunately, it's not a strong story.  The main character is shallow and self-absorbed, and the other characters aren't compelling- and this doesn't change over the course of the story.  The story revolves around the character's relationships to men and a couple of female characters (mainly her mother and her best friend)- not compelling alternative Seattle characters.  I really don't feel that this is a compelling story of human growth or broadening horizons
