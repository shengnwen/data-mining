Though it is chocked full of supposedly crystal clear evidence of Opus Dei's evil ways, most of the research is plainly outdated and mostly irrelevant. I tried desperately to read this book with an open mind. Yet Walsh's tone becomes shrill bordering on the infantile with certain phrasing, particularly at the end of the book, not at all hiding his deeply personal hatred for Opus Dei. For a man who left the priesthood, it's hardly surprising that he would have an intellectual problem with celibacy amongst lay men and women. A Catholic group getting political when the Jesuit priest Fr. Drinan spent several terms in Congress? I can't help but find astonishing that a man who used to give out the sacraments to the Faithful could examine another Catholic group through such narrow lenses of supposed "left" and "right" and could leave almost no material in his "investigation" to the actual spiritual content of his subject.
