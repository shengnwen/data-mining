I found this book interesting, just as I found 'Sarah' an interesting read. I read them before all this came out or before I knew any of the fictional background of the "JT Leory" and I'm glad. Because I read it simply as a story, violent and shocking, but a story.

The main thing is this (because I don't want to get drawn into an argument): this is all about people's wounded feelings than the facts, as Laura Albert hasn't given them out. 

There are novels written about child abuse. We accept them though. It is a part of the real world that an author may write about it, just as they can write about sex, drug addiction, cults, divorce, politics, religion, and death. Is the reason everyone is saying Laura Albert can't write about it is because we KNOW that's fiction when so many people hoped it was autobiography? It is not sick to write about it, when you consider so many other books are not condemned for writing about such topics.  To say what you cannot write about is censorship. I'm not putting it on the same level but 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' was initally banned because it wrote about sex, but it's a normal healthy part of adult life. Now we laugh about the ban. At the end of the day, a writer is a recorder, an observer. It has to be accepted that if things exist then they are part of our consciousness and a writer may write about them. 

Fiction is about the realms of possibility and being able to write about what has happened, does happen and could happen. That is it. And that is everything
