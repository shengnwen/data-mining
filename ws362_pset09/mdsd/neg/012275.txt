The writer of this book has found the real threat to gays and lesbians:  radical Islam.

Really, what have Right Wing Christians ever done?  Nothing.  The NEA has more political power than Christians.

The Muslim aim is to take over the world and exterminate "infidels".  That's us.  That all of us.  The Christian right wing can't even stop graphic sex education at their local schools.  They are not a threat.  Heck, Christians are not a serious worry.  They are not a worry.

Do not buy this book.  It's obsolete.  The author, Bruce Bawer, says it's obsolete.  We can't ignore Islam.  Why?  All GLBT people will be eliminated by Islam.  That is a face.

Read Bruce Bawer's book "While Europe Slept."  We may actually want to be friends with Christians.  Why?  Islam means to destroy us all!

All good feminists should be worried.
