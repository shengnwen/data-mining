The author uses only English-language sources, ignoring the many important primary documents that have not been translated from Spanish (and Nahuatl) into English. More seriously, he ignores most of the scholarly literature on Motecuhzoma, Cortes and the conquest of the Aztecs. This lead to a big mistake that undermines much of his discussion of Motecuhzoma: Recent scholarship shows that the notion that Motecuhzoma and other Aztecs believed Cortes to be the returning god Quetzalcoatl was a post-conquest fabrication. This changes our understanding of the Aztec emperor and his interaction with Cortes.
