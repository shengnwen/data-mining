Soros is perhaps history's greatest manipulator of markets. His actual quantitative analysis does not stand up to any rigorous testing, nor have his trading techniques withstood anomalous shocks or the simple resistance of pure market forces. 

Most, if not all of Soros' great trading coups seem to come from carefully constructed manipulations or runs on markets. Often, his genius has been the interpretation of the desires or intentions of major regulators (Treasury Secretary, Fed Chairman, other central bankers). One suspects this has not been accomplished without cooperation among fund managers and the regulators themselves.

Soros' political and financial pronouncements and policies all seem geared towards generating profits -- he is highly skilled at talking his positions. Lately, though, his dollar short, along with Buffet and others, has been a disaster, suggesting that, absent the unethical cooperation of a Robert Rubin, Soros' crystal ball begins to cloud over. Perhaps that was why he was so anxious to see a Democrat back in office.

His last book, "The Bubble of American Supremacy" was barely literate. He should stick to currency manipultions with his friends around the world, and leave politics and psychiatry to the pros. His theory of "reflexivity" is nothing more than the explanation of markets as subject to mass psychology -- work that others have done better, but perhaps not applied so larcenously.

It is enough to grind billions out of the markets through questionable methods. Why does Mr. Soros feel compelled to be accepted as a genius or some sort of genuine philantropist? His greed seems unlimited in every field.
