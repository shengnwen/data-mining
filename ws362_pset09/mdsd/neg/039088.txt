If you want a historical perspective on the H2O2 studies conducted during the past century, this is the book.  I should have saved my money.  I recommend "Flood Your Body With Oxygen: Therapy For Our Poluted World" by Ed McCabe.  McCabe explains it so that the information is understandable and usefull.
