This book is not at all what it seems.  The Mapmaker's wife, Isabel, whom the story is supposed to be about, does not really enter the plot until page 200.  If you like math and the history of how the world's shape was calculated, this journal-like book is for you.  If you are looking for a story and character development, make sure to pass this one up.
