This text was a required reading for a college course I took, and it basically summarizes why college isn't taken as seriously as it once was.  This purely indulgent, pretentious work ruins any chance of an actual point  with jumbled phrases such as &quot;...neither an autonomous activity nor an  automatic indicator of the economic infrastructure...&quot;  Personally,  this is thoroughly unreadable and unenjoyable; it was much more of a chore  to get through than it was worth.  Attali needs to quit with the literary  masturbation and realize that while having a large vocabulary is admirable,  he should perhaps learn to &quot;eschew obfuscation&quot;, pun fully  intended
