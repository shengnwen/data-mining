OK, I know that Dale Brown is not Tom Clancy, but I have all his books and for the most part they aren't too bad.  Most of them are pretty exciting techno-thrillers that get started really fast and keep going.  This thing is the worst piece of tripe I have ever read!  There is a plot, but the author tries to stretch a 25 page short story into 400 pages of boring, repetitive dialog.  The first 200 pages alone consist of the characters mainly struggling arguing with each one another on how to run a special terrorist ops group.  At any rate, if this is the new direction for Dale Brown books, I will be looking for a new author because this book is not worth the time to read it
