I read this book as a selection for my book club.  After all the fan fair, this book was a complete disappointment -- and let me tell you, we've read some bad books in the past.  This one takes the cake.  I can get past the fictional aspect of the book; however, the supposed "great writing" is just not there.  I found this book to be very superficial, although the story line had great promise. A considerable struggle to get through and little if any flow to the writing
