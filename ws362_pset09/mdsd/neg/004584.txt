While I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, the second was pure agony. I actually started to skim through most of the pages until I reached the end.  It is dense with detail; almost too dense. For instance, Finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire. His descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages, but by page 10 of the fire, I was completely and totally bored. Now, I'm not saying fiction should always be a "quick, easy read". Quite the contrary. I found Finney's writing to be refreshing. But c'mon folks, this book should have been 100-150 pages shorter. (Strictly for over-the-top romance lovers).
