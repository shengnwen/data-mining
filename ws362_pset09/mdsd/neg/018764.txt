The most interesting thing about this book is that the author feels no pressure to legitimize his assertion that there is something special about 30 seconds. Because his background is in the field of television entertainment, (never to be confused with communications), he finds significance in the length of television commercials, which frequently run 30 seconds. That this is done for financial reasons, not attention-span reasons, has evaded him completely. HTGYPAI3SOL is just another in the endless chain of How To books penned by individuals struggling with delusions of expertise, whose only skill is self-promotion, that package the obvious and resell it to the gullible. Readers who find anything in this slim and overpriced tome even remotely surprising or counter-intuitive are advised to probe deeper into the self-help section of the bookstore for volumes on Shoe-Tying For Beginners, The ABCs Of Writing Your Name, and Gravity - It's Not Just A Good Idea, It's The Law.
