I LOVED this book!  I think my designs are so much better now that I know when to open and close the windows at the right time!  I was always so confused before.  I can also make sure that I get good air flow by drawing those great ribbon arrows. This book is perfect for anyone who has never looked at the sky or felt the wind before or chooses to ignore their own senses!  I think Brown could of done this without DeKay though.
