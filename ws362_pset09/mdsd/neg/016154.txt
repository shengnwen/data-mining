This was the cheapest phrase book that I saw offered on Amazon.com and, as trite as it is, you get what you pay for.  If you are looking for the most basic of interactions with Italian speakers and are only planning on staying in tourist hotels and shopping in tourist markets, then this might suffice.  However, if you are planning to interact with native Italian speakers in a less superficial way, or if you want to be able to express yourself with somewhat more sophistication, I would recommend another phrase book.
