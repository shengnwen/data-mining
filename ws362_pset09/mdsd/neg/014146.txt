  This book is a good attempt by the author to delve into the religion of Islam, and explain some of its religious belief systems.

  Unfortunatly, I found the book based on the authors opinions and not much on facts.  He uses many examples which only further point to human flaws, rather then religious.

  I'd recommend something by Karen Armstrong over this book
