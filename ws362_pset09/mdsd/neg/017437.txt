This book is pretty near worthless. I started reading it knowing that I was unlikely to agree with much of Vicki's "advice," but I thought it still might be funny. It wasn't. Also, lots of her advice is not only wrong it is *completely* wrong--as in, not only not backed up by evidence, but actually *contraindicated* by evidence. I could not even finish reading the book after I got to the complete drivel that was her "advice" on infant feeding--she presented the section as "common considerations when deciding to breastfeed" and then proceeded to describe the absolute worst-case-scenario for everything possibly related to breastfeeding (& several things that can't be blamed on breastfeeding at all!). It was a common considerations section, but would have been more aptly named, "reasons I think breastfeeding is awful and no one should do it" section. 

I think it is valuable for women to read books that present a less-than-rosy view of motherhood, because too often we have a strong and persistent "perfect mother" image in our heads that is very difficult to live up to (especially if we have perfectionistic tendencies). I adore real-life, tell-it-like it is motherhood memoirs--they are validating and supportive. This book, however, is overwhelming negative and baby-bashing. There are much, much better books out there that do not worship motherhood, but do not completely despise it either
