Well, I didn't throw this book in the trash because of what the pope called jesus{another reviewer did), frankly I don't care.  I did, however, stop reading after page 30 something.  This book is boring and meanders in weird directions.  Also, when I picked it up I thought it would be a real sequel to Canticle(a fabulous book).  I wanted to know what happened to the space faring clergy.
