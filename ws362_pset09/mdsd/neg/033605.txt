The premise of the book is terrific.  Unfortunately that is lost in the first few pages.  Many different attacks are planned, and every time one is ready to occur, the US military is there to thwart it.  But of course, that would be boring, so like on the old "Star Trek" TV series, whenever the transporter would get the boys out of a jam, it malfunctioned.  Likewise the US military.  In this book the military is at best a bunch of imbeciles who can't seem to do the simplest task without destroying their own equipment.  It got boring after a while.

The various attacks are serious, but there is no follow-up.  Some of the attacks are enough to bring the country to its knees, but the results are glossed over, or just not mentioned at all.

Sorry Mr. Weber, but a techno-thriller writer has a responsibility to stick to what could happen, and then to wrap up what did happen.

As a side note, the whole book is a set-up for a sequel.  This is another problem I have with this.  I am sick and tired of bad guys making miraculous escapes and then coming back to haunt us in other books.

Maybe Mr. Weber should look up the term "deus ex machina" before he writes his next book
