There needs to be a good book written about accessing the world by the physically handicapped, unfortunately this one is not very current.  While it has a lot of information, most of it is so general it is of little use.   If you are an adult who became handicapped yesterday and have never  travelled anywhere, you may pick up a tidbit or two.  Otherwise, don't  bother
