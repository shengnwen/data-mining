I'm a BIO major and this book must be the worst text I've been required to read.   Seems to be a giant collection of facts, somewhat organized into chapters and extremely difficult to read and follow.   If you have to read this text, be sure that your instructor explains it clearly or else you're screwed!   I'd give it a 1/2 star but 1 is the lowest this system allows
