I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.
