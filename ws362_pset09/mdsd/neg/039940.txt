I bought this to help me eat right while pregnant.  i have been a vegetarian for years.  i wanted to make sure I was getting the perfect nutrtion for my growing baby.  The book is pretty informative.  It does contain shopping lists and tons of recipes.  I found that the recipes seemed a bit complicated, because of the amount of ingredients needed and its not just stuff that most people would have lying around the house.  I haven't cooked anyhting out of the book yet, but have used a lot of the tips she offers.  I guess I am just not much of a cook.  I am a young newlywed with all the time in the world, but I am pregnant and therefore exhausted.  I also don't have the cash to spend on all the weird ingredients you need on hand, which I would have to buy at the local co-op which is super expensive.  If you love cooking this book is great, if you are looking for simple recipes or info on vegetarian pregnancy, seek out another resource
