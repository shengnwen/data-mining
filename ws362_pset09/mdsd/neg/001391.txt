Albeit you'll learn many things about Area 7 & 8. Although you'll learn about chemical  and nuke weapons, this book's really boring. Each chapter begins with a persecution. So, how many persecutions could you read in a book? How many times the book's hero can save himself or being save by other person? At half book when you're still reading persecutions, you'll know that Schofield and Gant will survive. About the inexistent love story that of course is pathetic I won't write more. So if you like my kind of books (check my listmania! list) don't read this one
