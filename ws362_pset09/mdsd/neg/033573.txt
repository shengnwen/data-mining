After reading her other books as they have come out over the years  I picked up this one.
Kurtz really let her fans down with this one....
None of the characters have the warmth or depth as they have in the other books, and Donal, Kelson's grandfather, is a disgrace to the Haldane name.

I got about 15 pages from the end and put the book down in disgust
