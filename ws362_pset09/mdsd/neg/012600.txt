This guy is totally out of touch with reality.  He is trying to rewrite reality so that the we give HIM power through the money he hopes we will spend on his book.  Don't make the mistake of buying this book and don't make the huge mistake of following what he writes.  There is no need for power in life.  Especially at our ages.  We need peace and happiness.  We can get this by a walk in the woods.  Don't loose the rest of your life by running after happiness where it is not.  Happiness is inside yourself, try to find it before looking elsewhere.  It will not come from anywhere or anybody else.  Get peace with yourself instead of creating chaos.  

All chapters are poorly written with bad advices
