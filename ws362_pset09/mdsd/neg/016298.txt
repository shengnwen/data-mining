I read these 5 star reviews and the synopsis and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I like odd. I read the first few pages/chapters and thought it was "different", but kept waiting to be taken away to a dreamland carnaval. I forced myself to keep going, thinking it was just a slow-starter but I was never seduced like the other reviewers. Very interesting premise, but I was quite disappointed
