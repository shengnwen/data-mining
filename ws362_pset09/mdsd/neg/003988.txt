I still am against the idea of Jason Todd (especially), whose death added another tragic layer to the Batman mythos, returning from the grave.  The impact and fear of losing one's life in a heroic act - the ultimate sacrifice one could make - is almost nil in modern comic books. Characters die and return from the grave almost constantly, an unfortunate cliche that has hurt the mainstream's view of comics-as-art and rendered death as nothing more than a temporary setback for superheroes. 

Aside from the very concept itself, Jason's return is also poorly executed.  The new Black Mask, who is woefully out of character, is still present.  The Joker is sacrificed to Jason Todd's credibility.  And how does Jason come back, you ask?  What's the cool creative explanation that isn't a tired IC-related explantion that doesn't fit the Batman universe motif?  *Spoilers*: Superboy-Prime punching the walls of a paradise in another dimension is the explanation.  Jason wakes up in his coffin and digs his highly battered young body out of his coffin and 6ft of dirt using only his belt buckle.  The coffin had sensors that could detect people getting in, but amazingly could not detect people getting out.  What kind of crazy silly sensors are those?  A new coffin is reburied, and the greatest, I repeat greatest, detective in the world, who forensically examines the coffin in all its minutia, neither notices the reburial or the new coffin.  I couldn't make this junk up.  A must not read for batfans, in my opinion.
