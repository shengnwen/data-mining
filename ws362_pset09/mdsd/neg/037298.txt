Well, I have to agree with tungan, the writing in this book leaves a lot to be desired. I found I was scanning more pages than I was reading, which is really strange because I am a huge fan of WWII air combat and will read and re-read anything I can get my hands on no mater how dry. 
 Another problem I have is the title of the book... &quot;God is my co-pilot &quot; I feel is very deceiving. It led me to believe that this would be a story of a man and the evolution of his faith, as he leaned on God to help him during his missions. 
 The only reference to God in the whole book is in the preface (and that was a quote from a doctor operating on Scott after he had been injured).
 I don't have problem with the Japanese bashing simply because that was the way everybody talked back then. We were at war with them and everybody hated them. Leave history alone, right or wrong...we are stuck with it.
 Anyway I recommend passing on this book, there are a lot of other WWII air combat books out there that are a much better read than this one
