I admit, I only read the first hundred or so pages, then skimmed the rest. As Lincoln once observed, you don't have to eat the whole egg to know it's rotten. 

It seems to me the first half of the book is filled with Gardner arguments trying to illustrate how complicated his science has become, so that the author can spend the rest of the book proposing solutions. But I doubt seriously that very many people lead quotidian lives anywhere near as complicated as the author makes out.
