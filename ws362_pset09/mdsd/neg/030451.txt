This is a good book with lots of great information about the incestuous relationship between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family.  The relationship is repugnant, especially in view of the fact that fifteen of the nineteen 9/11/2001 hijackers were Saudi nationals; in light of the apparent White House managed flights that helped some 140 bin Laden and Saudi royals to escape the U.S. only days after the murderous attacks on American soil.  


Quite honestly, I wonder why an otherwise intelligent man like Craig Unger would receive and prominently display an endorsement from an extremist-bigot like Michael Moore on the front cover of his book.  Why not include on the cover other luminary Jew-haters and Israel-haters such as Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan, Cindy Sheehan, John Dingell and Cynthia McKinney?  Unger indicates no personal Jew-hatred or anti-Semitic tendencies in his book.  Why then did he resort to a bigot like Michael Moore for an endorsement
