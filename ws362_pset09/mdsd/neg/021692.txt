Hmm I wonder if those giving this book five stars actually work for McKinsey.  As a practioner, I don't know anyone in the industry who has actually read this book.  It looks impressive on the bookshelf, but the content is anything but impressive.  A lot of topics are covered, but each one only superficially and the writing is extremely dry and boring.  I actually found reading this volume *painful*, and I'm supposed to like this stuff since I do it for a living!  My advice for any potential buyer is read a few chapters first before you shell out for it
