Originally published in 1952, The Courage to Be by Paul Tillich is a compilation of the Terry Lectures delivered by the author in the same year. Tillich is a well known mid-twentieth century German-American liberal theologian. The following comments pertain to the 2000 re-release by Yale University Press

The lectures discuss the issue of courage and, are largely a response to some of the bleak existentialist philosophy prevalent at the time. I found the aspects of the text discussing existentialism to be the most interesting.  To the appropriate liberal academic audience in the early 1950's these lectures might have sounded majestic.  Tillich weaves a broad story touching on a range of philosophical, political, historic and scientific themes.  Fifty years later it feels dated and superficial; some of the themes e.g. existentialism, Freudism and Marxism are now somewhat passé and may be of limited interest to many modern readers.

This is not to say that the work is without value, I find that Tillich is always effective at conveying the majesty of God. Tillich was by all accounts a capable intellect, however, his ability as a communicator is limited; his use of language while occasionally poetic is often wordy and vacuous, while his argumentation can be sublime, it is frequently speculative and specious.

The Courage to Be is probably only of interest to Tillich fans.
