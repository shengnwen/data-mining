Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.

There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.
