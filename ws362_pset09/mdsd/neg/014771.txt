Ann's books are amusing, informative, thought provoking, and full of sarcasm to be sure, but at least she backs up her thoughts with logic, explanation, and evidence. Using facts and evidence to make arguments is rare for liberals, which is why they tend not to address issues, and use personal attacks to make their points.  Ann's comments about the 9/11 widows wasn't really against the widow's per se, it was a comment about the inability of anyone to question the political statements made by victims because they are victims. Ann does a good job explaining that being a victim does not automatically instill knowledge of international politics, or knowledge of Islam, or of much else, yet she sees (as we all do) the media fail to question a victim's political statements because they are victims, regardless of the merits of the arguments themselves.

Thus, as Ann points out, liberals trot out victims to make anti-Bush statements, or anti-American statements, and assume that the "victim" has an inherent (and they believe earned) "shield" from questions and analysis, dare we offend the victims or seem heartless. Unfortunately, not all the statements made by victims translate into well reasoned arguments, which was the point Ann was trying to make, and she made it clearly to everyone who grasped it, except for those who got stunned by the comments and stopped listening or reading (aka Liberals).
