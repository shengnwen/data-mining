If I could have given this book no stars I would have.  It was a complete waste of money and time.  Ms. Bacall comes across as a sour, shrewish old woman.  I don't know why actors think their political opinions are the ones we should all have.  Her disdain for her fellow Americans and our President lost her this former fan.  I've read my last book by Bacall
