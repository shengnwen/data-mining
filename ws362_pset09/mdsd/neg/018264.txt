I got this book because it was highly recommended by a college professor.  I thought that it was entirely too wordy.  I would skip through paragraphs because it was just too much.  I thought the story plot was interesting and could have been fun to read, but Tom Robbins came off sounding pretentious because of his overuse of words.  It could have been much better.
