It's often better to know certain people only through their works, and to avoid altogether what passes for a biography written by &quot;long-time  friends.&quot; This is the overview he was afraid of reading, what had to  wait to be written until his passing? There is no semblance of objective  distance in this book. Even the most awful, and possibly revealing, aspects  of this man's life--chief among them the suicide of his sixty-nine year old  wife of more than four decades--are glossed over and swept aside, the  authors preferring to concentrate on his happiness in taking up with the  wife of one of his friends soon after. And there are countless mentions of  his &quot;brilliant color sense&quot;--a subjective talent, at best--to the  extent that by the end of the book you might believe that this was on par  with the cure for polio. Dr. Seuss was a wonderfully talented author of  children's books, and a worthy subject for an honest and well-rounded  biography. Unfortunately, this is not it. Go back and read &quot;Green Eggs  and Ham&quot; again. Go read &quot;The Cat in the Hat.&quot; Leave this  alone
