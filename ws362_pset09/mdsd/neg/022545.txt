I bought both of Van Cleave's &quot;Best Science Fair Projects&quot; books for my middle school child and was not impressed, in fact, I returned the first &quot;Best Science Fair Projects&quot; book as it was simply a waste of time and money.  Readers should be advised that the majority of Van Cleave's projects are for very young children in early grammar school years, they are not for children who are planning for science fairs at the middle school or high school level, at least not on a competitive level.  Many of Ms. Van Cleave's projects are demonstrations of certain basic science principles and that may be interesting for parents to try at home with their children in their spare time, but how does a child convert any of these into real projects that are supposed to ask a question, investigate the question, and proceed with an experiment to prove or disprove what the child is investigating.  I cannot see where a book that contains projects such as &quot;Can You Make a Diagram of an Insects Body&quot; and where the materials required are cutting out the Head, Thorax and Abdomen out of construction paper to make a model insect, I cannot see where this is a project worthy to be called a &quot;best science fair project,&quot; much less receive the praise that the other reviewers have given
