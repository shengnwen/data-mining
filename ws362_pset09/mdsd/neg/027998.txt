I am a therapist working with families and children and this book does not help anyone to understand or cope with family problems.  This mother is neglectful and problem-ridden allowing her son to miss school, spend days doing little if anything meaningful, and giving him the responsibility of babysitting alone without any back-up support or phone.  Her choice of a paramour and her foul language make this more of an adult book.  I can't possibly understand how this won a Newberry award.  It is depressing without any redeeming educational value
