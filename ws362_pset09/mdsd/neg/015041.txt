As a collector of many forms of Electronica new &amp; old, I'm going to have to side with Matthew Collins on this one.  The book is truely volumunous in it's bulk of basic biographical info on lots of dj's and groups, but it lacks the Discography information collectors crave.  It's true that this book is great for a beginner I guess, but most of the people who would be willing to buy this are probably really into Techno &amp; Electronica, and I would think would expect a little more than what seems to be a bunch of info from the Allmusic website on Biographies.  It is worth it's price if you have cash to spare, and a spot on your shelf, but really, if you have the internet then just go to the website Allmusic.com for more info than there is in the book.  And I have to say I agree with Mr Collins on &quot;who the heck is Amon Duul&quot;  Maybe the group was an important figure in obscure indie-electro or something, but they're not a part of the Techno music that I love &amp; know.  And Prodigy is an awesome group, they just get bashed cause they got too popular, and I guess you can't be popular and be part of Electronica
