I am an eighth grader taking Geometry, so it is obviously advanced.  However, this book is not helpful AT ALL in learning.  It is so frustrating to not even have a glossary in the back to find definitions, and the book does a very bad job of explaining tough concepts.  If you are a teacher, please try a different book
