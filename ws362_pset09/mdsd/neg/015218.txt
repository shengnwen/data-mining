This book is required for my finance class. However, this book doesn't explain the concepts well. For example what the book covered on the chapters have nothing to do with what were asked on the exercises. Students are often left in the dark trying to find themselves to come up with the formula (luckily we have the internet). If you buy this book make sure you have the TI BA II plus calculator. The book ONLY explains how to do most of the problems on THAT particular calculator instead of giving us the formula to use on any other calculator or using spreadsheet. Although there are some chapters that mentioned they will give instructions on how to solve the problems using MS excel but so far only chapter 1 gave us some basic information and rest of the chapters don't show anything (even though they mentioned it). So the words on the book and what you are actually getting don't match. Unless you have a very good instructor who's willing to work without getting help from the book, you are pretty screwed. 

This book needs some serious editing (as I said the words and the contents don't match).
