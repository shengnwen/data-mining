An excellent story ruined by the WORST binding effort I have ever seen.  The book literally fell to pieces in my hand after only a few pages.  I guess it says something about the story that I even bothered to fight to the end of it.  No chance of a re-read. Unless you're willing to deal with loose 25 page sections, I would just look for a copy at the library.  It will not survive to become part of your collection
