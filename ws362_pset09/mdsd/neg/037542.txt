One of the single worst things to be published in recent history by White Wolf.  While the changes set down in Dark Ages: Mage completely ignored the time lines in the other mage series, it was atleast contained within the mage line. Demon the fallen on the other hand went further, it ignored the fact that demons have been used in every game, and those demons were not only better than the 'fallen' version, they are completely incompatable.  The changes put in this book sent the cosmology of other games into a tailspin, and not for the better. This was a badly done, and worse, unneccesary book
