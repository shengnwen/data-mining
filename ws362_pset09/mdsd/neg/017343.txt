I read the first two books while on vacation: #1 had flat characters and some of the worst dialog I have ever read, but an interesting SciFi idea; I had to read #2 because I already bought it, and was happy to discover that the action had picked up. I was actually looking forward to #3, to see the business in New Britain develop along with the fallout from Matthias' actions.

Book #3 turned out to be a boring drag of more painful dialog with endless pages of uninteresting character background (DEA agent Mike) and Miriam complaining about her situation. I taught myself how to speed read to get through the dross to see if anything interesting happened (the last couple pages had some action). 

Do you read the Robert Jordan books? Remember book #10 and how nothing happened? It got a 1.5 star rating only because you are not allowed to give zero stars. This book ranks right down there with that overbloat of filler material.
