I thoroughly enjoyed previous entries in the "Cat Who..." series, but this one was very disappointing.  In fact, I was so disappointed in this one that I pulled out a couple of older ones to see if my tastes had simply changed!  No, the book just doesn't measure up.  As another viewer commented - too cutesy, too predictable, too little mystery.  I will look for subsequent titles at the library rather than purchase them in hardback.  I hope this is just an oddball flop
