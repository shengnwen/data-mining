I bought a copy of this book and it IS forcing me to give greater attention to an arguably important part of handicapping, therefore, it might be worth the money.

While Klein's percentage of winners and return-on-investment calculations are adequate for the leaders at the first call, they are without merit for those that do not lead because he dumps both categories in together. This statistical error causes a disparity, but it only "seems" that the ROI between leaders and non-leaders looks larger. But, sheesh, there is only ONE leader but SEVERAL non-leaders. Using basic math, if the win percentage for leaders in a certain category is 30% then the win percentage for non-leaders is 70%. 

Using Steve's calculation method, in an 8-horse race you would bet $2 on the leader and $14 (the "non-leaders" times 2)on the non-leaders. Even if a non-leader won there would still be six losers among the non-leaders so the "win percentage" is just 14 percent. Unless the winner pays off at more than 6-1 odds it's a NEGATIVE return-on-investment!

In my opinion, look to other handicapping books for a better return on investment
