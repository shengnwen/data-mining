Heidegger endeavour is like to examine the condition of whiteness in general. 
Being is not more real and substantive than whiteness. It is just a category, a verbal shorcut. 
If per chance is philosophically useful, it is only on the most shallow, no deeper sense. 
Of course you can write -as he did- more or less moving pages about the condition of the human being, the "dasein", but that does not get us one step nearer some kind of ontological certainty. 
If someone like that kind of writting, I advice the Science of Logic by Hegel, 100 times more interesting and inspiring, although not an inch more convincing
