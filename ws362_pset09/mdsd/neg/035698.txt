I got halfway through "March" before I just got bored. It's not that it's really that bad, but a lot of the "facts" are actually just things some people think might be true, and the book jumps around like a high school student's term paper. The whole thing just feels akin to someone saying "Hey, guess what? Did you know that like, a real long time ago things were real weird and goofy? Haw haw!"

Not for anyone who has any real academic interest in early English history
