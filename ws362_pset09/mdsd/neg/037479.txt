I bought this book for my daughter to read to her toddlers, but sent it back to Amazon immediately.  The idea of a Guardian Angel is quickly introduced in the book and is a theme throughout.  If you believe in teaching about angels to a two year old, this book is for you.  It definitely wasn't for us
