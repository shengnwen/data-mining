This is quite possibly the most poorly written book I have ever seen. Like others on this site I will never again read a DS book. Talk about repetitive -- it got so bad that I began to underline everytime the main love interest was referred to as a "wacky artist". Between Chapters 5 and 7 the term was used 15 times, three times on one page. To make it worse, the "wacky artist" is also characterized as extremely immature and childlike, making him very unappealing to me, anyway. In the space of 3 pages the following phrases appear -- "looked like a big kid", "she felt like his mother", "his childlike style" "he was very needy sometimes, and self-centered, as children are", "he acted like a bored schoolboy", "pouting", "acted out, more often than not, like a child". What a bore. Both the book and the people in it
