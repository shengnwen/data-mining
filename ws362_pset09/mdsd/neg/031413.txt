This novel by G.K. Chesterton, starts very well, with a policeman so succesful in trying to infiltrate a group of anarchists that he is elected one of the bosses of the cell. Then things slowly becomes more muddled and the plot collapses halfway through the book, as it becomes more and more confusing and improbable and the author tries to feed on us too much indigestible philosophical baggage (Chesterton was a notorious political ultraconservative who seemed to find nothing worthwhile in the Europe after the Middle Ages). If you want to read a novel about early 20th century anarchists, I suggest instead you read Joseph Conrad's "The Secret Agent"
