The book is like a bible. Explanation is more than needed and you loose thread while reading it. Topics are not as consistent and organized as they should be, you have to move back and forth to get the whole picture. In my openion the author is not clear in conveying his point. A point can be explained within few lines but insted he use far too much text. Topics are much more understandable with the help of examples though. Honestly I get bored! Overall, it is a fair book and can be used as refrence material
