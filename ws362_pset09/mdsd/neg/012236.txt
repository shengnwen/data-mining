I really looked forward to reading this book, figuring that someone with as much access as Alan Light would give me more of an insiders look into a great band.  But he remains on the outside like the rest of us, instead relying on first hand accounts of the band members themselves as well as many others in or around hip-hop.  At first it's kind of cool to get some of the early stories about the punk scene in NYC, which really branched out from the hardcore D.C. bands like Bad Brains.  You just never really get to be in the studio, or at the writing sessions, or on the tour bus.  It's more fitting for liner notes.  Let's tackle this subject head on and get some good stories in a collection.  These guys are legends, and have toured and recorded with and around some of the core players in hip-hop history.  I found this book to be a shallow take on a complex and genre bending crew.  Disappointing
