This is the first Cussler I have read and I have to admit at being terribly disappointed.I have a liking for books that combine history and fiction (loved The Da Vinci Code) but this has to be one of the least readable in that genre.An important reason for this is that the hero,Dirk Pitt,is an immensely unlikable character.He's too smug,is a walking human encyclopedia who knows EVERYTHING,has all the physical and mental attributes of a God and appears to treat everyone around him with a distinct superiority complex.I ended up smirking on several occasions as his virtue's were extolled upon by all and sundry.Another drawback is the sheer number of characters.New one's keep popping up practically every chapter (and there are 78 chapters in all!).Their names and descriptions get all muddled up by the end of it and one really just stops caring about any of them.As if this weren't enough,there are several plots running parallel with each other and each of these becomes more and more ridiculous as the pages go by.To add to the boredom,detailed descriptions about cars,planes,ships,gadgets etc.are provided at regular intervals.This wouldn't necessarily have been a bad thing if it weren't completely redundant.It seems as if the author is merely trying to show off his knowledge about these things.The only reason I finished this book is because I am a completist by nature.I do realise that such books are supposed to be pure escapism and I'm all for such unbridled entertainment - except that there needs to be a method to the madness.This definitely seems like a case of biting off more than one can chew
