You have to check the cover of this book to make sure the author is Catherine Coulter, because the story doesn't sound for one second like the Catherine Coulter whose stories I adore in so many of her other books especially the FBI series.

Rosehaven is mentioned only briefly in the story when Severin and Hastings along with their soldiers journey to the estate and find Hastings' mother and a brood of unknown sisters sired by her father who had "allegedly" murdered her mother for her infidelity.  Once this is discovered about 2/3 of the way into the story, Rosehaven and the inhabitants are scarely referred to again in the rest of the story. It left me puzzled. 

Additionally, there are many subplots that were left dangling and unanswered while the author focused upon brutality, rape and sodomy in this vulgar story.  Now, in fairness, that may have been how 12th Century England was, but I would prefer not to have a blow by blow pornographic recounting of it as this story unfolds.  All in all this is not a well written story and not at all the style that this author has exhibited in so many other of her well written books.  I'll pass on this one.
