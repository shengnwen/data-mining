Is there substance?  Yes, not a lot, but there is a brief overview of history here.  

Is there fluff?  Oh hell yes and way too much of it.  There are just way too many asides and way too much focus on kings rather than conditions.  For example, he explains that Caesar may have had a homosexual escapade in Spain.  NOT PERTINENT and a little offensive to boot.  Remove such things and you have about 50 pages of worthy reading and I have to question some of his findings in those 50.  

He goes to great lengths to brush over Spanish atrocities in the New World and at Home, claiming they are basically English racism towards the Spanish designed as a PR campaign against.  I have no doubt that such existed as the two countries have long had problems, but that doesn't mean the Spanish Conquistadors weren't brutal (and downright evil at times).  And the Inquisition should never have detractors.  The most telling moment of the book happens, after detailing this "racism", he then goes on another aside to tell how the Irish sold out the Spanish for a bottle of whisky. Holy crap is that the pot calling the kettle black and how any editor would let that slip through, calls into question the entire book.  So I learned a little from it, but it's not worth your effort.  Seek other books.
