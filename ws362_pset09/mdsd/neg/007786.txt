This book is about a teenaged girl named Judi who develops bulimia while dealing with her extreme insecurities about her body and herself. Over the course of a few months, Judi realizes that another girl in her school, Nancy, is also sufferring from an eating disorder. After realizing that they have the same problem, Judi begins to emulate Nancy's behavior, and even "cover" for her while she throws up her lunch in the school bathroom.

Although the idea of this novel intrigued me, I didn't find it very original, or very realistic. Any reputable psychologist will tell you that people with eating disorders are almost never able to recover on their own, and have a greater chance of relapsing if they do. However, in Fat Chance, Judi simply stops throwing up after learning the dangers of eating disorders, deciding that losing weight isn't worth it. The problem with this idea, is that people with eating disorders are not generally concerned with the toll that they are taking on their bodies. Instead, they wish to continue the behaviors, and lie consistantly to cover it up.
Therefore, while there are some good aspects to the novel, I think that it presents a rather fluffy and sugarcoated idea of eating disorders. I think that if readers are looking for a more realistic view into the world of eating disorders, they should consider reading memiors like Stick Figure, or a psychotherapist's view, like The Best Little Girl in the World. These books better demonstrate the extreme complexities of eating disorders and their effects on those who suffer from them
