As an experienced cake decorator looking for new ideas, I was not impressed with this book. The examples were a bit staid. I would not even recommend it for new bakers since there are no explicit guidelines for making the decorations, constructing the cakes, etc. I would recommend The Well Decorated Cake by Toba Garrett. The instructions are simple and easy to follow even for the novice. And the recipes are wonderful. I have tested almost every one and had great results the first time.
