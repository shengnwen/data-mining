This book is full of pretty pictures but is quite useless as a guide for independent travelers.  It doesn't have any information on how to get from one place to another, the hours of operations of museums/buses/trains, or any price ranges.  The maps are detailed in 2 block radius, but it's impossible to understand how to link the mini-maps to get a comprehensive picture
