If you have never read a diet book before than this one is as good as any.  The author addresses all aspects of dieting and exercise.  My disappointment was that you have heard it all before.  I have had success on Weight Watchers, Body For Life and the South Beach Diet.  My problem is that after the initial excitement wears off, I don't maintain the program.  I was interested in this book because the other reviews indicated that it addressed emotional aspects of over-eating.  Specifically, boredom, stress, etc.  But I was really disappointed when he discussed these issues because he wrote a little blurb on each aspect and then gave some personal story.  To me it was childish psychological advice.

For example, he discusses binge eating.  Now I am only about 10-15 pounds overweight and I can eat properly all day and then right before I go to bed ruin my diet and eat 3 doughnuts or some other high caloric food.  His belief is that it is often related to some childhood trauma and that seeking professional help may be the answer.  I dont know about you but I am not going to seek professional help to lose 15 pounds.

Then he suggests to eat wisely.  He has a chart that actually says if you want to eat fudge, then choose fruit.  If you want cake, choose skinless grilled chicken breast.  Duh?  I did not make that up.  Here's another one.  If you want to eat pie, then choose soup.  Is he kidding?  I guarantee that I will never eat chicken breast instead of accepting a piece of birthday cake.

Okay I don't want to just bash the book.  Everything he writes is probably dietetically correct.  It's just that I have read them all and done most of them and I have yet to experience one that worked long-term.  The one that I had the most success is Body For Life of which I lost 40 pounds and as I mentioned I have put back 10 to 15.

Good luck.  Nothing new to report
