I purchased this book primaraly on the merits of the customer reviews here.  After having used this book to develop a Palm application using GCC PRC Tools, I'm stumped as to how it got such good reviews.  The example code (in the text and on the CD) contains errors (read: the code won't compile.)  Also, the examples are incomplete.  For instance, the author talks about reading from a TextField but not how to write to one (not a trivial procedure.)  Popup triggers are left out altogether.  In general, the author doesn't thouroughly cover the topics he's chosen to write about.  Nor does he give you any clue that he's not fully discussing the topic at hand.  For example, he mentions only a couple of the built in dialog boxes and doesn't bother to tell you that there are other's available in PalmOS - let alone list them.  The worst problem is that some of the examples are good enough to compile and execute on a non-debug device ROM, but will crash the debug ROM or produce erratic behavior in the program (ie: his discussion of PrefGetAppPreferences())  Over and over I'm having to debug errors that have been introduced because I used the author's buggy code.  Do yourself a favor, buy a different book on writing PalmOS applications
