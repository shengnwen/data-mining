After reading this book make me wonder if the two what wrote this book really be athletes or if they stay running one step ahead of the law.  Sister give me this book cause she know I like to eat.  And I do exercise.  But this book stank so bad if you hold it next to the food you eating, you lose your appetite, and maybe your meal before that
