I ordered this thinking it was a fun coffee table book about fashion from the 60s and 70s, as the cover would have you believe. The photos were boring & mostly of unrecognizable people. Plus, it contained a full frontal male nude shot, which made it too X-rated for me to leave out on the coffee table. I can't have my mother looking at this book! Thumbs down
