Shrewish. Prude. Judgemental. Blathery. Catty. Disjointed. 

What a shame. There's a lot to be said about female sexuality and feminism in general, but Levy doesn't bother with the core of any it. Instead, she spends her time interviewing the flightiest Spring Breakers she can find, criticizing successful women for acting manish, and obsessing about fringe cultural fads.

I was disappointed to see so many prejudices in Levy. She is one of the worst FCPs I've read. And a stick in the mud, to boot
