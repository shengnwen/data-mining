I have been reading Danielle Steel for a long time, and it seems to me lately I can guess the plot and the ending long before I get there.  Her books are starting to copy themselves, same thing different setting.  I really had a hard time getting through this one because she kept repeating herself when talking about Sasha's feelings, the book could've been a lot shorter if she didn't write the same thing over and over.  I would not recommend this one
