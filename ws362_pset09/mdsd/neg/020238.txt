This will probably be the LAST book of this series that I will buy. There is entirely too much emphasis on HORSES and cosiderably less on CATS. I've alwauys considered Rita Mae Brown's books to be primarily about CATS (and one dog, Tucker). While RMB's books have always had a thread of horseflesh, this current effort goes way too far
