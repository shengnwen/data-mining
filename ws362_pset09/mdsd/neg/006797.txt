I liked White Oleander so much that as soon as Paint it Black became available, even tho I'm committed to buying used books as an environmental measure, I had to have it right away and so bought the hard-cover.  Having read it, I must say I'm more than a little disappointed.  For me, Josie never really came alive, nor did Michael.  Most of the actions of the people in this story didn't make sense or didn't ring true.  Unlike the characters in White Oleander, I never cared much about any of these characters.  The story is pretty stagnant; I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Instead, all of the dropped hints earlier never get picked up.  Just as I was almost done reading the book, I thought, "OK, there's still time to reveal a shocker:  maybe Michael's mother tracked him down at the motel and, realizing that he could not escape her, he killed himself."  But no, the story just fizzles out.  We are left wondering if Josie's suspicions are true about Michael and his mother.  And how thick could this supposedly street-smart girl be if she didn't figure out until hundreds of pages after the reader did, that the housekeeper cared deeply about her wellbeing?!
