We all know that O.J. Simpson is 1000% guilty of this horrific double-murder and that he was able to buy justice thanks to his shameless "Dream Team" lawyers (or liars) and their utterly despicable tactics. Despite the countless lies found here, what I find most offensive, nasty and sickening is how Simpson refers to himself as being a "battered husband"--Say What???!!! Lies, more lies and nothing but big, nasty and fat lies
