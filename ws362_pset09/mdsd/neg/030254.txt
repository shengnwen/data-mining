I purchased this book with the intention of reading gritty tales of growing up in the South, not lesbian porn.  I do not have a problem with Ms. Allison's sexual preference; some of what she had to say about being a lesbian was interesting.  However, I found this book to be pornographic and disgusting.  I did not realize that 80% of this book was detailed sexual encounters.  For example, one story describes her partner urinating on her face. I do not recommend this book
