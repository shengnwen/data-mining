I ordered this book but didn't notice that it was an E-Book.
How can they charge the same price for an E-Book? Personally, I think the Acrobat Reader sucks when compared to a real paperback or regular old HTML.
Anyway, I figured I'd try to download it since I'd placed the order. WOW, there is Adobe DRM and MS Passport to deal with. Way too much trouble, I just called Amazon and cancelled the order.
Maybe the content of the book is OK, I don't know. If I were an author I don't think I'd let them offer my books in PDF form just yet
