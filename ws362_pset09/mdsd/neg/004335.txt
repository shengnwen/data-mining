As the rest of Habermas's books, this one is an extremely difficult read. Unless you have previous knowledge of philosophical concepts, you will most likely not understand what Habermas is saying because he makes constant references to other philosophers, concepts and ideas.  Rather than elaborating on them, he assumes that the reader already knows them.  As well, I found that he takes rather simple concepts and makes them unnecessarily complex, as if to sound impressive.  By the time you dig through all the semantic nonsense, you realize that his ideas are not exceptional and they could have been conveyed in a much simpler, straight-forward manner.  This book is a complete waste of time since you will spend hours just trying to understand what he's attempting to say, thinking that you will discover something brilliant, only to be disappointed.  My suggestion is to pick up a different book that is simpler to understand and where the author does not try to make his ideas sound impressive by using unnecessarily complicated language
