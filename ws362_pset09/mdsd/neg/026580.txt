it contains very little practical info, and is primarily an ad for their own kayaks and videos, and a medium to broadcast what heroes they are - "commander soares" indeed! they dont go "paddling", they go on a "mission"! these guys are doubtless good paddlers, but they cant write. to class the concluding poem "kayak brother" as ... would suggest it has literary merit (ie pathos), but it is just the stuff of cringe. guys, try understatement as a style for your next book, and put some useful info in it
