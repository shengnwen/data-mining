I didn't enjoy this book, even though I'm partial to sea stories.  There is not a single likable, admirable character in the book.  I don't think the author, Robert Stone, has spent much time sailing or knows much about the sea.  I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in reading sea stories.  Actually the sailing material does not play a large part in the plot and is not convincingly portrayed.

So what then is it about?  It seems to be about the misery of modern American life.  Stone wants his novel to be deep and epic but it is just depressing and dorky.  The symbolism and ideas are mostly shallow.  There's obscure religious undertones that made no sense to me.  The parent/child relationships portrayed in the book are utterly banal and ugly.  I found no humanity at all in any of the relationships. 

And consider the title-"Outerbridge Reach."  Outerbridge Reach is supposed to be an area in New York Harbor where derelict boats lie (get the symbolism?).  But I think the author wanted to title his story "Outta Reach" and came up with this 'clever' twist on the title instead.  Basically what the book is about is how fulfillment, love, and happiness are outta reach.  If you like this kind of depressing thing, you'll love this book.   I don't and I didn't.

Having said all this, I must admit that I did read the entire novel which I don't usually do if I dislike a book.  The reason I read on is that Stone writes well and has an elegant and interesting prose style.  He knows how to skilfully pace a story.  It's a shame that his talent is wasted on such negative content
