This book centers on Varian Fry's year in Marseille and is the third such biography to come out in the last decade or so.  This author is a Canadian and previous Fry biographies were penned by a Brit (Andy Marino) and an American (Sheila Isenberg).  Sullivan's work offers little new information on Varian Fry or on most of his colleagues.  If you look at her bibliography you might get the impression that she has done a great amount of research.  However, anyone familiar with the story, will find echoes of previous works, and much that borrows from Marino's book, which is superior.  

The core of her book is transforming four memoirs written by rescuers - Varian Fry, Lisa Fittko, Mary Jayne Gold, and Danny Benedite - from the first person to the third person voice. Her approach for doing this has two misleading results.  First, she does not give enough credit to the memoirs of the humanitarians who wrote them (just footnotes at the back). Second, observations presented by the memoirists related to passing events and impressions, she introduces as facts, denying the reader the original context for the various events. Instead of organizing her material skillfully, she presents scores of chapters, making for a choppy narrative. Hopefully, this type of appropriation will not become the standard for "creative non-fiction."
