Ah, the mass prison breakout, a classic (overused) storyline.  A prison breakout encourages Captain America to form a team out of the heroes who arrive to stop it, reminded of how the Avengers originally came together.  Which in this incarnation is a semi-allstar lineup, in the current tradition of the Justice League, plus Spider-Woman and Luke Cage, who are entertaining characters in the series if odd choices (someone misses the 70's). 

New Avengers has its ups and downs.  The artwork is quite pretty, though sometimes the colors are mergered into another too much and it's hard to tell what's going on.  The dialogue is frequently clever and humorous, though sometimes it seems like Spider-Man is trying too hard to be funny.  The overall story moves a bit slow (not much happens in six issues), the famous "decompression" style Bendis is associated with.  I suppose what I would consider the major flaw of the book is a common one with team books: characterization.  The only character who seemed to have a unique voice at all was Spider-Man, and that's primarily because he's the wiseass.  No other characters come across as themselves, just generic superheroes.  

The overall story keeps your attention, details sometimes seem glossed over, but there are a lot of clever touches in story and dialogue that I enjoyed.  The actual forming of the team was a little eh, and I would have prefered some explanation given on why Pete getting his arm broken barely bothers him.  Some of the companion pieces of the New Avengers, such as the Spider-man stories with Cap, Iron Man, and Logan as supporting characters really capture the personalities of the characters that seems to be missing here, but indicate the possibilites of this new team.
