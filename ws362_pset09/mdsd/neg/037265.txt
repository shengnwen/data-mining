Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"

This is one of those books. 

Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history. 

Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass. 

And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much
