This book is a reprint of a novel published in the seventies -- it shows its age, and probably wasn't all that good back then, either. The action is implausible, often silly. The characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, and the conversation is dull. If nothing else, it shows how far the thriller genre has progressed -- compare with Robert Brace's BLACK TIGER, for example, where the plot line is believable and the characters genuinely engaging, even minor ones
