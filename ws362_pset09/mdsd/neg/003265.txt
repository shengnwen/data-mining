I guess I should have read the review of this 'new release' of an older (2) novel(s).

I love Nora Roberts, but she's so much better than this now!  I've grown with her over the years and was a little disappointed that I fell for the new cover, thinking a new book.  A waste of money for any Nora Roberts fan
