I read "Veronica Decides to Die", after reading "The Alchemist," "Eleven Minutes," and "The Zahir." The previous two I enjoyed tremendously, even through "The Alchemist" didn't strike me as original and groundbreaking as the people that recommended it to me had described it. Had I not had such high expectations, perhaps, reading it would have been more rewarding of an experience.
Getting to the point, "Veronica Decides to Die" is yet another novel where he's reinforcing the theme that rules all of his books, the importance of appreciating life and treasuring each moment in life as the precious gift it is. It gets tedious at times, and I won't be the first to point out that the incessant borrowing of ideas is another obvious shortcoming. He introduces psychological disorders as a sort of a rebellion against society, as always, over-simplifying things in order to draw the reader to the "natural" philosophical conclusion. The problem is, this time Coelho doesn't quite succeed.
