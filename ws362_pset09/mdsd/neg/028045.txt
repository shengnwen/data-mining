I always feel that it is such a shame when authors ruin an otherwise excellently written work with scurrilous and unresearched references to particular religions. This book references "Mormons" and "Latter-day Saints", both nicknames for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She groups this religion in with other fundamentalist Christian religions, falsely stateing that this church turns a blind eye towards poligamy, when in fact poligamists are ex-communicated. She further intimates that members of this religion believe in Eve's BIG ruinous sin, when in fact they believe nothing of the kind and honour and revere Eve as the first mother. This intimation is carried further by stating a belief that the LDS church subjugates women, when in fact woman are highly prized and considered co-partners with their husbands in all areas of their religious and private lives. It is also a shame that the author, through her main character, stigmatizes chastity as being somthing only religious fanatics believe. All Christian faiths, Moslems, and Jews believe that chastity is a holy ideal. If you look at chastity separate from religion, consider how many fewer AIDS victims there would be--how many fewer children would be born without fathers in their lives--how many fewer victims of other STD's there would be, if only chastity was not looked on as some sort of aberition. It really is a shame. Unfortunately, Ruth Rendell does not seem to consider that many of her readers believe in the ideals she, through her character of Wexford, scorns -- and there is no doubt that by her choice of words she is expressing her own opinion. I could barely get through this book and considered several times putting it down
