I do not wish to dissect this book line by line, nor to clarify for review readers where I stand on the issues presented in the book. (Other reviewers have done enough of that.) My only desire is to point out that the best writing in all genres makes the reader anxious for the end. This author uses such derisive, negative and dismissive language from the first line of the introduction that the fun of reading is just not there. Subtlety is the mother of good writing.
