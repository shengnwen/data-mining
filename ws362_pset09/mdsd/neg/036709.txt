I didn't know this sort of 18th and 19th century Travel Literature was still being written today. Tom Miller travels awful far to come home with his suitcase full of frat-boy stereotypes and over determined metaphors. Cubans here are sexy, mango eating, Chevy driving caricatures. Having  traveled there frequently over the last ten years, I can tell you the only  subject illuminated by this book is the inability of Miller's mind to look  past his own North American biases. There are excellent books about Cuba  written by strangers to that country, see Cardenal's for example. There are  also excellent books about Cuba written by Cubans, see for example Franqui.  This book however is not worthy of the trees that died for it
