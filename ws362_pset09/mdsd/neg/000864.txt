The series of lectures comprising this book show Pipes at his 'best', clearly justifying critics views of him as &quot;among the most politically reactionary and intellectually unscrupulous of the &quot;totalitarian&quot;  school of American Sovietologists&quot;. This book provides a good  counter-analysis to the works of Figes, Fitzpatrick and Service, showing an  outdated 'top-down' approach to 20th century Russian historiography. A must  for those who wish to see the product of America's cold war generation of  intellectuals
