This series (up to book 4/5) was one of my favorites. There were little things that bugged me, but I considered it to be a masterpiece.

A coupld of things have caused me to completely give up on this series after this book.

* Detail is great and all, but please make something happen. There are very few books that I haven't finished, but I was close with this one due to the lack of real events furthuring the story. 

* ENOUGH with the 'Men are stupid, tug on my braids' mentality! RJ likes to infuse his charecters with the inability to understand the opposite gender. When will they learn what most mature adults learn? If I didn't know better I'd say that RJ is a feminist man-hater.

I could overlook these annoyances when the rest of the story was fantastic, but that just isn't the case with this book
