Boring book, the guy truly rambles; was disappointed especially after I found a good article about Jefferson in wikipedia. What added salt to injury is that I discovered that Hichens was (still is?) a Stalinist - felt that Jefferson might not have liked it had he been alive, i.e. to see a Stalinist as his biographer. Life isnt fair, as daddy says. Finally, I came across a video in which he was debating a British guy, I think his name was George something, he starts combing his hair in the middle of the debate - then he was called Popinjay; couldnt hold my stomach with laughter..
