I'm currently devouring every book in Bill Pronzini's fantastic Nameless Detective series, in order. So far, they've all been terrific, but I must admit that I had to force myself to finish this one. Is it because we  actually learn the Nameless Detective's name!  Is it that the final plot  twist is foreshadowed to the point where a six-year-old could guess what  was coming? The story is told in alternating points of view by Pronzini's  PI and Wilcox's police detective; that technique worked far better in  Pronzini's &quot;Double&quot; (which he wrote with his wife, Marcia  Muller). &quot;Twospot&quot; was a disappointment, but I look forward to  reading the rest of the series
