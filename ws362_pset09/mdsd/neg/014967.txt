Ms. Hawke creates an interesting 'live' vampire here, but he is the only good thing about this book. The author's use of descriptors [spec. colors] with EVERYTHING do not seem that of a professional writer. 

As for being erotic, well the few love scenes were slightly steamy but nothing to write home about. 

This is obviously a planned series as there are so many loose strings left at the end its a wonder my book didn't unravel. Read it in one sitting and donated it to the library the next day. Maybe I can save someone from wasting their money on it...
