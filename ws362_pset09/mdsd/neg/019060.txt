This book, though purporting to expose abuses of the legislative process in the House, is lacking in a number of areas.  Its substance suffers from an obvious rush to get to print prior to the 2006 midterm elections.  It could easily have been written as a less profitable and more concise essay.

There is very little history of the Houses's storied past.  The book is best when it differentiates between abuses of the Democrats in the majority in the past, and the Republicans in their 12 year reign.  The Medicare prescription drug vote stands out.

That vote, however, does not stand out as much as the author's naivete in their own dealings with Congress.  While working on a House study group, formed by the Democrats to help improve the operation of the House, the authors actually inserted in the report that the Democratic house leadership was "arrogant."

The authors then appear to be taken aback that they were called to a meeting of House chairmen who didn't appreciate that characterization of their leadership.  Regardless of whether true or not, their characterization of the leadership not only could have been more diplomatically stated, it needn't have been stated at all. Such naivete  raises the question as to how effective the authors can actually be in their declared mission to fix a broken branch.

This is the kind of political book all too often found in the public domain these days.  It was rushed to print to address a contemparary issue that will fade into history.  it won't even meet President Bush's criterion as a footnote.  It will not serve as a good primary source for historians.  

It also spends too much of its time in discussing the authors's self-laudatory attempts to "reform" Congress.  These days self-promotion seems to be required material for books whose existence drifts between contemporary journalism, history, and "expert" commentary
