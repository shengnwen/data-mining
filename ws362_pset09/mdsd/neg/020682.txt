 The thesis of this book is that the 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Bill Clinton's mistakes. That is incorrect. The 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for G.W. Bush's mistakes. 9-11 could have easily been prevented. The CIA and the FBI were giving Bush thorough warnings about how Bin Laden was a potential threat to the U.S. and the White House had documents that plainly stated "Bin Laden determined to attack in the U.S." Bush was on vacation the whole time that he could've been looking into that. Instead, he decided he would rather be out golfing and fishing than preventing an assault on American soil. Condoleeza Rice, the then national security advisor, now Secretary of State, committed perjury at the 9-11 Commission by saying under oath that the documents said that Bin Laden was not determined to attack in the U.S. When in fact the documents said the exact opposite. 
 I do not recommend this book.
