"Untidy Endings" could be a description of many of the Jury books, this one in particular. It's not even close to a complete story, but rather a filler, to be resolved at a later date.

I'm getting a little confused with the setting in place and time. If Jury was a small child during the Battle of Britain, he would be in or near his 70's now. Is the timeline is running slowly, as in Sue Grafton's alphabet series, where Kinsey Milhone is still in the 80's?  Then some things would make sense, but other references would not.  Also, some Americanisms are present that should have been British slang instead.  These faults make for distracting reading. 

Martha Grimes has written from a dog's viewpoint before to good effect, so that anyone who has a dog would be able recognize those past dogs, but Mungo's actions in this book are just a little too much.  And the recurrent cliche of "kid-jep" as Grimes herself classifies it herself in a previous Jury mystery, is becoming truly cliche.

This just wasn't her best
