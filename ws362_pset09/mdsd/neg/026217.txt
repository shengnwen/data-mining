This book has some very good points, especially the chapter about how the church has ignored the use of art (painting and drawing)in worship services.  However, overall the book shows many of the flaws of the emergent church movement.  The book ignores God's call to love him with our MIND as well as our heart and soul.  The book places an emphasis pretty much soley on experience and emotion.  Yes, he does place some importance on thought, however he puts emotion and personal experience on a pedestal above this discipline.  
The author also has a narrow minded view of how various small groups activities such as accountability are done in the church.  In the churches I've worked with and my friends were a part of, they did not have such a small view of spiritual formation.  Although he tries to come off in a humble light, the author simply toots his horn far too often in the book that it cannot be ignored.  
The author also discredits the use of models in ministry.  A model is nothing more than a plan of how something is going to work.  His book is a model...it may be a model for HIS church (like he won't stop saying, expcept without using the word model) and may not work for another...he just doesn't seem to understand what a model is.  Overall:  dissapointing...some good things can be drawn from this, but don't make this book the focus of your ministry
