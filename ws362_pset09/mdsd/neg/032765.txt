I was expecting a &quot;kit&quot; based on the title.  It turned out to be a 210 page paper-back book. The main reason I bought the &quot;kit&quot; was to get sample contracts, but none were included.  He does a decent job  of describing the basic process, and good ideas on marketing. Overall, I'd  look for a better source if you're planning to FSBO your home
