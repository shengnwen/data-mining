I hate to rain on everybody's parade, but I found this book to be a rehash of stuff I've read over and over in other places. There's too many numbers in here. What people need is an attitude about money, not just &quot;save  so much money for so long at 10% interest per year and you'll have so much  saved for retirement at 65, but if you wait until you're 35 to start,  you'll only have this much saved....&quot; (that's not a quote from the  book, but you can place that quote in almost any financial book, and it  will fit just fine). Personally, I thought the Millionaire Next Door was  better and Rich Dad Poor Dad in a leauge of its own. Any book on this  subject will certainly convey &quot;some&quot; information. The problem is  that they are too number oriented. People need to focus on paying  themselves first regularly, having a set savings program and intelligent  investments. This book seems to be more focused on getting rich by  retirement. That's just great, but anybody who saves money over 40+ years  darn well better be rich by retirement or they don't know what they are  doing. On the other hand, I think the authors are realistic in the sense  that this is not get rich quick by any means. If you want to sum it all up,  no matter who you are or what your circumstances are, save money on a  regular and consistent basis, cut up ALL of your credit cards, pay cash for  everything, keep your wants and spending under control and that's about it  really. It's not that hard to get rich. I just wish the book had more  practical information and less technical analysis with all those numbers  and statistics
