                  At a time when many historions and authors are bringing out important re-evaluations of the causes of World War I, there are still large numbers of the same that continue to bolster the accepted,"Official Versions of Who Caused the Great War".
                  Aside from some of the defects mentioned by other reviewers this author presents the German military as operating in a vacuum. That, in fact, the military alliance between England and France, with France also having a military alliance with Russia, all of which was aimed at Germany specifically, had no consequences or dangers to either Germany or Austro-Hungary. That the then massive bank loans of France to Russia had no military application when, according to French documentation, the loans were tendered with the understanding that they would be used to insure the ability of Russias military  to mobilize rapidly against Germany.
             Furthermore, the political and cultural attitudes in all of the European countries had no bearing on the military thinking of all of the militaries involved.
               There are many other better histories available.
