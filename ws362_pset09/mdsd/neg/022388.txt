No doubt Stewart Lee Allen was pleased with the success of "The Devil's Cup", a fine travelogue/meditation on coffee. With this book, it seems he decided to indulge himself a little, which actually turned out to be quite a lot. He attempts to display wit throughout, but for the most part Allen's wit is supercilious and sophomoric, and would to many seem to be the product of a vastly overinflated ego. In fact, "In The Devil's Garden" is laden with inaccuracies in both fact and interpretation. Simultaneously, Allen takes pleasure in virulently anti-Christian prejudices. Time and again he discusses "the Christians" as if retailing a particularly juicy piece of scandalous gossip which instead is really no more than a figment of his ignorance and over-heated literalistic imagination. But, have no fear, the author slanders all religions East and West with equal verve. This purports, after all, to be a book about food, which features in most faith traditions. To add to the horror of it all, his misuse of the English language is beyond belief. About a third of the way through I began to circle the malapropisms as if I were a high school English teacher. Two thirds through I gave up. I only finished this book to make sure it really is as bad as I thought. It was. It is a mercy to literature that "In the Devil's Garden" is out of print. R.I.P. May it never be revived.
