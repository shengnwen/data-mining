If you know much about the Eastern Front, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK! Although its advertising makes it sound like it is a thorough, in depth book on its topic, it is a actually just a shallow grab bag of random facts. A lot of its material is freely available, in greater detail, on the Web. Some of it is available in much greater detail -- Slaughterhouse's section on weapons, for example, is so poor you have to wonder why they bothered to include it.

Your money would be much better spent on something like the Oxford Companion to World War II. The Oxford Companion has a different emphasis that Slaughterhouse, but it is comprehensive, and includes all of the war.

If you don't know much about the Eastern Front, this book may have some value. But, I still recommend the Oxford Companion instead, plus the free material on the Internet
