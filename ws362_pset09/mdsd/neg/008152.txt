The book jacket says that the book's DVD-ROM will work with Xpress DV 3.0 and higher. The .omf video files were compressed at 20:1 using Media Composer and Xpress DV 4.6 does not support the 20:1 resolution, meaning that the sample video files cannot be imported and used in Xpress DV 4.6. This is a shame, because it seems like a good book and this is not really a problem that the author could have foreseen. Unfortunately, most places won't let you return a book after the DVD has been opened, so let this be a warning, FYI. Hopefully the upcoming 3rd edition will fix this problem
