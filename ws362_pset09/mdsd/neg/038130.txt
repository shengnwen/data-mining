I'm not sure what I was expecting but this book read like old articles in Mother Earth News. I don't know where the author lives but the suggestion for businesses have been done to death around here for quite a few years so that leaves you with his "wisdom" such as; don't throw money around or keep a low profile to the government or to neighbors if you are operating a business out of your home...whoa...just slightly obvious well worn ideas. I was hoping for new thinking on finding niches in order to make a living, not suggestions that I take a marginal at best, business collecting pine cones or working on cars in my backyard and not blow my cover by buying a mercedes with cash! Duh! Save your money.
