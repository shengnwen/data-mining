If you enjoyed having the conservative Catholics as the bad guys in The Accidental Pope, the Day of Confession, and Angels and Demons, then this book is for you.  However, if you think that such portrayals completely distort the conservative (that is, the Catholic) point of view, then don't buy this crap.  As with all such books, he never gives the traditionalists' points of view or arguments.  Rather, they are all simplified into power questions and are made heartless--you know, heartless conservatives, like John Paul II.  Sad.  Don't waste your money.
