Perhaps it's unfair of me to rate this book, since I didn't make it to the end.  It was disappointing, since I've liked others of Coover's books.  This one is written in a stream of consciousness style reminiscent of James Joyce/"Ulysses" (which I liked a lot).  Similarly, it also is incredibly literate and erudite, lots of language play which still somehow was mostly just hard and not fun the way language should and can be.  I could appreciate the humor intellectually, but it wasn't really funny.  The subject matter is a cynical take on a dark subject, the Rosenberg executions.  I can certainly understand why its release was so contoversial.  It might help to know more about the period but as someone who came of political age (later) during the Watergate years I know little about Nixon as VP and many of the social references were lost on me
