The book starts off slow and tapers off from there. The plot I think isn't a very exciting place to have a story take place. It is kind of depressing reading about a story that all they talk about is death and how the conditions they live in are so poor. I know that by having the story take place there it gives the story more variables but is depressing. I also really don't find it very interesting when the whole story is about these four people trying to get to a place and every chapter some group of things comes out of the middle of no where. There are so many different kinds of gangs and it is hard to tell who is good and who is bad and who has more power. I like book like that but this did not float my boat. The end of the book it probably the worst ending to any book that I have read. I could think of a couple ways that I could have wrote the end and it would have been better.  I think this is the not read book of the year. But that is only my opinion
