Sounds exciting, but actually, well, boring, mostly because the author  fails to distinguish between two very different claims:  first, that  boredom, the state of mind, didn't exist until recently, and second, that  it wasn't talked about much until recently.  The first claim would be  exciting and bizarre, but the argument at most supports the second
