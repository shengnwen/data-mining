The way this book presents itself, I was hoping it would show the contrasts of Christianity and other world religions/views, or the way the rest of the world views Christianity... but it's just a totally bias opinion of how &quot;Christians&quot; see the rest of the world.  If you are a born again, this book will probably re-inforce your own views, but if you really want an introduction to world religion/views, go out and buy a few books like the &quot;For Dummies&quot; series on religions that will present the whole story
