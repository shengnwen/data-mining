...I am a great Doreen Virtue fan on the whole, but I simply can't help thinking that she is simply regurgitating all the information and thoughts and insights we have heard before, in this pack. For me it is a case of re-packaging what has already been said a million times. The pictures are sweet enough, and very colourful, but I would stick to some of her other cards like the Archangel cards...I feel Doreen has simply thought 
" Hmmm what mystical icon can I put on this new set to re-sell as something new ". I am cynical, but can't help thinking she is laughing all the way up her beautifully tailored sleeve as she checks her bank account
