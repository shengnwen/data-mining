I am a great fan of Mr. Thom's work. I typically scour the shelves for his books.  However I found this one below his usual standards.  I did not get the impression his research was as thorough this time. Towards the end, the  story dragged.  I found myself finishing the book merely to bring it to  closure. I still highly recommend Mr. Thom's other works to friends. But  this book will definitely not be on the by-name list
