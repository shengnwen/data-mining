This is my first Laymon book, and also my last.  

Don't get me wrong - I enjoy gruesome and horrifying stories as long as the stories make some sense.  Without any logic or common sense, though, as well as crappy adolescent-style writing, this is one for the trash pile.  Or you could use the pages for toilet paper if you become desperate.

If you'd like to read a story that seems like it was written by a 12-year old boy, by all means buy this book.  Otherwise, don't waste your money - not even a penny for a used copy
