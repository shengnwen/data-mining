It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.  

Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.

Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories.
The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.

Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.
