This is not a good book.  Its thesis is poorly formed, and the execution is terrible.  The author's views are not well explained, and the discussion shows naivete, arrogance, and a deep ignorance about war, peace, and the middle east.  This book only muddles the complex issues involved.  This reader was quite surprised that a relatively respected press agreed to publish such nonsense
