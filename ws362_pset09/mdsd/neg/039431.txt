I was expecting a book that would give me the latest scholarly thinking on the Black Death and its impact, having been interested in this period of history since High School. As the book is sub-titled "The Black Death and the World it made" by an Emeritus Professor of History et al., I would argue that that expectation was not unrealistic. 

Its superficial, unsubstantiated and repetitive elements have all been documented in other reviews.  In a book light on analysis or insight into the supposed topic of the book I was amazed that he spends five or more pages exploring the theory of Hoyle and Wickramasinghe on plagues coming from space.  He says that in spite of their "impeccable scientific credentials" their theory has been ignored.  Hoyle and Wirckramsinghe are also much quoted by creationists for their belief that there has not been enough time for evolution to work and life has been seeded from space.  Creationists conveniently forget the seeding from space part but use it as evidence that there must have been divine intervention.  These two gentlemen are renowned astrophysicists and astronomers but not to my knowledge epidemiologists or biologists, which is maybe why the theory doesn't get quoted much by experts in those disciplines.  His second foray into the scientific world "Heritage of the African Rifts" is frankly bizarre and again a huge diversion from the supposed topic of the book.

There are a few good points in the book; the potential role of anthrax, the importance of not judging everything from our perspective, some of the insights into the individuals mentioned - but overall I'm afraid the professor, emeritus or not,  gets an "F" for this piece of work
