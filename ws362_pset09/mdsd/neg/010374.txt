I am a record collector with more than 30 years of addiction. 
I enjoyed enormously Michael Ochs "1000 Record Covers" issued by Taschen in 1994.  And afterwords I bought and reasonably enjoyed other record cover reference books such as One Hundred Album Covers by Storm Thorgerson & Aubrey Powell issued by DK and others.
Well learning about such a luxury edition as what this one seemed at a first glance, I thougt that I shall have a valuable addition to my library...
but I was badly mistaken. 
This is the worst collection of "best" covers I ever came accross in my life. 
The Authors begin with the Fiftes: Frank Sinatra's banalities that will not catch the eye even of a Sinatra's dedicated fan.  Then come other albums full of b/w graffities. A whole page is dedicated to the White Album with a ridiculously high issue number (White Album means logically a white page). Just for a laugh - there is another completely red page with another "highly conceptual" cover, that would merit only a verbal mentioning. The only passable covers in the book are either in bad printing quality or poor(creased and soiled) cover quality. Apart from that these staple famous cover art pictures are so banal that a 10-years old child is already tired of looking at them.
I wonder why the Authors made such an expensive and useless book. 
Well I understand that the tastes differ, but ... not to this point. 
My advice to any serious collector and cover art fetishist: leave this book to the Remainders.
It is a pity there are no 0 stars in this scale, but I should perheaps leave 1 star because the Authors are at least interested in cover art: good for them.
