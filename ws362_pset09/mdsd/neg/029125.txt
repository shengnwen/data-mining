Hanan Al-Shyakh's "Story of Zahra" is a bit muddled, and tries to be a feminist book, but it only manages to make Zahra look like a perpetual victim in an misogynist part of the world.  She flees her domineering, nasty father in Lebanon from her uncle that is conflicted about his feelings for his niece.  Then to escape her uncle, she marries a man whom she'll never love.  Then she flees to a war-torn Beiruit, and falls in love with a sniper.  Love, violence and death then ensue.  Frankly, I don't see why Arab nations had any fuss over this; it's not good enough to be subversive enough
