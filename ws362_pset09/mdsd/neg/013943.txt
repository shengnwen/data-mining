I was disappointed in this book. The photos of the altered patterns are sometimes frustratingly small, and often it is not clear exactly what aleration was done to the pattern piece. In addition, some of the fitting advice is not very good. For example, if you have a wide base of neck, simply making the collar circumference larger will not improve the fit, because you do not have a thick neck--only the base of the neck needs to be accomodated. This book would be suitable for beginning sewists, but it will not satisfy people with advanced sewing and fitting skills
