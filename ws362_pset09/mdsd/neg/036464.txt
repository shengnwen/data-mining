I have read many poker books, and now that I'm half way through with this one, I can honestly say that this is one of the worst. 

The psychology is about as deep as the cover. The author presumes you have no skill or ability - like him he adds - and offers a rigid mechanical rating system that is completely incompatible with today's game, (particularly the internet games). 

The end of this book is filled with doomsday predictions for those who want to make a living playing. He insists that the pro's make less money than average doctors or lawyers. Unfortunately, his findings are based on a study that was conducted in the 70's. This book may have been published in 2000 initially, but it seems like it was written in the 80's. Perhaps this is a nice gift for someone who already has every other poker book
