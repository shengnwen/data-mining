It's hard to have much confidence in a book that is so obviously slanted toward a particular agenda.  For example, in the discussion of tracking, Spring cites one study that found "few benefits" of tracking, but makes no mention of other studies that found benefits to students of various levels (Loveless, 1999; Epstein & MacIver, 1992).  This is political correctness with a vengeance, and I would not rely on this biased and polemical book to become informed about the issues
