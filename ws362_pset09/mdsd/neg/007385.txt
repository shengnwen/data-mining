This book is quite a simple (and sometimes unusefull) introduction to design/build Speaker System.
Design principles are old and it does not cover new trends such as implementation of spice models and simulation.
Maybe only source code (written in BASIC for DOS!) can be interesting for an absolute beginner, ... eventhough it's cheap, save your money
