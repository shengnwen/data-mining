It is truly sad that a scholar of the alleged caliber of James Robinson has so transparently rushed into print with such a volume.The whole tenor of his work smacks of bitterness that he was excluded from the detailed and meticulous restoration,translation and analysis of the recently discovered Gospel of Judas Iscariot that is so well described in Herb Krosney's "The Lost Gospel" (Published by National Geographic).

This work does him and his reputation no justice whatsoever and readers would be well advised to buy the National Geographic Volumes if they want to get the full story of this extraordinary find.
