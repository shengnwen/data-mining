Nothing but bigoted propaganda. For example, it ignores the fact that the US sponsored and supported islamic extremism and provided it with ammunition against moderate islamists in order to fit its imperialist agenda of military control of strategic locations in the middle east and south africa. It also ignores US atrocities  in iraq and palestine that fuel such extremism and radicalizes islamists. The book lays all the blame on islamists while making america look like an "innocent victim"
