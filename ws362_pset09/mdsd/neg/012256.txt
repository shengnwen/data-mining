After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.  

Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?

It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.    

Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial
