A wasted effort from one on the most perceptive minds alive. He dropped his past standards on this book.  Only the gems of wisdom about human nature gives it value.  An unknown author would have had this book rejected, or at least criticized.

I agree with the following observations taken from other reviewers:

"The story was all over the place and the ending far from satisfying."

"The first hundred or so pages move at a glacial pace, and the author's disjointed manner of storytelling soon becomes confusing and annoying."

"Far too much of the book took place in flashback... vacillating from vague self-pity to vague longing to vague regret and back... Of the three pivotal characters, two are presented almost entirely in flashback."

"Too dense and slow moving... even though the language is always wondrous."

"...novel seems dark and pointless."

"numbing dive into the depths of one man's self-absorption left me gasping for air."

If you are new to Le Carre, read his earlier works first or you may never read them after this work
