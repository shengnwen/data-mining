I am a fan of Kary Odiatu as a competitor and fitness model in many magazines.  I bought this book on a recommendation of an acquaintaince as well as the fact Ms. Odiatu and her husband were the authors.  As a personal trainer, I try to find books that would be well suited for my clients.  

I was up to page 85 wondering when anything of real value beyond a lot of rah-rah was going to appear.  Sadly, that did not happen.  Even the chapters that were designed to enlighten about shopping and training, were basically hollow.  

I was gravely disappointed in this book and even find it quite perfunctory and remedial for even a beginner to the lifestyle. 

While I do appreciate the emotional support and 'You can achieve it' sentiment -- it was most repetitive and truly took away pages and pages from what could have been a wonderful book if it ever got past the cheerleading and proceeded deeper into fitness.

I strongly recommend Christine Lydon's book 'Look Hot, Live Long'; Beth Horn's book "The Natural Way"; or Bodyfitness for Women: Your Way to Physical Perfection, written by Gerard Thorne and Phil Embleto
