Needleman had some interesting stories but I didn't find the book all the helpful or entertaining.  I had to read it for class and the only good part about the assignment was the class discussions, most of which had little to do with the actual book.  I thought it had potential and I was excited about reading this book but ended up being dissappointed.  It is a VERY easy book to read and you can fly through the pages.  I ended up reading a lot and not really understanding or getting anything from what I just read.
