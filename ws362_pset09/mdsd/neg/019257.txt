This book is a waste of money! I am currently an under-grad looking for some tutorial help for my Quantum course and purchased the book without reviewing Amazon's feedback reviews. Wish I would have done so before I bought it. Although this book provides some example questions with solutions, they are few. And the chapter problems don't have any answers to examine. This author or publisher needs to re-think their approach
