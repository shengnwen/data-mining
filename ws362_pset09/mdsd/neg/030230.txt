Don't fall victim to the falsely positively rated reviews. Though somewhat comprehensive, the transcriptions featured in this anthology are blatantly inaccurate and do not directly reflect Ms.Mitchell's beautiful songwriting capabilities. River, my favorite, is horribly off, using a major C chord for the beginning piano solo. Do not bother purchasing, unless you want to rip your ears off each time you attempt playing these transcribed "versions"
