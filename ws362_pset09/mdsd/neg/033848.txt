I read this book yesterday and found it disturbing.  I have no issue with religion, but I seriously question George W. Bush's legitimacy as a leader let alone a spiritual one.  This book is not about spirit, but about religion and only one side of religion.  The author tries to paint a picture of a just and moral character in the context of near Christian fundamentalism.
I have no problem with that, except the assertion that it is the way and not a way amoung other ways.  It is hard for me to vision George W. Bush, as much more than someone born with an enormous silver spoon with someone always available to show him the way. If you are skeptic of fundamentalism and its message, stay away from this book.
