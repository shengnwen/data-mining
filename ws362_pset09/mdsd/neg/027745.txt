While I enjoyed the other books of the series, I found this title to be lacking.
Almost every aspect of the story seemed rushed, or not worthy of being written.  

Origins that dont go deep enough to truly explain the charactors, storys that mearly show an event in the charactors lives, or storys that are pretty much exatcly as you would expect them to be without need for explanation (arseface).

I regret purchasing the titl
