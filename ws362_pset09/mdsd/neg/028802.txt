this book is a huge disappointment. i expected more for my money . i am ready to redo my living room so i bought this book. i don't know the author, but the topic was what i was looking for. the book doesn't help me much. it's a scrapbook of living room photos &amp; many of those don't look like the way people really live. and there isn't much real help in planning your own room
