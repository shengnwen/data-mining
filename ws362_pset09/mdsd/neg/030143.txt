Too many numbers without enough explanation. Shandler seems to assume that you have been reading his books for years and have a thorough understanding of all of his metrics.

However, I do believe that the approach is sound. Including more commentary on players would be useful.

The primary advantage to this book is that it has one of the earliest release dates for books that discusses the coming season. Without much competition, what else are you going to read in the cold of winter?

I doubt if I will buy it again next year
