I went to visit 6 Flags Marine World in Vallejo, CA. When I arrived there I found to my surprise that it was closed for no special reason. The opening times in the book are wrong! Then I decided to visit Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. I was late for the last boat at 2:15 PM. In the book says the last one is at 2:45 PM... Wrong again!! Now, I have a book but I still have to call to ask and confirm any move I do.  If it is not possible to be accurate with the opening/closing times, it is better not to say anything about them
