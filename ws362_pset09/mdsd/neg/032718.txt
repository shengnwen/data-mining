Misled by its title, I was expecting that this book was about making rustic furniture.
However only the last third of the book is about this.
Two thirds of the books (100 p.) consists in  a gallery of pictures (with some comments), mostly chairs. Their style is not modern, but not traditional either. I find most to be weird or snob. Actually many look postmodern to me (they may not all be from the author, but from his friends -many being also from New York City like him). These may be a source of inspiration for some, but definitely not what I am looking for.

And that last third of the book, about making things is also quite a deception in itself. It is a collection of shallow articles by other authors, who show projects they make,   with a very vague and general talk about the technique they use. One uses tenons and mortises (anyone knowing a bit about conventional woodworking will not learn anything here), and worse, others use nails and even bolts (the last one). I really learned nothing from this. In addition, this is all about dry wood. 

I recommend instead Les Smith's Build your own Log Furniture (only a little bit of technique, for dry softwood, but at least something...), and much more a book where you really can learn many things: Drew Langsner's Green Woodworking
