his didn't cut it. some of the stories were of the kind where the military are challenged by pulpish creatures. i hate those stories. there is a story by Smith here, not really good horror, but had suspence. in addition there is a good story by Rainey. but the rest, no. Some, like Piccirrilli, get almost interesting,  but in the end, you wonder why you read them
