This book consists of theses, written by researchers in various fields, on various themes such as hyperreality, fashion, capitalism, postmodernism, and feminism. Therefore, I think that there are some theses in which  BaudrillardÅfs thoughts are not understood at all. The constitution of this  book is not so good because each researcher mention freely to various  notions without big theme that combines each thesis. It is disappointing  that discussions on Baudrillard do not develop between each thesis. If each  thesis were complementary to each other, this book would be more  interesting and more controversial
