I am an animal lover and owner of three dogs. I also practice alternative medecine and my dogs are in my office with me. I received this book for my birthday and do not know what to say to the woman who gave it to me.   I found it boring, repetitive and full of &quot;aren't I wonderful&quot; stories about the poor author struggling through vet school, tortuing animals and gee whiz not liking it, then, golly, figuring he was going to darn well do something about it.  OK, he went to acupuncture school before a lot of others, but he is so pro acupuncture I find it tedious.  He mentions other alternative therapies only briefly, and I could tell he was not well versed in them.  He goes on and on ad infinitum about how other methods &quot;work well in conjuntion with regular veterinary care&quot;.  Well, isn't that rocket science?  A poorly written, egocentric story about a vet and his &quot;magic dog&quot;.  Give me a break
