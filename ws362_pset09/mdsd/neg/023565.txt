The hardcover edition of this dictionary is awful. The binding is originally constructed, with tight pages that cracked my edition beyond repair on the second day.

The dictionary itself is exceptionally good, making for easy reference. A paperback edition would be ideal.

This dictionary is also mediocre for referencing technical terms
