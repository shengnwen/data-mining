Received late due to poor delivery service. I ordered this Christmas gift on 2 Dec 06. It was to be delivered by DHL. Using the item tracking number, I found it was supposedly delivered on 12 Dec 06. I received it on 27 Dec 06, after having to buy a replacement gift. Where it was all that time, who knows? I must say that Amazon was very good about refunding my order total. I would prefer UPS from now on!
