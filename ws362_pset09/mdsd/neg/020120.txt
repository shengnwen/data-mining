I found this book (I listened to the audio version) to be a major disappointment. The tips offered by Carnegie may have appeared insightful and provocative to assembly line supervisors back in the 1930s, but in the more enlightened 21st century a lot of his "good advice" comes across as irritatingly simplistic and sometimes even downright condescending and offensive. It's so easy and straightforward: Be nice to people, remember their first names, always be positive and you will instantly be liked by everyone. Overly obvious and trite - hardly the kind of stuff that would find its way into today's Harvard Business Review. Adding to the sense of irritation is the voice of the reader who tries to sound upbeat and optimistic, giving the whole performance the hollow feel of amateurish propaganda better suited to "Pleasantville" than to "Wall Street". 

For more insightful, relevant and up-to-date advice, I recommend "How to become CEO" by Jeffrey J. Fox
