I have never read a book so boring in my life!  I read Erotique Noir, and  there were good poems here and there.  I was hoping Dark Eros would have  filled the gaps that were left by Erotique Noir, but the poems and writings  just got more and more boring.  There were VERY few writings I would have  even considered to be even remotley called erotica.  I am very dissapointed  in this effort.  Its seems who ever put it together has lost the passion we  feel as a pepole
