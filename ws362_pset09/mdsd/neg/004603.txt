I really tried to enjoy this book but just couldn't manage to like it by the last page. This story tried to explore the different aspects of family and self, all through the magical Lazelle family. I found it to be simple minded and rambling. I'm not even sure the author was 100% where she was going in this book. 

The main character, Gypsum, receives her powers later in life than her family. She was previously cast as the "normal" one, alienated for her differences but attached to her family through tradition and magic. Her relationships with her family are forced and just seem wierd at times. Not once does the author explain how this family fits in with society. Most of the story runs like this: "I almost killed my aunt through cursing a computer that took over our minds. I need a cup of coffee" The author gets lost more than once in direction and the middle of the book is just another magical mistake after another where a point is made then skipped over. 

Everything is so strained and just plain wierd that I couldn't get into it. There is no personality in any of the characters. If it weren't for the adult situations and language I would have pegged this as a young adult novel. I think it almost was supposed to be until 3/4 of the way through the book where all of a sudden a lot of the characters are swearing and there is a slight homosexual relationship explored. 

I gave it two stars for some interesting parts of the book that kept me from throwing it away and the fact that there is some effort to include statements about family ties. Blah.
