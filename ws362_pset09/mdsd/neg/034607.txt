Bruce Cole has a well-deserved reputation for high quality scholarship and exposition. This book is an excellent synthesis of current knowledge about the role of the artist in society, his materials, and the types of work he might create.

Sadly, the illustrations accompanying the text are worse than any I've ever seen. They're of unbelievably low quality. If you took a low-quality scanner from the mid-90's, kept it on the 'text' setting instead of 'graphics', you would still get better images than the mess that's in this text. It's more like a fourth-generation mimeograph. 

They are basically unusable. And that is unacceptable in an art history text. There is no grayscale - just large blurred black blobs. It's as if a creeping fungus made a home in the book, and refused to be dislodged. The fact that this book is in print as such is an insult. With even pedestrian-quality greyscale images, this would be a fantastic text
