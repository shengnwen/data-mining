I saw this book in the book store the other night and almost bought it.  Norman Jewison was on the TCM documentary of Steve McQueen, seemed like a nice guy with some fascinating stories, and I thought it would be interesting to read about his career and all the celebrities he has worked with.

I thumbed through the book, reading bits and pieces.  On the back cover was a praising review from Gore Vidal - Strike 1.  Below that was a praising review from Cher - Strike 2.  Inside was a picture of Jewison with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas - Strike 3.  Not to mention the book states John Wayne supposedly called Jewison a "pinko Canadian."  Also not to mention a few other things I found offensive.  I put the book back on the shelf, kept looking and wound up buying "Capote," about the life of Truman Capote.  He was a Southerner, a writer, hob-nobbed with the rich and famous, and on the back book cover it said he had a feud with Gore Vidal.  Home run.
