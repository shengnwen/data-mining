Geisler stresses that we must have an objective test for the truth of a world-view. He posits the test of undeniability and unaffirmability. Namely, whatever is undeniable is true, and whatever is unaffirmable is false. 

He then says that he'll show that every world-view except Theism is unaffirmable, and that Theism is the only affirmable and undeniable world-view. 

Then Geisler discards the test in the very next chapter when he deals with Deism! He never shows how Deism is unaffirmable, but only that it's "inadequate" (p 171). 

He criticizes Deism as inconsistent for believing that God doesn't intervene in the world by saying that once the Deist accepts Creation he must also accept the possibility of other miracles. Even if this is granted, this doesn't automatically mean that miracles happen! The possible does not equal the actual Mr. Geisler!

He also claims that "if God was concerned enough about man to create him, it would seem to follow that he would be concerned enough to intervene on his behalf." Thank you for your opinion Mr. Geisler, but why don't you show instead how the position is "unaffirmable" as you promised? 

The first section of the book is worth the read but I give it 1 star because it completely failed to meet it's objective of showing all non-theisms unaffirmable and theism as undeniable.
