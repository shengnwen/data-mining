Having not seen the orginal Rudolph TV show in a very long time I forgot what the story line was... remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child. There are a couple of scary illustrations in this book. My 3 year old was in love with the Rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with Rudolph again because he said he "didn't like the scary snowman".  Yes, I know it's a classic, but be warned
