This book is most appropriate for someone who has just entered the workforce.  Many of the lessons regarding behavior in the professional world are useful, but not profound.  I was  dissapointed in the section of the book devoted to personal matters.  In general, I would not recommend to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of basic personal financial skills.
