The only cool thing about this book is the way its set up. It has the cast at the begining with all the characters, and it says "The Curtain Opens..." at the begining of the book, ad "The Curtain Closes..." at the end. Its about a boy named Leo who reads his father's autobiography his Dad wrote when his Dad was thirteen. When he finds out his dad had a sister he never heard about, he tries to figure out what happened. He's in a play, and the whole script of the play is at the end of the book. He feels invisable with all his brothers and sisters, and he imagines a lot, which gets him the name "Fog Boy." I really don't understand what people see in this book. There is a lack of feeling from Leo. He doesn't really say much in the book, and he doesn't replay things in his mind like he's supposed to. Instead, he imagiens what he wished would've happened. I was very disapointed with this. I expected a great book. All in all, this was a 2 and a half star book
