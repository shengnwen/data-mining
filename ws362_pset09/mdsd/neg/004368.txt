I am a HUGE Donna Karan fan and could not wait for this book to be releases, but I was extremely disappointed when I recieved it.  The first few pages are an interview with Karan.  Every question asked is answered in her press release and is talked about in  just about every magazine article ever written about her.  The other 65 or 70 pages are old pictures of her clothes.  Most of the pictures are old ads and if you follow her collections, you have already seen them.  My advise is to call Patti Cohen's office and ask for a press release or to start reading magazine articles about Karan.  It is a lot less expensive and is more informative
