Even though GWB is not a perfect person, at least GOP is better than Democrat and I will tell you why. America is strong because this country was founded by the acknowledgement of God. God is love, that's why freedom and liberty are given in this country from the very beginning. The Dems never care about God, that's why they legalize gay marriage, abortion, fetus killing and event those who have broken the law such as those the illegal immigrants. 

All people in the world are created equal in front of God, that's why all people should have the same right to live, to speak and to listen. However, people should be wise in reflecting their rights and freedom. There is "unwritten" law even in the Bible that limits people's rights. God gives freedom to people but yet people have to follow His rules. Freedom doesn't mean that people have an absolute right to get whatever they want. Believe me, America will be collapse if every one only think about their rights of freedom and liberty. 

Men can't always be nice to other people because such men will be taken for granted by other people, and so is a country. America can't always be nice to those countries that are so hypocrite, barbarians, dictators, tyrants and those who always extort our country such as Iran and North Korea, including Iraq before it was toppled. Democrat is too weak to face those barbarians. We CANNOT be too weak to face those evil countries
