I couldn't understand the hype over this book.  This was one of those books that gets good press and lands on a couple lists of best book of the year but for me, I thought it was rather simple.  I think my biggest disconnect was my lack of knowledge of the Jewish culture.  I honestly feel that if I was more aware of some of the family and cultural quirks, I would have enjoyed it much more
