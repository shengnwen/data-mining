I've owned this cookbook for years.  A well-meaning relative gave it to me when I first became a vegetarian 16 years ago, and it's a good thing that I didn't start to try recipes from this book early on, because I would have given up on vegetarianism.  There are some decent bread recipes here, but the remainder are almost uniformly terrible.  Nutritious, perhaps, but also tasteless without a seeming thought to presentation or texture.  This book represents the worst of early vegetarian cooking in America, and I have yet to prepare a single recipe from this book that I found to be truly appetizing, or that I would (heaven forbid) serve to guests.  I didn't sell my copy because I wouldn't inflict this sort of thing on an unsuspecting victim - I recycled my copy
