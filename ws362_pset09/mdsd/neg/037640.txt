Sure Mr Beevor has done lots of research but his book fails in many areas - poor and limited maps, being not clear whether he is referring to Axis or Allied units, very poor character establishment of all leading figures with the exception of a very average attempt at Gen. Paulus, chronologically all over the shop, very limited attention to civilians.
Yes, very interesting but not at all satisfying for either a military historian or anyone interested in the history. Looks like a Grade C attempt at history by an earnest student of popular journalism. I won't bother with "Berlin"
