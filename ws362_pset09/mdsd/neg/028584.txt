I was going to buy this book because it was so highly recommended by Dr. Phil among others. When I checked the reviews at amazon books I decided it would be safer to check it out at my local library and I have to say THANKS FOR THE WARNING. This book was so bad I wanted to throw up. Who would raise their kids like this. Why would you want to make food a control issue and teach your kids animals are disposable. Whats up with the spanking. Why would you beat your own kids! Honestly, it might work but so would hitting them over the head with a 2X4. We are their parents, surely we can do better than that!
