I personally feel that the  the book is small, being rightly meant to be carried by residents in wards, but cramped with borrowed information which exceeds the capacity of the book. A lot of it feature in other standard texts and nothing is new.The algorithms too are borrowed. Information on antibiotic usage and common tropical disorders in detail are lacking. Unnecessary publicity is being given to the book and The Osler Medical Handbook by Cheng and Zaas is far superior to this in all aspects. Another important aspect is that students reading the book do not read standard texts and are clearly at a disadvantage while appearing in examinations.The book needs to be rewritten in another format to be successful.
