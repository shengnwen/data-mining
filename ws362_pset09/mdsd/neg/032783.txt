I always like to give new authors a chance, so I read &quot;When Death Comes Stealing&quot; hoping for a good mystery.  What I got were 2 characters that I liked a lot, Tamara and Jamal, but very little actual  detection from a supposed private eye.  Try Marcia Muller or Sue Grafton if  you want good mystery and detection from a female writer. I will probably  not read another of Wesley's books.  I love mysteries, and mysteries  without plot are no good
