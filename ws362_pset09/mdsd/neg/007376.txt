I wanted to read this book as lighthearted summer fun.  Instead, I found a rather dreary tale of some seriously mixed up people.  Most infuriating was the character of Tony, possibly the most arrogant, pompous, self-righteous ass who has ever graced modern literature.  And the author condones him and his behavior!  He's right, don't you see?  He's a macho guy, the omni present voice of reason and knowing what's right for everyone.  The other infuriating part of this novel is the author's treatment of Faye, the heroine.  Because she's &quot;fiesty, independent and outspoken&quot;, she is repeatedly referred to as &quot;difficult to HANDLE&quot; and &quot;a real handful&quot;.  Excuse me, but is Ms. Moore saying that women need to be &quot;handled&quot;?  Apparently so, since we're told that Faye has really &quot;met her match&quot; in this Tony loser.  I think that a man with those same characteristics would be praised as a real go-getter, aggressive and accomplished.  Why the author has strong-willed Faye succumb to Tony's blackmail and bullying is WAY beyond me.  And the way the novel ended?  COME ON!  She has made the smart, strong willed man the hero (though she tries to discuss his &quot;faults&quot; to make things appear even), and the woman very introspective and sorry for the way she is... and trying ever so hard to change.  If any man tried to bully and blackmail any smart woman into ruining her own wedding day, I'm pretty sure she'd tell him to shove it far, far up where the sun don't shine - and I can't believe that Faye didn't. A novel for the 21st century?  I don't think so.  If you love chick-lit, read the Shopaholic books or the Nanny Diaries; at least they're well written and FUNNY
