I have read all of the books up until this one, and this one is definitely the worst so far.  In fact, it makes me wonder whether I will continue to read the series.

The book is misnamed.  The Ionian mission is only the last fourth of the book.  The first three-fourths is a very boring description of two battles that came close to happening but never did.

The Ionian mission itself is fairly confusing with all of the personal names and place names bandied about.  Jack Aubrey, as in most of the other books, is burdened with an extremely difficult mission.  He must decide who to support in some kind of three-way civil war.  He makes the wrong choice, but then is called away to fight another party who has seized some British vessels.  Talk about deus ex machina!

There is nothing of much interest that happens in this book.  Stephen Maturin doesn't really do anything interesting in the espionage line, and Professor Graham is a bore.  The final battle scene is as predictable as most of the others--Jack Aubrey wins against all odds because he is a good captain.  I recommend skipping this one if you are reading through the series.  I would bet that Patrick O'Brian did not spend very much time writing this.  In fact, it seemed like bits and pieces patched together to form a "novel.
