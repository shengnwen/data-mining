Wow I was sadly disappointed with this book.  I was hoping Bujold would follow The Curse of Chailon with a better all around effort but instead we get a convoluted, slow-moving fantasy story which didn't payoff by its finale.  The main character is an empowered 40-year young beauty who is faced with many life-threatening problems but she wasn't interesting enough to drive the story.  The other characters were nothing to write home about and the plot was slow compared to other Bujold works.  To top it off, the interesting theology and environment was underdeveloped.

I was surprised to see that this won both the Hugo and Nebula for best science fiction/fantasy of the year but looking at the competition it seems as if this was a particularly poor field.  I really had to use all my reserve will power to get to the end.

I think Bujold should retire this universe and I'm interested to see where she goes from here.  I won't be the follow up "The Hollowed Hunt" but I am curious to see what the new Sharing Knife series will bring to the table as a proclaimed "romantic fantasy".  Hopefully it's better than this.

Bottom Line:  Like it's predecessor, this book is adored by many.  I'm really not sure why..
