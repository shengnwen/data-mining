As other reviewers have mentioned, the photos are grainy. very grainy. However, left unmentioned was something even more troubling - many of the photos have been digitally cropped in photoshop or some such program. this was done presumably to save ink by not printing backgrounds. The cropping was done extremely poorly and amateurishly - there are toes that come to points, feet that look like blocks, all sorts of bizarre and unnatural concavities. a real hatchet job. the end result looks like someone took a pair of scissors and crudely snipped photos from a magazine. this sort of problem is particularly distressing in a book intended for artists as the accurate depiction of the outer contour of a form is vital for drawing. 
On another note, the models are not actually that thin. more average. This would have been a useful book, if not for the botched photos. An older edition would likely be satisfactory.
