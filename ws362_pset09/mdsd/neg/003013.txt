The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World for Grown-Ups is a decent idea but fails to provide much value.  It's far too short to be a comprehensive guide, yet it fails to offer much content that is both unique and useful enough to justify its price.  If you were to buy the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World, you will get a book that dwarfs this one in size and usefulness.  Quite frankly, nearly all of the information presented here is available in the main volume but the reverse is certainly not true.  This book can only scratch the surface compared to the full guide.  Even though I love the Unofficial Guide series, I can't recommend this one
