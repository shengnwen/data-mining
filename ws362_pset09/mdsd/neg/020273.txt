This book is not very pleasing.  The pictures are done in that "insane, stressed, spattered watercolour" style akin to the disturbing psycho comics out today.  The book is disguised as an alphabet book, but it does not have a good rhyme to it - and the pictures are harsh and "messy".  Finally, the fly who the child begins to identify with gets squashed in the end.  Not the kind of book I want to read to my son.  There are better books out there for the money
