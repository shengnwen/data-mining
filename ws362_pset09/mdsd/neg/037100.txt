A real disappointment. The characters lacked any depth, the murder/mystery plot was stale as corkboard, and the dialogue felt very contrived.

The author's first book was fantastic, very visceral and real. "Welcome to Yesterday" seemed pretty empty in comparison. Wonder what happened between then and now. Reads like a totally different writer
