This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative
