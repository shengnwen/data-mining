"Micah" was a big disappointment to me.  Unfortunately, in this book, Hamilton has proved that, yes, she can write straight porn!  The story line is minimal and undeveloped.  If sex is the reason you read the Anita Blake series, then go ahead-- you'll love it.  I felt nothing but disgust(with myself-- I read it to the end looking for some redeeming feature.  Alas.)
