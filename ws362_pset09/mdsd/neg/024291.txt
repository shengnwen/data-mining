I'm a Christian, but found this book too religiously pushy and lacking in the info I needed to help a troubled teen who is longing for an absent father.  It had some good info, but I found the idea of telling a teen that God was the only Father she needed, to be of little help.  Yes, we all need God, and especially when faced with life's hardships, but her longing for her father isn't going to be satisfied with that knowledge alone.  If a girl has never had a father in her life, it's certainly difficult for her to envision a heavenly Father in the same concept that I do because I was blessed with a wonderful earthly father.  I didn't finish it, and read Longing for Dad: Father Loss and It's Impact which had much better info on the subject
