The premise of this book is so obvious a high school student could have written it.  That said, a high school student might have done a better job of exploring utopian and dystopian literature over the last 200 years.  "The Hidden Luddite Tradition"?  There's nothing hidden about Fox's examples.  Emerson and Thoreau were secretly  Luddites?  Pray tell.  French Impressionists liked nature more than the machine?  Fascinating!  The Romantics were secretly Luddites?!?!  Welcome home, Sherlock Holmes!  Blah, blah, blah.  Fox adds nothing to the debate on the role of technology resistance with this book.  The writing is pedantic, trite, and predictable (if your into Dan Brown).  Many of the sources she sites are books out-of-print, for over 100 years!  Just try challenging that opinion!
(I realize I'm using lots of exclamation marks, but this book really let me down.  I was expecting a cogent articulation of anti-technological groups and movements, but instead got "Luddites in the Arts for Dummies".)
