I read this book with my 2nd grade daughter (assigned book through the school counselor).  In our household, we don't encourage the word hate; I prefer I'm angry at or I dislike...  The book uses the word hate frequently, and the little girl in the story talks of wanting to die rather that talk to her friend about their problem.  Neither of us liked this story.  I feel the language is inappropriate for the age group
