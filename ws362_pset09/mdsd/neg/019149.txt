Halfway through this book I had an incredible urge to hurl it at the wall.  But I paid for it, so I forced myself to finish it.  I was sorry that I forced myself.  It was depressing.  I don't understand how people can rave about this book.  A history and geography lesson of Istanbul would have been much more interesting.  Pamuk abandoned the usual formula of entertaining the reader, instead creating some sort of literary experiment.  I hated it.  Don't buy it
