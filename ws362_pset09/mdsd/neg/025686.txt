I don't for a second believe that Burroughs is telling the truth about his life -- but I gobbled up his other books anyway.  He's funny and there's something endearing about the way he writes -- yes he's gay, and yes that necessarily "colors" his worldview -- but talking about a job you hate, a family you loathe, and a partner who amazingly tolerates you are necessarily universal.

That said, he lapses here.  This isn't as approachable a book and the narrator is isn't so much funny as he is unlikeable.  By turns smug and arrogant, too much of this feels self-indulgent.  Chafingly, distractingly so
