This book reads, word for word, like a translation done in the late 1800's by Benjamin Jowett available in two books from Barnes & Noble's classics press.  It's cheaper and the notes are better not to mention the paragraphs are numbered for reference unlike this book.  Those numbers are needed if your are to attend lectures
