I have never read such bull**** in my life.  As an educator with her recent Masters in Education, I debunk Greene's theories.  I suggest reading actual research done by Phd's and educators such as: A.R. Sadovnik; H. Kohl; R.P. McDermott; J. Bettie, M.A. Gibson; M. Polluck; Fine, Weis, & Powell; R. Rist; J. O'Neil .....to name a few.    When Jay Greene has read from all of the experts above, spent a few years in schools doing the work of an innovative, caring, open-minded teacher, and interviewed students from underpriviledged back grounds, then he can write a book about schools. Our students are not sick patients and our schools are not hospitals, yet Greene sticks to this metaphor in order to make his reader's think that education is something as simple as a broken toy.  In fact, education is about teaching our children to become critical thinkers: something Greene does not want his readers to do.
