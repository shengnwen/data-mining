Found the book in the used section, was quite surprised at the unremitting whitewash of anti-RVN forces, but at least the dated Marxist terminology was quite entertaining to parse. Uncountable amount of opinion stated as  fact, with very thin references. If you're looking for a black &amp; white  account of the conflict, this one's pretty good
