Heron's experiences are entertaining. She writes with humor and with  honesty.  However, her writing is somewhat choppy and even slow in places.   I felt disappointed at the end of this book, somehow let down by her lack  of 'depth' and insight into the suffering that she witnessed daily.  Her  clinical evaluations and uplifting sense of humor were a treat, but  spiritual and psychological observations were not easily found in this  work
