There are three main reasons to why I did not enjoy this trilogy.  First, the story and overall flavor is a bit juvenile.  The first story in the trilogy is decent, but the latter two were simple and uninteresting.  Second, the main character of these stories is incredibly annoying.  A know-it-all, the book repeatedly showed how great the main character was in stark contrast to the rest of the characters who are portrayed as stupid, and well below the greatness of the main character.  Third, several things bothered me with the writing style of the books.  The author used a lot of words and phrases over and over again.  "Jason shuddered" must have been used at least two dozen times, trying to show how much smarter Jason was than the other characters.  Also, the second book tries to get philosophical and really does a poor job.  The author attempts to promote moral relativism, but does so in an overly obvious dialogue between two characters.  I appreciate philosophy in narrative, but it must be done well like CS Lewis and Arthur Clarke.  All this to say that the book is a disappointment, there are much better science fiction books out there to read
