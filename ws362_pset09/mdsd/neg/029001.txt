I guess I just don't get the whole &quot;Sheep&quot; phenomenon.  My child received three sheep books from an aunt who thought they were hysterical.  I don't get it.  I didn't find them to be cute or clever at all.  In fact, I thought they were incredibly stupid and a complete waste of time.  My son wasn't impressed either
