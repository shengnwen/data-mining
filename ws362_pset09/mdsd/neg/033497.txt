When REA (Research & Education Association) released its initial version of GRE LITERATURE IN ENGLISH in 1989, I bought it to prepare myself for that test.  I was not particularly impressed with the organization or the lack of suggestion as to how to best make use of the material presented. Still, authors Beard, Kennedy, Liftig, and Malek included six full length exams with explanations.  That was 230 x 6 or 1,380 test prep questions. I took the test and scored middlingly.  Years later, I learned to "psyche" out the test and was surprised to discover a new and supposedly updated version.  In this newer version, Malek cuts down the number of tests from 6 to 3. Nearly every one of the regurgitated questions is a reprint from nearly 15 years ago, thus ensuring that this text does not reflect any of the major changes in test content during that time. What Malek does try is to emulate the far more successful paradign put out by the Princeton Review's CRACKING THE GRE LITERATURE by codifying the vast array of western literature: genres, timelines, book and author lists, literary terms, schools of literary criticism, etc. The problem is that Malek did not do half as thorough a job as the Princeton Review did. Malek does little more than to use an overly broad brush to skim a distressingly long list of required readings without giving any hint as how to best do that. True, neither did the Princeton Review, but at least the latter presented a methodology that was reasonable. This is not to say that Malek's updated text is useless. Anything, no matter how scant, that prepares you for a mind-numbing test has its uses, but if you insist on using Malek, you might prefer to go to the library to find the 1989 version that gives more preparation than its more recent cousin.  By the way, Malek's test questions themselves: many of them are so outlandish that one is amazed that he thinks ETS will ask such trivia. 

You have been warned.
