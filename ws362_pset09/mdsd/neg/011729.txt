Wow, what a bummer. I was really looking forward to this book. I enjoy science-cyberpunk-fiction-y type books with female protagonists, but this was sad, sad, sad.

First, the idea. The idea just isn't good enough, or at least, the solution to the plot isn't good enough. Gibson clearly loves suspense, so he writes as though really exciting things are happening, even when NOTHING IS HAPPENING AT ALL, and the hero mainly feels nervous. It makes for tough reading. The characters that you are expecting to hook up never do. There's a weird side story thrown in that has NOTHING to do with the main story.

The main character is supposedly good at figuring out what "works" in advertising, yet is allergic to certain brands, will barf at the sight of a Tommy Hilfiger logo, and has a pathological fear of the Michelin Man. Not only would someone like this not be able to work in advertising (even on a consultant basis), but the fact the Gibson is unable or unwilling to explore this idea branding and logo identity beyond something that the protagonist simply "gets" is really annoying.

Save your time and money. Not that a used version of this book is expensive or anything.

I've read Sweet Valley High books (not recently, of course) with more interesting plot lines and narratives
