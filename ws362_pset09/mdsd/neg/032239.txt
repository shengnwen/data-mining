I had to force myself to finish this one, after having raced through The Skinner & Gridlinked.  While the basic plot was good, the execution was flabby.  I wish more time was spent with villain Skellor, and a lot less with expendable side-stories of a half-dozen minor characters, which get tedious in this 600 page book (not the 300 Amazon says).  The Skinner has a lot of characters too, but they seemed to all be painting important parts of the overall story, on a much more interesting world.  The story also lacked of a strong story line with at least one really intriguing character (like Sable Keech in Skinner, or Cormac in Gridlinked).  By the end, I just didn't really care that much about any of the characters, and the climax itself seemed tacked on and under-developed.  I hope this work is merely a hiccup for Asher.
