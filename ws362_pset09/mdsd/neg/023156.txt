i was quite disappointed.  i had hoped for a few things i could incorporate into my own party giving. but i consider it to be a guide to working with a party planner. no recipes, no how tos.  for instance the section on music suggest that you ask the DJ for a list of the types of parties he's worked.  i'd prefer a list from david of the best jazz cds to serve at brunch
