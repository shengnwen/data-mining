i am three quarters thru this book and no amount of money could make me finish it. what do people see in this writer? the dialogue is drivel, the characters implausible, and the situations unlikely, to say the least. so here somebody finds another gospel of the life of jesus. of course, this is accompanied by murder and skullduggery and an airhead opera singer (of all things!) heroine.  i'm sorry.  maybe if i were twelve, i'd think it was really cool
