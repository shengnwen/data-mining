I got a Rick Steves Paris book last year when I visited.  Because of the success of his program on PBS, I thought his guidebook would be full of insight when travelling.  I was sorely mistaken.  The book was full of common knowledge for anyone who has traveled any distance away from home.  His suggestions were dull and hackneyed, basically has you hit all of the tourisic commonplace areas.  Better to go with a TimeOut guide or Lonely Planet than this guy.  I'd only reccommend this book to the unseasoned or unadventerous traveler looking for a superficial journey.
