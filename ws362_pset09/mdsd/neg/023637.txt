After readind this book to my son, only once, I felt very sad about what happened. Maybe because my son is only 4, his reaction to this book was a lot of sadness, rather than liking the story, or learning about Baseball. I had to spend quite a bit of time explaining to him we (mom and dad) will not die and go to heaven just yet. He was so concerned we would not be around, and started asking so many questions about DEATH. My whole purpose of buying this book was to teach him about the sport, since he is getting so interested in it, and the experience was not even close to it. It is a good book to have and read about Lou Gehrig's history, but not for a 4 year old who just wants to understand and learn more about Baseball
