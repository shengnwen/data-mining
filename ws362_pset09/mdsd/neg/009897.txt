I had very high expectations of this book and looked forward for ages for its arrival and was thrilled when I was informed it had arrived.  Immediate disappointment occurred upon seeing the book, it is no taller than a compact disc and not much wider.  I was expecting a much larger book not one where the picture on Amazon is just about actual size.  Still if the content of the book had been superb I wouldn't have cared that much. Very average effort would be being nice describing what is inside.  The best three signs in the book are on the cover, most are pretty average and have been doing the rounds on the Internet for years.  

While some locations are specific a lot of the credits are also rather vague so if you actually wanted to find the sign for yourself you'll have a bit of a mission.  Also some of these photographs have been cropped so all you see is the signs themselves and not what surrounds, meaning we are seeing them out of context and they are not that funny in real life.  For example the Bind Persons Cross Here sign with the vague location of Australia (is actually at Nobbys Beach, Gold Coast QLD) does not show the school for blind children which is right next to it nor the other signs next to it warning motorists on the Highway to slow down due to the crossing.         

If you've been using e-mail for over a year or so you will no doubt have seen the majority of these signs before.  In fact the best ones you've seen there you will find are not in here.  Don't waste your money!
