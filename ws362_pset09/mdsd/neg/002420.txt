I'm glad I found this book in a remainder bin for four bucks, as I do NOT think it is worth [money] unless you are a serious fan of either Greg Louganis or Great Danes. It is primarily about Greg, Greg's dogs, Greg's life, Greg's opinions, with a sprinkling of brags to show what a really wonderful dog owner Greg is. I had hoped there would be a bit more on being a successful dog owner while having an often-debilitating chronic illness that could interfere with everyday dog care and training, but other than passing references to snuggling in bed with the dogs on bad days, there's little mention. Disappointing, as it had the potential to be a really good book
