This is a great book for people aspiring to become a professional gunsmith.  It may have some usefulness for the normal gun owner as well.  The detail and comments provided show this book was written by someone with an extreme amount of knowledge and experience in the subject.  Unfortunately the author realizes this and wrote this book to reflect it.  His egotistical lectures of exactly what the reader should do go beyond what I expected to gain from this book.  Then there are the contradictions that lead me to not believe in the author's knowledge as much as I did when I started. 

If you want a very technical guide on how to become a professional gunsmith, this is the book for you.  If you want a Do-It-Yourself Gun Repair Manual (Gunsmithing at Home) look elsewhere.
