Sorry guys, I looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media.  The graphics of the book are truly beautiful.  The recipes however, hmmm,  try again.  I followed a simple recipe for Apple Crisp and got a bad result.  I now go to respected standard cookbooks for my Apple Crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great.  Really people, the recipes are NOT the stuff of greatness.  Graphics? Great. Photography? Great?  Recipes? You have got to be kidding
