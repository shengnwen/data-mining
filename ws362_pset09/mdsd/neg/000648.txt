I purchased this book because I thought it was a revised and expanded edition of the Joy of Cooking book I already have and enjoy. The REVISED and EXPANDED words on the cover lead me to believe I was purchasing even more and different recipes than the original, but it is the exact book! I also purchased the other one stating the same misleading words in bold print on the cover. I am very disappointed and cannot return them because I didnt make this discovery within the 30 day limit. I believe it should be clearly stated that these are merely paperback editions of the hard back Joy of Cooking which I have purchased several copies as gifts for family and friends as it is a wonderful cookbook
