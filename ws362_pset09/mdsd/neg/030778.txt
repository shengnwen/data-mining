It is difficult to believe Ms. Aston has read Pride and Prejudice for the simple reason that none of the "daughters" presented in this book could possibly be related to Mr. Darcy.  The names are a dead give away:  Letitia? (who is purely boring); Camilla ??  Traditionally children were named after relatives.  Jane, Elizabeth, Georgiana, Mary, Catherine, Lydia, Charlotte. etc.

But then it is impossible to believe that any of these silly, mannerless, oversexed, vulgar young women could have been brought up by the Darcys.  Camilla grows a little but her love affairs are not believable.  What are we told about Wytton that would make anyone love him? 

And then "Aunt Lydia?"  What connection has she to the giddy brainless Lydia who runs away with Wickham?  And Caroline Bingley?

This book has no connection with Jane Austen.  It is a much-too-long badly plotted Regency, who's author has used Mr. Darcy's name as a selling point.
