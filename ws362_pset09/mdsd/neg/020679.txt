As a 50 year old, heterosexual, Christian, male who has been involved with Scouting, youth and adult, for 43 years; this book disturbs me on several levels.

Let me lead off with this - Scouting is NOT a Christian organization.  Baden-Powell never represented a Scout's duty to 
God in conventional terms.  Seton and Beard were more likely to use terms like "the church of the woods" or "the gospel of the redman".  The Scouting movement is a generically religious movement.  We have awards for Scouts from Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Bahai, as well as a variety of other non-Christian backgrounds.

Let me follow with this - Baden-Powell undestood the difference between homosexuality and pedophilism.  BSA is perhaps the only major World Scouting organization that seems to not understand this difference.

Thirdly, to align Scouting with either side in the ongoing culture wars does a disservice to those youths whom we are trying to reach.  The aims of Scouting are: Character development, Physical development, Development as a citizen.  These belong to all of us.  Instead, some within the movement seem to be teaching intolerance towards those who dare to disagree with us.

This book will not reverse the decline in numbers.  It will not bring in those boys who are attracted to the aims and methods of Scouting, but whose parents are turned off by the rhetoric coming out of books like this.  It will instead serve to perpetuate a circle the wagons mentality that will keep Scouting from fullfilling the dreams of Baden-Powell, Seaton, and Beard
