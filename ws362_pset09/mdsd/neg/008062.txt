    Firstly, i want to make clear that i have a degree in geography and am very familiar with the topics 'discussed' in this book.  Paul Driessen is obviously well-educated and knows how to write, therefore it must be assumed that he has purposefully neglected the facts in order to contrive an argument that will appeal only to people with no prior knowledge of the topic...

    For example,

    He advocates the continued use of fossil fuels by declaring that there is no proof carbon emmisions are responsible for climate change.  Regardless of climate change, the excessive air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels is indeed responsible for chronic respirotory illnesses worldwide (inc in the third world), and also catastrophic 'acid rain'...

    This one example is indicative of basically every chapter in this book (this is why it was published by a small company and wasn't found in my university library).  Without prior knowledge of the subject, one could easily be led astray.

    As a geographer i found this book interesting.  However, its profound inadequacies serve only to strengthen the integrity of the environmental movement.

    I do fear though, that too many people have believed the rhetoric they have digested in this very short book with a catchy cover and title
