I read a number of the reviews here and was quite excited to read this book when it came in the mail. Much to my chagrin, the material was very light and pretty much common sense.  There were no great insights and a remarkable lack of specific examples.  The author discusses her suggestions in generalities, but does not support those suggestions with specific examples forcing the reader to long for clarification on exactly what she is trying to recommend.  All in all, a disappointing purchase.  This book may have been great in 2000, but today is obsolete
