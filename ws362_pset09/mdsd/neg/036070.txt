I previously wrote a somewhat obnoxious review of House of Leaves, but after some thought, have decided to edit it.  

House of Leaves was mentioned to me by several friends and acquaintances, and hyped as one of the most frightening books they had ever read.  One individual told me it kept them up at night out of terror.  Others had said that they finished the book in a weekend and couldn't put it down.

Now, I love a good horror story, and several people promised me that this was THE horror story to read. After suffering through long boring academic-style descriptions of a house whose insides by far do not match its outsides, and footnotes written by a skeevy tattoo artist, I failed to find the scary.  I looked and looked, but it just wasn't there.  

Thus, I'm disappointed.   It isn't so much that I minded slogging through faux academic literature (although that in itself is annoying - how many articles and interviews could possibly have existed on such an underground video project?!), but that I slogged through it looking for something that - for me, at least - just wasn't there.

So, if you want my opinion, the book isn't scary, and it's rather long and dry.  Even the supposedly frightening experiences of Johnny Truant, the tattoo artist, were kind of boring and made my eyes glaze over.  Hence my previous title of "A handful of Ritalin and a pot of coffee couldn't make this readable...".  

Do I really need to be brought back to the days of writing research papers for college courses I only took to satisfy some ridiculous requirement?  That's what it felt like
