I did not choose to read this book... my great-grandmother gave it to me for christmas years ago and I knew I should read it sooner or later. So I read it. 
And didn't like it. It was boring, and to me there was no point and each different part starts off like the part before last never happened. These stories don't seem to connect to each other, and I was confused and I wish that the whole story could've been about "The Red Pony" like the title. Because I actually liked the first part, but the rest was a waste of my time. The only good thing I could say about it was that I finally got that one out of the way so now I can read more appealing books
