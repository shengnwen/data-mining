Glenn Miller once wrote "Onion Breath where are you over?" and String of Pearls.  This book had one flaws in it.  Zero gravity.  After spicy food it can't fart and it can keep it bottled up all the day because a girl is sitting near him in school.  He wants to score because he's a soccer player with no return.  Ottoman Berkley and some friends have somewhat a good idea how to feel about his coming to change.  J.D. Salinger wrote that on parchment and vitally grew with no limit in sight.  Why didn't this book talk about kids in the Middle Ages.  I want to read a book like that.  Some kids know how easy it is to be fun to talk and sing to after dinner.  Speakers in the earway of oui oui is sensible to adolescents.  All in all, good. Stick a fork in me 'cause I'm done
