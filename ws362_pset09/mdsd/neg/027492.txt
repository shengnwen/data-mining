I read this book for my European History AP class...actually for the summer work. I chose it because it seemed short and easy to read. Boy was I wrong. I did not enjoy this book at all. My recommendation is to choose another play. Each scene was totally different, which I did not like. The language is a bit confusing. Overall, I do not recommend this book...sorry.
