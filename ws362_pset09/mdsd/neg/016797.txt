If this book doesn't disturb and confuse you enough in English, go ahead and read it in French. We did.  This is by far the most confounding book we have happened upon during our college careers. The story line, or lack  thereof, throws you for a loop, assuming you don't get lost in the  cinematic language.  We left this book feeling dumber than when we started.  Bon chance
