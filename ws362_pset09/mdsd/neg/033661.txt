I was not impressed by Mr. Robinson's analysis.  His shock at the level of criminality that exists in any community is shocking to me.  Is he pretending to be naive, or, is he truly naive?  Why does he pretend NOT to know what was happening in his community.  I don't care if he was raised in Richmond or any other small town.  I think that he pretends to be naive when he really isn't. I don't like that level of pretentiousness.  He also did not do his homework.  Kittrell College, where Peewee went to school is not in Henderson but in Kittrell, NC which is very close to Henderson.  I also did not like his rambling on about his kids going to a school in the future.  Finally, I was very impressed at The Debt, at least he kept to the point of the book.  I thought that I would read more of his books because of his very fine articulation of what he sees as the problem and why African American should get reparations, but this book was not very good at all.
