Avoid this Faulkner work. It will not enhance your appreciation for his writing; rather, you are likely to regret ever having guiltily enjoyed Sanctuary. Other than his two Snopes novels, none of Faulkner's work after  World War II is worth reading, and I include Intruder in the Dust in that  assessment. Instead, go back to the works that demonstrated a gift for  story-telling and language, rather than sales. Sanctuary is unique in that  the lurid story of course was sellable yet Faulkner was able to infuse it  with his own unique vision and style
