I purchased this book because the seemingly counterintuitive concept of using options as part of a conservative investment strategy was intiguing. The author is knowledgable and authoritative. Although there is an effort to present basic information, it is not comprehensive - the reader needs to do some preliminary reading before tackling this book. I have two problems with the book. First, it is very poorly organized and written. It has the feel of a book hastily prepared for publication. Chapter contents bear little relation to chapter titles and there is much repetition. Rather than being helpful from a pedagogical standpoint, the author's rambling repetion confuses rather than illuminates. The author is also prone to awkward locutions - he was painfully ill-served by his editor. Second, I was not fully convinced that the author's proposed strategies are, in fact conservative. They seem to depend to a great degree on market timing which as most seasoned investors know will hinder ones plans as often as it helps.  The case for "conservative" options strategies as opposed to traditional buy and hold approach is not made.
