Incoherent.  This book wanders seemingly at random.  Travelog?  Literary criticism?  Science?  History of?  Behavior studies?  I might well want to read any one of these, at various times.  What I am not interested in, is a book that wanders from one to the other.

Poorly reasoned.  The author steps from the observed facts of commonalities at the genome level, to the fairly safe conclusion that all earthly life has common ancestry, but then leaps to the absolutely unjustified conclusion that "life [on earth] happened once and only once".  Nonsense: the evidence does not rise to that level.  For one thing, life could just as easily have started 1000 times and been extinguished by inferno in the early bombardment period.  And, it should be well known to the author that there was no single tree of descent for unicellular life - they routinely exchange genetic material and have even combined to form more complex cells.  Pardon me, but there is plenty of room in that history for multiple geneses to have been obscured by early exchanges and combinations.

So, the author can't write straight and can't think straight - regretfully, I find that I for one have no use for this work.
