The normal elements of an Anita Blake novel (supernatural detective work, exciting action, and Anita's strong will) are reduced and pushed aside in favor of gratuitous sex scenes.  There's nothing wrong with a little romance, especially if it advances the plot.  However, these repeditive scenes are about as romantic and subtle as a sledgehammer.  They don't contribute to the plot, but instead interrupt it.  

The excuse is that Anita has been infected by the ardour, a supernatural hunger for sexual energy.  Supposedly she got it from Jean Claude, even though it was never mentioned in the previous nine books.  It's a very flimsy plot device.   More annoying is the change in Anita.  Always before, she fought stubbornly to maintain her morals against all influcences.  However, she makes no attempt to resist the ardour.  

The book is so different in focus, flow, writing style, phrasing, and word choices that I suspect it was partially or entirely ghost written.  

I greatly enjoyed all the Anita Blake novels prior to this one.  I recommend reading those.
