I listened to the unabridged version on tape.  I enjoy audio books because I'm able to work at the same time (I paint).  So I get to feed my desire for great fiction, and get my work done at the same time. 
 
Blair Brown did an incredible job as a narrator. She was able to create a unique "voice" for each character in the story,making  it easy for the reader to keep track of all of the characters from the get go.

However, by the time I got to the end of the tape, I was glad that I at least had painted those six hours instead of wasting my time reading this novel!  I was so disappointed at the end, and found myself really irritated by the main character about three quarters of the way into the story. From the beginning of the story, I was irritated by the character's daughters too.  Also, I was irritated that nothing outwardly seemed to change in Rebecca's life.  OK, she had an arc, but it was all in her head. I found it very unfullfilling.  If I hadn't been passively listening to the story, while doing something else, I probably wouldn't have finished the novel
