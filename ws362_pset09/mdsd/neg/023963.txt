This book is definately mostly about the authors trials and tribulations. It reads kind of awkwardly and clumsy.  I didn't feel that I got to know more about what &quot;actually&quot; went on in the Waco compound on a daily basis. Frankly, it seems to be alot of adolecent &quot;whining&quot; about how hard life is and how much easier it gets when you have a &quot;leader&quot; who makes decisions for you
