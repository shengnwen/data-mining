    I've taught and researched  music education and the  history of music  for 35 years.  If you want to know about the history and background of Christmas songs, there is ONLY one book I highly recommend: "Stories Behind the Best-Loved Songs of Christmas" by Ace Collins; published by Zondervan.  The book by Mr. Collins is thorough and coincides with my own research on  carols.  This book, on the other hand, relies on  half told stories and the use of the "Free CD".   Hey, I know about all the 4 and 5 star ratings this might have received, but how many of those reviewers have read more than 5 books on the subject and taught music history for over 35 years.  You can purchase the great book by Mr. Collins right here at Amazon--as I did.  You will not regret it.   On the other hand, if you wish to purchase a nice looking gift of a CD with traditional carols and brief paragraphs about the carols (some of which leave out much information), purchase this book.  The artwork is attractive: that is the ONLY reason  why I rated it two stars instead of one
