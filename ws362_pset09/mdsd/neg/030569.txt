This is a classic Christmas story in our family and is linked to many Christmas traditions; however, I was disappointed in this copy because of its &quot;editing.&quot;  Many parts of the original story were missing for no apparent reason.  I did, however, find the illistrations lovely and would recommend this book for that reason
