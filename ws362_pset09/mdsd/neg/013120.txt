Even if you like Zizek (which I do), this book is a disaster.  Don't waste your time.  I was hoping to see Slavoj sneek into "enemy" territory and offer some of his "rock-star of theory" antics about Deleuze since he mentions him so often in his other works -- usually referencing Coldness and Cruelty or The Logic of Sense, but this book is almost chemically-free of Delueze (a thinker of the first-rate whom I quite admire).  The book is a hodge-podge of recylced writings (something Zizek is becoming quite comfortable with the more he writes). Deleuze is barely mentioned and often when he is Zizek is often simply wrong about his "take" on him. Most of the time Zizek is just spouting off (and it's not even the inspired kind of spouting that got him famous!) If you want to read something fun by Zizek read Enjoy Your Symptom or Looking Awry; if you want something more substantial read They Know Not What They Do, The Sublime Object of Ideology, or even The Ticklish Subject.  If you want to learn about Deleuze read Deleuze: A Critical Reader, Gilles Deleuze by John Marks or Michael Hardt, for a more slanted but engaging encounter perhaps Badiou's Clamour of Being  -- but better yet just try reading some of Deleuze's books: they are wonderful, and Dialogues or Pure Immanence are easy books to begin with.  I couldn't agree more with the review Eric made below. Looking for Deleuze in this text is like trying to find grapes and nuts in grapenuts: tedious and an utter waste of time
