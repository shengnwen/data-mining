OK folks, here's a contrarian review of this book.  Consider it an opinion which "balances" other reviews presented in this book review section.  Here goes.

Webster defines the word "slog" as "to plod one's way perseveringly especially against difficulty; to plod heavily".

What an apt description of the effort required to read this book!

If you're engaged in the CFA curriculum, this book comes as a recommended (practically required) textbook.  That's unfortunate because this book's various authors are inconsistent in making the material readable and understandable.

Yes, the book is comprehensive.  Chapter topics include:  Accrual Concept, Analysis of Cash Flows, Ratio and Financial Analysis, Analysis of Long-Lived Assets, Analysis of Income Taxes, Analysis of Financing Liabilities, Leases and Off-Balance-Sheet Debt, Pensions, Intercorporate Investments, Multinational Operations, and Business Combinations.  Great stuff to know - practical matters to understand and master.

However, this book presumes a solid understanding of intermediate level accounting, and provides little or no review of these concepts before delving into the topical material. It makes learning more challenging, and when time is of the essence, that's problematic.    So I found myself "slogging" through the course material in an effort to learn Level II material.

Supplemental reading is often required to make up for what the authors fail to teach effectively.  Here's a tip:  Schaum's Intermediate Accounting II has an excellent chapter #10 on Pension Accounting which will benefit you in your studies.  Likewise, I have found other Schaums's Outlines to be very instructive and beneficial (consider reading my other reviews).

The CFA Institute would do well to consider recommending other Financial Analysis textbooks to cover the same material - a book that is more readable and user-friendly.  One that's more engaging rather than one which requires heavy plodding
