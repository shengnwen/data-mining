Charles Upton, I am sad to say, is no Rene Guenon. While Guenon eschewed apologetics, marking his writings as the work of a real sage, Upton cannot resist making the arguments that Guenon made earlier and better. In fact, due to his long history as a beatnik, hippy, New Ager, and mainstream liberal, Upton has a hard time shedding many of the problematic baggage he has accumulated over the years. He praises Noam Chomsky and still seems constantly susceptible to egalitarian, moralistic thinking at nearly every turn. In short, Upton has decided to write a book on a subject he is not yet qualified to pontificate about. While reading his book, I wondered whether he will migrate, at some future point, away from "Traditionalism" in the same way he moved on from the New Age and his other interests. The saddest, and yet at the same time most fascinating aspect of his book, is how he manages to unintentionally render Tradition appear to be yet another facet of the New Age. He mixes up Hindu, Christian, and Islamic ideas while complaining about New Age syncretism. He claims to have "transcended dogma" but does not "deny it." This is the same trick many New Age people assert they can do too. At no point does Upton see that there are problems and legitimate objections to some of his assertions, and he avoids venturing into any area that deals frankly with possible holes in either his approach or his argument. I would heartily recommend this book to people to watch a soi disant Traditionalist fall flat on his face. I am disappointed that SP, a publishing house that usually has high standards, went for this mess of a book.
