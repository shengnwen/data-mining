It's possible the women are funny, but I guarantee you the writing isn't. This is just awful. Big bold neon "laugh at the absurdity of this or that stupid foreigner stereotype! You'll never guess what happened! It was like, so weird, like, I mean, like, ohmygod!" I read 34 of its 200 pages, just because I was too lazy to get out of the beanbag and grab a better book. Six authors who can't write, and I have no reason to believe the others can. The intro by she who chose these essays also sucked. Don't waste your time.
