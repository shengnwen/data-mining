For once I would really love to read a book that purports to be about a woman's sexual awakening without having said awakening occur at the hands of one man with whom she falls in love but who treats her poorly and/or can't seem to express his love until she's left unable to really love anyone else.  Not that that's the exact plot here, but how many "women's erotica" books can be summed up that way? I have no problem whatsoever with the SM content (see my wishlist if you don't believe me) and wouldn't have had a problem with the story itself if I hadn't read it seventeen times before.
