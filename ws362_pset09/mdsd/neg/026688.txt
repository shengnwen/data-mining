I read them all.  Grishim, Turrow, etc.  Kermit has a good understanding of the legal process, as he should.  There is so much legaleze, the characters go undeveloped.  The plot is thin and never really grabs you. Some of the sub plots are so trivial, they go nowhere.  

Kermit, you have the talent.  Now that you have written your book that first year law students could learn from, go write the next one for the rest of us
