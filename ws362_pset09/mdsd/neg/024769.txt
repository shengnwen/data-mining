I found this book to be a lot of common sense without a lot of fresh ideas. The author is from Indiana and constantly sites examples from that part of the country which didn't help me at all. The constant plugs to hire  a bridal consultant become tiresome. I wouldn't recommend this book unless  you didn't have a clue about the wedding process
