Previously, I read the first two books of the His Dark Materials books with ease. They were easy to get into and the plots were more interesting. The third book is just a disgrace. I read the first couple of chapters and just could not say, "Oh, lets continue reading the Amber Spyglass." I practically had to "force" myself to read it, and eventually, I got tired of forcing myself to read it, so I decided to abandon it. There are three main keys that has led me to discontinuing this book.
1. The plot, the characters, the settings, etc. was just absolutely boring. There were no action-packed parts of the book in the beginning. And a major have-to-do thing for authors is to draw the readers in right from the beginning, and Mr. Pullman has not done that in this book.
2. This book is way too long. The combination of boringness(not a word, but oh well) and lengthiness is definitely not a good combination.
3. Why does PHilip Pullman have to be so against Christianity? I read his bio on wikipedia and he has all these critical comments on C.S. Lewis. It's okay for him to hate the religion, but others have the right to appreciate their own. He's also in these associations that are just so religious related. I just think he shouldn't show his hatred in his books
