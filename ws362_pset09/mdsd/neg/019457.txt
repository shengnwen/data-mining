As a screenprinting teacher, I am always on the lookout for good screenprinting manuals to recommend to my students. Unfortunately, this is not one. It is an OK book if you know NOTHING about screenprinting and want to do it for a hobby to make some cards or do projects with your kids, but I do not recommend it for someone who is looking to get into screenprinting more seriously
