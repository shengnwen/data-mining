While I find Ethan Mordden often erudite and highly entertaining,I find his comments often irritating and inaccurate.  His new book, THE HAPPIEST CORPSE I'VE EVER SEEN contains inaccurate information on productions which involved both of us, from placing the New Amsterdam Theatre Company's final presentation, Jerome Kern's SALLY, before producer Bill Tynes' death to a cryptic "all was well till someone claimed to have found the Bennett parts at the St Louis Muny" about my restoration of Cole Porter's lost show JUBILEE.  If Mr Mordden can't keep the information accurate on matters in which I was involved, I question the accuracy of other areas in his expertise.

To my knowledge, Ethan and Bill Tynes were good friends and it's my memory that Ethan was on the board for The New Amsterdam Theatre Company.  Bill's health in 1986 delegated the March production of JUBILEE to Sally Hassenfelt, who became the New Amsterdam Theatre Company's producer at Bill's death in January 1987.  SALLY was the only show produced under her regime in January 1988; the late Bill Tynes was still credited as producer.

Bill had wanted to use the March 1986 performances of JUBILEE as a backer's audition to present a major revival, but his health limited his time as producer and Ms Hassenfelt, who had been brought in to assist Bill, asserted her power over casting and director by bullying everyone, from me to the Cole Porter Trust.  One "period musicals" authority tried to sabotage my working on JUBILEE by attempting to locate the original scores and parts, but nothing was located.  In his latest book, SING FOR YOUR SUPPER, Mr Mordden's comments on JUBILEE, removing Tommy Krasker and me from any reconstruction or revival comments, show that he's been studying the photocopy of my vocal score that I gave him in 1986.
