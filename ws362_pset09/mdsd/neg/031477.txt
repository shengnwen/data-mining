Laymon has some excellent books, this is not one of them. I swear he must have repeatedly smashed his head against a wall before writing it, the IQ is so low. The Traveling Vampire Show, Island, Midnight's Lair, Body Rides....
all good stuff. Even the sub par books are better than this; blood games, among the missing etc. 
This book feels like it was written by an eight grader with a constant erection and an overly violent disposition. Woman are cast in the worst light possible and all the guys are either idiotic, insane or both. The little town where this story takes place just needs to be nuked, because if anybody actually acted like the characters in this book do the human race would be gone in two generations.
