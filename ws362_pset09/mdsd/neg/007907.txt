I've made a lot of good bread lately even though I'm a beginner.  But the 4 recipes I've tried from this book have all failed  If this had been the only book I'd purchased on making bread I'd have stopped trying by now.  But every recipe of Beatrice Ojakangas has turned out to be wonderful bread. I'd recommend her books if you want good bread.  Should add, I don't know Beatrice and have no agenda in recommending her books.  Each recipe from "Bread Made Easy" has ended up in my compost heap.  Very disappointe
