This book is full of errors, and it made me wonder where in the world this  author got so many misconceptions about C. Evidently, he either has not  read the book by Kernighan and Ritchie (the originators of C), or has not  understood it, yet. If you want to become a serious programmer in C,  consult the 2000 reviews at ACCU (Association for C and C++ Users) Internet  site. If you just want to impress your friend at your first date, make sure  your date does not know C better than this author, because this book is  just as bad as so many C/C++ books in the market
