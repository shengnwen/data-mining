Leaving the book's artistic merits aside (and they are considerable) I post this review merely as a warning. If you are someone who "enters" books as you read them and internalizes the mental images they conjure, then you may wish to avoid reading this book, especially the short chapter entitled "Stab Her, Man". If you have read "American Psycho" and wish you hadn't, not for any moral or aesthetic reasons, but simply because some of the horrific images are unnecessary additions to your mind's imagination, then you may be familiar with the risks
