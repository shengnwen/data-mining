There is a review further down this page that is purportedly written by the author. If this was indeed written by the author, he should be profoundly ashamed of himself. 
This is what Michael Burleigh has written in the review below in regards to the criticism offered by one of his readers: 

"In cyberspace every moron gets a coconut. One big electronic democracy? Many of my US readers appear to need dictionaries. People don't in the fifteen European countries my work is translated into. Nor did I as I wrote the English language. My book is about Europe. Maybe try living there before you presume to comment on it?"

This is one American who has no intention of putting any money in the pocket of someone who holds me and my fellow countrymen in such open and unbridled contempt. And you have to shake your head at the effrontery of the author as he rates his own book with 5 stars
