I did not care for this book as much as Dry: A Memoir.  The latter capitvated me and made me laugh out loud and was difficult to put down.  Sellevision however left me wanting and I abandoned it around the halfway point.  

I did not find in it the sense of humor I loved in Dry.  And I did not find a character that I liked and cared about and wanted to see triumph at the end.  Similarly I did not find a character that I hated enough to be rooting for his or her downfall.  All of the characters seem to be shallow shopaholics and I guess that just doesn't hold my interest.  Let them shop their lives away, who cares
