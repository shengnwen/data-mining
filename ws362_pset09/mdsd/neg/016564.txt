I found the book disappointing with very little information specific to debt collection.  I was hoping for insights into the collection industry, however, the first 25 pages were devoted to a very general business plan.  The Fair Information Act infomation is available online for free and the final chapter consisted of self-congratulations by the author. I wish Mr. Bills had shared his considerable knowledge of the industry in much more depth
