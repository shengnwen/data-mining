I am trying to do some quick refresher reading on ada for a job interview and this book has been sitting around unread since i went on an ada course 5 or so years ago. It would be less painful to swallow this book whole and pass it out the other end in the same state than read it. Its riddled with profound opinions on the philosophy behind the language and i skipped the first 4 chapters as irrelevant rubbish but still have the rest padded out excessively with this stuff instead of getting down to the actual language. I think I should have read the book I got back in 1983 written by the course lecturer instead even though it was published before the language was finalise
