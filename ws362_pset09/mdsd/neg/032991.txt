For anyone interested in detecting lies in the marketplace, politics, and marriage: this is the last book you should buy.  Slight exaggeration aside, there are probably 3 semi-valuable pages in this book.  

Ekman spends about 275 pages trying to convince you that even if you believe someone is lying, you might be wrong...or, actually, you may be right...The entire book is a dizzying succession of tautologies.  He is so scared that you will read his hypotheses (which are of no practical value - who can spot a "micro-expression" without buying his $50 software and training on it for a month?) and accuse an innocent person of lying (or vice versa) that he has rendered this book useless.  If you are a masochist and are interested in reading a book where an insecure researcher talks to himself for hundreds of pages, by all means buy this book.

There IS a reliable protocol for detecting lies, and there are at least a couple of books that I know of that go over it in detail, in less than 200 pages.
