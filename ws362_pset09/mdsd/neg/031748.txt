Mr. Ricketts begins well. Kipling's ancestors are well drawn. His first years in India are well done. The years back in England when he was 7-17(roughly) are very well written. The first years as a journalist back  in India, when Kipling had great success with poems and stories, is well  doen too. So, the first 140 pages are useful. Then the book gets really  boring. Kipling leaves India,  circles the world and lives in Englamnd then  the US. It's really boring. Mr Ricketts seemed to run out of energy. So  read the first part and skip the last
