 
     This book was tiresome reading at times, with many mathematical tables of which were put in the book to provide an alibi for whomever might disagree with the man and how he came to the conclusions he had done. I must agree with one of the reviwers of this book --- " Who cares?". I mean ultimately, it will be the readers themselves that will judge what exactly was the greatest and productive findings in history. 

The Techonologically inclined will say that Science is the master of all that is and the more liberal arts type will insist that the Arts is what defines a culture. The fact is that both do because both hold a sea-saw effect, without imagination there is no science and without science there is no reason for a human being to think beyond what reality tells him to be so. It is science that produces better paints, better materials that lets the Artist craft and produce --- so why pit them against eachother?  

It is that point that I will give this particular book 2 stars, as well as the way it was made. The side notes in a terrible headache making Blue with white type was a horrible idea. The reading was very drawn out and I've read better on far more drier  material.  The fact the guy took a good few years of his life to do this seems kind of odd, and I question it --- one should wonder, why? Somone could have made the arguement that the West had a far more promenint mark on the world in far fewer pages and time then this particular author has done.
