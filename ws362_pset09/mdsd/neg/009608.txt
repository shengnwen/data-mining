The story-line is OK, even though some unlikely coincidences occur.  BUT, the writing is very amateurish and full of grammatical, punctuation, and syntax errors (among others).  It was like slogging through quicksand to read it.  The book must have been self-published because no editor would have let it go out with all the errors.

A very good editor could make this an OK book, though not nearly the quality of Susan Kay's.

Don't buy it unless you are a Phantom of the Opera collector and just must have everything published
