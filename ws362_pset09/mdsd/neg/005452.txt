This book is very poorly written. There are grammatical errors, lots of repetition, and so much awkward writing that I, my grandfather and my stepfather all had to put it down. 

I think the only reason this book gets such good reviews is that it is one of the more easily-accessible books on the subject. As soon as there are more mainstream books on the topic, this one will fall by the wayside
