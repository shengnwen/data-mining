This book dares to be called an historical work. It should be deemed a fantasy.  Rarely does the author clearly articulate reasons for her sweeping and farcical assumptions.  When she describes Lizzie Borden as proof positive that the Cornells were genetically disposed to get angry enough to kill, she clearly crosses the line.  Ms. Crane thanks her husband for his help by stating that he was her partner in crime.  It's truly a crime that this book was ever published
