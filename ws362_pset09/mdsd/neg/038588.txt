Before reading Breakpoint I had no feelings at all towards Vince Spadea except perhaps empathy at his being tagged with the "longest losing streak in a pro tennis players career" label. After reading his book, I detest the man. He's a mediocre player that has a grudge to bear against almost every player who has beaten him on the Pro Tour. He tries to  sound authoritative but he comes across sounding "green" with jealousy. His book will certainly not win fans but will negatively influence people
