This book was a favorite with my children many years ago, so now as a grandmother, I was excited about the prospect of introducing it to my grandaughter.  Like so many others, I was surprised and disappointed to see so many pages missing.  Wondering if any of the used books available could possibly include the original?  Now I'm on a search for the original
