This book didn't work for me, though I like Nutshell books.  I think that alphabetical approach didn't work this time. It might be good for utilities and commands, but for Tasks and Concepts? It's much easier to find what you want on topic basis. And why on earth to use alphabetical approach if most books have good index? I have discovered another book, &quot;Mastering W2K Server&quot; by Mark Minasi. That book is great. I have found there everything I needed. It has a lot of cross-references to NT and even 95/98 without boasting much about it.  Nutshell book arrogantly states that you have to be very good at NT to read it. I think that might be just to cover up the confusion created. True, Minasi's book is 50% more expensive, but it's twice bigger also, and much more useful
