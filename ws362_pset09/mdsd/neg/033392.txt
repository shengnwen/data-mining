Although Hadot does know his stuff, me mostly talks about other people's view on philosophy. I found this book to be quite a tease.  Hadot rairly gave a good description or analysis of ancient texts.  I was always interested in philosophy, but this book did me no good exept lure me to read Plato: The Republic, which I had read before in college.  Plato: The Republic gets to the heart of ancient philosophy by giving a great translation of the ancient Greek texts.  Making it feel like you were there when Socrates and Thrasymachus engage in one of the greatest battles of intellect and reason.  And their topic of interest; 'what is justice and injustice?' a question that is still debated.  Even though these dialoges date back to 380 B.C., their reasoning can still be applied today
