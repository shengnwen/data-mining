  We received a rather terse note on returning from our vacation
  about not emailing a response back. The book was in HORRIBLE shape. His description of the 'worn ' appearance was wishful thinking. He did not email us and tell us that a credit had been issued . I found that out by followup. I can't say the 'near'service we received was very good
