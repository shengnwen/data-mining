I have lived in El Salvador now for over eight years.  To visit El Salvador for three days and continue to make a profit on those three days -past- seems completely immoral to me, especially since the book remains in print and continues to influence the world's opinion of El Salvador.  I find this completely unfair.  Would it be possible for Joan or Oliver or anyone else that enjoyed an income from the events of 20+ years ago to come back and revise their assesment?  It would probably cost them all of two or three thousand dollars for the trip, but of course, it would stop the thousand if not million dollars in sales of these recollections which were wish fullfilling fantasies to begin with.  All of El Salvador suffered during this time, why perpetuate the suffering?  And what about any three days in any given city in North America?  Could'nt the "glass is half empty" scenario be drawn to horrify any sensible person from every wanting to visit there, simply by selectively clipping the daily paper?  I think so.
