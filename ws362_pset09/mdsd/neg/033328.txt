I have read many books on infertility and IVF.  I found this one to be poorly written.  The author uses interviews with infertile couples attempting IVF.  She writes word for word from their interviews.  It is confusing as she jumps back and forth between their stories and her own. The writer also has a very negative attitude toward IVF even though the process helped her to have healthy twins.  It seems she is trying to work out her insecurities and doubts through her writing. As I am still pursuing parenthood, it was difficult to read a "poor me" story from a woman who seems to regret IVF even though it worked a miracle times two for her.
