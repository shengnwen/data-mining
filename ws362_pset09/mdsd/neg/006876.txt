This book had some interesting statistics, and I'm glad I read it for those, but McDowell's writing style isn't great and I think his editor was asleep at the wheel (subject/verb agreement!).  The last half was basically an advertisement for McDowell's teen devo curriculum.  McDowell does a good job of laying out the crisis, but the only solution he offers is his own curriculum.

He also repeated himself as if trying to make a certain word count.

I expected a lot from this book, and I was disappointed
