Dover reopened in Greek Homosexuality (1978) the study by classicists of a subject disdained since 1933, when Hitler crushed the German Homosexual Emancipation Movement.  However, Sir Kenneth denigrated Greek pederasty by claiming that it was merely lustful.  He hypercritically refused to use sources dating from after the 4th century - even Plutarch's Lives, which, like the works of Lucian and Diodorus, notoriously cited and paraphrased lost classical sources, which themselves often relied on earlier oral and written accounts.  This simplified the crotchety don's task and distorted his conclusions.  His "book" is really a collection of four essays.  The longest and most original are about erotic vases and a seamy lawsuit involving a kidnapping.  How such a skimpy selection of sources could be expected to yield a valid thesis defies reason.

Nicknamed "Bend-over Dover" by undergrads, Sir Kenneth, unlike so many other Oxfordians, seems never to have experienced a homosexual act, except once when, according to his autobiography, he was buggered while on military duty in Alexandria and complained that it hurt.  He was led astray by his intended collaborator, the Canadian shrink Devereux, who taught him the distorted Freudian thesis that homosexuals are sexually retarded, i.e., that we don't fully mature from the oral and anal phases to the phallic.  Sir Kenneth's homophobia was well documented a few years ago by James Davidson in the February 2001 issue of Past and Present.

"The Prosecution of Timarkhos" takes up 100 pages (19-109) - one half of the text.  It is an extended commentary, a specialized task at which Dover is a master.  The best things about the book are the illustrations, the analyses of the vase paintings, and the 30 pages of appendices
