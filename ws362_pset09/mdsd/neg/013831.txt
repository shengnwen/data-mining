Harwood's book presents an interesting yet somewhat flawed overview of the historical roots of both the Judaic and Christian biblical religious tradition. Indeed, the author introduces extra-biblical precedents for myths that parallel many of the stories and legends central to belief in modern contemporary Judaism and Christianity.

On the one hand, the book succeeds in reducing Christianity to nothing more than another in a long list of pagan mystery religions. Only the ethnicity of the deity has undergone revolutionary change; "god" is no longer of Babylonian, Egyptian, Persian or Greek descent. Rather, in Christianity, the savior-god is Jewish. The author shows that in no other aspect can Jesus or the religion founded in his name be considered unique.

On the other hand, the book is not so successful in its attempt to discredit the essence of Judaic belief. While creation, flood myths, etc. are shown to have their precedent in earlier pagan traditions, the radical departure of the concept of god from the pagan to the Jewish tradition is never addressed. The author fails to show that in all too many aspects the God of the Jews was essentially unprecedented. Evolving over time, Yahweh became and remained unique.

Nevertheless, despite its flaws and oversights, the book serves, in part, as an adequate introduction to the historical background of the biblical world.

A note of caution: The anti-Christian and anti-Jewish literary tone of the book might well be offensive to some readers. It is quite apparent that the author harbors intense anger perhaps as a result of his own research which he admits culminated in the shattering of his religious faith
