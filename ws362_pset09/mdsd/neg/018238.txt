My book club strikes again with this inane, predictable and hard to complete selection.  I think Kim Edwards found the novel difficult to finish writing, because the ending was even more bland and poorly developed than the rest of the book.

The premise of the novel is interesting enough, which is why I found it mildly engaging.  However, I found myself hating all the characters in the book (save Phoebe).  The metaphors the author uses are for the most part cheap, and are further deflated by their constant repetition.  How many starfish metaphors can she make in the course of just a few paragraphs?  Then there was the overuse of several phrases..."silverfish" is just one that comes to mind.  Still, this was Kim Edward's freshman novel, so I can excuse some of the overly-elaborated and amateur metaphors; hence the two star rating.

I had a difficult time trudging through this book to reach the end.  The middle section could have been half as long and still sufficed.  The characters were all, without exception, poorly developed and painfully uninteresting.  This doesn't make the invisible plot any more tolerable.  I would say that if you really wanted to feel like you wasted your time reading something, then choose this book.  There is certainly nothing to be gained by reading it
