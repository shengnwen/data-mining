Okay, I am going to settle this myth about Palm Beach.  Ronald Kessler has no idea what he is talking about.  In fact, nobody in Palm Beach would ever really allow a gossip writer to come in an expose all of our secrets.  Its just not done that way.  Many rewrites of the chapters were done until they contained little more than what you would hear sitting at a table at Taboo for lunch.  Ronald Kessler drops so many names that it seems to become a guestbook for his adventures with the rich and famous.  In my opinion, he needs to realize that he was not invited into this society like he thinks he was.  Mr. Kessler was given little more than idle gossip to write about and he turned what he learned into a group of stories that sound interesting but have no substance to them.  The only way to really know about Palm Beach is to come here and see what goes on.  It is just like any other normal American town, only the other towns don't have two bit authors running through the streets with idolized vinettes about wealthy socialites.  In other words, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK
