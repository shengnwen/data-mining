This was a boring book. Nothing happened! The descriptions of people, places, and events were really good-unlike the plot. Basically, Thora is from some community where if you're born with the mark of the goddess, you learn how to use a limited amount of magic, and don't have to get married or take care of the home. The community is attacked by pirates, but Thora and her dog escape. Thora finds a wounded familiar, and they travel together. They find an underground storage chamber thing, and go through it. There are all sorts of things there from the old days, where technology was above that of the middle ages. Thora and Malkin and Kurt go to the place where Malkin's blood-bonded person is, they fight some evil people, blah, blah, blah. The thing I didn't like about this book was that nothing really interesting happens. They have battles, but the battles aren't realistic, even for a fantasy/science fiction story. I mean, they don't know who they're really fighting, none of the bad guys ever say anything. Plus, Thora is _really_ intolerant of other people's religious beliefs and  customs. If someone doesn't go with the code she was raised with, she pretty much gives them the cold shoulder. It got on my nerves. Again, nothing happened. I liked the furry people-the familiars, and their relatives in the woods-but the people were boring. Thora's is the only view point, and she never changes her mind about any of them. Basically, it's a boring book with boring characters. I've read a few of Norton's other books, and feel pretty confident when I say that this is definately not her best work
