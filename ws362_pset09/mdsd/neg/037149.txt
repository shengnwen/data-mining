Basically, the authors discuss a number of breakout and/or reversal strategies that are pretty well standard fare; I didn't see any 'breakthrough' ideas involving volume as I'd hoped for, save the usual accumulation/distribution stuff that can be found in any common technical analysis book. A few important points emerged, such as the idea that dumb money usually causes more violent accumulation spikes whereas smart money accumulates more quietly. Not really a revelation. Perhaps the main problem with the book is that it's simply overwritten and not written very well. Lacing almost every trading 'lesson' are personal accounts of the authors'---how he began trading, mistakes he's made, etc. Kind of reads like a diary and not a grammatically sound diary at that. If you were to trim all of the personal narratives, admonitions and pontifications about trader psychology personal or otherwise, you could rewrite this book in about 30 or 40 pages at a price less than half of what this one costs. Better yet, a book simply of charts with do's and don't would be far more meaningful because there is so much clutter and ineffectual writing here that it obfuscates what the author is really trying to say. The authors' foreign nationality certainly doesn't help, as he tries to sound colloquially American and it just doesn't come off right. If you're new to trading I'd look elsewhere. If you want to skim some charts and pick up a few points on breakout strategies and volume that you may not know about, I'd first look through this book in the bookstore before shelling out thirty or so bucks.
