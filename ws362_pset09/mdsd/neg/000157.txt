I have never had to struggle so hard to complete a book. The book starts off ok and heads straight to cardboard. Why the heck did I waste my money on this! Bitten, Broken and Stolen by Armstrong are so much better in kick-butt chicks with attitude, hunky werewolves, romance, and action/mystery. I do not make a habit of writting any reviews, much less a bad one but this book is so bad I have to warn someone. Save the money you would spend on this and buy Bitten instead
