I'm all for simplicity and living with less so that's why I picked up a copy of this book at the library.  I was really, really disappointed to find that this was a book about living simply but with God.  If I wanted a sermon, I'd go to church.  If you're looking for a book about simplicity or looking to scale back I recommend Frugal Living for Dummies, The Everything Budgeting Book, Living the Simple Life or The Joy of Simple Living
