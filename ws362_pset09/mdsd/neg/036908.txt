On page one, the author asserts that "We've read too many magazines, watched too many gardening TV programs, seen gardening videos, and gone on too many garden walks to have the 'beginner's mind'..." Apparently, "too many books" are why she was totally clueless that variables like soil type and quantity of rain and sun would affect how well a plant would thrive in her yard.

She claims to have been perplexed when perennials hardy to zone 7 kicked the bucket during her zone 5 winters. She was shocked when the plant she bought at the nursery ("No one could tell me a thing about it.") was unhappy in her Chicago yard; it was native to California & Alaska!

There are lots of photos. Most of them are homogeneous photos of things like a clump of Hostas or a field of Black-Eyed Susans. I can see pictures of individual plants in any seed catalog; I want to see what they look like in a cottage garden!

All of the photos seem to have been taken in the author's own yard. There's not a single picture of someone else's garden. There are no descriptions of gardens outside her Chicago suburb, let alone her home state of Illinois. Perhaps the book should have been called "A Midwest Cottage Garden" or "Frances Manos's Garden". That's all that's in here. If you already know the basics of zones and what plants need to survive and you're looking for inspiration and ideas for creating your own cottage garden, I suggest looking elsewhere
