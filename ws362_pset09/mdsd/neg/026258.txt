I found this book very annoying to read because of the way it intertwines the various women's stories (for the most part) rather than telling them one at a time. I also guess I expected this to be about WOMEN backpacking (Since the subtitle is "Tales and Tips from Seasoned Women Backpackers") so I got very turned off by the author's recounting how her husband gets up in the a.m. and fixes her tea or how he patiently puts up with her while she whines. I did enjoy the Llama chapter, and I can't say it was a waste of time, but it was not what I expected.
