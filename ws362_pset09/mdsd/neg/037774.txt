I started reading this book, skipping the introduction and then realized this isn't the Tao Te Ching at all. This is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said, and so he wrote his own version. It turns out the author admits this in the introduction. I wish I had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk. I guess I should have taken the hint with the "A New Version" doublespeak on the front cover. Sigh.
I usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs.
