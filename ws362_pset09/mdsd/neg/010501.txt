Ralph Ketcham certainly some respect I had for him when he, in the middle of Patrick Henry's speech, inserted, "Here Mr. Henry strongly and pathetically expatiated on the probability of the president's enslaving America..."

If it were not for the fact that I've already highlighted and marked up this edition, I would buy a different version and use that as my primary source. Mr. Ketcham's remarks were not in good taste, nor was it proper historical method to simply leave out an argument from Patrick Henry, thereby disallowing a following historian to examine and evaluate its merits.

****Note****: About four weeks after I wrote the post above, I discovered that the insert mentioned above was not Ketcham's doing. But rather, the side note of a journalist present at the time of Henry's speach at the Virginia Convention. My apologies to Ketcham. Although, he should have inserted a footnote to make the readers aware of what appears to be an awful bias. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow users to edit their ratings and so this version of the Anti-federalist papers will remain at 1 star from me, although it should be a 4 or 5.
