This is supposed to be a revealing look at the superhuman community and what happens when one is killed by another.  What it actually is is a self-serving justification for the Youngblood universe and all of its little spinoffs.

Knightsabre comes home drunk on his 30th birthday.  He passes out and wakes up accused of murdering Riptide.  The story moves between the main plot and short stories of spinoffs throughout the ages.  As the story moves to an unlikely trial (held in private) we find that the whole event is a result of the entire universe.  Every character since the dawn of time has had some hand in this story.

This story was supposed to show how a superhero faces trial using non-super courts and legal systems.  But they pick their own judge and hold the trial in secret.  Secret from the non-super world, that is.  In the end it just shows how cleverly Alan Moore can tie seemingly unrelated elements into a story.  The story ends with the third part of the four-part story.  Part four is reserved for a series of short Youngblood prequel stories (why not just make it a three-parter?).

If you want to see Moore being clever, you might like this one.  If you are looking for the advertised drama, stay away because it isn't here
