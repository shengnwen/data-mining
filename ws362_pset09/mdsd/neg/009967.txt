Unfortunately, I read this book before reading the reviews.  It was in my disgust for the book, that I got online to read the reviews to see what other Christians thought.  I firmly agree with the many negative comments that have already been brought out.  This book is full of Debi Pearl's twisted opinions, but rather than be stated as that, the book uses a type of pathetic guilt to try to lead the reader to think that what she is saying is Biblical. I would not recommend this book to anyone, but those that are in a failing marriage due to physical, emotional, or verbal abuse need be very cautious of the harm that can be done if following the opinions of the Pearl's, especially where kids are involved also
