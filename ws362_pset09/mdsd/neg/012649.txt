I gave this one two stars simply for the vague effort put into it.  Overall the books is rather poorly written, source documentaiton is almost nonexsistent and to be quite frank, the writing style is beyond boring.  Having lived here in the Ozarks for all of my life (well over 60 years) and having accomlished some modest research in this area myself, I was very, very disappointed in this work.  Actually, I am not at all sure if this author ever lived here, or even visited.  If you are interested in this area of study, I suggest "Ozark Magic and Folklore" by Vance Randolph.  This is a older book, but well worth the search to find it. I Do not recommend this work.
