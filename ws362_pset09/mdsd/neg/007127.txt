Although John Stanley's book covers a lot of great movies, there are many problems with the overall context. For example, he seems to only have a vague recollection of a lot of the movies. Because, a lot of reviews get the stories completely wrong. (HELP's plot is not about the Beatles looking for Ringo's magic ring. Everybody knows that!)Some actors are credited with the wrong roles. Also, there are many glaring spelling errors and a slight continuity problem: A title will say "see altertnate title", and that title and review would not be in the book! Mr. Stanley, do a little more research on your films and a more careful job of copy editing and you'll have an invaluable book. The more I read your current volume, the more mistakes I find and the more I feel I could write a better book myself
