Often times fiction is just a vehicle for authors to use all of their ideas and just throw them all into one book.  This is the case here--it took me 4 months to finish because it was so bad.  There is no plot here really.  Much of the time Robbins writes about 5 talking objects which is by far the worst part of this already bad book.  The entire book works up lazily to the climax where a 16 year old belly dances, her vagina visible the entire time--well that's not so bad, but Robbins has spent all the time getting to here so he can preach some of his views which are just more colorful versions of the Celestine Prophecy.  Save your time-this is a bad book
