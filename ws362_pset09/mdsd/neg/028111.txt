This text was such a waste of money. The editor's of these tests did absolutely nothing, as far as I'm concerned. An example, there was a independent question in the physical sciences that had no correct answer.  Do you know how frustrating that is after taking a day long test? That's  not it. The exam was littered with errors and even more incorrect answers
