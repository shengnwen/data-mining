...but it seems like Grant himself, whom I respect, didn't know how to wrap things up. This TPB is the MOST disgusting one , considering splatter put in the story, and, sometimes plain boring. End is unclear, and reminds me of what Arthur Clarke said once : 'I don't explain anything'. Puzzling ending for my fave characters, could it have been better?
