Since I am a patent attorney specializing in computer-related inventions by trade, as well as an avid photographer, I consider myself extremely well-versed in computer technology and digital photography.  I have been using digital cameras and Photoshop for years.  Suffice it to say that I am not in any way, shape or form a "beginner."  I bought this book in order to learn advanced tips, secrets and techniques that would allow me to improve and streamline my workflow while processing my images using Photoshop CS.  However, this book is poorly written in the extreme.  It seems that almost every other sentence refers to a step, process, function or Photoshop menu item that the author fails to adequately explain, thereby leaving the reader with more questions than answers.  Every few weeks or so I keep trying to plow through another section or chapter in the hope that the descriptions and examples will get better.  But it never does.  I have yet to finish a single section of the book and think to myself, "okay, now I understand this particular concept."  Most often I am left clicking around Photoshop menus and searching for options in dialogue boxes trying in vain and with much frustration to find and use some function that the author says should be used but failed to explain or show. Most often, the author does not bother to give any examples of what he means when he says you should use some function or process buried behind 2 or 3 levels Photoshop menus.  This has turned out to be a complete waste of time and money
