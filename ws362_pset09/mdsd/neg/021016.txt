Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the  U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.

It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial.  Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and  doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green.  Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.

If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history.
