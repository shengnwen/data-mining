I have been homeschooling for years, and when I did a search on books for homeschooling to help with evaluation and narrative reviews, this book came up.  I purchased it and I am returning it.  The information that is in this book is not specific and you could get more useful information online for free.  Even if you are a new homeschooler, this book doesn't provide any more than common sense.  Take the money that you would spend on this book and take your kids out to lunch .. it would be better spent
