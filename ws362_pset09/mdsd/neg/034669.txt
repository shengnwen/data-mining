I have never paid this much for a book with poor grammer and editing in nearly every page. Perhaps because the material is cutting edge they chose to rush this book to print. Not only is the copy bad, there are many places (like the entire appendix) where figures are referenced but do not exist. Despite this, the book contains some great information about the emerging security threats to web services and some measures you can take to preempt them. I applaud the author for his technical content, but the book itself needs a lot of work before you should pay this much for it
