As someone who enjoys casual history reading, specifically about WWI and WWII, I found this book a complete waste of time. This is the first book of this type that I honestly could not force myself to read after the first 100 pages.  Paragraphs seem to run on for pages with no main topic, let alone coherency.  There is no feeling for chronology at all, just continuous rambling with names and places inserted into the narrative that come from nowhere!  Keegan's book, although it started awfully slow and over-detailed, was much more enjoyable and informative.  After reading Churchill's excellent WWII series, I'll have to get his book on the &quot;Great War&quot; rather than spending any more time on Palmer's drivel
