This book is... horrible. I've never read a worse Phantom novel in all my life.

First, before he even goes to write the novel itself, Fredrick Forsyth mocks Gaston Leroux, the writer of the original novel. He criticizes the book, then goes on to write something that should be burned. Only the epologue is worth it.

I was reading the entire novel shaking my head in shame. I would not pay more than the penny that I did for this novel. 

It's really not worth it. Mr. Forsyth should be ashamed
