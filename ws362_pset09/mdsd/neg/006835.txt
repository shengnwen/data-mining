There's nothing worse than getting a book that has source code that doesn't compile.  Not just little noob things, like forgetting to add directories and such, but actually BAD source code.

Oh, no, scratch that... there is something worse.

Source Code that doesn't compile AND no executables.  Not only can you not compile and understand the code, but you don't have anything to base your ideas off of.  I mean, christ, at least give us something to show us what it's supposed to remotely look like.

I disliked this book so much that I didn't even bother trying to re-amp the source.  It's just plain garbage.


here's a hint to multiplayer programming as well as game programming in general:

books don't teach you anything.  If you're looking for a "how-to" guide then books aren't the answer.  Usually you can find some useful information in books that can help solve a problem, but there really is no solution to an entire problem.

don't let Andre's Tricks series fool you, or any other books for that matter.  What makes you good at programming is programming itself, and figuring out things on your own.

Reference a book or article when need be, but don't waste your money on something like this.  Just google sockets and you'll have more than enough informatino to get a project gonig.

Peace out,

Jaso
