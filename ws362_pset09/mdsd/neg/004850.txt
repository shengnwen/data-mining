Ask yourself just one question:  If a convicted murderer serving a life sentence without the chance for parole brutually kills a prison guard, what penalty is given to this miscreant?  A life sentence?  Justice can only be done by taking this "person's" life in a short and swift time frame. Also have you noticed how many attorneys have a great deal of their income from defending these people and who pays, of course we do. I say shorten the appeal process and make it swift. Make it mandatory at every appeal hearing to show the death pictures if available of all the victims that were brutually killed. Plus limit the testimony based on the upbringing or childhood of the murderer. Who cares? One simple question in this regard, did he/she do the crime
