I have the original hardcover edition of this book published in 1983 and it is one of the worst biographies I have ever read. It was virtually co-authored by Veronica's grasping stage-mother who used her as a meal ticket and who also sued her for support once the money dried up. Miss Lake's real problem was alcohol and this book's dubious (and central) theme that she was a paranoid schizophrenic does not seem based on medical fact. The authors provide no proof of this 'diagnosis' -- only hearsay -- with Veronica's redoubtable mother as the only reference. The real truth about this beautiful, tragic actress who was more sinned against than sinning remains to be told, and sadly, may never be. Miss Lake's own autobiography "Veronica", while glossing over a lot, gives a much better sense of her as a person -- flawed, alcoholic, but seeking only love and peace of mind in a much less enlightened world than today
