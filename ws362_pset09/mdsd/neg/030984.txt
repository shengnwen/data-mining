Reading throug this mess was like banging my head to the wall.  Niles is undoubtedly one of the most talentless writers in the TSR/WoC branch.  The whole book is on autopilot, characters fall out and then fall back in, but you don't care, because you can't get a hold on them.  The villain and the surprise, even the setting are all obviously just plot devices, I couldn't care less.  The dwarven kingdom has never been sooo boring and dull.  There is no sense of time, doom and loss, and the whole is impersonal.  Skip it and you won't miss a beat [in the series]
