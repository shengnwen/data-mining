I was excited to get this book because of the great reveiws it received.  But I quickly became dissapointed.  The beginning started off good and had lots of promise to be an exciting and enjoyable read...but after I read 40 pages still nothing exciting happened.  It took forever for the two main characters to get together, I was bored with them.  And I really got sick of hearing about all the friends and their boring lives.  Usually I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips's novels.  My favorites being Kiss an Angel and Dream a Little Dream
