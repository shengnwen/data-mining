I  liked Yate's novel "Revolutionary Road" very much, but found Easter Parade  disappointing. Lots happens in a short book, and Yates exhibits the clean, simple prose style of a good crime writer. Looking back, at the end of the novel, I was touched by all the fruitless effort Emily Grimes had put into establishing a satisfying long term relationship, only to be thwarted by the limitations of the men in her life.  Yet Yates is really writing about people, not making them come alive as well developed characters.  When Emily turns her back on her sister, which should be a major event, it is almost casually dismissed.  "The Easter Parade" is readable, but it is not good literature.
