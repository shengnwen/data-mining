I have no idea why this one's still in print, much less in so many editions, as if it was some sort of classic.

What "Miss Blandish" is, quite simply, is a straightforward rip, in theme, incident, characterization, and plot, of Faulkner's "Sanctuary". If you read "Sanctuary", you'll be  effectively getting the same story, plus a much higher level of writing, plus an introduction to one of the great writers of the past century. So don't waste your time on this thing.

Chase was a serial plagiarist, and also made a play at copying "The Big Sleep". Chandler, faster off the mark than Faulkner, hit him with a lawsuit and forced the book off the market. So you won't find that one on Amazon.
