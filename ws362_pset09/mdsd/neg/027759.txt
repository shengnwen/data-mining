To me, a successful overview of the Middle East should be (1) factual, and (2) unbiased.  I read many of the reviews that stated this book was biased, but there were enough positive reviews that I figured the charges of bias were just the inevitable result of glossing over some details for brevity's sake.

I was wrong.  This book is so heavily biased that it reads more like propaganda than a fair account of history.  After a few chapters, I found myself questioning the validity of the facts themselves -- at that point, the book was pretty much useless to me. 

To illustrate my point (and because I didn't heed the "bias" calls from earlier reviewers), I decided to include two quick samples of the bias in the book:
-- This statement on p. 69, which is indicative of the tone of the book:  "The Arabs weren't happy with Jewish immigration because they believed it would lead to their displacement from Palestine.  This assumption simply was not the case, and subsequent history would prove it."
-- A recurring sidebar called "Tut Tut!" is supposed to correct common "mistakes & misstatements" about the Middle East.  There are 38 of these sidebars in the book -- 28 are pro-Israeli, 13 are neutral or indeterminate, none are pro-Arab.  

Now, I'm not pro-Arab (or pro-Israeli, for that matter).  But seriously - the most contentious subject in the history of mankind, and the author can't even find one example (out of 38 sidebars) of an incorrect statement that bolsters the Arab cause?  How is this kind of bias helping us to understand (and maybe eventually solve) the problems in this region?  I think a book this biased simply makes matters worse by perpetuating the arguments of one side.

Bottom line -- if you're looking for a fair discussion of the Middle East, there have GOT to be better books out there -- I'd suggest moving on to another book.  And if you find a good one, please post a review - I'm still looking.
