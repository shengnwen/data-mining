This book did have a great start... I was flipping through the pages reading, and I was left with a one page- "how to"... I thought that this whole book was to HELP you conquer your insecurities, not just give you a quick little "over-view" of what you're SUPPOSED to be doing... 
The title is misleading, and I definently wouldn't recommend this self-help book to anyone
