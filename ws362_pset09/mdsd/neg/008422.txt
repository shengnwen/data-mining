You would think a book with a title "How to learn golf" would teach you something about how to play golf wouldn't you? Well not this one. Instead, it gives uninteresting statistics on golfers like how many people took up the game in 2000 or how many people quit the game (who cares!). Also the book tells of different ways to go about learning golf such as going to a pro or reading a book. As for myself, I chose reading a book, and unfortuanetly i chose this one. Don't buy this book
