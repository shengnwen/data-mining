I began my study of political philosophy with the best - namely Plato - so I suppose that when I began reading Aristotle's The Politics, I was optimistic.  That optimism didn't last.  I find that Aristotle takes many arguments for granted and ignores entirely others that would call into question some of his premises.  Often while reading The Politics, I found his analysis entirely lackluster, and his criticisms of The Republic, Gorgias and Laws (all by Plato) flawed or at least overly simplistic.  It's not that I'm incapable of appreciating the brand of philosophy Aristotle uses, after all I do consider myself more or less a realist.  But rather I did find it lacking of vision and insight.  Aristotle focuses on such parochial matters such as classifications of constitutions and mastery over slaves in the household versus statesmanship in the nation, that it never moved me or left me in deeply pensive state.  Ultimately, if you want to be truly inspired - read Plato, not Aristotle
