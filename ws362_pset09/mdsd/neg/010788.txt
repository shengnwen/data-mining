I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a &quot;Wim&quot; in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;Safe Harbour&quot;.  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try
