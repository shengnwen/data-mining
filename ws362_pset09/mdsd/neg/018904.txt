I have read several books on creativity and spirituality. I had hoped to use this book for a group study at my church, but ended up being very disappointed. There is little here that seemed new and fresh.  

One note:  It seems completely geared toward women.  All the stories and examples are very feminine in perspective, and that is fine, but it should say so in the description.  I think a typical male would have a hard time relating to it.  My guess is that traditional women from conservative, evangelical churches would find this book most helpful.
