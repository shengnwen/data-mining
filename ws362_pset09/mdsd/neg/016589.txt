When reading the author's mention of driving to synagogue on Shabbat, or cooking on Friday Nights, a voice at the back of my mind told me that such a thing (breaking the Sabbath) would have been abhorrent to my ancestors and 4,000 years of Jewish tradition. Although the author's Judaism fits very well in the context of contemporary American society, for those of us interested in the Religion of our Forefathers.

Readers on a true spiritual search or those looking for something more authentic might be interested in Buber's "Tales of the Hasidim" or Heschel's "An Island in Time". Though less 'modern', they impart more meaning and relevance
