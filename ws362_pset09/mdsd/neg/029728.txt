Despite what appears to be the vast majority of opinions on this book, I found this book very difficult to get through. What De Pree writes as "authoritative" leadership concepts, I see as nothing more than common sense. Perhaps I have been blessed to work in a company that touts similar values and beliefs or perhaps I am just a person that already believes that it is the diversity of people that is what makes a company successful. But I found dredging through De Pree's long lists of leadership principles exhaustive and frustrating. I didn't find this book revolutionary (which is how he seems to write it) or even particularly interesting. "Man's Search For Meaning" is a FAR more compelling leadership read...
