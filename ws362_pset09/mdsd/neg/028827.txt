This book is generally outdated and written from the perspective of someone who wanted to offer an alternative to psychological interventions which he believed did not work.  But, he never proved that they did not work.  It was an exploration of new territory in the time that it was written, and does not hold much beyond historical value; as there are other books which explain cognitive theories of emotional disturbance and treatment for such in a more clear and precise manner.
To the previous reviewer, talking is not primitive.  Black and white thinking is.  Wanting to simply explain and control is entirely primitive and based in fear and anxiety.  It is why we have gods, myths, fairy tales and legends.  Sitting in a room with someone you trust and talking through your problems is not primitive. Whether it is a friend, a relative, a stranger or a therapist, it is progressive and courageous; even by today's standards.  Trusting another human being and making a connection with them is superior human behavior.   
Now, lets stop trying to be the one who has it right and start working together to heal people
