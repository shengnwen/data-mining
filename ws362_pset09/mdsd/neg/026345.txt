I'll make this real quick. This book is basically a re-hash of existing material written in greater depth by others, such as Zechariah Sitchin's series of books starting with the &quot;12th Planet&quot;. This book really isn't even good enough for beginners on the subject, as the author jumps from subject to subject with little continuity. This is at best an appetizer for the main course
