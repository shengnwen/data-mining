This is not a very good book of Joan Chittister, the book feels dated and the thought patter is scattered.  I thought for sure it was written in the early 1970s with the political bent and anti-traditionalist religious life feeling.  The references to her young nun life in a community pre-molestation by experiments, is interesting as those are the very communities that are growing.  "Sister" Joan has better books; Rule of St. Benedict Insights for the Ages is superior to this particular effort. Look for that book instead
