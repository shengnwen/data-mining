I borrowed this book a while ago, hoping for an enjoyable light read. Unfortunately not. 

The main character of this series, Amelia Peabody, is supposedly interesting. Unfortunately not. Obsessed that men are the evil of every age, her rants occupy almost every page. Her "supposed insights" and commentary were so long that I found myself speed-reading through the pages, scanning as many as 20 pages every few minutes. 

The sidekick is just as annoying. While she isn't complaining about the weather, she is busy fainting. 

Anyone who has read a handful of mystery books would already know who the "Mummy" was. What little intrigue there was, was ruined by the predictability. 

Although the writing was quite enjoyable, it was ruined by many of the characters. I'd take one of the case studies of Sherlock Holmes over this any day. Or any book by PD James or JD Robb.
