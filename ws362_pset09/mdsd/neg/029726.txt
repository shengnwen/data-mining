I'm a huge Alton Brown fan. This is one of the books I asked for when my birthday came around. I thought I wanted it after reading the reviews and thought it sounded good. I was very disappointed. While there is some good information in it, it's mostly blank pages that you write your own recipes in w/ your notes. There are a few clear plastic pages so that you can put in recipe clippings and instructions and warranties for various kitchen gadgets, but a simple file folder would solve that. Sadly, I will be returning this book and finding something else to purchase
