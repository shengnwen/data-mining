Since the title is &quot;7 Simple Steps&quot; I thought the book would offer a clear, specific program for getting organized.  Instead, it's more of a general advice book for overall self-improvement.  The first chapter, for example, is about losing weight and getting in shape, and the advice is frustratingly familiar. Eat lowfat foods, exercise every day, etc. etc. There's not much in this book that the average reader of women's magazine won't already know
