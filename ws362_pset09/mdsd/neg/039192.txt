If this book wasn't so full of valuable information, I wouldn't have given it a single star.  The proof reader slept through this edition.  There are more errors than I could have ever imagined.  They sometimes refer to the same variable by different names in succeeding paragraphs!  Many times they leave off critical subscript identifiers or don't label important values in the example figures.  Small errors crop up all the way through this edition.  Hope they fix the Seventh
