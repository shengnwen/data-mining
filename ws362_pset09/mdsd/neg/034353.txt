I wanted to like this book.  I wanted to learn something about the modern rise of anti-semitism.  Sometimes, you just don't get what you want.

I read the book, hoping to answer some serious questions: Is anti-Zionism the same as anti-semitism ?  Are Jewish anti-Zionists experiencing self-hate ?  Is the rise of European anti-semitism a product of long lasting traditions or a by-product of Muslim immigration ?  I still have these questions.

The book does attempt to address these issues.  It does so by a selectively culling statements, events, and quotes.  Where a book of this nature would demand 100's of pages, the author here feels that his cobbled collection of editorials can address these issues with limited research and less than 200 pages.  It is tragic that such a serious topic is handled, so casually.

Like many people, I fear a second Holocaust prompted by Iranian nuclear ambitions.  What does Schoenfeld think of this issue ?  He agrees that such a threat exists, but sees fit to address it in only one paragraph.

What about a solution to the rise of anti-semitism ?  The only one I can find, is the belief that a stable democratic Iraq will reduce the phenomena.  I don't want to get too political here, but that's a pretty disquieting source of optimism.

There is something here, but there's not quite enough.  I don't disagree with the author, but I don't feel that throwing out a collection of individual opinions constitutes a serious analysis of a serious topic.
