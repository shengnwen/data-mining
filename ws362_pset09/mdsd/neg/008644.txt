If I could give this book Negative three stars, I would.  I found it to be pretentious and not at all helpful in planning.  For instance it says that a bride that has a precious moments cake topper is probably too yound to be  married.  Also, they give a thumbs down to fountains in wedding cakes.   Instead of helping you plan a wedding in your taste, they are inflicting  their STRONG opinions on the bride-to-be.  This is the only book I have  ever returned in my life. It doesn't answer any of the questions brides  have, like what order veryone walks in the processional or any suggestions  for music or flowers.  Don't waste your money on this book if you need a  wedding planner
