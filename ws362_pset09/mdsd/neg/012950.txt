I enjoyed The Illuminator, however, like some other reviewers had problems with it. While not a middle ages expert, even my novice eye was attracted to absurd name choices. My MAIN concern is this book parallels Anya Seton's Katherine so much that I TRULY felt uncomfortable. While John of Gaunt and Julian of Norich are real historical figures their "voice" in The Illuminator too closely paralled Seton's. About a fourth of the way through the book, I desperately checked the Acknowlegements section for credit to Seton and Katherine- none was given! It almost seems as if a copy of Katherine was at the elbow of this author. Basically, the illuminator IS Katherine, but told from a different point of view. As one reviewer noted, names seem either ubsurd or "ripped off" i.e Rebekka (Ivanhoe) and Kathryn (Katherine). Perhaps someone should check into this....again, I did enjoy the book, but since I had just read Katherine before The Illuminator I was consistently distracted by the TOO many similarities.
