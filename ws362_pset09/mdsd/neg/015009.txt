This was my first time reading The Yoga Sutras, and I struggled with it for weeks and finished it only with great effort.  The writing was dry, confusing, and I was often pausing to look up words (both English and Sanskrit).  I would only recommend this book if you are a scholar interested in reading every translation of the Yoga Sutras, or if you are a devoted friend of the author.  I bought this book as a required text for a class.  It turns out the author is a friend of the teacher who assigned our reading list.  What a disappointment
