This dreary account of a foul-mouthed adulterer who consistently makes the wrong choices might remind some of other tragic characters in great fiction, such as the protagonist in An American Tragedy or in  Crime and Punishment or Madame Bovary.  But the difference here is that Bob Dubois never learns, he repeatedly does the dumb thing, whether it is adultery or use of dope or abusing his wife or his poor innocent children.  One can hardly help being disgusted by a man who does not seem to have a brain in his body.  Only a moron would break all the windows in his own car when he is short of money for his wife and kids, or wreck his home, or booze and do dope when he does not know how to pay for necessary care for his child.  As for all the stuff about voodoo this may be interest to some but to me was a bore.  Surely the account of the Haitians' plight is distressing, but it helps to make this book a depressing one.  Frankly I was glad when I finished this pretentious and not well-written book, and thought Dubois got what he asked for and deserved
