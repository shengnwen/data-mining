I was required to read some of this book as part of the U. of Washington's &quot;Freshman Interest Group&quot; program, and I find it difficult to believe that it is getting so many good reviews.  Though I'm sure Prof. Light means well, it is little more than a summary of statistics gathered during his student interviews, and many parts of the book don't even seem to be addressed to students.  The only &quot;advice&quot; offered is based on statistical trends from his research with the result that it is extremely vague.  Furthermore, the book is so impersonal in tone that there was nearly nothing I could relate to as an entering college student.  Some accounts of individual students' experiences are used, as well as direct quotes from the interviews, but for the most part, these are chosen just because they enthusiastically back up one of Light's points.  If these heavily sugar-coated quotes reflect the majority of the student interviews, I have a hard time believing they were very candid.  Though I don't mean to completely lambast this book, because it could be of value to college teachers or administrators, and it does have a few interesting sections, I can't imagine it actually helping very many students.  The sections on diversity, effective classes, and effective mentoring are completely useless from most students' perspective
