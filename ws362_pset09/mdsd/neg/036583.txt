The description sounded promising, but in fact this is one of the least well-written books I've read in a long time.  The prose iss stilted.  Sentence fragments abound.  The style is that of a 16 year old writing a travelogue, complete with irrelevant details about every aspect of the author's daily routine.  Harold Truman has an unusual fondness for italics, and puts quotation marks around the title of each chapter.  Don't waste your time or your money on this book
