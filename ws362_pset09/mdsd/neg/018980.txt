UGH yet another waste of time. it was slow/boring and took forever for me to read. I am serious when I say that I am SHOCKED you all like it so..I could not wait to finish it. it was not as bad as Wolves In Chic Clothing but it was pretty useless in my opinion. I had to finish it because thats the way I am... but what a waste of  time....pass this over..it was not intresting at all.. basically "girl finds love,friends and a rat infested house.." THE END  
I had no motivation to read it at al
