I thought this book was terribly dull and uninteresting.  I had to read this for a college course and was deeply disappointed in the material and the story line.  I had to literally force myself to stay awake and read another sentence.  Yes, it was that bad.  I do not reccomend this book to anyone.  In fact I have warned avid reads, like myself, to never pick the book up. I am a reader who likes thick plots, action, mystery, everything but what this book had to offer.  

I do not think I learned anything that opened my mind to another culture or about life in general.  The book jumped around a lot between present and past and it was easy to get confused and disinterested.  Not to be too harsh but: horrible, horrible, horrible!  Save yourself the time, money, and effort.  Read another book
