I was really hoping to find some great information and insight into unschooling with this book.  What I found was one woman's narrow-minded opinions about parenting.  The foundation for her strong opinions appears to be a traumatic childhood, a few 1970's books on unschooling, and the experience of raising her only child.  

She is extreme and harsh in her judgments.  Nothing stated in this book is backed by any sort of data.  If you actually look up her daughter online, you will find a woman who is unsure about her radical upbringing.  The daughter does not view the experience with the same nostalgia and romance as her mother.

Needless to say, I think this book was a disaster.  If you are looking for a very extreme viewpoint on unschooling presented as one woman's memoir, than this is the book for you.  If you are looking for some genuine insight and information on unschooling, I would look elsewhere.
