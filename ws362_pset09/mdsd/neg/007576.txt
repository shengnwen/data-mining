Quite possibly the worst book that I have ever read.  It is an infomercial from start to finish.  At least one comparison as to how efficiently Target is managed compared to other stores actually proves the opposite of what the clueless author intends (If you look at the numbers).  It is pure hype with no real value to anyone who graduated high School
