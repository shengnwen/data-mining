I'm sure that somewhere in this book there is a story, but it wasn't worth the cost of finding it.  Started reading this and got 100 pages into it before saying enough with all the obscure references, historical meanderings, and pointless speculations.  Seems like this book's real purpose is to test the reader's intellectual bona fides rather than to present a well written, intriguing story.  It was a slog and people who want to give it great ratings, I think, do so because they're afraid people will think them stupid if they tell the truth.  Call me stupid then, but this book needed a good editor and someone to tell this pretentious author to move the story along once in a while and lighten up on the obscure/pointless ramblings. My congratulations to those who managed to get to the end of this 533 page snooze fest.  You have my admiration for your tenacity.

I note that people usually rate one or two star reviews as unhelpful.  But take a look at lots of reviews of this book.  The majority of them say it is a long, boring slog, then they give it a 3 star rating.  How helpful is that?
