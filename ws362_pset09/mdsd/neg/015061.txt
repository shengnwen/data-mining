I was expecting much more from Martha!! I wonder if she evens knows what this planner has (or actually, doesnt have) in it! I would not recommend purchasing this. Definitely go to a book store and preview the planner before purchasing. The only things I like about it are that its full sized with a lot of places to store misc. papers and the advice that comes with it. But, I subsrube to MS weddings, put the advice in there. I like the Simple Stunning wedding planner much better. I felt the MS Planner was a whole lot of nothing.
