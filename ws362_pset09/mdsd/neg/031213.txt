I workout all the time and I am constantly buying new health books and comparing them to each other and adding  what i read and learn to my workout routine. This book is great for someone who has not picked up a weight in their life. For someone who is intermediate or advanced its not worth the money. Yet i bought it anyway just to have in my collection. If you really wanted to get serious about it I recommend "arnolds encyclopedia of bodybuilding" it is by far the best boook for adding muscle and trimming down. (be advised Arnolds book is for those who really want the info to buff up
