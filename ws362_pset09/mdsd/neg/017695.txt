How sad it is to see what began as a fun series of books end this way. The only good thing in this book is the departure of Polly.  She was much too staid for Qwilleran who needs some fun in his life.  Years ago we did not understand why the author "bumped off" the doctor love interest, suddenly turning her into a villain.  The series began to take on a certain listlessness.  That said, I would like to see Mrs Braun find a competent and enthusiastic co-author who can restore the original concept because Koko and Yum Yum deserve to go out in a blaze of glory.  Besides I would like to know if the barn actually was destroyed by the fire, even if Qwill himself didn't bother to find out
