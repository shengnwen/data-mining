This book may have been ideal for British parents, but it just doesn't seem to work as well here. Some of the menu ideas are really odd, like mackerel and vegetable mash, chicken with leeks, lemony fish, and moroccan lamb with couscous. Not exactly standard dinner ideas for the 9 to 12 month olds I know.

The book does have some very helpful information on nutrition, but that's only 25 pages worth total.
