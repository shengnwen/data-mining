Truly a fascinating premise...I've always wanted a time machine of my own, but the protagonist wastes his opportunity.  So does the author.  The style is quite true to the characters, though, right down to the  you-have-to-have-been-there-to-know England.  Particularly fascinating were  the fragmentary documents discovered along the way...mind-blowing concepts  like a brochure for the Zooseum owned by Disney-Vatican; a final message by  a desperate medico to her family recommending a particular METHOD of  suicide (not if, just how), followed by the arrest report made by the  military.  If you're into postapocalyptic imagery (especially if you've  been to England) and liked Shute's On The Beach, you'll enjoy this one.  If  not, just take the two incidental concepts I've spoiled for you and pen  your own version of what could happen if the world doesn't realize that  eight billion people can't all live the California dream; you'll probably  have more fun, and you'll certainly save time
