Jane Smiley's _A_Thousand_Acres_ had a great deal of potential.  It had a powerful plot (King Lear) that has been little-adapted in modern times.  Smiley chose an interesting and rich setting in her modern day heartland farm.  However, the actual execution of the book leaves much to be desired.

First and foremost, Smiley writes exactly like a writer who has just completed a college writing program.  She uses smart and subtle humor (one may say wit), metaphors and similes.  The problem is that one is conscious at each and every juncture that she is using a simile, a metaphor, or a quip.  While more seasoned writers might have woven beauty into readable text or else have chosen to complexify and engage a reader, instead she chose a middleground that is neither challenging nor readable.  The reader constantly is forced to swallow some rather ridiculous metaphors, all the while conscious that they are swallowing a textbook, but ridiculous, metaphor.

And while the plot taken from Shakespeare had a lot of potential, it was handled quite inexpertly.  Yes, Smiley chose the intelligent path and abandoned Lear about 3/4 of the way through (so that everyone doesn't die).  However, once again, she writes in a way that makes every reader -conscious- that she is adapting Shakespeare, and at times the plot seems ridiculous in its current setting.  Yes, she sheds new light (the protagonist is the Goneril-character, who was a Shakespearean antagonist) in a very intriguing way.  Yes, she invents new excuses for her behavior (former child abuse)... however, had she not tried so hard to make the reader conscious that she was adapting Shakespeare, these plausable interpretations might not have seemed -in-plausable.

All in all, a book with many potent seeds that were not sown to anything near their full value
