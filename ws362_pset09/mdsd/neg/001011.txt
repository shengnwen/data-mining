I was sadly disappointed with this cookbook for toddlers!  It had nothing to do with my son's likes and dislikes.  I found these recipes didn't work for me (and I am not a bad cook.)  The mattar paneer was too soupy.  The homemade rice cereal was too thick.  The foil-baked chicken was not done at the prescribed time.  And the banana cake was greasy and flat.  I have found that cooking from other "adult" cookbooks works well for my toddler.  I just adjust the ingredients if it calls for too much salt or is too spicy.  No need to buy this cookbook
