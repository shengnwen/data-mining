I enjoyed this book much more than I had originally expected when I bought it.  I 'had' to read it as an assignment, but I have to say that it was very encouraging! Everyone has a dream to do or be something other than what they currently are/doing.  This book rekindles the flame of the dream within us to actually stop making excuses and to 'go for it!
