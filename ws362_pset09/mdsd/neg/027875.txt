Dr Laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment. 
It is unfortunate that she chose to use this relationship book as her soapbox to promote her own religous beliefs. If you dont believe in God and as Dr Laura, you can never be happy is the moral of her story.
Laura makes a number of irresponsbile and misleading statements such as calling daycare, modern child abandonment.
She talks about chastity until marriage several times and about 'shacking up' to use her term but never once does she explain why monogomy is important in a healthy relationship and she absolutely never mentions that a relationship has a natural progression part of which is physical. She moves the step of marriage up to be much sooner than it should be in a relationship while at the same time saying people should wait 'through the 4 seasons' or a year before being married.
Actually says 'it is dangerous to pursue a physical relationship without the promise of marriage'. Is she saying men should promise marriage before they are ready?

She would have produced a much better book if she had given more examples of callers to her radio show or letters and given less malformed advice. Her rants and raves are actually entertaining, too bad that along with examples were cut short with her religious promotions and poorly thought advice snippets.

I listened to the whole thing(audio book cd) and I couldnt list the 10 stupid things implied in the title. I guess they are there and maybe under chapters 1-10 in the book. I could call out several stupid things but I didnt see 10 that stood out. Lots of it was common sense and phsychologically off callers made it obvious.

It is fun to listen to but make sure it is not the only book you use as a source. There are other better sources for relationship info.
