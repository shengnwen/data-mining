This is, with no doubt in my mind, the worst book on Active Directory I have seen. I can't believe Sybex decided to publish the second edition (let alone the first) with all errors and such superficial coverage of practically every Active Directory topic. I'm under impression that its author had no practical experience in dealing with any real Active Directory deployment. If you are serious about learning Active Directory from experts, check &quot;Mission Critical Active Directory&quot; by Jan De Clercq and Micky Balladelli (Digital Press) or &quot;Windows 2000 Active Directory&quot; by Alistair Lowe-Norris (O'Reilly)
