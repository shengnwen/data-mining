This book provides a good overview of blacks (slave and free) in New York. It's a very good reference (encyclopedic) book.

My main problem with it is that Leslie M. Harris, the author, relies heavily (if not entirely) on secondary sources. The book, then, is nothing more than a patchwork of various other more scholarly works. Hence, finding the actual primary source (i.e. court decision, council minutes, etc) proves extremely difficult.

I do not recommend this book for advanced students. If, however, you're interested in an easy read and don't care about sources, this is the book for you
