This is the first book I've read by Karen Hawkins.
I just did not like this book.  Fiona seemed too selfish, I really tried to like her, but she just annoyed me (the way she was mad at Jack for not changing for her after shes forced him to marry her). The family curse seemed interesting but it got tiresome and Fiona's brothers just seemed to get in the way too much.  I thought maybe the curse would play a bigger role towards the end of the book and it started to, but it all just died out.  I didn't buy Fiona and Jack's love for each other either.  I was more interested in Lucinda than any of the other characters.  The end of the book is the worst, there was hardly any resolve, it all seemed rushed and ended too abruptly.  Some people really liked this book, I just expect more from a historic romance.
