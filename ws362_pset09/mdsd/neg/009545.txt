A good book explains a subject in understandable language.  Intelligent authors translate complex subjects, when billed as introductions, into terminology understandable by neophytes. Despite the abundance of printed praise on the jacket, this book is an excellent example of the opposite.
 Perhaps a passage will demonstrate: "In saying that I justifiedly believe there is a green field before me, I am implying something else, something quite different, though it sounds very similar, namely, that I am justified in believing there is a green field before me."
There is an old rule concerning definitions that states, for clarity, do not to use the same word.  This passage deals with defining justification and confounds the matter by attempting to introduce as separate concepts 'justified belief' and 'justified in believing.' There is little clarity here or elsewhere in the text. I sincerely regret purchasing this book
