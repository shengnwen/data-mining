Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type.
The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it
