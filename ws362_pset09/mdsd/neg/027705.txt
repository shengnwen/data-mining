What a titel! I expected information about film I haven't heard about, but all I found was a book about underrated, but noneless well-known pictures. Or do you know a person who don't know &quot;The Adventures of Robin  Hood&quot; or &quot;Out of the Past&quot; or &quot;My Darling  Clemtine&quot;? These are classics, man! Everyone interested in movies had  heard about it. So where is the book that keeps the promise this titel  implies
