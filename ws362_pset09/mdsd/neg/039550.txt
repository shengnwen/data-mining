Gun nuts NEED to have their guns taken away.  What the NRA doesn't want you to know is that most firearm murders are committed by legal gun owners against members of their own families or other close friends and associates.  They also don't want you to know how many children die every year by accidents with firearms and suicide by firearm--if those guns weren't lying around the house for them to find, those accidents and those suicides would not happen.  I pray for the day that the US government will get the moral compass necessary to GET GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PRIVATE CITIZENS.
