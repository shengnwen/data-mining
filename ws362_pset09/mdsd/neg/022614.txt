I read this book as a teenager and thought it was pretty cool.  20 years have passed and I thought I'd give it another read.  And I have to say, that I really didn't like it all that much.  The book doesn't really seem to be focused on an event or a character.  Instead the author introduces a slew of characters that you neither care about nor are they really tracked through the story.  And the few characters that recur enough to remember them, are really cardboard constructs rather than something you'd relate to.

As far as the main plot goes, it got off to a very slow start.  It tries to pick up a little bit in the middle and will leave you with a half-finished feeling.  I'm a fan of the aliens invading earth premise but this was just a disappointment.  Either that or it's been done better in the last 20 years
