I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich!  I quickly read all of them and wanted more!  Then I found the "Full" series, including this volume, "Full Bloom".  I was really disappointed to find that this is just an average romance, not very well-written.  The humor, which just flows in the Plum novels, is very strained.  A better choice for Stephanie Plum fans who are waiting for the next installment might be "Bubbles in Trouble" or any of the "Bubbles" books.
