I had always really liked Tatum O'Neal - just felt she was gorgeous and had a pretty soft spoken voice.  I was interested in picking up this book to know more about her.  I am glad other reviewers noticed the constant name dropping.  If she had any 10 second encounter with another celebrity - she wrote about it.  These encounters couldn't have had any real effect on her life - she needn't have mentioned them.  I came away thinking she didn't have any real emotional attachment with anyone except herself and that she meant only to divulge painful episodes in her past so that others could have a chance to pity her. She manages to place blame on everyone around her (her husband, her father) and doesn't seem to learn any real lesson from the things that happened. The book is short, poorly written - doesn't touch on any one part with any detail  but hurries along totell you how she met Michael Jackson for a couple of seconds. The tales do border on unbelievable & incredibly sad. With all the material she had to work with she didn't put any body & soul into this book & we never really do get to know her.  I know I wasted my money in buying this book - it was clearly destined for a dollar store shelf
