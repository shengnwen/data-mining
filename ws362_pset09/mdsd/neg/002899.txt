     Mr. Null is renowned for being an expert in his field. His expertise and insights are often invaluable. However, in his book, "The Joy of Juicing" his experience appears to be overshadowed by generalities and a lack of research. For example, in the opening sentences, Mr. Null recommends that readers purchase a centrifugal juicer despite the fact that there is plenty of research showing that centrifugal juicers are not the best choice when compared to single gear and twin gear juicers. In addition, there is scientific research showing that centrifugal juicers create static electricity during the juicing process that kills vital enzymes and nutrients. Centrifugal juicers are also not the best choice for many fibrous types of greens since overheating can easily occur.
     The balance of the book is dedicated to recipes that are categorized by courses. While the recipes sound interesting, it would have been helpful for Mr. Null to explain why the recipes are beneficial for the prescribed ailment or purpose for which they were intended. Examples include juices with names such as "Beauty", "Fountain of Youth" and "Brain Juice." Also, in the section on "Soups" and "Main Dishes," Mr. Null juices certain vegetables prior to boiling them. Considering that there is much research showing that nutrients and enzymes are killed after heating above 118 degrees, it makes no sense to extract a juice and spend up to 15 minutes boiling it to death.
