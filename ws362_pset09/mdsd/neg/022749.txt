Since the description of the book is NONEXISTANT, I just wanted to make it known that the solution guide only has solutions to the odd numbered exercises - no evens. It also does not work out each odd one either. With the odd numbers' answers in the back of the accompanying textbook, this solution guide (with only a few worked out solutions, all in a large font size making it seem like a big book) is not worth my time or money
