It's important to know in considering this book that it is pretty much Morell's thesis, so if you dislike dry, academic work, it's probably not for you. While the book addresses many of the issues that intentionally childless women face (especially the 'compensation' and 'regret' stereotypes), it really hesitates to delve deeply into the sociopolitical/psychological causes and implications. I felt the book was far too heavily reliant on extensive and repetitive quotes from Morell's survey respondents- as such, it really prevented the narrative from gathering speed or developing into something powerful or revelatory. The scope of the research and the profiles of the intentionally childless women presented by Morell are extremely limited, as she herself acknowledges: mostly middle-aged, Caucasian, heterosexual, and married/in an LTR. In short, this book is the first of its kind, and it is groundbreaking. But as a feminist reader and a happily child-free woman, I'm ready for the next step.
