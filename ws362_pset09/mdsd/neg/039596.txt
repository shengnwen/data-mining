This is a decent book outlining the basic tenets of libertarian philopshy on how things work in the real world. My problem with the book is it never deals with the real issues of the left with free trade that is the doctrine being pushed on Thrid World countries. Then the arguments become absurd. Unions have become more militant in the US because of their lack of power and Mexican women are happy to work 80 hours per week and love taking birth controll pills evry morning as prerequsit to employment (Roberts dosent say this but these are the conditions under whihc many people work in free trade zones. So if he claims Mexicans love the jobs that are brought through NAFTA and dont want clean drinking water or clean air then they must love these conitions). And i love this argument: America had sweathops too. But the book forgets to mention that free trade  did not improve the conditions of wrokers in this country, collective actions by the workers did.  Also a little history fact: No country has ever industriliazed through free trade and that is the truth no matter what your economics books tell you.  However, this does not delegitimize the free trade doctorine but it is certainly something that needs to be talked about.  Read Globalization and Its Discontents by Stieglitz instead
