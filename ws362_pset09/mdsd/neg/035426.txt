This is yet another book on how to mold yourself into the perfect little military wife. Give me a break. While it does address women having careers, it emphasizes the need for military spouses to participate heavily in their husbands' careers and placing your spouses' careers first, explaining that eventhough he may not want to or may not need to go to your office functions, you still have to go to his for the good of his career. It is the same garbage that every other guide has. 
It does address the ranking system wives seem to think applies to them because of their spouses, but gives you tips on how to be more understanding of it, as if it's okay for people to treat you like less simply because their husband outranks your husband.
Ladies, do yourself a favor and worry about having your own lives and your own education and your own careers, cause when he is gone on deployment cookie baking and sitting at home waiting for him, and listening to the other wives criticize you for not  doing whatever it is they think is important is a complete waste of time and it will depress you. You need to develop your own lives and your own talents and hobbies. The 1950s wifely lifestyle will drive you batty.
Save your money and use it for something that will uplift you
