The book starts off decent, then becomes useless dribble, How a ghost hunter can believe in ghosts and then proceed to say that all spirit communication is the work of satan and evil demons is pure nonsense, discarnate humans show up fo his amusement but only demons show up for Spiritualist seances, pure junk ! he also attacts the occult sciences as means for demon obsession, and claims Witchcraft is the work of the devil, what is this guy doing living in the 13 century ? or just spotting off christian bigotry ? oh, and by the way, going to cemetaries to look for ghosts is like going to candy stores looking for sugar, get real, either ghosts exist or they don't, oh, I also liked the way he sumed up psychics as useless con men. it just proves that any one can write a book and claim to be an expert.need I say more ?  don't waste your money
