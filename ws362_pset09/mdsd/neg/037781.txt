This book begins with the arrogant assertion that psychology in general, and the author in particular, can change mankind and create a "caring and compassionate" society in which genocide and all lesser forms of evil will be unthinkable.  It then goes through several hundred pages of repetitive ramblings, introducing and summarily dismissing the theories of Hobbes, Freud, and many others, relegating Nietzche to the position of Hitler's ego, and ultimately arriving at a conclusion that could have been summed up in a short article: humans are frustrated by "difficult life conditions" (a phrase which grates on the mind with each repetition after the first 50 pages of overusage), which causes them to join together to lash out against those who they deem responsible.  His interpretations of the causes of the four instances of genocide which he chooses to discuss seem absurd in some cases, and contradict themselves in others.  The last two chapters outline the author's naive plan for the construction of a warm and fuzzy world of understanding and compassion.  Even if his plan were plausible, his view of human nature is ultimately deluded and irrational, and it is therefore of no value.  Some may say this reviewer is cynical or jaded, but I prefer realism to useless optimism.  An authoritative book on the psychological drives behind mass killings which brings together the ideas of many great minds and uses convincing evidence to support itself would be most welcome.  This, however, is not it
