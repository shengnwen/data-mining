I expected much more from this book. I'm not really sure why, though, because we formerly used the Gallup test to select our  sales people. This could have been a good book. But the authors seriously miss the mark. They are clearly more interested in selling their own version of a sales test than giving sales people useful information. Most of the information they do share is not new. It's the same old stuff you get in Marcus Buckingham's Gallup sales brouchure also marketed as a book. The biggest problem with Benson and Rutigliano's book is the airy fairy untested psycho fluff they're trying to float as established scientific discoveries. The two authors are both Gallup's hired hands. They say successful salespeople are successful because they share one common trait. They "use their strongest aptitudes" to succeed in their work. "Strongest aptitudes?" Where haven't we heard that one before? What about intelligence and motivation and values and skill development? This book reads smoothly but won't work in practice. I know because we used to use the principles marketed in this book. But the selection mistakes proved too costly as we found out they also did for other users. Forget about the strenthfinder test this book touts. The book is an undisguised phising expedition for more people to take their sales test. But who cares? Does anyone still think you can trust surveys collected on the web? There are plenty of excellent books out there for sales people. Miller and Heiman, Tony Parinello, Spin Selling (one of my favorites), Dudley and Goodson (another favorite), Zig Ziglar, Huthwaite, these are the books salespeople should be reading
