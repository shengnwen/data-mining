If you can divorce yourself from the lyrics (and show) that really says nothing... and says it quite crassly, the music is amazing.  

I believe the composer is extremely talented and could make a competition quality arrangement of "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall". Too bad this set of music doesn't say something equally important.  Perhaps next time.
