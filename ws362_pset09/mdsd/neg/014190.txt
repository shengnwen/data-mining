The book is very simple and tertiary.  Lightly discusses a number of topics.  Details related to form and execution are lacking for someone who claims to have their Doctorate.  The illustration is worse than what I can create on my home computer.  The real issue I have is that the author and the publisher are both deceptive in their practices.  Although the book appears to be a significant volume...in fact, it is triple spaced text with 20-26 font all to increase the number of pages to appear as if the book is a significant volume.  In addition, the basics for any book such as an Index are missing entirely.  This book is a joke even if it was priced at $3-$4 it would not be worth the shipping &amp; handling
