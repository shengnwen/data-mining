The cover states that there are forwards written by Dick Brannan, Arnie Beswick and Hayden Proffitt. My copy contained no forwards of any kind. Actual facts and research are words that can only be used loosely to describe this book. Most of it reads like a compilation of material pulled together from previously published sources, and written poorly. I was anticipating this book, but once I knew who the authors were (read some reviews on their other titles), my expectations were lowered accordingly. I am a factory lightweight fan, but can't recommend this book for even a novice who is interested them. Wait until it's in a bargain bin if you have to have it
