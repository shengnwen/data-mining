I own over 60 poker related books and dvd's and this is only the 2nd book I have ever sent back.  It is just a compilation of information from other books, and a bunch of useless information (how to build a poker table??  don't they sell those in several stores??).  Please save your money for one of the myraid other poker titles that will actually teach you something.  It sure has a NICE TITLE, and a review from one of his friends, but don't let either sway you
