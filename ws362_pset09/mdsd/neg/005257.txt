The two reviews listed must have been written by the author and a friend. I respect this individual's experiences in the profession, but the actual quality of this book is dreadful. I immediately noticed that on the back cover copy the author shifts within a paragraph from an informal to a formal voice. Hoping the inside would be better I tried giving the content itself a chance but found it very pedestrian and trite. Lots of rambling and little "meat". 

My husband and I brought this for our daughter who is considering a career in PT. We couldn't get past page 1 and decided other titles would be much more helpful for her!
