These activities have many, many steps and feature directions such as this: "In the next step, students will transfer their tracings to the second sheet of drawing paper and place it scrap paper. Using the edge (not tip), press down and rub heavy solid lines behind the lines of the drawings or fill in the whole space. In effect, students will be creating their own carbon paper." Rub heavy lines on the back of the drawing paper (the back is never mentioned again), the tracing paper? the scrap paper? I don't know... It's extremely unclear. This book has some impressive looking activities but uses a lot of technical terms and seems way too complicated for the bottom of the 2-5 grade range that's on the cover. I would recommend this only for teachers with a very strong background in art working with grades 4-8. It also talks about how many "class periods" activities take, as if the author wrote it for middle school but the publishers just slapped grades 2-5 on the cover. Very disappointing...
