This book is absolutely not worth reading--it's barely readable, has no defined plot, and is an overall disappointment. There is no plot in this book beyond sex scenes and clumsily drawn out character "relationships" which tend to consist of the protagonist realizing that she has to have sex with someone.  I don't recommend this book at all
