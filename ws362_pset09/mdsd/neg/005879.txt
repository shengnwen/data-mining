I like the idea - focusing on good customer service. I don't like the way the book is written. Other books, like "Fish" (Stephen Lundin) do a better job of presenting a "moral through a story." They are teaching something new or inventive. Good 'customer service' is not a new concept. Conveying its importance through a simplistic story is, in my opinion, rather elementary my dear Blanchard. 

If these fictional characters were real people, and some good facts were thrown in, this could be a very good book. As it is, I think there are better ways -  and books - to promote good customer service in an organization. 

The only redeeming quality is it is a quick read and therefore if you want to line Ken Blanchard's pockets... you can buy copies for your entire team and perhaps inspire some thought and get everyone on the same page. Unless you have team-building in mind though... seek wisdom elsewhere.
