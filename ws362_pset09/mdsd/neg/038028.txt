I've found two pretty decent uses for Monster Manual IV:  1) If you want to use the Spawn of Tiamat in your game, this book is essential.  2) If you want to assign class levels or subtypes to common monsters from the first Monster Manual, but are short on time, then this book has them ready for you.  A major chunk of this book is devoted to these two things.  The rest contains a decent number of new monsters that may or may not fit into your game.  

The new format of this Monster Manual gives every monster at least two pages.  Some of the extra information provided by this format does come in handy, but a lot of it is devoted to discussing how each beast fits into the Forgotten Realms and Eberron campaign settings.  If you don't use either or both of those settings, that's a lot of extra paper you're paying for.  As a point of comparison; if the two page per monster technique was applied to the first Monster Manual, that book would weigh in at around 640 pages (it currently has 320).  I think that's a telling sign of just how much padding this book contains.  If you removed all of its superfluous information, Monster Manual IV could easily be reduced to 112 pages.  Make it a softcover, and you've got a handy $10.95 book on your hands.  As a $34.95 hardcover; however, Monster Manual IV just isn't worth the investment.
