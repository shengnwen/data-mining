Based on the book's description as "...a complex and compelling tale of political upheaval, espionage, sexual passion, and all the suffering wrought by war, poverty, oppression, and exile... told brilliantly with empathy and panache.", you might think  this would be a fascinating read.  But this book wasn't quite the read I thought it would be.

Berberova really needed a strong editor to help her tighten her writing.  There were too many people mentioned and the story tended to take so many tangents into other people's lives, making it difficult to get a strong sense of who Moura was.  

But you can get a sense of who Moura wasn't.  She wasn't a great mom (but to her defense, that was probably the case of a lot of women in her situation), wasn't a great friend, and not too devoted to anyone except herself.  

The repeated name dropping made the book frustrating as well.  Whether they were in her life for a week or a decade, it seems that Berberova mentions everyone Moura ever met.  The index in the back of the book was necessary just to help distinguish the characters as there is little way to keep them all straight.
