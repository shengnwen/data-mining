If you're one of those people who paid money for the book or spent the few hours reading it when you could have been shampooing your hair or some other trivial task, then yes, be mad, feel cheated and confused.  However, if you're like me who came upon this book that someone threw away, you might not be so angry. 

Flip forward to 1999, Rosemary wakes from a 27 year coma to find her son, Andy, is the most popular fellow in the world with the ability to bring together all people.  He has no religious agenda other than a "can't we all get along" umbrella that has  succeeded greatly on a worldwide scale.  When it's discovered that our Rosemary is the Mom of the most beloved person in the world, she gets thrown into the arena of celebrity too.  

If you look at this book as a whole, it's not particularly good but if you can look at some of the premises, some are kind of interesting.  The ending which at first left me feeling cheated actually took on more meaning when I reread it.  

If you come across this book and have nothing to do for about 2 hours, not a bad read...otherwise not really worth your while
