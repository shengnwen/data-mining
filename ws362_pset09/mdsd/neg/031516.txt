I can only say this: I read the novel, and it didn't touch me or affect me in anyway! I believe a good book should have an impact on the reader, now of course it doesn't necessarily have to cause a dramatic change in the reader's life, but it has to affect him somehow, or at least make him enjoy the reading!
But I read this book and I simply could not get the point of it. It was quite boring and it didn't give me anything at all! A sex maniac from Sudan, and then what? A big hidden secret that the author is constantly trying to make you wonder about, and I was actually bored by the author's failing attempts to intrigue the reader! There is simply nothing special about it, as you will read it and forget about it the next day, maybe even the next hour! Some will probably regret wasting their time on this book, wishing they read something else instead.
