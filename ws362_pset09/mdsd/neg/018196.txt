The first hundred or so pages of the novel are fairly interesting and easy to get through but from there the book seams to go nowhere.  I had a very hard time trying to get through the rest of the novel as it meanders towards its anticlimactic ending.  Yes there is some beautiful writing and keen social observations but all and all it was quite dull.  It was disappointed after reading the previous reviews and hearing good things about this book I found myself trying to like but it was just too slow paced for me
