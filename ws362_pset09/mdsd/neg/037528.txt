I didn't buy this book, I received an email from Amazon to tell me I might be interested in buying it. When I saw who the author was I was disgusted. Never have I seen people such as Anne Nicole's family try to cash in on her image. Anne's mother is disgusting and her true motives on trying to get custody of Anne's little girl have finally came to light.
She wants to be guardian of her. She is why Anne Nicole turned to drugs in the first place. She is no KIND of a parent.. I'm so happy to see that Howard Stern and Larry Bernstein have finally come to good terms with what is best for this baby girl. Howard should be allowed to be in this baby's life. He knew the true depths of Anne's hatred for her mother and her sister and with good reason. I never really cared for Anne's image but my heart when out to her when her son died and I truly feel she died of a broken heart.
I have always felt Howard Stern is a good man, he came from a good family and he tried to love Anne and help Anne the best that he could. He is the one that helped get her career going, time and time again.
He before anyone, deserves to be guardian over Anne and her daughter's estates. Not this so called family who turned on Anne in life because she got tired of all the leeches trying to live off of her.
Please do not buy this book. Someday, if Howard Stern decides to write a book about his life with Anne Nicole, that is the book I would invest my money in. He loved her, he loved her son and he loves his baby girl even if he isn't her biological father.
This so called sister writes about someone she hasn't spoken to you in years just to make a buck. Go out and earn a living like everyone else
