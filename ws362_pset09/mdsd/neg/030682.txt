The cover is very pretty thanks to Penguin books.  BUT..  this translation is seriously lacking in elegance.  Trust me.  Look into buying Robert Fitzgerald's tranlation or my personal favorite -Samuel Butler's tranlation.  They are far more poetic and descriptive than Robert Fagle.  I recommend picking up two translations and comparing the same few pages from the same chapters.  I honestly don't know why Robert Fagle got such high praise for this.  Take my advice and get Samuel Butler or Robert Fitzgerald's translation.
