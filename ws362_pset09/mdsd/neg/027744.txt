I'm new to this type of book but the first I read was Lee Child's "The Hard Way" featuring his loner hero Jack Reacher and after that this book was an incredible let down.  Implausible plotting and idiot characters was my main problem.  This is set in rural Georgia and I didn't buy it.  Seriously- one of the main protaganists has been raped by a jesus freak, her twin sister was killed and she was being abused  by her ex-skinhead boyfriend and she had an abortion.  She's also a police detective.  Yeah- dopey
