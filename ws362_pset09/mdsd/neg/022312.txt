How can this be a great "modern" playwright when
the views and themes of this major play have a better part
for the 17th century than the 20th?
I thought about it and if it was produced in  San Francisco
even with it's respect for the arts, on merits
the play would be jeered.
Woody Allen thought that Strindberg hated women,
but I think he just lacked any understanding of them
