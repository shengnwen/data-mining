First let me start by saying that Manji has very little knowledge of Islam for someone who claims to have gone to an Islamic school.  I will not say madrasa, because the word has been misused, purposely, to give darker skinned peoples an exotic barbarity. The word simply means school and is used, worldwide, to refer to schools both secular and religious, simply coming from the Arabic root "to study."  

I do not understand why Manji rants and raves over and over about ijtihad  (reasoning independent of the past religious opinions), but one thing is for sure, and that is that she has no knowledge of Muslim movements of the 18th centuries onwards.  One of the most successful movements, founded by Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab, known as Wahhabism by those opposed to it or Salafism by its proponents, has as its founding principle the use of ijtihad, as it wished to break from what it considered was corruption of Islam by all Islamic groups and empires after the community of the Prophet.  
However, ibn Abdul Wahhab's followers had to change his theories, as he only accepted the Qur'an and Sunna (the traditions of the prophet), but these traditions were not collected with any authority until the 9th century, meaning in order to claim the Sunna, the Wahhabi's would have to accept the consensus of the first 3 centuries of Islam (which includes the Golden Age).

The problem with the Wahhabi's is that they are a exceptionally right wing, and so their independent analysis (ijtihad) is inherently conservative.  Why doesn't Manji know this.  It is not a hidden fact.  She doesn't even need to learn Arabic to find this out, it is written plainly for anyone with knowledge of English.  You don't need a comprehensive study of Islam to know this, though you would think it should be a prerequisite for anyone claiming to have the ability to tell the world of the trouble with Islam
