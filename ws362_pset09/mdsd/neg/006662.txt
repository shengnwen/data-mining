The book being compared to "the Da Vinci Code" is an insult to Dan Brown and to the readers.  Blatant ripoffs of the book jacket design to look like Da Vinci Code's, even the characters names (Lang = Langdon, coincidence?) are shameful. 

The book is a boring, mind-numbing read, I could not go on after about 100 pages (I read the da Vinci Code in 1 day).  The racial slurrs this book is full of (which have NOTHING to do with the content) are insulting to any reader.  The book talks demeaning and negatively about "the Russkies", implies that all "bearded middle easterners" should be searched at airports as they all come from terrorist countries, and slanders the French by calling them cowards for opting out of the Iraq war (keep in mind - this book is not about the war).  The author must have forgotten who helped Americans gain our independence from the British in the first place...

I do not recommend this book, I regret buying it, and this will be the first book heading straight for the recycle bin
