Sigh. I have read a lot of Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels by women writers. In fact, when I see a title by Carol Berg, Lois McMaster Bujold, J.V. Jones, Kate Elliot and a host of other women authors, I automatically order it because I know it will be a fully realized story with complex characters and a sense of immersion. I tried this book because it came up on my recommendations and assumed it would fall into this same type of writing.

Nope. This thing reads like a classic Harlequin Romance(tm). The perky, struggling heroine from the 'wrong side of the station' with a soft spot for orphans and stuffed animals meets (I kid you not) a tall, dark and handsome mysterious stranger who is More Than He Appears. They immediately notice the other has (insert ALL the romantic cliche descriptions) and spend most of their time feeling intense sexual attraction until they (of course) tear each other's clothes off...... Did I mention she has bad luck with men and he is More Than He Appears? Or perhaps the direct rip-off of the C3PO droid from Star Wars....
This is one of the VERY few books I actually am not going to finish. If you actually enjoy Harlequin Romances, more power to you. This book might be for you. But, be warned. That is ALL there is in this story. The author actually could write good stories- this is clear. In fact, as a 'pure romance' novel, it's not bad, I suppose, hence the two stars. 
I just look for more than burning glances, constant full body contact encounters and 'accidentally' copping a feel in the repair conduit to move a story along.
