I was impressed by the writer's skill in creating beautiful prose. However, I did not get anything else out of the book. Forgettable characters, thin plot, endless descriptions, and ultimately dull.    Seemed like the writer was writing the book for himself and no one else. Rated two stars because of writer's talent and because I enjoyed the first half. Take three stars off for the meandering second half and my other complaints
