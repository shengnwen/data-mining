zzzzz! I was really disappointed! The book offers nothing new, interesting or exciting. The author claims to be a professional photographer as well as a ghost hunter, but I didn't see any photos in the book except some orbs, mist and a vortex or two. Considering the fact that the author has visited some of the most haunted places in the world, I would expect a more detailed and believable account of her experiences. In checking out her web sites I found the same information and photos which that were in the book, which left me wondering why anyone would choose to buy it
