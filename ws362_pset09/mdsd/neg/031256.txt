I bought this book at Home Depot and returned it after a few hours upon finishing it.  I could have got the same information from a free pamphlet.  They ought to be ashamed.  However, there were some nice pictures and I did learn a little bit, but it was just a super easy primer for the real thing.  I didn't buy another book before tiling 900sf in my house.  I wish I had bought a better book, as I learned all kinds of tricks "the hard way."  Hint: Swimming after tiling all day can return your back to normal when it doesn't seem like anything else will help.  I am now going to buy John Bridge's book before my next tiling job
