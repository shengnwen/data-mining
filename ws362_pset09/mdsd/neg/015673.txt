This is by far the most boring Beverley book, although competing for the title with her next, "To Rescue a Rogue."  The beginning is quite promising.  But than the action just stalls.  The love story is completely unconvincing and sorely lacking any tension.  Throughout the book, Jane agonizes whether to tell Simon the secret we readers know.  St. Bride is described as a wild character, with adventurous blood of his ancestor Ademar running through his veins.  But he comes across as a wimp.  Also, he marries the woman he barely knows when it is not quite clear that he is even attracted to her.  To fulfil a dying friend's wish?  Who on earth does that without an excellent reason, even in a romance novel?  It is not so clear how this man obliged our hero.  Then, after talking to his friend Hal, who really is in love, Simon decides that he too is "thunderstruck."  It just doesn't fly.   Apart from the somewhat interesting beginning -- very little is going on in the rest of the book. Just extremely boring conversations. Simon's cause -- fighting for the rights of Canadian Indians -- is entirely undeveloped.  He just drops this idea to go home and "do his duty" to the family.   In my opinion, reading an old Beverley book for the second or third time is time better spent
