The first few Alex Cross novels were really quite good.  But for some reason, beginning with Violets Are Blue the quality of the stories began to deteriorate, becoming worse and worse and worse and worse.  The plot of Violets Are Blue is disjointed and full of holes, and the writing is juvenile.  Please don't waste your time or money with this book or any subsequent Alex Cross novels.  I purchased and read them all.  The first six Alex Cross novels remain in my library.  The others have been recycled
