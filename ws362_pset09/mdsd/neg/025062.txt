It is unfortunate this book didn't come out better. Some glaring problems with it include:
- has no concept of energy physics to begin with
- does not understand "hydrogen economy" (hydrogen's an expensive storage, not a source of energy)
- downplays geological data of oil discovery (or doesn't understand it), although Hubbert is covered briefly
- believes or disseminates half-baked unproven ideas from the research sector: scientifically not valid energy sources are brought forward as alternative fuels
- does not deal with the net energy concept (EROEI) or even refer to it

With these fundamental oversights it's really difficult to recommend the book.

It's not completely without merit as it does tell some of the basics right, but mostly it's pathologically impartial journalistic fluff, without looking at the hard facts as a good researcher should. 

It's too much about how we are miraculously going to replace oil, gas and coal with tar sands, nuclear power, hydrogen and live happily ever after.

To those readers who want to believe this, this might be a good book. People looking for valid and scientifically solid reasoning on the subject will be sorely disappointed.

I'd recommend books by Deffeyes, Simmons, Heinberg, Campbell and many others before this (all on peak oil)
