Having read - and absolutely loved  - Ms. Gilman's hilarious memoir, "Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress", I naturally expected this book to be a great read as well.  I was sorely disappointed.  Ms. Gilman's sassy style gets lost in a sea of trite "you-go-girl" cliches.  As the pages turn, Gilman's voice just gets angrier and angrier.  Every other sentence is prefaced with "Yeah, well..."  The writing is terrible, the editing is sloppy...I could go on forever.  Grandmother's quotes were wonderful, but otherwise, this book was difficult to take.  Gilman makes it abundantly clear that only as long as you share her extremely liberal views - this coming from someone who considers herself moderately liberal - can you make it into the Goddess Club.   After the first twenty or so pages it began to irritate me.  This is not a manifesto on how to cultivate some "girl power" and exercise it, but rather an excuse for Ms. Gilman to hop on her soapbox and rant.  I would suggest skipping this shallow read.
