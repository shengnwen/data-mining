If you are young and gay or just young then this book may be of some use as you cruise the shopping malls. If on the other hand you are a little older, gay or straight, shy away from J Crew and Abercrombie, cringe at khakis, wonder at those who show their t-shirt peeking up from under their polo shirt and have given up wearing ball caps in public and are ready to upgrade your image then Alan Flusser's THE ART OF PERMANENT FASHION would be a better buy
