I tried many times to finish this book because once I buy it and start it, I hate to just walk away from it. BUT, this book did it. I was never really interested in the plot, I thought the writing was very basic, elementary actually, slow, and just plain boring. I tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up, but I never did get into to, making this the only book I've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing
