This really is not a book on Hacking Tivo, rather a book on "Hacking First Generation Tivo's."  I have a series 2 DVR and expected to see some hacks that would prove worthwhile for my DVR, however there is little for owners of Tivos manufactured in the last two years.  Very simple recommendation-if you have a first generation Tivo buy the book, otherwise pass
