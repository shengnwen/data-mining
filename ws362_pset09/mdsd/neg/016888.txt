If you only like eggs, bacon and ham for breakfast then these recipes are for you. While noting calories and fat Hughes leaves out sodium, cholesterol, protein, and all other nutritional information. If I wanted to raise my cholesterol and sodium intake then I'd eat eggs and ham every day for breakfast. In addition, she adds some variation of fruit to each breakfast. I could of thought of that on my own. I admit that I did not buy this cookbook for the lunch recipes, so my input in that section of the book may not be relevant. However, if I had purchased it for the lunch recipes I would have been very disappointed; no one has time to make these lunches on a daily basis unless they are at home all day and have nothing to do. I hardly have time to make breakfast and dinner! There were only a handful of dinner recipes that even seemed appealing to me and were good...however, would I have purchased this book knowing there would only be a handful of recipes I'd use? No. The desserts aren't worth bothering with unless you want to spend time preparing a variety of fruit and spice combinations. Not very exciting. Fortunately I only paid $8 or else I'd be a lot more unhappy. Also, there are no pictures and that makes it difficult to get excited about as well. If you're looking for a diet book look somewhere else. If you're looking for low calorie recipe ideas, look somewhere else. There is nothing special or exciting about these recipes.
