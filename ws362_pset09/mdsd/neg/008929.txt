I will echo the comments of a previous critique.  Contrary to what I expect from an Intro Philosophy book, Warburton comes across as extremely bias in his section on God.  I could care less what he believes, the problem is that I know exactly what he believes from reading this section.  I think the mark of a great Philosophy teacher is when the student has no idea what the teacher believes based on the lecture (or book).  Warburton fails miserably in this respect, but only in this section.  As mentioned before, he definitely has something against Theists.

I might go as far as to say this section is completely worthless.  His arguments for God's existence are followed by bias objections that add nothing to the book but poor logic.  At one point he uses evil as an argument against the Designer.  What is the problem with this?  Simple - the teleological argument does absolutely nothing to put forward the idea of an omnibenevolent being.  It argues for nothing more than a Designer.  Bringing evil in as ground for objecting that argument is irrelevent if not careless.  This is just one of his many failures in this section (there are at least five other objections that fail the test of reason).

Please don't misread me.  I don't think you need to learn philosophy from a Theist.  In fact, if you want to read philosophy but don't want a Theist to teach you I suggest reading William Rowe.  He is easily one of my favorite philosophy writers.  You can read his entire book and have no idea what he believes - again, the mark of a great teacher.  Philosophy is about teaching people how to think, not what to think.  

Anyway, aside from the secion on God I think Warburton actually does a decent job of this.  The section on God is inexcusable and demerits him two stars in my mind (a 4* book without that section).  But overall the book is okay.  Just skip the section on God if you buy the book
