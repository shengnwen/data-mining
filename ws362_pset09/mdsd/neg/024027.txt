I read Mr. Harris' book while on the way back from China, after studying  in Beijing as an exchange student. Reflecting upon my experiences in China,  I was amazed at how Mr. Harris distorts the truth. Almost everything he  says in the book is incomplete or distorted. If anyone wants to know more  about China and its people, the best way is to go and visit, and see for  himself. The worst he can do is read Mr. Harris diminutive lies. I regret  my parents wasted their money to buy this book for me
