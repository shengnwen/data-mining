This book is rich of historic material of each part of Japan, if you want to know who lived in a palace, for example, and what he did, before you visit there.  

But, this book is the worst on transportation information provided among all travel books I have used.  

First, it is short of useful maps.  You cannot find Asakusa, the No.1 tourist attraction in Tokyo, in any region map of Tokyo in this book.  

Second, its maps are hard to read: not abstract enough, not colored, and not bilingual.  It does not have the color coded Tokyo subway system map. (BTW, you get ask for a free one from any subway station exit.)  Its different grey colored subway map is hard to follow.  And all maps are all in Romanji (like English) instead of bilingal: both Romanji and Kanji (like Japanese and Chinese).

Also, it's not quite updated: in Kyoto, there are two subway lines, laid out like a cross.  But this book says that it has only one line. (the version I read was the third version, printed in Feb. 2004.)

In summary, this book is good during preparation, but not very useful during the trip, unless you want to take taxi all the time
