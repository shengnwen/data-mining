After reading this book, the name "Diana Wynne Jones" became synonymous with "unreadable garbage."  I remember that my brother first checked it out from the library because it looked scary (don't judge a book by its cover).  It wasn't.  There wasn't much suspense, the characters were shallow and most of their motives, ideas, and feelings were unclear.  Why didn't anyone disagree with the wholesale slaughter of the people?  Another of the book's unsolved mysteries.

The writing was meant to be light-hearted and humorous (I think) but to me it felt immature and silly.  The reason that books are published is to teach people not only about their lives but also about language!  It was actually frightening how Jones managed to make her writing seem juvenile.

As for the plot, well, let's just say that I was yawning half way into the book.  The reader was dropped into an alien world without the smallest explanation of the creatures, world, government, or location.  This is not a good way to open a book.

I also read "Year of the Griffin" (didn't realize it was the sequel until too late) and "the Merlin Conspiracy."  I wish I could say that these books were better than "Dark Lord of Derkholm" but if I did I'd be lying.  If anything, they were even more shallow, more random, and more thrown together than this one seemed.  Just like in DLoD, the plot was hastily resolved by throwing in a few untterly random and unknown names places and connections and a smiley face was glued on.

My only suggestion is this: don't read it
