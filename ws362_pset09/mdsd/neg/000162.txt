Warning: contains some spoilers, mostly regarding Red Mars.

Other reviewers have beaten me to some of the better criticisms of Green Mars: the endless dialogues that merely rehash themes from Red, the irritating pseudo-socialism, the ludicrous indefatigability and resourcefulness of the characters, etc.  

I'd like to add two points.  First, I swear to Almighty God that if I ever meet KSR--be it in a social setting or just at the supermarket--I will punch him square in the face and say "That's for you and your @#$%ing eco-economics!"

My second point is somewhat more serious: unlike Red Mars, the novel has no central human story.  In Red, Robinson rather excellently used John, Frank, and Maya's love triangle both to hold the novel together and add some character-based tension: did Frank intend for John to die in the Nicacea riot?  if so, was it motivated by jealousy or politics, or both?  will Maya find out?  if so, will she be able to forgive Frank?  

All of this was, however, completely lacking in the sequel.  The only relationship with any successful tension is between Sax and Phyllis, and it hardly frames the novel.

In Red Mars Robinson pulled-off a rather staggering feat: however imperfectly, he wrote a HS Fiction novel about the colonization of Mars while creating a competent host of characters and even a couple of interesting relationships.  He just didn't have it in him to do it twice
