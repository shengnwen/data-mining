When I got this book I was expecting some good advice. But what I found was a bunch of ridiculous crap. She suggests that all meat eaters are "blocked vegetarians" ... they really want to be vegetarians but they have fears. Give me a break, she couldn't be more wrong. The book does not offer practical advice and just adds to the idea that vegetarians are weird people. Trying telling a meat eater you think they are a blocked vegetarian and see the roars that will get you. This author offers a fantasy world, it's not based on reality. Plus she starts the book out with bumper stickers and saying about vegetarians... like vegetarians don't also have bumper stickers and saying about meat eating? Please! She portrays us as victims of meat eaters, and misses the idea that groups like PETA are out there making vegetarians look like complete idiots. If you want to read this book I would suggest you get it used or at the library, it's not worth buying. It's good for a laugh only. "Blocked vegetarians"... LOL! Give me a break
