Bought this book used and it was still overpriced. The time I spent reading it was priceless compared to the completely inane "blathering". As others have said, the sex isn't even sexy. At least the wife-swapping showed some unusual relationship-type intereaction. What a boring, bizarre story. Somebody spank Piers and put him back in the land of Xanth
