I have long been hoping to find the ONE career book that will point me in the write direction of finding the career that I want out of life.  I'm coming to believe that these books are mostly a waste of money.

This book contains a personality test that is not unlike any other career assessment test that you can take online, for FREE.  It then contains a boat load of charts...50 highest paying jobs for this personality type....50 jobs for this personality type with the highest amount of women/men employed...ect ect.  If this sort of thing interests you then by all means this book might be for you.

Most of the book however is a list of different jobs for the different personality types that contains descriptions, experience/education needed, related job, ect but it is all on a VERY BASIC level.

Save your money and speak with a career counsler
