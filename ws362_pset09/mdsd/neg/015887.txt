Billed as a book written by a Californian who moves to Provence, this book is actually written by a French woman who, after spending some time in Beverly Hills, moves back to France into a home that has been &quot;modernized&quot; for her.  If you're more interested in boring acounts of how to impress your neighbors than you are in the joy of living life in a beautiful part of the world, then by all means - buy this book.  My girlfriend and I were thoroughly disappointed, and returned this pretensious monstrosity for a full refund.  For a more substantial and joyful read, try &quot;A Year in Provence&quot; by Peter Mayle, the book that almost certainly inspired Lenard's shallow and uninspired effort
