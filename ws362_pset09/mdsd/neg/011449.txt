I far as I can see, Kachadorian's houses operate reasonably well because of the passive solar orientation and room layout. The saltbox design deflects cold north winds over the house and adds value.  The increased insulation and emphasis on air-tightness also adds value too.  The solar slab, at the core of his design, I consider near useless, adding little if any value, and uses purchased heat to heat it up, a no, no, in passive solar design.  He sues teh floor as ducts.  It is near impossible to get an air-tight floor.  There is far too little insulation under the slab too.  The house actually needs a heating system, which says something.  Kachadorians passive solar saltbox design with superinsulation and being air tight, minus the solar slab (which attracts vermin under your floor) would perform very well. 

For a house to remain cool and warm it required a high thermal mass of concrete walls and floors with superinsulation around it, not a stick built timber frame.  

Knowledge of passive solar construction has moved on since Kachadorian did his houses.  Look at the Pasiv Solar standard in Germany, who use mainly concrete.

If you want to know passive solar principles, then this book will give you that.  Ignore the solar slab and build the house out of air-tight masonry, superinsulation and install a Heat recovery and vent system.
