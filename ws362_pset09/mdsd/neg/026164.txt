Half of the book is a history of several value investors.  But this section is quite superficial in how these individuals screened/found the opportunities they did.  Little is told of how they valued the companies and how a wanna-be investor should procede in doing this themselves.  The first half of the book is ok, but again could use more help in terms of how to find prospective value companies.  Chapter 6 is about the only good chapter. It analyses WD-40 (the company).  I recommend instead "The Intelligent Investor" (2003 ed.) by the late Ben Graham and Jason Zweig.  It lives up to Buffett's praise of "...by far the best book about investing ever written.
