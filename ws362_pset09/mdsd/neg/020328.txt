It's not difficult to imagine the type of person who would still want this book, but one would prefer not to. Unfortunately it's still all too relevant. One wishes that Henry Ford's idea of history as "bunk" was more convincing!

The resurgence of opposition to the phoney "War on Christmas" should remind readers of earlier efforts to attack American Jews. 

Hendrik Hertzberg, in a New Yorker article about the ongoing war on Christmas, made a direct connection to this book. He wrote:  

... Christmas itself, in something like its recognizably modern 
...  form, with gifts and cards and elves, dates from the early 
...  nineteenth century. The War on Christmas seems to have come 
...  along around a hundred years later, with the publication of 
...  "The International Jew," by Henry Ford, the automobile 
...  magnate, whom fate later punished by arranging to have his 
...  fortune diverted to the sappy, do-gooder Ford Foundation. 
...  "It is not religious tolerance in the midst of religious 
...  difference, but religious attack that they"-the 
...  Jews-"preach and practice," he wrote. "The whole record of 
...  the Jewish opposition to Christmas, Easter and certain 
...  patriotic songs shows that." Ford's anti-Semitism has not 
...  aged well, thanks to the later excesses of its European 
...  adherents, but by drawing a connection between 
...  Christmasbashing and patriotism-scorning he pointed the way 
...  for future Christmas warriors.
