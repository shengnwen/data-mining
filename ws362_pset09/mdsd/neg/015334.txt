This author seems arrogant in her approach to her readers, assuming all are basically ignorant  and lost on the Spiritual Path. She has taken gross liberties with  the sacred  ancient language of Quechua, using English  plural form, bastardizing the inherent beauty and meanings. She  not only uses invented words, but uses English improperly as well. This is before we get into her translated material and very personal interpretations ! Worst, she refers to Westerners (capitalized)-not acknowledging that PERU IS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE - while using the word Indigenous in lower case. The respectful title Don before a man's name is lower case for her also. Being aquainted with several people she showcases in this book,I  feel ashamed  and hurt for them to have been exploited in this manner
