If you're a fan of Sidney Sheldon, you'll probably like this one because it's inplauasable and stupid like all his other books.  It's a lot like &quot;Master of the Game&quot; because it's also a rags-to-riches tale.  However, all the characters are flat and the plot is kind of sleazy. It reads like a made-for-UPN movie.  The bottomline is that it's just plain stupid.  After this one, I've given up trying to find a Sheldon book I can tolerate
