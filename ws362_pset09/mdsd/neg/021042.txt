I was really disappointed by this book.  Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I like a novel with a plot and with characters who are at least plausible if not interesting.  This book has neither.  Given the glowing reviews here on Amazon, I kept reading on, assuming that "this has got to take off soon."  It never did.  Nothing led anywhere, nothing mattered, nothing happened.  Maybe, as some previous reviewers suggested, that's the point: this book is about nothingness, and thereby makes a statement about the twentieth century soul.  But if that's what I wanted, I could just have stared at a blank piece of paper for fifteen minutes.  When I read a book, I want to engage with the book on some level, and I did not engage on any level whatsoever with this book.  Maybe it's me, but all I can say is "Reader Beware."  When they say that the desert is the main character, THEY'RE NOT KIDDING.  If you're interested in people or plot, look elsewhere
