Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book.  It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the "design" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying
