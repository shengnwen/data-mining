This book, based on Freudian theories, is not for the average parent.  The author blames parents for all of the problelms their children may be having in school. She completely ignores the realities of external social forces, including poverty, community culture and the existance of BAD teachers.  Unless a parent has the advantage of having read other theoretical works, they might accept this bunch of parent blaming junk
