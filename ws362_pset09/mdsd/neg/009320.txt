This book has a very clear, "lack of communication". The book is fine for the basics but the problem exercises do not involve the basics. The author explains problems from the beginning but goes straight to the end with the problem exercises. There needs to be more depth between the examples and the problems.  This book is fine for some one who already knows it. But,if you don't and want to get confused and frustrated, then I recommend this book.  If you are unfortunate and are forced to use this book, I would look for an outside source for reference.  Beware!!!  My question to the author is: Why are you keeping the middle a secret. This stuff is not as hard as the author makes it.  To sum this up, the author says here is an elementary example now I want you to solve this advanced problem. Students need more examples with more depth. This book may be titled as introductory but it sure is geared for the more advanced.Thanks, but no thanks
