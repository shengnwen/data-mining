Yes, the theme is interesting, the plot is well constructed, the characters are conceivable. But: most of the positive characteristics of this novel are destroyed by long and boring philosophising. I really am not a friend of action and action only, but Barnes reflects too often and too much. And the whole subject of Occitan culture may be interesting for those who know about the old troubadour tradition, but the ordinary reader is certainly confused by it. His characters are believable in this Occitan context, but most of the readers have never come in touch with even the theoretical basis of a society like this. It may be interesting for the expert to discuss the oppositional viewpoints of a fundamental Protestant society with all its hypocrisy and a society that has its basis in artificial codes of honor and dignity. But both are far away from reality. And that is why they do not reflect any social problem in reality. Both should have been opposed to a realistic society of today, of course alienated from the here and now by science fiction settings. This is what science fiction is about. But here this novel discusses some theoretical problems and never arrives in reality. Some critics call Barnes a descendant of Robert Heinlein. Well, if so, he has still a long way to go
