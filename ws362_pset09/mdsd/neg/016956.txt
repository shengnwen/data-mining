For the life of me I can't understand how it got the Book Award.  It's a pointless heap of drivel without any appealing characters. Roth also combines multiple quotes in the same paragraph causing confusion about who's speaking. That, plus long rambling confused stntences with no direction make reading it a head pounding chore.  I quit after reading to the half way point. This muddled mess is not worth your time.
