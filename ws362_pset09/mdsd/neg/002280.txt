Unlike years ago, Logic comes with good manuals and there is a variety of books and even a DVD available for learning Logic. Among all of the books, I feel this is the worst, and not worth even owning. In fact, I sold my copy of it. 

The book is not terrible but it has nothing going for it. Its a rehash of the manual that comes with the program for free. Its not particularly well written, not fresh, not insightful, and not interesting. It seems to be written by a guy with no particular writing talent, nor talent in using Logic who just wants to make a buck by explaining the manual again in a dry uncreative way.

Merton's book has no special insights like Len Sasso's excellent book Emagic Tips and Tricks which is well written, to the point, and useful, or Stephen Bennet's User's Guide to Logic Audio. Both of those books come from experienced Logic pros and cut through the verbiage to give you immediately useful methods. These guys can write well, and they really know how to use Logic!

Merton's book also doesn't have the excellent tutorials of the Apple Pro Training Manual - Logic by Sitter and Brock.  Thats a great book for learning to be an expert in well organized lessons. But Merton has none of that. Another alternative would be George Leger's Logic Pro training DVD. 

I just don't see any reason why this book was published. It seems that the publisher is producing "Power" books for Protools and other music software, and they just needed someone to fill the Logic spot. But I don't think this book is worth reading much less buying. I think your needs will be much more satisfied by one of the books written by true expert Logic pros, good writers, and those who did it for own love of the product rather than a quick buck
