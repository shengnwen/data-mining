Much of this book could be cut out. Too much commentary, too little information. Somewhat boring. You'll be skipping over large sections. The "case histories" are hardly relevant.

Well,go ahead and make your lists now - your "deja vu" experiences, correct intuition experiences, little voices telling you otherwise. Then do the pendulum and playing card challenges. And the dictionary -this one sounds vague. Definitely for beginners. But if you have even a bit of common sense, interest or insight into the topic, you already know the information in this book
