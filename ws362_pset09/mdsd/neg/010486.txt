In studying this time period, my three children and I have read MANY books.  I found this book to be somewhat boring in comparison to several of the books we've read so far.  I felt that from what we have learned about this time period, this story was not realistic, and perhaps a little "whitewashed".  The situations and humor seemed contrived, and the plot was simplistic.  And I did think that it was preachy.  We do have strong values, but we have read several books that have incorporated these values believably into realistic and exciting plots. This book was disappointing
