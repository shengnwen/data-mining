This book does all right for the writer who does not have the information already.

advice such as, "Poor spelling and grammar puts you at a disadvantage".

really?  did I really need to waste my money on such a book to give me advice on such a wow, I didn't know that :).

she offers very obvious advice like what to do on tours and how to get publicized.  the chapter on Media training, "Television appearances are part of a book's promotion".

hmm...thanks for the great insight!


However, for those who already know some things, this book only glosses over what you really need to know.

I know I need to set up a mailing list for say, a book signing event.  But, she doesn't actually tell you HOW to contact them properly, and where.


don't bother with this book.  get free information on the website by spending your own time googling.
