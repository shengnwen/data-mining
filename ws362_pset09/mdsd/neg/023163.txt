Brautigan was a very weird man. I understand he went on to take his own life. That's a shame, but honestly I can kind of see the suicidal mindset in him if the man he writes about in the first-person in these is a real reflection of how he truly thought. He was a grouch and mean-spirited to the people around him. He clearly thought he was smarter than everybody else and his writings show he probably wasn't. A lot of people say this book is original but it's not, it's more like...typical midling-talent hack writing with countercultural, back-to-earth themes. He wanted to shock and tease and praise a simple life all at once and be non-tactfully frank about certain things to the point of grossness, and that's not my cup o' tea. Other than the poignant "childhood Kool-Aid" piece, the only part I liked in any of these books was in "Trout Fishing" when Brautigan caught a humpbacked fish whose odd manner of swimming he compared to Lord Byron's limp. Even that wasn't spectacular. Also, his wife should have left him over all the mean things he said about her. She must've been a saint to put up with him. I honestly don't see why any of these books make for good reading. They're a waste of time.

(If by some cosmic chance you ever happen to read this review, Zik, wherever the heck you are in this decade, sorry I lied about liking this but I didn't want to be rude about your favorite book. Since you "borrowed" those CD's of mine that I never saw again, I wish I'd have admitted how sucky I thought Brautigan was at the time.
