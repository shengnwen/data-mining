Maybe I grew up on the wrong side of the Mason-Dixon line (that would be north of Jackson, Mississippi) to appreciate the humor in this book, but I didn't find it all that funny.  With the exception of a few ancedotes this book was disappointing and did not live up to the rave reviews I'd heard about it.

Some of the advice handed out in this book was good (I agree with the author regarding toupees on men).  A couple of the anecdotes were side-splittingly funny (such as the one about the Queens most-prepared woman award).  Even a couple of the comfort-food recipes sounded good (the chocolate pudding in particular).  But overall this comes off as just a bunch of frustrated women over-40, who need therapy because they never got majorette boots as children.

Personally, I had a difficult time finishing this book and don't care to read any of the subsequent books that have been written by Ms. Browne.  As she explains how the Queens came to be, she attempts to draw you in with some "good girl talk" to make you feel part of the gang.  The author turned me off with her definition of the Sweet Potato Queens as an exclusive sorority with it's group of wannabes, who supposedly grovel and beg to become a Queen.  Give me a break!  Even if this was meant to be funny, it wasn't. It was just pathetic.

My good, sound advice to you on this book -- save your money and don't buy it.
