Despite the glowing reviews from others, this book was of little or no value in preparing for the CLEP exam. The format of the questions was not the same (the study guide had zero long quotations to read and answer questions about, but the real exam had many) and the material covered was not remotely distributed the same way. The bulk of the material covered in the study guide was mentioned little or not at all on the exam; the exam contained many many many questions about things that were mentioned little or not at all in the book. Perhaps the CLEP test people have moved into a new mode to outsmart the study guide publishers, but whatever the reason, the study guide will not prepare you to pass this exam.
