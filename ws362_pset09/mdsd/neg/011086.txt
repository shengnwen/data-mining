This book is a huge disappointment.  Instead of discovering the history of a wonderful people, I found bigotry, racism, snobisness and intolerance.  At page 200 or so, and after many tries to warm up to this author with her narrow-minded and slanted views, I decided to just put it down and search for unbiased history in other sources. To readers who haven't visited the Balkans, I'd suggest save your money to actually travel there.  You won't be disappointed by the wonderful islands or it's people.
