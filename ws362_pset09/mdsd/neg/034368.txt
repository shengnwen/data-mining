I have owned a 4-quart Romertopf for a few years and wanted a cookbook to try things beyond my current self concocted recipes for turkey parts and duck. The title of this book sounded very promising, but if I had looked through this book in a bookstore, I would not have gotten it. 

Some of the recipes are nice, but could just as, actually more, easily be made using regular baking dishes than clay pots. I was looking for a cookbook where using a clay pot made a difference in the final product--and this book is not it. 

As two examples out of many I could use: 

1. Braised Red Cabbage with Cranberries - All the clay pot does is provide a covered dish for the final cooking. Prep cooking is done in a frying pan. One could just as easily make this dish completely in the frying pan, covering it until done, or use any covered container one already has and finish it in the oven. 

2. Banana Bread Pudding - Calls for use of a cazuela, a Spanish, clay pot that looks like a high sided pie pan. The cazuela is not necessary for this dish to be made. Any similar shaped, metal or glass, baking dish could be used.

Whether one likes lamb or not, the recipe for Gigot of Lamb with Garlic is one of the few recipes in this little book that is probably much nicer made in a Romertopf (or other covered clay pot) than in a normal covered roasting pan.

The most frequently called for Romertopf size is 3-quart.
