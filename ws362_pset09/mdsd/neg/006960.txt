Waxman's book makes one wonder if she really writes for the New York Times.  Any amateur film geek who's actually seen the films she writes about will find multiple errors, strange, unsupported statements, poorly written and edited sentences, and could probably write a better book themselves in short order.

That said, Waxman's interviews do give her a point of view on her six main subjects which is interesting, and some of the gossip is compelling.  Waxman badly needs an editor.  She thanks one in the acknowledgments, so apparently someone held the title, but no one much seems to have performed the function.  Had a good editor got hold of this manuscript, it might seem less like it was written in crayon in a big hurry.  Which is a shame, because it does have its moments, a few revelations, and a driving narrative.  But too much takes away from these strengths to recommend the book highly
