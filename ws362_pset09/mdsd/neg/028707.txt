The first book that was sent to me was defective.  The pages in it were out of of order and the book was missing about 80 pages.  The seller assured me he would send another book, which was also defective in the exact same way.  The seller has not contacted me despite several efforts to contact him and resolve the issue.  

I am never speaking to/dealing with this seller again
