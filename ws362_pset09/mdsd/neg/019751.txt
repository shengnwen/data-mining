I am a third grade teacher so the title interested me.  I found the main character obnoxious.  She judges people by their appearance.  She judges herself, her friends, and her teachers by this yardstick.  She is disrespectful to her teacher.  This is behind her back of course, but not a good model for young readers.  There are too many wonderful stories out there in the literary world to be bothered with this book
