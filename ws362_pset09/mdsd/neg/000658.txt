I didn't like it, I was looking for some profound thoughts to be spilled into my lap but I didn't get them.  I am not sure if in the time that it was written it was completely out of the ordinary with its contraversial "philosophy" but I didnt get much out of it.  It seemed to be steared towards a more self loathing, unhappy and hermit crowd. I prefer something more thought provoking and honestly different.  But maybe I missed a lot, I was almost falling asleep through most of it.
