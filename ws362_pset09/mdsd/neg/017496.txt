My biggest problem with this book is that it features very few good graffiti artists. VFR, CYCLE(?) and REVS are the only notables here. The others are bozos whom attempt to look tough with bandanas covering half thier faces with mediocre tags in the corners of their portraits. And that, my friend, is all this consists of; the taggers word written on thier portraits. Many of these guys aren't even from New York (that is a fact.) I think the area of concentration should have been on the walls rather than the faces of psuedo-street-tough kids.
