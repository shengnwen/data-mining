Before you buy this book cut/paste the following words into a Google search:

"Hank Hanegraaff" financial

Then come back to this review.

It makes me weap to see Christian ministries misuse God's money. My advice?  If you really MUST read this book, buy it USED so the money goes to a struggling book seller.
