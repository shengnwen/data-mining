This is yet another self-serving piece of fiction from Mr. Scoblete.  He continues to profess the idea of "the captain", yet no one has ever seen him but Frank and his close circle of followers.

Here, he goes even further, offering up this "famous" 5-count, never explaining that the average person tosses only 6 rolls per hand.  Yet here he is recommending giving up 5 of those before even considering placing a bet.  I wonder if this is the "Golden Touch" they speak of...having you hold your bets until a hand is almost over.

As like so many other Scoblete craps books, it is long on unverifiable claims and short on beneficial advice.  A very disappointing read
