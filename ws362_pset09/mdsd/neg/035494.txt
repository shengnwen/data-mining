I bought this book because I wanted to look into the mind of Damien Echols.  I suppose I did accomplish this to some extent because his writing is honest, if adolescent.  Damien reveals himself as not a monster, not a hero, but as a somewhat self centered and bitter suburban boy-man.  His life experiences after his arrest are so limited that he depends on the somewhat trite events of his childhood and teen years as the basis of his world view.  His religious search, ending in Buddism, is questionable in that his supposedly deep spiritual voyage ends in yet another unconvincing conversion.  He is no longer the 19 year old black-wearing suburban "magick" deadbanger at the end of the book, he has been transformed into a white (prison) uniformed vegetarian Buddist of 30.  And yet, a distinct narcissistic overtone spoils any genuine belief that he might have transcended a youth that he so despises.

Do I know Damien better after reading this book?  Yes, but I'm not sure that I like him
