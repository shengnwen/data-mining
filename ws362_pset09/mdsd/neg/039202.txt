This is an interesting book, in that it might encourage the reader to think about things outside of the one's traditional framework.  However, if you take the time to dig up the articles that Radin uses as "proof", you will find that some of them are all but incoherent.  I tracked down the authoring scientist behind some of the papers regarding time, and he informed me that his results were due to chance and not replicable (and also that he is no longer a scientist).  It makes me wonder if Radin actually read the articles before disseminating incorrect information to the public.  I realize that scientists have to eat too, but Radin should never have sold a book at the expense of truth.  Also, be careful with the graphs, which are often organized in a deceptive way.  I can verify that some of the psychokinesis stuff is legit, but I would advise anyone who reads this book to a) take it as fiction, b) find the original articles, and c) try to replicate the experiments yourself.  It sets us all back to have people spreading false information.  Peace
