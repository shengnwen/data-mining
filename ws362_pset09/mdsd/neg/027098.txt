I was not pleased with this selection at all. Of the five books I purchased through Amazon.com involving the single parent, this was the only one I could not force myself to read. Instead of giving you insight and  advise on single parenting, the author used Bible verses that implied  single parents were inferior to two parent families. Too much negativity  for me!!
