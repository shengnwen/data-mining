The recipes in this cookbook aren't simple, nor would I call this "home cooking." The ingredients required for some of these recipes are diverse and very, very gourmet-oriented. Truffle oil is often mentioned, for example. This is not to say that the recipes are bad, but if you're looking for easy, simple recipes, this is not the book to be buying
