Harold Lloyd was a good 3D photographer and managed the 3D very well, only too well I cannot say the same on whom prepared the photos for the book.
I worked several years using stereo photos, I take stereo photos for hobby and I must say that the 3D photos in the book are bad formed and printed.
Often they are misalligned and the colours of the glasses "lens" don't match with the printed colours.  
You may try to use green-red glasses, or perhaps it should be better if the two stereo photos were printed side by side (as in the "3D-Hollywood") and not so badly merged as in this book.
