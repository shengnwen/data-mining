For a book that was supposedly published in 2004 (according to its title page) this book is incredibly out of date. For instance, in the internet chapter, it talks about dial-up connections more than it talks about DSL.  It is almost like DSL is this brand new thing.  It is not.  It's been around for a while, most people, even colleges and K-12 schools, have some form of ethernet or DSL.  They are beginning to develop cell phones, for cripes sake, that get internet.  In fact, I have a cell phone that gets DSL internet!  My professor has found many errors in this book. For instance, there were misspelled internet domain names. They mislabeled .tiff in this book.  They did not go over the variations of most forms of software.  This book does not mention the ipod.  In the back, as some sort of scam to charge college students more money, they offer the 30 day trial versions of Macromedia Flash MX, Dreamweaver MX, Photoshop, among other things.  These are all old, no longer made versions, ones that last only 30 days.  You can download the newest trial versions for free from both Macromedia and Adobe online, CD-Rom free. If that's not bad enough, this book costs $66 in the school store.  All that for a book that is riddled with errors and is very out of date.  This book needs to be rewritten from scratch, all the errors corrected.  It is just one more bit of d***ing evidence that textbook publishers are out to insure that college students are broke while they are rich.  Salt Lake Community College needs to find a newer, better book from an author who cares more about the people stuck buying this thing than his Hollywood mansion.  This book is awful
