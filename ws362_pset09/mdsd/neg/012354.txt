I purchased Dr. Street's book out of curiousity of what the author would write to defend the evangelical method of altar calls and the ever so popular sinner's prayer.  Sadly, the book lacks any serious theological treatment of salvation and completely ignores the sovereignty of God in salvation.

The book seeks to be a guide both to evangelists and pastors to how to deliever an "effective" invitation (emphasis on numbers being the key word for effective.)  Dr. Street should have rightly named this book, "The Effective Manipulation Methods" and then traced the poor theology of Charles Finney right down to Billy Graham.  While Dr. Street does try to answer his critics (such as Martin Llyod-Jones) he never truly gives any answers but simply lists Llyod-Jones' nine reasons not to give an altar call and never gives any biblical reason we should do so.

Dr. Street works from a Baptist theology that ignores election and the work of the Holy Spirit (John 6:44; Acts 14:48) and places the emphasis on man (both pastors and hearers).  He cites not one biblical example of an actual altar call or genuine invitation but uses various Scriptures out of context to try to make his point.  He also gives justification to the sinner's prayer method although he never deals with any Scriptures concerning this matter (since there are none I would expect him to do so).  

Overall, unless you are an Arminian in your evangelistic approach, then I would not encourage you to purchase this book.  It offers nothing in the means of theological content.  You would be better to read Iain Murray's book THE INVITATION SYSTEM or John MacArthur's ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS, or HARD TO BELIEVE.
