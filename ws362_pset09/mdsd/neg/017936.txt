I got about one third of the way through before giving up on this book. Without knowing anything about the author, it seems like a romance novelist trying to write a mystery, and I think readers of both genres will be disappointed in this book. 

This is my first Amazon book review, from an avid mystery reader who hopes to write more reviews to help others as I have been helped by these reviews. I am not overly critical of books and if it's an enjoyable read, that's what matters to me. I won't spoil the plot, but will give my honest opinion
