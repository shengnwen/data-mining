Collector Books did not live up to its generally fine quality of productions in this guide to English ceramics.  The text is awkwardly written, confusing or contradictory in places, and colorless, lacking enthusiasm.

On the plus side, the range and selection of objects discussed is ample, and the illustrations of marks are helpful
