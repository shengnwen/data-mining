The dialog is cartoonish. As a screen play it would probably be okay. As a book for anyone older than 10 it isn't worth the trouble.   I had hopes of using this book for instruction about the punic wars. Now, I'm using it as  an illustration on how not to write.  Or,&quot; How could he have said this  better.&quot;   Sorry....its just awfu
