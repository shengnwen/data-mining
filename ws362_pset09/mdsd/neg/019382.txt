but not to read! :-) Simply unbelievable that Matt Dalton would feel he could write anything about the Peterson case worth reading! It rates right up there with something that Falconer (original juror #5) might pen! Some of these reviews certainly remind me just how gullible peeps can be. I'm glad I wasted no money on this borrowed drivel - just wasted the time it took to read it! I rated it with 1 star simply because that's the lowest choice here. In reality it's less than zero
