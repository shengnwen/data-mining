I can't begin to state how disappointing this book was to me; as a student of the early Republic, I enjoy reading a great deal of authorship concerning the Constitution and its aftereffects, much of which continues to ripple forward in our modern age.  There are so many infinitely superior works available to readers today, some of which have been previously mentioned, but also include:

Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton
Stanley Elkins/Eric McKitrick The Age of Federalism : The Early American Republic, 1788-1800
Willard Sterne Randall's Alexander Hamilton: A Life
The Federalist Papers
Darren Staloff's Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson : The Politics of Enlightenment and the American Founding
Lance Banning's The Sacred Fire of Liberty: James Madison and the Founding of the Federal Republic

...and many more.

The author's constant use of the word "blunder" only demonstrates his inability to write prose that is based on cogent arguments - rather, he opts to conduct mere rants and obviously demonstrates his simplistic, Jeffersonian bias in historical interpretation.

Normally I would refrain from getting too personal, but the only thing I can say about this book is that I now have something with which to line my birdcage.

Stay away from this "term paper" of a book and spend your money and time exploring the aforementioned books if you really want to  gain real insight into the events of the early Republic.
