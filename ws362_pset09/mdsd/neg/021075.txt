The philosophical paradigm of this book is that culture determines the way people value and behave in the business world. 

This book is relevant to readers who are new to the Chinese business world. Professor Chen from Darden Business School defines `Chinese business world' to encompass Chinese in the mainland and overseas. As the Chinese business world is very culturally-determined, he concludes that traditional cultural values govern how people undertake and organise their businesses in various aspects. Salient cultural values include family-oriented, guanxi and networking, the middle way, and patience. 

Professor Chen concludes that Chinese culture and business practices are diametrically different from the West. If readers are quite familar with the Chinese world, they will find a bit frustrated because there are too many management studies that have fallen on this subject. Another limitation of this book is that Professor Chen assumes that cultural values and business practices of Mainland and Overseas Chinese are analogous. He fails to understand that the way to conduct  business is different between mainland and overseas Chinese. For example, entrepreneurs from Mainland China tend to be more speculative or opportunistic and less ethical than other Chinese entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.
