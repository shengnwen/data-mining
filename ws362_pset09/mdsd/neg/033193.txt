I bought this book hoping that it was going to be user friendly, for people who dont know much about astrology. I dont know if I lost the ability how to count or Im really bad in math, because Linda's example (Ryan and Maria) on how to find the aspects like the sextiles, conjunctions, oppositions, trines, etc just doesnt match with the way I calculated them. Its really frustrating and confusing! I wish she had been more specific and had given more examples as guidelines. Because finding the aspects accurately, is really the main point on this book in order to get a good relationship reading
