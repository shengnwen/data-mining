upon reading certain passages in this reference manual, most memorably the article on the concentration/death camp at Auschwitz, i was appalled and disgusted.  while consistently refusing to refer to the National Socialists by their true moniker, NAZI, the book continuously UNDERCUTS the horror and mass murder committed against humanity by the Nazi regime.  understandably, this book is intended to inform, and must take a neutral stance. However, this book fails to convey the true nature of the horrors committed against humanity, and provides a voice that is almost SYMPATHETIC to the Third Reich.  in one article it says how most of the jewish prisoners in the camps died of "poor hygenic practices" and disease, while "some" of the deaths, "SOME" mind you, could be attributed to executions.  MOST of the deaths can be attributed to merciless murder and slaughter of human beings as waste.  do not purchase or consult this book.  it is a horror that it is even in print, and that Da Capo would even translate it into english.  while extensively informative, this book makes one cognizant of a perpetual nausea while reading.  do not buy this book
