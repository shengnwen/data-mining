Sorry, but I can't rate this book fairly as I still don't have it.  It's been almost 5 weeks since I ordered it, and I'm still waiting.  Several complaints, and I got a 5 dollar discount on my next order.  Why would I order anything else when I have to wait so long to get what I was promised in 2 weeks?  Next time I will buy at the local book store.  Yes, I will pay more but at least I will have the opportunity to read it before I die of old age
