 The Million Dollar Baby was a bummer. I mean if like long dry stories that may put you to sleep then read this book. The only story that is filled with action and will keep you on the edge of your seats is the short story Million Dollar Baby. The only reason why that is good because it's just like the movie and the movie is great. 
 The Monkey Look, Black Jew , Rope Burns etc. are about 25-30 pages a peace and they don't keep you into the book as others.The Movie is the only Millin Dollar Baby anything i would waste my time on.
