There's nothing new in the book. Nothing a good DM couldn't come up with on his own in an evening. This book does little to add originality or that "cool" factor to your game. If you want to wow your players, frighten them, make them smile with your devilish cunning as a dungeon master, do some serious scheming. You might surprise yourself with what you come up with on your own. Don't buy this book
