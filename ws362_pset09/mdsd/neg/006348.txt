Along with other books, I purchased this one to share with my 5 and 7 year olds.   I was disappointed as many of the reviews commented on the appeal of the book for younger children.   I would recommend this book for much older children (pre-teens)as we feel the language was too formal for our kids' age range. 

My kids absolutely enjoyed Prince Sidharta, When I was a Monkey and Every Breath a Smile and were able to understand the stories and messages without any explanation
