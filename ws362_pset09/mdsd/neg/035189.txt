The character is a lame fellow who decides to marry a woman he dislikes because he fells in love with her sister. All the pages of the novel are washed away describing inconsequential conducts and behaviors. I fail to  see anything funny or at least an issue worth discussing with a friend, let  alone explain to him/her what the book is about. Its theme is actually  about nothing. Indeed my feelings for this book contradicts the  enthusiastic reviews offered by other fellows, and I am surprised because  some books which I have bought from Amazon.com based on the popular opinion  have not disappointed me. Well, I guess there is always an exception to a  rule
