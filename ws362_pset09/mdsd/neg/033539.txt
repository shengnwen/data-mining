I picked up this book expecting a mystery, and I was sorely disappointed.  While I enjoyed the characters and the setting, and even the body of the plot, the ending was terrible!  It felt like the author got tired of writing the book and just... stopped.  It makes me wonder if the author knew the answer to any of the mysteries at all
