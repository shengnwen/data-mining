I have read a lot of Michael Crichton and thought it intelligent and interesting.  After just finishing "Travels" this afternoon, I have to admit that I hated it.  I know that this book was about his inner and outer travels in life in which he reaches self discovery, but in reality it is one of the most self obsessed books I have ever read.  He whines and complains and tries to find excuses for his bad behavior and his inability to have a meaningful relationship.  Instead of looking at the international travel (as little as he actually talks about it) as a great opportunity to learn about other cultures for who they are, he is continually belittling and condescending.  His only real self discovery is when he turns to self help and psychics so he can talk about how wonderful he is and how misunderstood he is.  For all his money and experiences he could have had the same attitude anywhere, one of ego centered self indulgences.  Nice try but highly frustrating and diary-ish.  He should have kept this one to himself
