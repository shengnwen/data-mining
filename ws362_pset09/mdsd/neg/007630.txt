I can't believe that other reviewers gave this book 5 stars. I was completely disappointed. The book included very little useful information  to help kids make good nutritional choices- "fruits and veggies are awesome" was about the extent of it. The text is uninteresting and cumbersome to read aloud, and the illustrations are not appealing. I am returning this book
