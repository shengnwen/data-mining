I have to agree with practically everyone here.  I do not "hate" this book, however, I never felt so disconnected over a romance novel.  I thought maybe it is just me - I mean, I work full-time with a husband and kids, therefore, I thought maybe I'm just too exhausted to read.  It took a full 9 days to finish the book & each time I struggled to stay awake even in the middle of the day!  The entire story is like watching an episode of "Seinfeld" about a story of "nothing."  Don't get me wrong, I liked Seinfield, however, one expects more in a romance novel.  Devon & Jocelyn are flat & without chemistry at all.  The sex scenes are actually average in a romance novel; however, they are slightly graphic, more in line with Stephanie Laurens minus the sensuality.   I just couldn't grasp with most of the characters in the story.  For instance, Jocelyn's harsh/abusive father & older brother are at the beginning of the story & yet they disappear right before her wedding without further explanation.  Another thing, Devon's siblings "sort of" just shows up in any event that he might be in or in a party without (again) an explanation or introduction to why they were there in the first place or how they even got there in the first place.  So much so that I had to go back & "re-read" the previous pages/chapters because I was feeling confused or that maybe I miss something.  It sort of gives you a feeling of "huh, where did that came from!"  Am I making sense at all?  The problem now is that I bought most of this author's books (older stories) and just the thought of spending another 9 days to get through to each one.  Yuck
