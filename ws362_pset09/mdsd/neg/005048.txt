I have been reading science fiction for about 40 years and the best I can recall, this is one of my least favorite.  Although some may like Jon Courtenay Grimwood's style of writing (if this is representative, not having read any before) I found it very hard to follow and very disjointed.  Although the central idea of the novel is a good one, the author, in my opinion, seems to wander away from the story line to provide meaningless details that tend to confuse the reader.  I have made it about half way through the novel but I am finding it very hard to complete
