I bought the book because i have a 3 year old daughter and i was excited to read a book about a mother daughter relationship, especially one that covered the difficult teen years that I have to look forward to!  What I didn't expect after just reading the first chapter was all the disturbing parts regarding her 3 - 4 year old being sexually molested by her drug addict husband who obviously grew up in an environment that made that horrendous behaviour seem permissible.  Had I known I was going to be subjected to reading that, I would not have bought the book. I understand that if you have a child going through drug issues it is probably an insightful book to read.  But I would have liked to have known that there was incest involving a toddler in this book before I bought it. I found it too troubling to read. Just a heads up.  Maybe it wouldn't offend others as it has me but I thought I would at least put it out there.  I am returning the book tomorrow as I can't read anymore
