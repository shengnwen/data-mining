I have been trying to read this book for over a year.  I can't get into it and I think it's time to throw in the towel.  I have gotten half-way through but the author jumps around too much.  The stories are interesting but don't really seem to have anything to do with one another.  Too many characters - could use a cast of characters or map showing how characters are related at the beginning.  The upside is that the individual stories are well written and it addresses some interesting topics.
