This workbook seems to be out of the niche that Amateur's mind was intended for.  After attempting the first 16 problems and getting none of them right, I needed to have someone explain why my guesses were wrong.  I feel like im not learning anything by thinking about a position for 15 min, coming up with my response, and BOOM, what a surprise, im wrong again.  I recommend a book that explains the right answer, as well as why some other moves are inferior
