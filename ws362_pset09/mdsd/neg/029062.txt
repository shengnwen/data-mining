I wish I could have read the reviews here before buying this book. I bought it while at the airport because the description on the back sounded interesting. It isn't the page turner that it could have been. 

The beginning is great and the gets you hooked, but it's pretty much what's on the back cover that got you to buy the book. Even from the beginning, Edward's prose is annoying, she describes things for no reason and it feels like she's wasting our time, trying to draw out the storyline. 

Once the main event is over, the plot goes nowhere and it's incredibly boring. I started flipping past paragraphs of irrelevant descriptions. 

I didn't think the ending was surprising at all. You know it's going to happen, you're wondering why Edwards takes so long to get to it. I did think it was touching and, fine, I admit it, it made me cry... but in my defense, I cry at everything (even that depression commercial chokes me up - Where does depression hurt? Everywhere. Who does depression hurt? Everyone.)  

All in all, this book seemed interesting, but I wish I had chosen another (better written) book to read.
