Though I am a huge U2 fan, I was disappointed by this book.  It is clear that it is written from a very ambiguous 'post-modern' Christian viewpoint, and this is echoed on every page of the book.  The author's agenda of reframing Christianity in the 'po-mo' world is so obvious and incessant that it ruined all the other aspects of the book.

To end in a cliche way, "I still haven't found what I am looking for"
