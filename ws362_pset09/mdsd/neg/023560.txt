I ordered this book to reinforce with my 2 year old why hitting is wrong. My son doesn't hit alot, but at age 2, he gets angry and doesn't know how to express his feelings.  I was hoping that a picture book might help him to identify his emotions and maybe identify some empathy for the person on the receiving end of the hitting.
While my son likes when we read read this book, and can easily recite from memory the mantra "that's not ok", he doesn't really make the connection to his own angry feelings and what to do with them.  
The title of the book, "No Hitting" is also a little misleading.  Only the first page actually addresses hitting; the rest of the book addresses other inappropriate behaviors that kids have when they are mad (like squeezing the cat, jumping up and down while yelling and screaming, scribbling in sister's book, etc).  Each page starts with the phrase "I'm mad. I want to (fill in the blank).  That's not ok, but I can..."  When you lift the flap, you see an alternative to the inappropriate behavior.  The weird thing is that the alternatives are not at all useful.  Even as an adult, if I were so angry as to want to hit someone, I don't think I'd be calm enough to ask for some pots and pans to bang away on (and neither is a 2 year old).
As a matter of fact, my son got angry at the cat the other day and tried to squeeze her (which he'd never done before getting the idea in the book).  Lucky for us, our kitty is pretty fast!
So, as an educational tool - not so good.  But the illustrations (as with all K. Katz books) are cute and my son really does enjoy the book and pulls it out almost every day
