It goes without saying that this man is a pioneer of his craft, however there are throngs of contemporary chefs who are doing things with food that show that they know their ingredients better than Peterson does- good cooking is a result of knowing your ingredients and knowing them well. Peterson claims that there is little, if any, difference between Wild, farm-raised, and Atlantic salmon. This is preposterous! The difference is oceanic. Perhaps Peterson has never eaten Wild King Alaskan salmon or Copper River Sockeye salmon or anything from the Yukon River, which is a real pity, because one of our lifetime's greatest foodies is missing out on the greatest culinary experience of all time! Save you money and spend it on Peterson's Fish &amp; Shellfish. Even the salmon recipes are better
