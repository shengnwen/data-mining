This book is terrible in addition to being ridiculously expensive ($108 to be exact).  I had to buy it for an MBA course in Managerial Accounting and found it to be extremely confusing, without structure and ambiguous.  There are numerous errors, omissions, and the examples are not clear at all.  It's really too bad such a poor text was chosen because I am certain that others, like myself, have been turned off of management accounting forever.  It's too bad because management accounting is such an integral part of business and deserves much better attention, and clarity than this book provides.  I can't wait to &quot;try&quot; to sell this one.  Definitely not a keeper!  If you have to buy this book for your course, I truly empathize with you
