Some of the continuations of Andre Norton's worlds have been gems, and some of them have been disappointments.  Beast Master's Ark is the worst to date.  The original Beast Master was one of my favorite books, with Norton's classic complexity of phrase, her textured and troubled main character, and her believable yet alien world.  This sequel has simplistic language, startling to someone expecting Norton's turn of phrase, and no plot to speak of.  The story never generates tension, and there is no climax.  McConchie does a great job with characterization, but good characters are not enough.  There must be some story.  To add insult to injury, there are multiple typos, and some editing mistakes like tense switching that add to the general sense of a book that is not well written.  I am sorry that Andre Norton put her name to this one
