Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.

It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be. 

It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.

The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.

This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable
