My four-year-old daughter was subjected to this travesty of a children's book in preschool.  Ever since, she has awakened nightly at 3 a.m., tears streaming down her face, worried about burglars coming through her window.  I'm not "squeamish" or a "namby-pamby" as suggested by other condescending reviewers of this book.  But I do value my sleep.  If you value yours, pass this one up.  There are many other good children's books out there
