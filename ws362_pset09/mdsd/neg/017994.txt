Maybe I am lucky... i have the original, limited edition New Falcon version.. even autographed by Chris Hyatt. I have owned the Llewellyn edition in the past, but disposed of it BECAUSE IT IS GARBAGE... incomplete, garbled... don't even bother with this edition. I believe "The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic" (New Falcon publications) is also still being sold on amazon.com. It is more expensive... but you truly get what you pay for. Don't waste your time on this Llewellyn garbage. I think ZERO stars would be more accurate..
