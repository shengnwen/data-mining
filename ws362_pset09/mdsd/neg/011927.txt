This book was a disappointment. The author is so deeply entrenched in gender stereotyping that she offers advice like this: "Praise your partner's strengths. If your husband does a good job quieting the baby, tell him so. If your wife demonstrates selflessness and patience as she cares for the baby, let her know you admire or appreciate those qualities" (33). Thus, the father gets praise for quieting the baby, but the mother must be "selfless" and "patient" in order to earn praise. Even my husband laughed heartily at this one! I was, frankly, shocked that a book written in 2000 could offer advice based on such simplistic male/female gender divisions. Sure, it acknowledges that new parents are exhausted and that marriage is a challenge, but it offered no advice I found useful.
