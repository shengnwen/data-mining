Yes, I have read portions of the book-- I couldn't stomach most of it.  It saddens me that Focus on the Family and MOPs promotes Ms. Whelchel as an author and speaker on parenting.  Many of the suggestions she have are in no way helpful to children in helping them to learn, and cannot even be called discipline which means "to teach" not "to arbitrarily punish."

For the record, I am a conservative Christian, not a liberal or seeking to rid God from anyone's lives.  I seek to raise my children according to the way God treats us all as sinners-- forgiveness and love and compassion.  Thankfully when I screw up (as we all do as both children and adults), God doesn't pour hot-sauce down my throat, drag me by the hair across a parking lot, hit me, or any other method along those lines.  He welcomes me back with forgiveness and uses the situation to help teach me what I did wrong and how I can try and not sin in that manner in the future.

For "John St Meyers" from Indy, you can't even quote the bible correctly-- the bible in no manner EVER says "Spare the rod, spoil the child", that is a widely misquoted & misused quote from a SONG in the 70s.

I would more strongly recommend books such as "Grace-Based Parenting" by Tim Kimmel, "Biblical Parenting" by Crystal Lutton, and "How to Talk so Kids will Listen and Listen so Kids will Talk" by Adele Faber
