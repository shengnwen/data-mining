All of these books that keep popping up saying you can do the math in your mind in seconds, are correct in one way.  Yes, you can do it...in fact you can do pretty massive equations using #'s in the millions or below, (or higher).  The thing that is terrible about all of these books is they sound like a modern day memory book or such.  They are ALL based upon what is called Vedic math.  It was the math form used thousands of years ago...generally dating around the Summerian culture.  
Vedic math really does work...in fact it's quite mind-blowing to put out answers to a large group of #'s just as someone finishes reading the problem! : )  Check out websites based upon Vedic math, or buy books directly relating to Vedic math...there's more to it than just putting it in print
