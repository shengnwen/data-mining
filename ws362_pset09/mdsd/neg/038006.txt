I think this is possibly the most overrated series I have ever read. Since I seem to be alone in this thought, let me explain.  

1) There is little to no narrative drive. Adams intrigues the reader with some interesting narrative points early on, but never actually gets to finishing the point, leaving the reader wondering why there is no resolution (was he bored when he wrote? or is he just sloppy? probably the latter).

2) There is little cohesion to bind the five part trilogy together. It's really just one random story after another. In fact,it's not really a story--it's more an extended TV series in which the writers make up plot points as they write (a la Alias). Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

3) Only the first book seems to be truly good. After that, it goes downhill. Unfortunately, the first book, ending without a conclusion such as it is, only makes the reader want to read further, which upon completion of reading further,the reader becomes disappointed that the further reading was not as good as the initial reading, which in turn makes the initial reading not as good as initially thought. Conclusion: overrated series.

It is however, somewhat funny. Hence, the two stars
