This book has a great cover and not much else. If the actual combat could be condensed into a smaller book, it would be about 15 pages long. Unfortunately, one has to painfully sift through some pretty bad prose or attempted poetry. He's like the Bonnie Parker of the German Army. His references or image to us wearing a mask were so redundant I could have screamed. I'd bet he used the "mask" image no less than 20 times, and in a small book that's 19 times too many. I only wish it could have been a true combat memoir and not a failed attempt at a Hemingway/Sasoon legacy. I truely wish for his sake that something better did book-wise come from his experiences.
