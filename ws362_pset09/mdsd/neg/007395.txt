I hate to add another neg. review but what the hell. This book read like a Hardy Boys book. That is fine if your 9 years old but these are supposed to be suitable for adults, aren't they? However, as others said, my love of  the show compels me to read the books. Child of the Hunt was far superior,  especially as it was rather ADULT
