I thought this book was very ordinary and at many times boring. The characters were flat. There was no discription of main characters themselves; how they looked, carried themselves, how people saw them or how they saw themselves. Characters like mothers, wives, son's, criminals and the main characters themselves just came in and out of the book. There was no climax to the story. The book is named for the daughter of a hummingbird and although he metions them in the book, he never explains how it connects to Teresita or her mother. We don't know why her mother left or even how Teresita's father felt about the mother. 

I felt as though I was reading a story from a first time writer who had no idea what the ending of the story would be when he stared it. It seemed to me he just wrote and wrote and when he had enough for a book, it was edited and sold. It had a thousand good stories in it but just as you think you are being taken into one, the author drops the person or the story line and moves on. I was very disappointed. I felt it had the potietial to be a great book or many great books. Maybe even a trilogy. There was very good detail about food and poverty but nothing about the characters.
