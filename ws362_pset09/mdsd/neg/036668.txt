Buy this book if you want to listen to this guy beating his chest about how he got wealthy by being a marketing guru and squirelling his income away like Ebenezer Scrooge. He boasts about how he still works part time for fun to generate money he doesn't need. But apparently he doesn't think about donating this money he doesn't need to charity let alone giving his precious time to charity. 

The really funny thing is, at the end of the book, he tells the reader not to buy brands and designer clothes but buy things only of real value. I agree with him. But he has just rubbished the entire marketing industry that he lauds in the first part of the book as a great place to make a highly paid career. It apparently does not occur to him that there is a big contradiction between the sales and marketing people who get paid megabucks for pumping products up beyond their real value and the truly skilled workers who create "real value" and get paid jack all. What a total cynic and hypocrite !
