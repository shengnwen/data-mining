Although this book would appear to have a lot of promise, it ultimately fails. Like Mr. Taylor's self-proclaimed &quot;Certified Professional Landlord&quot; title (Fill in your name on page 218 for your own bogus certification!), these phony forms are imaginative but have little to no legal standing. Worse, Taylor apparently has little respect for his tenants. One form, the &quot;Tenant Late Rent Warning and Excuses&quot; form (&quot;To be given to new, renewing, and late tenants.&quot;) asks tenants to mark a box as to why their rent was late. Sample excuses: I was mugged. &quot;You didn't come by when I had the money,&quot; &quot;I didn't have a stamp,&quot; &quot;I'm dead.&quot; A chuckle for a landlord, but also a cynical and unprofessional suggestion. Taylor's advice on handling phone calls from prospective residents is even worse - he promotes using a hard-sell interrogation on the first contact that seems destined to drive away prospective tenants. Anyone with intentions to do good business would be well served to get more professional advice than this extremely disappointing book
