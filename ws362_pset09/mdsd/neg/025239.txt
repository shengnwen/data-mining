I'm not going to waste much time on this book review except to say that of all the books I've read on this disorder this one is the worst.

This guy comes across as a total jerk and I think this book is a fake. I think the writer of this book is secretly laughing at all of us who purchased this book and I sincerely feel this guy wrote this book as a psychology student joke.

If you want to read the best book on this disorder read The Minds of Billy Mulligan
