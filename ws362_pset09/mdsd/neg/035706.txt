I found this book to be quite disappointing, juvenile and unbelievable. The characters are irratic and the story line overdeveloped in some places and underdeveloped in others. Example: if a wealthy New York bachelor is trying to impress his affluent next door neighbor with a house warming gift, he most likely would bring something from Tiffany's, not a MacIntosh Yankee Candle. And what world class Manhattan hotel would have a gift shop that contained both emerald earrings and a section of Christian fiction? If I were you, I would pass on this book
