I grabbed this volume from an airport bookshop hoping, as always, for a good read, but as well to learn a bit about a period of Chinese history that I have not read deeply in. Alas, Man's book fails on both levels.

Halfway through and the Mongols are conquering Asia. This part of the book is well written. Exactly why Genghis is the leader and why the Mongols are following him is left unclear. Indeed, after a rough childhood, being kidnapped and escaping Genghis emerges as head of the Mongols? Why? I do not know. The historical record here is probably sparse, but that is no excuse to skip over these years. They are pivotal to explaining why the Mongols emereged. Would the Mongols have emereged under another leader? Or, was it just Genghis?

The final third of the book is spent in Man's quest to find Genghis grave. The lack of any maps to go with the travelogue leaves this section quite confused. Then again, is Genghis's resurrection only to be seen in Man's hiking about the Mongolian woods?

Somewhere there is a good biography of Genghis and the Mongols, but this is certainly not it
