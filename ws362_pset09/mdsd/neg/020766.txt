This book reads like a hand picked set of scientific facts woven together to support the argument that dogs are not man's best friend at all.  Although interesting and informative in some parts, this book is also repetitive, meandering and overly negative in others.  The first half of the book runs through some interesting observations about the genetics of dogs and their behavioural links to wolves.  This is interesting and you can read through it in one enjoyable sitting.  However, as the book goes on you notice that Budiansky gets more and more negative about dogs, using a thinly veiled veneer of science to try and make his arguments look objective.  He basically describes domestic dogs as being inferior mutations of wolves.  He seems to be trying to tell us that we need to face up to the fact that our dogs don't love us, but that instead they are using us like parasites.  Moreover, all their signs of affection, play and obedience are actually just instinctive behaviours that have evolved to help them in the wild.  OK - if this corresponds to your experience with dogs then this is the book for you.  For me, I haven't got time to read all the underlying scientific papers but this just doesn't square away with empirical evidence.  Budinsky himself makes a point of the fact that comparatively little scientific research has been conducted on dogs.  This doesn't seem to stop him from using what has been done to denigrate them.  Overall this book doesn't give man's best friend any credit at all, and I suspect that many dog owners would find it quite disturbing.  The fact that it tries to use science to back up its bias claims is even more troubling
