What dispicable human being would write such a book after someone took her in and gave her a pretty good childhood compared to other children I know. Christina Crawford, according to many historians, was a little brat who expected to be treat royally just because she had been adopted by a film star. However, Joan herself was brought up to earn her place in the world and worked hard to get there. She had no intention of letting her children grow up without learning these good rules.

If you don't believe me what a horrid human being Christina Crawford is, then please view the Turner Classics documentary on Joan Crawford (with Angeica Houston as narrator). In every segment where Christina talks, she comes across so bitter ... she has not one nice word to say about her mother, just criticisms.  After all these years, Christina is still bitter!  And you know why? Simply because she was jealous of all the people out there who loved Joan Crawford for the wonderful films she gave us.

Only the most rotten of children would write a book about their parent.  Why would Christina want to destroy her mother's image.  Only a nasty unhappy soul would do that. Christina should have been left in the orphanage.  

Joan was a maginficent actress, who deserved alot better than this treatment after her death! Shame on Christina
