After reading Skinny Legs and All, and loving every word, I bought this book on tape.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with it and stopped listening after the first CD.  How many times do we need to hear about an extra large scrotum?  It must be repeated a hundred times, and it just wasn't amusing.  The reader, Barrett Whitener, tries to do the best he can, but his poorly contrived Japanese accent (which sounds more like a German accent), just doesn't cut it.  I'm sure if I gave it another 3 or 4 hours of listening, I might get hooked, but who has that kind of time to gamble??
