Many reviews are approved )or disapproved) by a slim margin -- one third to one half. Hardly ANY reviews of her books (i've looked at others)are either universally liked or disliked. What gives?
NOTE i've skimmed two of her books, because I'm so soft headed that I actually think I can learn from my opponents. I give her two stars for chutzpah. (Somebody explain to her what chutzpah is.)
In constrast, read the amazon.com reviews of Frank Rich's "The Greatest Story ever Sold," which seems to make the usual liberal attempt to be fair and somewhat respectful of his opponents. Most of the reviews of his book are overwhelmingly approved or disapproved by 5 to 1 or 10 to 1.
Ann Coulter produces lukewarm responses. Frank Rich provokes fervid love or hate. Can somebody explain this for me??????
