I read through all the 5 star reviews prior to purchasing this book.  I was very disaapointed to find most of the book devoted to very basic hardware concepts. Much of this information is obtainable from sources cheaper than a $70 book.  For example, the MPC7450 PPC Reference Manual is over 800 pages and is free (check out Freescale or IBM websites) - you will learn about microprocessor architecture too!.  There are two chapters in the book (Chapters 1 and 11) that have a weak discussion on architecture, and after a lot of hand waving, finally refer you to some other books (see page 533) that actually discuss architecture.  

So if you know nothing about hardware or were sleeping in class, you might find this book useful.  I am sending it back - and next time I will read all the reviews
