Schuller desires to take the reader down a feel-good road.  Unfortunately, the path is littered with little more than cliches and pop-psychology.  The text is a series of sound-bytes which is easily equalled or surpassed in most any book of collected quotations, or, if one prefers, a Google-search under choice key words.  The road signs of the book (i.e. the gist of the text) are 1) you feel unfulfilled; 2) don't worry, be happy; 3) oh yes, and God wants you to be happy.  All the road signs are supplemented with the above-mentioned sound-bytes and pop-psychology.  In keeping with the spirit of the book, I took the path and stopped at Schuller's lemon tree.  Unfortunately the lemons were not good.  I then tried to make lemonade.  Unfortunately the lemons were so bad that no amount of sweetner could make them palatable.  In fact, it became unhealthy.  I tried several other uses, but all were equally unproductive and unhealthy.  I began to wonder why--then I realized that lemon trees, in order to produce palatable fruit, must be trimmed regularly.  The lemon tree at the side of this particular road is in need of serious trimming.  There is better and more nutricious fruit to be found elsewhere.  Even the old cliche "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" is of no use when the tree itself is no good.  It is this last part that Schuller fails to adequately address.  Too bad.  I strongly suggest you take a different and more scenic road that bears much better fruit
