This book is geared to what the author calls speed tournaments, those with relatively low starting chip counts and fastly increasing blind structures.

If you follow Mr. Snyder's advice, you are ruling out the overwhelming majority of tournaments at the major online poker rooms.

I'll save you some money. In a nutshell, play small, fast, low skill tournaments. Your cards don't matter. Play aggressively in late positions and if someone plays back at you, fold.

If you're looking for books to improve your game in 90% of the tournaments you might really play, get Harrington on Hold 'em I, II and III instead
