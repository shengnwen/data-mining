I chose this book for a college writing class assignment. I had to read it, then critically review it. I've always been an avid reader, and no book has ever made me feel stupid, but this one succeeded. It almost felt like Rick Moody was trying hard to use as many confusing words, sentences, and formats he could think of. Some of the stories took me days to get through, and I only finished them because I had to. Some were better than others; I sort of liked "Boys" and "Forecast From the Retail Desk", but everything else left me with a headache. The worst were "Pan's Fair Throng", "The Carnival Tradition" (still have no idea what that was about), "Ineluctable Modality of the Vaginal" (16 pages - 1 sentence - give me a break), and the two "list" stories: "Wilkie Fahnstock: The Boxed Set" and "Surplus Value Books: Catalogue Number 13". None of the stories had any real character development, and some had no recognizable plots. There are maybe people who will understand this stuff better than I, but this is still not a book I would recommend to anyone I know. If you're someone looking for enjoyable short stories, please don't buy this book.
