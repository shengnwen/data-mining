The "detective" character, Goldy, is terribly annoying and way too cute for words. The books could easily be shortened by 100+ pages. Every detail however small and unimportant is described in excrutiating detail. Bad writing + bad character development = frustration. Don't waste your time and money with this crap. If you are looking for a non-professionsal female "detective" story try Murder on Martha's Vineyard by David Osborn.
