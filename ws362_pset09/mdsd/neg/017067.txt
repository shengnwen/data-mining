It took me almost a year of off-and-on reading to finish this book. In most stories, there is at least one character that you can identify with - even if it isn't the author's intended goal. In this book, they are all pathetic losers on a fast track to Nowhere Land. To call this a monumental work is laughable. The story moves like sludge until the very end, then becomes simply forgettable. If you enjoy being abused with other people's dysfunctions, go for it. Otherwise, don't bother
