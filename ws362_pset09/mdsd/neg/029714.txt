One of the other customer reviews for this book (which may have been removed by now because I have complained about it) says: "This book has been updated to include the 4.1 version, a big improvement over the old book which covered 3.0 or maybe 3.1."

But clearly, that customer was referring to the 2nd Edition of the book - this book that you are looking at is the First Edition; in other words, it IS the old book which only covers version 3.1. I know, because I just bought it for $20 and now I will throw it away and buy the 2nd Edition
