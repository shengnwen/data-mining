I've read everyone of the books in this series and look forward to each new one.  Ms Fluke has painted herself in a corner.  Hannah is a "good girl" so the romance part is limited and the readers have become bored with the Mike or Norman thing!  Now what?  The mystery was fine for an "American Cozy", the recipies are fun, but get on with Hannah's life.  Isn't her biological clock ticking?
