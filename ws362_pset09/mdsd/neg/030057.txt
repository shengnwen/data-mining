This book.  I can't say it was the worst book ever, but I was bored reading it.  I could care less about Paris, and if you don't like the main character...I am not the best at figuring out who the killers are, but this one was SO easy, I thought I was wrong.  I love that he is a red herring, but still obvious. Was she trying to be coy? I don't like her coy. She needs to stop that
