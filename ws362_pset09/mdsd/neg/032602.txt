At last Ambrose begins to tackle the massive British contribution to victory. but it is a disappointingly short and skimpy look.

Ambrose (and one notes, some US reviewers below) manages to recognise the victory at the bridge, but understates the non US contribution overall. Remember, approx 50% of all forces in Normandy were UK/Canadian/Polish etc. - and far from failing, as one reviewer below has it, they held, and ground  down, the bulk of the German forces in Normandy, enabling US forces to break out against relatively weak opposition (this is a fact, not an opinion -look it up). 

Perhaps it is a little unfair to direct one's ire at this, his belated attempt to recall a few of the non US troops involved. His book on D-Day might be a more suitable object of one's scorn (4/5 about US troops alone). Yet the frustration millions of non US readers feel at being written out of their own history seeks an outlet.

It's not as if, say, UK historians - like Keegan or Neillands - have tried to minimise the US contribution in their books. All the allied armies made a huge contribution to victory. So why the chauvinism on the part of Ambrose, d'Este et al? do they feel insecure, or is it that they have fallen into mere parochialism? Thank goodness not all US historians are as narrow this.
