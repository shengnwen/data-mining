Is basically a brief introduction and outline and then many examples. The examples are all mostly from the 2000 decline in the market. So the book outlines a very specific approach and highlights examples that fit that approach. 

Given the cost of the book , I don't mind having it in my library. So far the best book on short selling was written by Justin Mamis . The book by Kathryn Staley is great as well. The focus there is how to look at the balance sheets and corporate shenanigans. Both these books are not light reading though
