I found this book rambling, difficult to understand, and not particularly well written.  The main thesis that all that exists is NOW  (see the other reviews for more detail) was not proven in the book and, as far as I can see, cannot be proven empirically (mathematical proof without experimental proof is not adequate).  In my opinion this book's theories belong to the realm of science fiction. If you want to let your imagination roam, anything is possible. Maybe everything is an illusion.  Maybe I am the only thing that exists in the universe.  Maybe there are all sorts of simultaneous universes that are constantly breaking in on each other.  Etcetera.  If I tried hard enough, I could probably support each of these ideas with concepts from quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. 

I don't think it's unusual for theoretical physics to cross the line from science to conjecture: This book is in that tradition
