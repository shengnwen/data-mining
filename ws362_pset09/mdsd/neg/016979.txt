This poor unfortunate book has a tragic case of identity crisis.  It is Wodehouse dressed up as MI-6, and the whole getup just looks absurd.  Hugh Laurie is actually a pretty good writer- especially for someone whose day job is acting- but this particular fairy tale was unsuccessful.  The protag. is amusing, and the narrative is pithy.  However, the plot is one which requires the reader to sympathize with the characters.  Basically, I didn't.  Laurie spent so much energy trying to make his protagonist funny, and forgot to make him interesting or loveable.  I'm a little bitter about that, because I'm pretty sure "Dr. House" is capable of better work.  Come on, give us better! Chop, chop!
