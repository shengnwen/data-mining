I found this book to be highly disturbing.  If you're looking for a sultry read I would definitly NOT recommend. I am about as open minded and sexually liberated as they come and usually I thoroughly enjoy erotica.  However, I could not get past the first chapter of this book.  This is the first and only book I have ever returned and received a refund for within two hours of purchasing it.   Within the first chapter, the author begins depicting sex games between an adult male and 10 & 12 years old girls! She then describes the main charachter raping his daughters and forcing sexual acts on his sleeping son.  How is this "exquisite" literature?!? Would it be okay to purchase a video or a photograph of this happening? Condoning imagery of forced sex with children is far beyond acceptable imagery.  By allowing these kinds of images to be glorified we are saying "it's okay to think about children in a sexual way."  Not only is that disturbing but its not EROTIC!  That is terrifying!  There are a great many things we adults may fantasize about doing to each other.  There are plenty of people in the world who think even consenting adults shouldn't be able to control their own sex lives.  I am not one of those.  I do, however, feel that children have NO PART of adult fantasies.  I'm amazed that this book has come so far with people glorifying such sad acts as "erotica."
