Regina Herzlinger's &quot;focused factories&quot; of tomorrow are the &quot;centers of excellence&quot; of the 1980s.  Both concepts are fine for metropolitan areas but ignore several important facts:  1. 80% of health care resources are consumed by 20% of the population, the elderly and very young;

2. There are about millions of people who neither live in areas large enough to support such &quot;factories&quot; and lack the financial means to travel to them.

3. Consumers are concerned largely with price and convenience, and secondarily with outcome.  They have no basis by which to compare technologies (such as mammogram machines, as she suggests).

4. Patients aren't paying the bills.

Consumerism isn't a panacea.  Patients have no idea what health care truly costs, equating cost with price.  Physicians haven't been  much help either, since they lack sound business sense and have been shielded from market sources for decades.

The &quot;solutions&quot; at the end of the book appear to have been pasted together to meet a deadline instead of being carefully constructed with adequate supporting arguments.  It is reminiscent of the cartoon of two scientists next to a blackboard covered with equations, one of which is &quot;and then a miracle occurs.&quot;

Finally, Herzlinger made the same mistake as Hillary Clinton.  Physicians are not about to accept changes in their system made without their input.  Ultimately, they still deliver the product and, unless one can figure out how to construct a health care system sans physicians, one must include them in any talk of reform.
