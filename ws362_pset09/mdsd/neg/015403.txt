If you are expecting more than a dictionary- Don't buy this book. If you are a reenactor, this book is not for you. The book is filled with names of items and dictionary type descriptions. There is very little written text  beyond that. The book seems to be geared more toward the beginning and end  of the 1800's with little regarding the 1850's - 1870
