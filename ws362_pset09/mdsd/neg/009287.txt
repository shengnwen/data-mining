This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last.
