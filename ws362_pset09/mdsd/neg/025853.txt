I just had to put this one down!  This was one useless book in my opinion.  I purchase it for its alleged value to the business person.  I just didn't get how the content was applicable to selling to the aging or where the  author came up with some of his ideas.  I would be inclined to agree with  the readers from California.  This was one dry and pointless piece of  fiction
