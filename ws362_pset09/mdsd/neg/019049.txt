This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.

PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.
