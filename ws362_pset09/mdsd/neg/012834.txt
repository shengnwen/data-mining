Very mediocre, overall, and I was disappointed with this latest addition.  This probably wont be a very helpful review as my main problem with it has a lot to do with the problems I had with the last book or two in the series.

I never particularly liked White Haven - as a character, I find him fairly shallow - and don't sympathize with his cheating on his wife, though quite a lot of time was spent trying to make me 'feel his pain'.  Whatever.  The relationship developments were tremendously disappointing to me and I hated how Weber worked it all out between the three of them. *shudder*

The Honor Harrington that I loved so much in the first few books has become someone that makes me wonder.  I barely recognize her at times and I mean that in a bad way.  

Ah well.  Let's just say that by the end I was hoping Haven would get off one good, lucky shot at the planet and accidentally take out White Haven's estates with durn near everyone in it.  That would have cheered me up
