After reading some of Connie Willis' other books, I must say that this book was very disappointing to me.  After finishing this book it didn't even enter my mind once like Doomsday Book and Bellwether did.  It was very confusing and it didn't seem like the plot was going anywhere.  Like another reviewer said, I didn't know that Fin was female until almost the end of the book.  The reason that this isn't just one star is that the book was funny, especially the character Bult so I could enjoy the book a little bit
