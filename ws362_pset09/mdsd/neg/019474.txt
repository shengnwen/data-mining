It is always amusing for me to come across  yet another attempt at "Revisionist Koresh History". In this book the author tries to portray David Koresh as a misunderstood religious leader instead of being the evil sociopath that he truly was.The author attempts to give the reader the "Human side" of Koresh's followers.What he fails to describe that it was all a case of "David , please take my wife and daughter, kindly plunder my Bank Account and that way we won't have to think for ourselves anymore".The author glosses over the numerous Charges of Child Abuse while ignoring the fact that Koresh kept the children for 51 days in a hostile environment where there was no running water, electricy, heat or even decent food. As a negotiator with David Koresh the author failed miserably in respect to not getting the innocent children out of harm's way into the  care of the proper authorities where they could be given a hot meal, a warm bed and a safe place to live far away from conflict and gunfire.The author tries to show the real humanity of those involved and fails because there was no Humanity in that Compound only a thug who hide behind women and innocent hildren and interpreted the Bible through the barrel of a gun
