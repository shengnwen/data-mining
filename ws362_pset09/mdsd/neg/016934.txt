You know how it grates when you're exposed to a really really loud car stereo?   That's what this book is visually.  I am not interested in using a cookbook that 1) hurts my eyes and 2) isn't very original.  I mean, don't kids get enough stimulation nowadays without printing a cookbook this garish?  

If you're looking to get the kids into the kitchen, save your money for The Everything Kid's Cookbook or Mommy and Me, both fantastic books for that purpose; or for ultra kid-friendly new recipes, Beyond Mac'n'Cheese (by MOPS), or if you're really serious about family cooking, The Cook's Illustrated Family Cookbook, all excellent selections.  

For healthy alternatives, get the BH & G's Kid's Favorites Made Healthy--a really excellent book with lots of recipes that are charming and easy to make. Skip this tome, which aside from scarring your retina, is mundane at best
