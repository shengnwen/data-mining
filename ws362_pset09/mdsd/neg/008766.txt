The goals of the book area laudable but I find it very frustrating to read.  The diet directions are very general and scattered; they seem very unorganized.  I found a lot of contradictory information such as a quote from a doctor saying it's impossible to loose more than a pond of fat in a week and then 2 or 3 pages later several testimonials as to how people lost more than 2 pounds of &quot;weight&quot; in a week (averaged)on Null's diet: well which is it?  Also, he recommends eating with canola oil (a Frankenfood type product). There were other concerns but I do not have the book in front of me.  He seems to make many claims without telling you why it is so.  While reading the book I wondered if someone made a fake copy and I was reading it.  I expected so much more from this book.  However, overall I see it for the good it is trying to accomplish and still recommend the book: I just do not see it as very &quot;solid&quot; in instruction.  I  wish it was better formatted as to how to do what he says.  It basically recommends a vegetarian diet and more live foods (vegetable, fruits,sprouts,lentils) while cutting out dairy/wheat.  I found the recipes to be very odd mixes.  I got a few ideas from it but they are &quot;weak as water&quot; recipes.  It is neat that he recommends getting a balance not only in the diet, but also in the home environment, emotional, physical, and spiritual.  I may need to read it twice
