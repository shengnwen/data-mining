the author in my opinion has never clinically interviewed, met, or examined Princess Diana while she was alive. To use her life episodes as though he is qualified to diagnose a person he has never met, is unprofessional and salacious in the extreme. As I understand it, it is not considered ethical in the helping professions to diagnose people one has not examined personally and at depth. I would recommend Walking on Eggshells, The Borderline Mother, and other serious books on borderline personality disorder that do not play fast and loose, but give real case studies that the author has absolute firsthand knowledge about. 

BPD is too paintful a fact and too serious a subject to spend time reading a book that misappropriates the life of a dead woman who cannot answer the author's charges about her psychological states. If you live with a person who suffers from BPD or think you might suffer from BPD yourself, read a book that teaches coping skills and gives real cases in all their variations, and see a good shrink in person too
