This book has been on my 'list' for several years and I finally got around to reading it recently.  I might have saved myself the time - both in anticipating it and reading it.  I found none of the characters to be sympathetic.  Instead they were all somehow - how is it possible to be both? - boring caricatures.  It felt like reading a book that was being written while what the author really had in mind was a movie.  The sex was gratuitous and the so-called action felt forced.  Above all the author may or may not still live in the South, I'm not sure, but it seems odd that she found this bit of real history and place intriguing enough to write about and yet a true contempt for New Orleans and Southerners comes screaming through
