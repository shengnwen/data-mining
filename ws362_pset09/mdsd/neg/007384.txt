Customer reviews of Ted Allen's "Everything a Man Need's to Know About Style" criticize the lack of detail and shortness of the book. I would say Kressley's longer and more detailed book, "Off the Cuff," suffers from the opposite problem in my opinion. Overflowing with filler and fluff, this book doesn't have enough useful or funny information to justify such a lengthy hardcover book. If you took out all the useful parts, what you'd have is Ted Allen's shorter - and cheaper - version. If you could buy them both used, I'd suggest buying "Off the Cuff" for what little it has that Allen's book doesn't have but otherwise save your money.
