All you have to do is turn off your mind, relax and float downstream and you too can be a wealthy writer and go jetsetting with all your glamorous friends. Any actual writers reading this advice are probably expiring of laughter.  

Being able to construct a simple sentence with proper spelling and grammar does not, in itself, make you a writer. It would seem to be a prerequisite of becoming one, but the lady who wrote this book apparently feels that it is preferable to lose control and write gibberish -- perhaps she's trying to encourage students to write the kind of garble that passes for "intelligent literature" nowadays. 

Unfortunately, being told that you have the ability to write does not mean that you have the ability to write well in terms of plot, story structure, word choice and all the other elements necessary to high-quality, memorable writing (marketable or otherwise). Skip the autobiographical content; get what you can out of the guidelines.
