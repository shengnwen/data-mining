Such beautiful pictures, and they are great inspiration. Makes you want to spend the day in the kitchen.  There it ends. I tried the white chocolate-candy cane recipe twice.  It just doesn't work.  We (I have a professional kitchen) added flour to make a manageable batter, but after baking could not get them off the baking sheet.  More adjustments, and finally succeeded in making a cookie that no one liked.  We also tried the two layer desert with brownie bottom.  Expensive mess.  The  beautiful photographs are worthy of framing or put the whole book on your coffee table.
