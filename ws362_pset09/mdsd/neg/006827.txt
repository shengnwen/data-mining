Yes, the U.S. is running headlong towards several serious financial problems, and Panzer includes a few alarming statistics that help document this.  However, the bulk of "Financial Armageddon" is composed of vague generalities (eg. we don't even get an approximation of how much current federal, state and local obligations total), unexplained situations involving complex financial instruments (derivatives, hedge funds, various risk-assumption tools), and his recommendations (minimal debt, maximum pension and healthcare protection) are banal and useless.

Some of his interesting observations:  1)Foreigners now own over 42% of outstanding Treasury securities, up from 30% in 2000.  2)By 2005, 13.4% of mortgages were subprime, up from 2.1% in 1999; meanwhile, 25% of mortgages outstanding carried adjustable rates.  3)Profits of U.S. financial firms have risen from 4% of the total in 1982 to over 40% in 2006.  4)Not one recession in the past 50 years has been predicted in advance by a major poll of economists.

Unaddressed topics include rising sentiment for major foreign holders (China, OPEC nations) of U.S. debts to switch to investments in other nations, as well as the likely consequences of their doing so and their alternative leverage over U.S. policy by threatening to do so, outsourcing and illegal immigration's contribution to our declining financial future, opportunities to substantially improve healthcare quality while saving money - eg. providing national healthcare coverage (less administrative expenses, increased incentive for preventive and appropriate care), or the opportunity to substantially reduce wasteful education expenditures - eg. inflation-adjusted per-pupil annual operational expenditures have tripled in the last three decades with no improvement in graduation rates or NAEP 17-year-old achievement scores
