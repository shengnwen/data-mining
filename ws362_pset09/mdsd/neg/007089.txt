Lynda C. Welch writes her book from a Wiccan perspective.  She attempts to bring her reader around to her idea that all of the Asynjur (Aesir and Vanir Goddesses) are really just different perspectives of one Goddess.  The Wiccans believe that in the final analysis there is only one God and one Goddess.  While there is nothing wrong with having such a belief system it is shameful to try to underhandedly misrepresent your belief system on those seeking knowledge of the Goddesses of their path.

As an Asatrur this book is highly offensive for the above reason.  The Asynjur found in the Eddas are named and their deeds are written for all who wish to honor them.

As a Gydhja (Asatru priestess) I would recommend that any who seek to learn of the deeds of the Goddesses not waste their money on this book.
