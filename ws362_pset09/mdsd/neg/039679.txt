This book will be a great disappointment to many stroke survivors and their relatives, as it was to me, a survivor. It tells the story of one man in England, with moments that make you think there is a similarity, only to be disappointed.  The only hope for the book is the wife's diary, and her  feelings from the event through the treatment. But even then there is the  feeling that her diary in censored, knowing that it would be published. The  author does direct the reader to some other good books, and gives us a  happy ending. The book does teach us that life goes on, even if you have a  stroke, but stroke suvivors already know that fact
