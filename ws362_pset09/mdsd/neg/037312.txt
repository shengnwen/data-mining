Before I begin, I would like to say that I am not an expert on the subject, but I do personally feel that some more advanced animals (apes, dogs, etc) do very possibly have some type of lower, basic emotions.  When I purchased this book, I hoped that the author would provide some detailed scientific evidence supporting the theory that animals do have emotions and accounts of examples that demontrate the theory in action.

Unfortunately, all I got was an attack on the idea of "Anthropomorphism" and Science as a whole, some anecdotal "evidence" and some hackneyed junk theories that the author just made up as he went along.

When the author takes a break from telling you how evil and heartless scientists are or endorsing a vegetarian lifestyle or spewing out the kind of drivel you could find in a run-of-the-mill PETA pamphlet he presents such arguments for his case as "Animals have emotions because this person over here who owns a dog says so."  Wow, truly groundbreaking.

This book is a hotbed of junk science only made to appeal to dullards who want to hear someone that seems important and/or smart say that their dogs love them as much as the reader loves their dog, even if it's not proven with any real science
