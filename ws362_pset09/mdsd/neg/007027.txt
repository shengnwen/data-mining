This is a fairly mediocre mystery novel in a series I've always found enjoyable if not memorable. But this one has something I'd not previously seen in any book, though I've heard it is a new trend.
Apparently the author isn't making enough money from book sales and has resorted to product placement.  The frequent mentions of Walmart might have been overlooked, but the laudatory paragraphs advertising Home Depot in the middle of the book are startlingly obvious and strain credibility.  (Good service? Not in my experience.)  At any rate, advertising seeping into books is a terrible idea.  Let's hope it doesn't catch on
