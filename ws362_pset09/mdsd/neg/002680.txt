I studied this book looking for the Biblical Truth about angels. People talk about them all the time. And seem to attribute almost everything good to the presence angels or their service to us humans. After all, who is taking care of us? Is it angels, God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) or angels at the direction of God?
I'm afraid I did not find out the answers to my questions. The book contains many scriptures that refer to angels and then the author's personal examples of when she believes angels were actively involved in her life. Pretty much what I had been hearing from other people. How wonderful angels are, guardian angels, protective angels, blessing angels, etc.
So I'm left with only one Biblical Truth. The angels in the Bible always say that we must not worship them. But we must worship the one that sent them. Praise God
