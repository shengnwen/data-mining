I picked us this book because I heard that Senator Kerrey was a presidential hopeful for the Democrats. Turns out that is Senator John Kerry from Mass, not Bob Kerrey from Nebraska. Regardless of the political future of the author, this book was a disappointment. Senator Kerry tells two stories, the first of his uncle who was killed in WWII. Second, his own story of growing up in Nebraska, joining the service, going to Viet Nam, being wounded and recovering. However, there is no analysis of the events past the obvious &quot;Viet Nam was a mistake&quot; and we were not fighting to win. He also stops and at the point where he gets out of the VA hospital and does not tell us how he went on to become a US Senator. I would not recommend this book
