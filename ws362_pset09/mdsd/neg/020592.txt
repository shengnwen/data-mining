I've been fascinated with Peter Gabriel since I was 12 years old.  I bought this book hoping to get some insight into the man and some info on those early Genesis albums.  The book got off to a great start; discussing the early days of Genesis as school chums.  But as the book progresses it begins to read like a discography.  So-and-so made a solo album with these musicians, Genesis made this album, here's how it did in the market.  The writing is marked by british style humor and language. But this does nothing to make this book any more interesting.  It lacks insight into the bands characters and barely discusses what's going on in their lives.  For example, at one point the book mentions Peter Gabriels wife Jill.  Uh, no one told me he got married! who's this jill person?  what does she do?  Later the same thing happened with phil collins.  When did he get a wife?  early on there are some good stories but later all we hear about is that they put out a new album, who was on it and how the album did.  a little about the sound too.  oh well, they'll stay mythic in my mind.
