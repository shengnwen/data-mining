Mr Heinrich is touted on the inside back cover as a scientist. Maybe so, but he didn't bring much science to bear on this book. It is a thinly disguised peon to Barry Sears' work on the Zone, with a lot of personal  anecdote and opinion thrown in. The bibliography is telliing - too many  popular articles and not too much science. I have nothing against Sears'  work - in fact I'm a fan - but this adds nothing to the genre. And boy did  I get sick of the phrase 'pasta, pasta, pasta'
