When I read a review of this book, I was interested and checked it out of the library. It was a quick and easy read, and, unfortunately, also a disappointment.

In author Shellenbarger's favor, it must be said that the book is literate, well-organized and based on a reasonable methodology of data collection. It even has footnotes. It categorizes female midlife crisis into specific types, and gives defining examples of each.

However, _The Breaking Point_ is also quite superficial, despite a few offhand references to Jungian psychology. After awhile, the collected personal stories which are used as examples start to sound like a litany of airheaded people who made bad decisions (dropped out of college to get married, married emotionally remote men, tried to mold themselves according to other people's expectations) and eventually wound up paying the price. The book also has virtually no perspectives that are not rooted in the last 50 years of human experience, which makes it difficult to take seriously.

I am a 52-year-old woman, recently retired, and I find it impossible to identify with these people. I also find it absolutely astonishing that anyone should find the notion of continued personal growth a radical solution to any problem.

This book may possibly be of assistance to women who are like those the author interviewed. There is at least one piece of sensible advice herein: throwing yourself into a series of sexual or romantic affairs may be dangerous to your mental health and your marriage.

Sorry, Sue, nice concept, weak execution.
