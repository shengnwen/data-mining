This book is a sales brochure, nothing more. Ted Breaux serves as an "editor"  for the book and then gives his own Jade brand absinthe a glowing review without ever revealing that he is the distiller of the product! This is a basic matter of editorial integrity: shame on all three authors for not being honest with their readers!

They also misattribute the famous phrase "absinthe makes the tart grow fonder" to Oscar Wilde instead of Ernest Dowson! Anyone who has any knowledge of literary history knows of Oscar's preferences -- he didn't "do" tarts. That was Dowson, pure and simple, author of the incredible poem "Cynara".

This book gets one star for the poster reproductions...and that is generous.
