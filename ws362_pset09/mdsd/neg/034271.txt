This isn't a great read. The story feels static. Nothing much happens. The narrator (Cath) goes on and on about her life now, her two failed marriages, her children (who are not well-developed characters), and her desire to learn more about her grandmother. The grandmother's story, unfortunately, isn't any more interesting. I kept waiting for the climax, the epithany, something, anything, to break up the monotony of the narrative, but it never came.
