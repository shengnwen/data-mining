I have been a big Rumpole fan every since the PBS series, and I thought I'd give one of Mortimer's other books a try. If he could strike gold with Horace Rumpole, why not with Lucy Purefoy? Unfortunately, no such luck.

	Lucinda Purefoy is a bishop's daughter recently graduated from college. She takes an advertising job, but something is missing, so she decides to volunteer for an organization called SCRAP, Social Carers, Reformers and Praeceptors, who help former prisoners readjust to society. That's how she meets Terry Keegan who's just done four years for breaking and entering. They fall in love.

	The conflict begins when Terry tries to explain to Lucy why he got into burglary in the first place. "It's not for the money," he says, "It's  the excitement." She wants to get closer to Terry so she decides to try it for herself. She begins by shoplifting. When Terry finds out about it, the roles are reversed. Now he's the one trying to get her to go straight. 

	When Terry looks down his nose at her trivial efforts, she decides to increase the stakes. There lies the problem with the book. It's just not believable; it reads more like Bridget Jones's Diary than a crime caper. I would imagine Mortimer was trying to lampoon do-gooders here, but Lucy is such a dim bulb that the reader is constantly telling himself, "She can't be serious!"

	The minor characters are worse. Lucy's father the bishop is more liberal than Teddy Kennedy. When he finds out Lucy is sleeping with Terry, he's all for it. Also, when the leader of SCRAP resigns, they solicit Terry's criminal overseer, Chippy McGrath, to take his place. Mr. Markby, Terry's parole officer, is just as clueless. These people just don't measure up to the Rumpole characters. Somebody should have had the courage to tell this to Mr. Mortimer
