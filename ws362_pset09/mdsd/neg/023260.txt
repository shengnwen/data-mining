 This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. It is not only inaccurate and slams ministries that have brought thousands to Christ (like John Arnott), but actually cruelly brings up very personal issues that fellow Christians are trying to heal from by the grace of God. This book has always been harmful and it is full of Pride and Judgement. Avoid it at all costs! Instead read John Eldredge, Max Lucado, or Brennan Manning
