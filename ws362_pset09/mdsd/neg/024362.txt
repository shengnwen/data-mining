It appears that John Jakes likes to write about conflict.  This book is comprised of conflict in war, conflict in relationships etc. etc. To me his characters do not seem real.  Also, I don't like the way he creates situations where he reverses right and wrong. It is a book that lifts immorality as a good thing. This was my first and last John Jakes book.
