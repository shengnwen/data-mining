I bought this book thinking it would help me to understand what the schools know, only to find out that the Department of Education has not yet released the regulations. My district now tells me these federal regulations are what our state uses to make determinations on their own regulations. So while this book does give information about the law (and as another reviewer stated, it can be found on the Internet for free), it does not directly address federal or state regulations, since they have not yet been created. So, I found the book only marginally helpful, thus two stars for a good effort
