Unfortunate but true - the author clearly has not read the Harry Potter books themselves.  The "writing" itself is painfully stilted and gives the strong impression that scant facts have been surrounded by stock "fantasy" adjectives and adverbs and then bluntly tacked onto a generic "bio" outline.

I'd heard that this wasn't a great bio but while waiting for the Half-Blood Prince I broke down and bought it anyhow thinking "Just how bad could it be?"  The answer is "very."  I urge you not to make the same mistake.  However many times you've read the books themselves you'd be much better off reading them again than reading this
