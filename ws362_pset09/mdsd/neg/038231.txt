I enjoy the pottery barn style and since we are doing minor renovations that give me an excuse to redecorate my bedroom I couldn't wait for this book to arrive. I checked the online reviews of all the PB books and saw some complaints, but I thought overall I'd be glad I made this purchase. Wrong! I flipped through it once right after getting it and I doubt I'll pick it up again. I recall a reviewer of one of the other PB books saying there's nothing in here that you can't get from one of the PB magazines and that reviewer was right. I actually think the bed and bath magazines are better than this book. I'm very glad I purchased just this book and didn't waste money on the entire set. I guess I'll wait for the next PB magazine to come in the mail for any redecorating inspiration
