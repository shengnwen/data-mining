There are some good things as well as some bad things about Micro Fiction. The good thing about this book is that it has variation in the texture and tone of the stories. My favorite would have to be Morning News which was written by the author himself.   Also the author has managed to touch on many different subject matters. However the bad news is that many of the stories in the book are not very well written, some of it is formula fiction and I had trouble understanding the meaning behind a couple of them. The upside is that the book costs less than $2
