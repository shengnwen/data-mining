This was a disappointing read, to say the least.  For starters, Father Nevins starts with a concept of Fundamentalism which would leave most self-described Protestant Fundamentalists scratching their heads!  Nevins proceeds to "answer" a number of Protestant arguments, some of which would never be posed by any serious Fundamentalist or Evangelical apologist.  Nevins also commits a variety of informal logical fallacies.  (At one point, he even appeals to 20th century usage of an English word to determine 1st century usage of a Greek word!) In the interest of fairness, we should point out that we are not at all sympathetic to Nevins' cause, but we believe that the works of Catholic apologist Karl Keating are far more useful for both Catholics and Fundamentalists.  With no animosity for the author himself, we do not believe Nevins' book was worth the brief time required to read it.
