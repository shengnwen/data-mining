This and Mad Jack were stunning dissappointments.  Where are the fiery heroines, the ones with true pluck and spirit?  Why do all of Coulter's females become bedridden at some point?  What happened to the mystery?  There was nothing fresh about this novel.  The relationship is missing the brilliant spark that is so enchanting in many of her previous works--it seems lately Coulter is marrying off her couples earlier and earlier.  This story has been done to death by Coulter.  Try the "Song" series or the early Sherbrooke brides
