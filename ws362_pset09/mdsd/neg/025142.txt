I hated this book for all the same reasons that the previous reviewer loved it.  Latour's voice changes add some depth to the story, but are done in a manner so convoluted that much of the substance is lost.  Using Aramis itself as the voice of martyred technology just becomes increasingly absurd throughout the book.  There are much better books than this out there about man's relationship with technology, do yourself a favor and find one of them
