I read a favorable review of this book so I got it.  I have
been reading obits for a good while and they are a great delight.
I thought this book would aid me somehow in this pursuit,  but
it did not.  All it did was to puff up  the professional obit
writers, about how interesting they are, unappreciated , etc.  I guess I should have gotten a book of actual interesting obits instead. If the author could have cut the
book down to 20 pages, it would have been enough.  My advice
to people who are interested in obits,....  is to read obits.
