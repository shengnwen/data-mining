 I've often said I think I was born in the wrong time.  I love the Big Band era. The clothes, the cars, the styles, and of course, the music. So let me preface by saying, maybe I'm spoiled. I have the Ken Burns Jazz documentary on DVD, along with the complete CD music collection, with most of the "individual" CDs in the series.  I own a respectable collection of Big Band music, CD's and vinyl. And I have a weekly Big Band Radio Show every Saturday morning, "Moonlight Memories". I even have the movies "The Benny Goodman Story", and "The Glenn Miller Story" on DVD. 
 I always look forward to reading about the Big Bands, the leaders, and the era.   But with this book I should've looked backward.  It reminds me of a 7th grade book report.  Written with huge type, wide margins, three page chapters, and plenty of spelling errors. (It isn't Paul Whitman, it's Paul Whiteman) But worse, the level of writing is only at about a Jr. High level.  I was VERY disappointed. If you are really trying to learn about the Big Band era, or even just want a "casual" read about your favorite bands, pass this by.  $19.95?! This book is $2.95 at a bargain/used book store at best. I'm sorry Bob Wilder. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice... won't happen.
