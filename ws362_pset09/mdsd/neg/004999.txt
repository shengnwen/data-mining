This strategy guide for Company of Heroes provides a broad overview of the game and some useful basic information about the different types of combat units and their weapons capabilities. However, the guide fails in its basic mission: to give insight into the operational tactics required to secure objectives and succeed in the game. A significant portion of the guide is taken up by weapons descriptions. Although this is helpful, the reader would be better served with advice on how combined arms tactics could overcome most of the challenges presented in CoH scenarios. Overall, I rate this product as needing improvement.
