Maybe I should have been more familiar with the Greek tragedy this story is based on?  Frankly, I'm not sure what purpose was served by switching back and forth from Classical Greece to modern day.  What I did like was the very on target insights as to how a gay man feels from adolescence to adulthood.  Personally I think the book would have been just as effective by just keeping it as historical fiction.
I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone
