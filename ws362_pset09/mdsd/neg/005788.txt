The title and what seemed to be overwhelming praise captured my attention.  When the book arrived I was eager to read it.  I cracked the pages and my jaw dropped, not in a good way.  This book is so poorly written I am baffled  at how it ever got published in the first place.  I read as much as I could but the poor use of language and annoying blocks of italicized text made it impossible.

I returned to Amazon to look at the reviews, again.  This time, rather than just taking the star rating and "featured reviews" at face value, I really went through page by page and evaluated the reviews.  It appears that many, many kids have been assigned to write a review here at Amazon as part of a class project.  

If you read through all of the reviews on this site you will see that most of them are written by children.  95% of the kids reviews have given the book a 5 star rating which has thrown off the rating.  If you pay attention to the reviews not written by children you will see that the majority of adults do not enjoy this book.

If you're between the ages of 11 and 13 you, apparently, will love this book.  If you are an adult, who knows better, don't expect much from it.  In my opinion, it is a waste of paper.

(On a side note:  A little time investigating the author brings into speculation about the veracity of his story.
