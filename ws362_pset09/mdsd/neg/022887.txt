I read this book because it won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1983.  It is, I believe, the least intersting and most esoteric book I have ever read.  It reminded me of my reading of Fin-de-Siecle Vienna, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1981, and which I long wanted to read and then when I read it I found it a chore to read, and greatly welcomed the last page.  The last chapter of Transformation made no sense for me at all, and reading this book's only significance is that I have read another Pulitzer Prize winner in history.  I thought I should warn persons who might be overly influenced by the other 3 reviews and might think this would be a great book to read
