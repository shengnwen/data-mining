I've owned this book and after a few years the pages of the book fall out. This makes the book useless as a reference book. I've had the same problem with Tab books and Sams books. I keep my copy of "Teach Yourself Java1.2 in 21 Days" with rubber bands to keep the pages in. I think that it's time for the Japanese to make their appearence into the book industry. Beware of Osborne, Tab and Sams books
