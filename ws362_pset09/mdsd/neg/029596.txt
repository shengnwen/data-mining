As many others have pointed out, this book is quite biased in it's handling of the cuisines of different countries.  Yes this book is quite Anglo-centric, but what would you expect?  There is also a clear dislike of all things American and the author would have you think that this countries sole contributions to the world of gastronomy are fast food joints and Coca Cola.  

However, the reason I only gave it one star is the accuracy of the entries.  We have a right to expect that reference works from this publisher be painstakingly researched to present information without error.  But there are just too many factual errors to ignore.  Three examples serve to make my point.

In an entry about ice cream sundaes, he refers to one of the towns as Two Rivers, Michigan.  Two Rivers is in Wisconsin.  Next, in an entry for chuck wagon he refers to wranglers as the assistants to the cook.  Wranglers handled the movement of the herd and never, ever assisted the cook who almost always worked alone.  Third, in an article about the United States, he writes of the emergence of fast food chains including "White Tower" Huh?  I'll admit that sliders aren't for all palates, but the chain is White Castle.

There are just three that come to mind but I'm only up to the letter F.  Should obvious, easy to research mistakes such as these be tolerated?  For me, it brings the accuracy of the entire book into question.

I expected better from Oxford University Press
