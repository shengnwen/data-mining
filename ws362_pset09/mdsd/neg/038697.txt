I found nothing in this book that was not in the first.  Also, every single house photographed in this book is done in contemporary style, and I am not a fan of contemporary.  The first book had a much wider variety of looks and styles.

In a nut shell, don't waste your money.  Go to your local book store, thumb through it, and put it back on the shelf.
