This is the third book that I've ever read by Donald Goines and now I'm confused about whether I like him as an author or not. This book was really hard for me to get into after Prince got out of jail.  Then when the Cougars came in, I was all over it.  Then when Ruby got all Queen Bee, I was bored again.  It was just one big roller coaster of emotions. I'm still going to read another one, because I didn't like his first one, thought the second one was great...so I figure there's a pattern there too
