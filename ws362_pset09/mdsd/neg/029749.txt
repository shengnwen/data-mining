I bought this book based upon Amazon reader reviews. There was little advice that was other than common sense, and much that was silly at best (for example bring water from your old home). The major points could be summed up: have an open mind, be flexible, bring old things so you are comfortable, and find ways to join and meet new people. There you have it. Save your money
