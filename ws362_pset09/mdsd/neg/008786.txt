I give this book two stars for effort and its Christian perspective, but he reverts to the "forgive at all costs" mentality. Some things aren't forgivable, nor should people be expected to do so. This may lay an additional burden on people who are suffering, trivializes their injuries, and it gives the abuser an out. Still, a decent effort. Might be helpful in addition to counseling from a ministe
