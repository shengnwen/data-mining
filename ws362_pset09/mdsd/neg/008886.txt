Basso's book is intended for younger teenagers, but it promotes abstinence, and is not reality based at all. As a high school teacher, he has to be conservative in this society, but today's teenagers will not accept his message, nor should they. The book is really sex-negative, and as such, it is not very relevant to today's teenagers, especially those 15-19.
