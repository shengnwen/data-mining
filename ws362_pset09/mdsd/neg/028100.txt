That's the refrain I kept repeating to myself after each new unbelievable plot twist.  It's what I told myself at four in the morning when I finally reached the last of 453 pages.          

At first I was intruigued.  The storyline was rather ingenious.  Instead of the usual serial killer we have a madman who ends the lives of beautiful young women while keeping their body intact.  In the beginning the characters show a hint of future depth, a  promise unkept.  I let myself sink into the story.  

I should have known better.  Gardner McKay has taken a wonderful, interesting and novel idea and turned it into a story so unrealistic I that it becomes cartoonish.  

The DA and the entire LAPD refuse to look for this madman.  What could the reason be for such a failing on their part?  It seems that this particular psychopath is beneath their notice because he doesn't actually kill his victims.  Without a death on his hands, his crimes will  land him in jail only slightly longer than a car thief.  

The fact that he keeps his victims against their will while he plays and toys with them (thus the name Toyer) does not seem to bring the thought of kidnapping charges to anyone, nor a dozen other charges that come to mind.    

After the first third of the book, the plot twists and turns become so easy to call that it was almost sad.  I rushed through the rest of the book, not really wanting to absorb it so much as finish it.  When I came to the final crescendo of the novel,  I stared incredulously  at the last line.  Fruitlessly, I kept searching for something else, another chapter, a note that said "To Be Continued".  Surely after all I had gone through to reach the end Mckay wouldn't have left this so...unfinished!  Unfortunately for his readers, he did.  

One long night without sleep later I put the book down and told myself, "remember, it's only a book"!
