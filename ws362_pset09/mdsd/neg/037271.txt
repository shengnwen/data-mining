I travel extensively and am a fan of Frommer's guides which I generally find to have a nice assortment of options in varying price ranges.  The volume on South Africa however, was a great disappointment.  If Frommer's were to be believed, you had to pay $200 and up for a decent hotel room.  Fortunately I have often traveled in South Africa, enjoyed its reasonably priced accomodations, and knew such prices were nonsense.  I stayed in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban and other top destinations in season for less than half that much.  The guide also overlooked  destinations a bit off the beaten path and proved of so little use to me that I didn't bother to pack it home with me. I strongly suggest the Eyewitness guide instead or just surf the web for tons of great information from the South African Tourism Board.
