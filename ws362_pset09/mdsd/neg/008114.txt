I have read or listened to the entire Cat Who series and this one was a so far off base that finishing is was painful. There was no mystery The 'Barn" is lost almost as an after thought to fill space. I feel that someone tried to pass this off as a Ms Braun's story to meet a number of words requirement.  There was no plot development even close to the of past Cat Who books.  This was on book I wish I had never purchased.
