If you wish to believe you are permanently damaged, and blameless, and wish to stay damaged: This book is for you. Ms Miller's thesis is  that all of us have been damaged by our parents and we can never overcome that damage and loss of potential. While I am aware, after years as a psychotherapist, that some parents are genuinely abusive, I am also aware that maturity is transcending ones childhood and becoming whole. For some maturity is too much emotional work and they choose to remain damaged, blameless and whining victims. Their choice. Ms Miller further infuriates me by maintaining all children were abused and those believing they had a happy childhood are in denial, dellusional. This book offends me, as a psychotherapist, as a parent and as a mature adult who needs not be a victim of childhood. I suggest instead the Wolins book on Resiliency. And stop whining!!!!
