I bought both this book and Nolo's Every Landlord's Legal Guide thinking they would address different things. I really wish I didn't waste my time reading Landlording! It's verbose and wastes 75% of the book (and your time) trying to be cute with silly examples. The information is in there but you have to weed through a morass of text just to get to it. I couldn't believe how much more succinct and effective Every Landlord's was, providing ALL the same information with none of the bs. And that comes with a free CD of all the documents you'll need. I agree with the other reviewers that the information is useful. But there are much better ways to get at it. If you don't believe me, go to a bookstore and look before you buy
