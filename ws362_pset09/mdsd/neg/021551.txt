The sub-title of this book, "Rapport-Based Training," made me give it a try, even though I do not employ force-based training methods. I do, however, try to give everyone a fair shake.

However, there were some things in this book -- which is full of hypocrisy, BTW -- that turned my blood cold. His inclusion in puppy testing of checking for pain sensitivity (he calls it touch sensitivity), because your training program will assume the dog will respond to pain, is chilling. And the statement "Experience says that force is an inescapable training element" shows that, no matter how open-minded he says he is in the preface, this trainer has not explored all options. He views "tough" dogs and "submissive" dogs as irredeemable, while other training programs not based in force have turned these dogs into wonderful companions.

Although at no time does the author suggest that he is not a force-based trainer, he states repeatedly in the front matter that he gives a dog a chance to learn before applying force; yet from lesson one he recommends giving a new verbal command to a dog and applying pressure with a pinch collar to force a dog into various as-yet unlearned positions. Hypocrisy. 

I was hoping to find in this book something more based in relationship-building than the traditional correction-based methodology, something I could recommend to those who cling to force-based methods. Yet the only place where I could agree with this author is that a pinch collar is less damaging than a choke chain (which, frankly, has no place on any dog). It was a disappointment.

Better reading materials for those who don't want to use strictly food-based training methods include "Excel-erated Learning" (Pamela Reid), "So Your Dog's Not Lassie," and "Never Say No"(Dr. Mugford).
