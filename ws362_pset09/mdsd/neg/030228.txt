Seeing the other 5-star reviews makes me wonder, eihter those reviewers are clueless or I might have missed something big.
The main idea of the book is that if you can figure out the expectations incorporated in a market price and then evaluate the likelihood that (the more important of) those expectations may be wrong, you may actually find mispriced stocks and thus uncover good investment opportunities. Which I think is a nice idea, but is much easier said than done. The way the authors propose to proceed can be summarized as follows: (i) figure out from publicly available info and analyst reports the main consensus drivers such as sales growth, operating margin, cost of capital, etc., (ii) figure out what forecast period you need for a DCF model based on the consensus assumptions to produce the current market price of the stock, (iii)evaluate if any/which of the assumptions used in the DCF model are likely to be wrong, and based on that, (iv)make a buy/sell/hold decision. The reason this approach doesn't seem to add a lot of value to me is that it essentially consists of evaluating the assumptions used by other analysts (or other "consensus" numbers) to see if they make sense. This is what a lot of investors are already doing, except that it's a notoriously difficult task, and once you've gone through the pain of evaluating the main driving assumptions behind the consensus DCF, you are just a half-step away from building your own DCF anyway.
I'm giving the book 2 stars though for the pretty useful frameworks for thinking about drivers in a DCF model, and for being written in a fairly concise and articulate style
