This author's writing style is so awkward and clumsy, both in the manner of writing and in the plot development.  Everything about this book was so contrived and unbelievable.  Two grown adults are "forced" to marry in the 21st century, based simply on the bride's father's threat to financially destroy a town?  A billionaire father ignores his daughter during her entire life, yet cares enough about her safety to buy her a husband?  The hero hasn't gotten over his late wife's murder EIGHT YEARS AGO, not because he misses her, but because he will never know what she felt in her final hours before being murdered? The hero and other male romantic sub-character both realize they love the women in their lives after a bright green light shines down on them from the sky? Huh??   Nothing made sense.  Also, all of the characters were under-developed.  I'm guessing, based on the little that was written, that Honor was supposed to be an impressive business manager, and was planning to manage the town's historic district, but almost nothing was written about how she was doing this.  The main characters never talked to each other much over the weeks they were together, but somehow fell in love.  In short, this book was an outline, not a fully fleshed book.  Don't waste your money
