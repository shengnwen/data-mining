I have been waiting for this book for a while as the publishing date slipped a few times. Having recieved the book, I wish I never bought it. To start with 2/3 of the book is about java, optimisation, a poor section on JDBC and some networking stuff that you can find anywhere else. The remaining of the book is a general discussion of Java and the last chapter (Ch 15) is about a simple 3d engine (jist 3D)which is pretty incomplete. The book has many incomplete code snippets and no games in sight which is surprising when the authors have been around the game development forums for such a long time.
 The book seems to be a poor attempt in discussing games development in Java. More like an attempt to cash in the market demand.
 If you are buying this book to learn about Java and 3D, then there are better books such as -Developing Games in Java- by Brackeen which has good explanations about various aspect of game development in java.
 My advice is that dont waste your money on this book
