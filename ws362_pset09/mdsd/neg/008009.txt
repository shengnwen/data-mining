"Unspeak" might have made an interesting article for a magazine, but the material the author has gathered here doesn't warrant a book. It embeds the journalistic fantasy that seems to plague so many modern ink-stained wretches: the fantasy that, since objectivity cannot ever be accomplished, subjectivity is just fine thank you very much, and that anyone's subjective stance is therefore as objective as anyone else's. [Incidentally, this is part of the reason for the awful modern 'news' practice of having journalists interviewing each other.]

The book is really an embittered rant against (mostly) modern public political discourse. The author's particlar political prejudices shine brightly, and badly distract from the central theme of exploring political speech.

Minor errors (such as seeming to completely misunderstand the very old term "natural sciences") further disrupt the flow.

The book this one attempted to be still needs to be written
