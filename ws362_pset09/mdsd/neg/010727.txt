Most of the online reviews promise a lot but the book doesn't deliver and that is a great disappointment since an understandable guide is need. The author does not explain and illustrate the relationships between rgb (additive) and cmyk (reflective) in enough detail for one to comprehend how to read color coordinates in the info window and then correct the images using PhotoShop's image adjustments whether they be curves, levels, or whatever (which require thinking in both color spaces). The author is an expert on the four process color inks on the press and how they relate to cmyk color densities on printed paper but how to achieve the corresponding correct color densities in your digital files using PhotoShop is not clearly communicated. I've learned more reading the compressed &quot;Create Print&quot; articles in MacWorld by authors like David Blatner (a fine writer) then I learned from this book. My recommendations are: if you want to understand the basics of digital prepress then the Agfa Guide to Digital Color Prepress (though dated) is far better; if you want to understand channels then PhotoShop Channel Chop (also dated) is better; if you wants to understand curves then the PhotoShop Artistry books (version 5 or 6) are better. If you want a professional's insights into how he goes about correcting cymk color situation along with lots of self accolades, well this is it. Also be warned that none of the photographs measure up to the quality of good commercial stock photo images. Hopefully, by the next version of PhotoShop a good technical editor can turn this book into the gem the PhotoShop audience needs on this topic
