I have issues with racism in any form but I find it equally as offensive when books like this come out which try and make a race out to be victims.  

In a nutshell, if someone is complaining that they are being taken advantage of and still being paid 40 million, or even 1 million, one has to ask themselves, "Is this guy for real?  How stupid does he think we are?"

I place the authors intentions of writing as fair and just, but somewhere along the line he corrupted the concept into something grotesque, offensive, and just plain wrong.  I could have read and Ann Coulter book and been less offended by the implications
