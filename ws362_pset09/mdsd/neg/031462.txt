This was THE WORST book I've ever read.  I literally read the last page while standing over the trash can, letting it fall into the can as I finished.  This book was so disjointed... It jumped around from past to present, from boyfriend to boyfriend and back and forth.  I was actually annoyed while reading it and can only be grateful that I didn't spend my own money on it!  There was no plot, no point and definetely no entertainment to be had in this very boring and very pointless read.
