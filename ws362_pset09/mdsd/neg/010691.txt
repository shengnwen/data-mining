because this book is so bad that it'll take your mind away from it. 

Sacre bleu! Someone reported all my previous 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be. 

I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like one of the books, reasonably, I thought. Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like me negatively reviewing  Silva. Well, the last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.

OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time. 

I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I can say that I don't like the book, can't I? I will not be buying any more of his books.
