Ben Franklin is my hero, I have 12 biographies on him, this was the worst. I first started collecting Franklin biographies forty years ago, Van Doren, Fay, Issacson, Brands, Wood and a half a dozen others. At first glance, and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different... a new take that concentrated on France. Well it was new, and very different - it put me to sleep in my chair several times. I eventually gave up and shelved it with the others. What a shame. Boring.
