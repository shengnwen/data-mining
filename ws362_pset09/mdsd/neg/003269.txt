I recently purchased this book, trusting the recommendations on this site, and after reviewing the book I am sorely disappointed. The book doesn't give a tremendous amount of information in individual essential oils, it dedicates nearly three times the amount of pages to Dr. Young's exclusive blends, and how to use them. Additionally a lot of content is dedicated to telling you why every other oil is inferior to the Dr. Young oils, which came across as nothing more than a marketing ploy to sell his oils. I've used other oils, such as John Steele oils - which are EXCELLENT quality - and have had no negative effects from it.

Another thing I found quite alarming is his recommendation to use essential oils neat, including ones known to be irritating or caustic to the skin. The "Raindrop technique" is extensively discussed which any respectable aromatherapist knows is incredibly hazardous and likely to cause burning or injury to the skin.

There is some generally good information given about individual oils, like the range of which chemicals should be in each oil, however, nowhere does he explain what each of these components do, and no where does he talk about how these various components act on the brain chemistry. He also doesn't explain how various oils can counteract each other in the brain chemistry through inhalation, something critical if EO's are to be used in mood alteration, altering brain function or the like.

If you plan on using the Young Living oils, then this book would be of great help, but if you don't, I think the book is mostly advertising for his oil line and won't be of much use to you
