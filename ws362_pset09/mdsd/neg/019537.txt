Overall, I would have to say that I didn't like Words by Heart all that much. But, that's only my opinion. Some people that are total opposites of me may like the book. Everyone is their own person.     Personally, if you are just like me, then you will be bored to death just as I was. The life in this book is not like anything that would happen in everyday life.     I don't think you should read this book because it will bore you until you can't be bored anymore. This is not one of Ouida's better books. I can tell by reading this book. I would suggest you don't read this book and find a different and more interesting book
