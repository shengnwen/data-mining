This is by far the most stupidest book ever written. I think most reviewers have already said what there is to say. This book is about HATRED and nothing more. I also read the author's review on the "Journey Of Man" here in Amazon, where he said 99.5% of all the arts and music came from Europe. As a historian I can only laugh at this statement! - Asian countries like India & China were the cultural centres of the world. India is the bithplace of language and music. It is from India where Europe learned that it is a good idea to have a bath more than once a year!! This man surely knows nothing about history and this book proves he knows nothing about science either!

All human beings were black once. Our color differences come from adapting to various climates. And if this man hates black people, he is not a human being!!!!
