College Professors Listen Up! This is not the book to use for teaching Computer Forensics and Investigation. I am a student in a graduate course for Computer Forensics. The fact that this book uses strictly commercial software for all the exercises is sad. Especially since there are many Open Source tools available that can be used to conduct Computer Forensics. The software included with this book requires that the buyer obtain a license from the vendor, before the software can be used. Then the license is only good for 120 days. This is not fair to the buyer especially for students, who usually have no intent of keeping the book past the end of the semester. It would be better to use a book for the class that the students would find worth keeping for the long term. Also, a book that uses Open Source tools for the examples/exercises, would provide much more value to the students. A much better book to use would be 'Incident Response and Computer Forensics, 2nd Ed' by Chri Prosise, Kevin Mandia and Matt Pepe. If this book does not suite you, then I am sure that you can find another book to use. 

This book is better than the previous edition, but there are still problems with the information. As another student posted about a case project. The evidence proved the employee innocent. This is just the beginning of other problems that you will find with the book.
