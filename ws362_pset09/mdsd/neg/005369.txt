The science chapters get longer and duller and will cure most insomnias. The Diskworld story chapters get shorter and thinner and don't add up to even an Ok short Watch story. I appreciate what this series of books is trying to do, but please Mr. Pratchett, let it go. I've been a Diskworld fan for years and I'm sad to say that I've watched the humor dry out from book to book. Thud! was boring, mostly unfunny, and barely insightful in a politically-correct-why-can't-we-all-just-get-along way, but this one is worse. Even hard-core Pratchett junkies should take a pass on it.
