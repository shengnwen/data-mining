I just finished it and my first thought was "What an awful, awful book." I was really excited about reading this one too because the back jacket held such great promise. (i.e. "haunting world of avarice, skullduggery, and exceptional evil." Oh really?? I guess I missed that.) Seems more like an ordinary, even dull, murder story. The main narrator even has to mention that there is exceptional evil afoot. Should he really have to point that out? 

As others have mentioned the plot is very convoluted with numerous side stories and people that after the fact seem to contribute nothing to the main story. How many times do I have to read a narrative on King Alfred? At one point yet another person wants to tell Alfred's story and the narrator says he doesn't need to hear it again. My only thought was "Oh thank god!" (I'm still not clear on what this story had to do with the mystery.) 

I still don't understand how some of the characters were connected to the murder and what their motivations were. Also, the mystery was wrapped up too nicely w/the Indian boys narration at the end. He basically spelled out exactly what happened. But shouldn't that have been done throughout the book instead of dumping it at the end? (It's like the author got bored and didn't feel like writing anymore. But I don't think we can fault him for that after all the filler he wove into the story that contributed absolutely nothing to the mystery.) 

I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I don't think it is particularly brilliant like all of the quotes in the book make it out to be, nor is it well written.
