"Welcome to the BSC, Abby" is a fairly good book, but not one you'd want to read over and over again. Abby's the newest sitter in the series, and it will be difficult for her to have a fan base, especially since she replaced Dawn. I don't think it was exactly smart of Ann M. Martin to introduce a new character so late in the series. However, I think Abby is the most realistic characters of the series, and it is her first book, so if you're a fan, it might be a good idea to check it out
