Wonderful characters are introduced but a novel needs a plot and CANDLES BURNING remained plotless at page 257 when I gave up--and this was a 376 page novel.

McDowell died before completing the manuscript and one characteristic I liked about his books was his characters. But he always had a plot that would kick in once everyone was "on stage."

Not so with this book. I give up
