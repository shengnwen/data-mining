 Ironic that a novel by a writer who despised penny pinching and greed would have his novel published in such a way that to make a few more bucks the publisher makes the book literally painful to read.

 The text is simply too crammed on the page, following lines of text is awkward and the lack of spacing simply makes the book painful to read.

 Theres other editions of the book that are cheaper and properly spaced. What a disappointment this edition is. Shame on Signet for this ridculousness
