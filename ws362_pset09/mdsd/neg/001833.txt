And I'm not. There are many murderers listed in this book, in apparently no kind of order, so if you're looking for a specific one, take your time. Most of these are the gory killers, whose sadism and senseless torture of their victims (humans and animals alike) would make me ill if I read it, so I skipped those parts, which left me with not much to read.  

I will have to take the word of previous reviewers who noted errors in the stories, since I'm not very familiar with the serial/torture killer type. I did notice that Mr. Everitt mentioned that Charles Whitman wrote a note requesting an autopsy before he went on his shooting spree in the tower at the University of Texas, but the author fails to mention that one was done afterward, and a large tumor was found in his brain. Just so you know.
