The First Four years was released many years after These Happy Golden Years brought a sweet, tidy ending to the series. I did not like this book and it just does not feel like it belongs with the other books. It is about hardship and bitter times and disturbs the harmony of the other titles. I'd recommend serious thought be given before this book is begun
