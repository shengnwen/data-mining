Growing up in the Delta I find a lot to dislike about this exercise in academic revisionism of Southern history. The author is clearly ignorant of those times that shaped the history of the Delta, the floods of 1927 and '37 followed by the migrations of black people to the North followed by the mechanical cotton picker, followed by the emmigration of light industry to the &quot;new&quot; south. This superficial book is typical of the ideological rectitude among apologists that permeate parochial history departments. A person wishing to understand the psyche of the Delta should read instead, &quot;Lanterns on the Levee&quot;,or &quot;Rising Tide&quot;, both available from Amazon.com
