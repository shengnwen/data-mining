This novel was required for an English Writing class, and I must say that the novel serves no practical purpose what-so-ever.  
By the novels end I was left wondering to what intention the author had in mind, but more-so to what reason did readers have to keep reading?  Life is short and time is valuable, and so I only choose to read novels in which something can be gained. Okay, life is not always fair, yet the show must go on...got it.  But this novel's all-too-obvious moral comes at a painfully high price; one must leave their common sense on page nineteen, only to find the storyline to be too dark, too dramatic, and a tad too driven by blind faith.  
The absurd storyline is only surpassed by the countless missed opportunities to offer readers something real, something tangible, something useful.  Basically anybody can write a piece of nonsensical overkill, but who has the want or the time to read it?
