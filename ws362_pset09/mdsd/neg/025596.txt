I was optimistic given everyone's positive comments and since I am, myself, in the process of designing a project management center of excellence, I took a risk and bought it. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find it at my local bookstore to flip through it first and now I know why, nobody would buy it if they could see it first. The material is appropriate only at the most basic level of project management capabilities. If you've been at it for only a year or two, you might find it helpful, but if you are truly implementing one (as the title claims), you better already know all this stuff and a whole lot more. I wasted my money, don't waste yours. This is my first review and I don't usually write them but this purchase disappointed me
