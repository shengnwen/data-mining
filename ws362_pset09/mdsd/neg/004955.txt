First, Somewhere on Amazon.com I read that the pictures in this book are FULL COLOR.  They are NOT.  I did not find this book helpful at all as far as showing the pictures to my son while he sits on the toilet.  He has no  interest in looking at these cartoon people.  I've never seen a kid have  less of an interest in anything in my life
