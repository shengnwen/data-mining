This type of writing really shames the whole fantasy genre.  It's an embarrassment to Douglas Niles, who is capable of much better writing; it's an embarrassment to TSR/Wizards of the Coast, who really detract from the quality of Krynn by allowing such drivel to be published; and it's an embarrassment to Mr. Fireforge, who deserves a better novel.  I love Flint just as much as the next fan, which is why I bought this book.  I would love to return it and ask the authors to put it back on the market when they have something of value to share with the fans
