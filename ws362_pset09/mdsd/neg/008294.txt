This book has about 50 good pages when they're talking about exploration and ecology of pretty much any entirely underground environment, underdark or just really dark.  Some of the monsters -- undead swarm? kuo-toa leviathan? -- are also pretty nifty, though most aren't that great.  The usual spattering of new magic, races, feats, and prestige classes are marginal and probably not worth the bother of inlcuding in your game, espeically if you're not building a new excluisively underdark campaign.  The regional info is where this book really disappointed me -- they did cross-marketing with the War of the Spider Queen series, inserting spoilers for book #3 right in the middle of a rulebook.  (I'd already read it, was disappointed with it, and even more disappointed when most of the plot advances were summarized with two paragraphs.)  This cross-marketing during Lolth's silence made the "Arachnomancer" prestige class stand out as spectatularly dumb -- either the regional information is wrong or that PrC is really pretty de-valued from the get-go; either way you're shelling out money for both the PrC and the regional info.  But the information on the ecology of the underdark is why I got my copy of this book.  I just can't recommend that anybody pay full price
