Frank Oski draws attention to the very real health dangers of commercial dairy products. Unfortunately, he does consumers a grave disservice by encouraging the consumption of soymilk, an alternative that is even riskier. Soymilk was rarely drunk in Asia prior to the 20th century and like other modern, nonfermented soy products has been linked to digestive distress, thyroid damage, cognitive decline, ADD/ADHD, immune system breakdown, infertility, reproductive disorders and even heart disease and cancer. Sadly, many people have seen their health seriously deteriorate because of soy milk. Children are at such risk that in July 2005 the Israeli Health Ministry issued a health advisory warning parents that they should not feed their children soyfoods or soymilk more than once per day or a maximum of three times per week.  For people who would like to explore all sides of the milk controversy, I highly recommend Ron Schmid's "The Untold Story of Milk"
