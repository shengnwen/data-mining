Whether or not the book was particulary funny, I couldn't tell you.  I didn't get past the first chapter.  Every other sentence was a simile.  "I was raving mad like a castrated bull during mating season."  "I was confused like a Weight Watchers meeting being held in a Dunkin' Donuts."  "It was like..., I was like..., They were like..."  Not that mine are hilarious, but I'm not writing a book using similes as the foundation.  The writing was frustrating.  It's a good thing I only borrowed it from the library
