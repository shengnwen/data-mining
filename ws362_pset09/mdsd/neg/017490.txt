I admit I don't know who Chris Maddon is but I liked the idea of this book so I bought it. I've gone back and forth through it but have never determined yet what exactly is new about these rooms. It looks like a simple collection of living rooms without rhyme or reason.  I expect a lot more from a book than that and a lot more obvious effort on the part of the author in making me understand the point of the book and what ideas are in it for me
