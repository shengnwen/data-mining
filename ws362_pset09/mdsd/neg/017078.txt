As much as America needs a real understanding of the Indochina conflict, this work falls drastically short.  The sources sighted are the typical biased rationalizations void of depth and understanding.  Anyone with an elementary wish to finding truth in mid to late twentieth century Indochina has merely to check whether actual primary participants were used in the construction of this work.  Clearly, they were not.  As an examination of American political decision making it may have certain merit.  It is however impossible to gain a full understanding of the decisions without knowledge of the depth of the situations.  This book does not do that.  Clips taken out of context from the FRUS (Foreign Relations of the United States) compilations are not a substitute for scholarly research.  This work is long on pages, but short on understanding
