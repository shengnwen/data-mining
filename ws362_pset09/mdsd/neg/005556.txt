Some people writing reviews of this book have criticised Mary Buffett for cashing in on her former relationship to Warren Buffett. I don't have a problem with that. Everyone who has written a book about Buffett has done it to make money. What I found interesting about this book was that Mary Buffett has not included a single example of her using the information in this book to buy a company's shares in the stock market and make money. Mary Buffett doesn't provide the name of one company she made money on - or her reasoning behind buying it. We all know Warren Buffett can make money in the stock market. Mary Buffett doesn't show us that by using the information in her book she has ever made a dime. 

The book is written for a reading level of about junior high school. The book might be helpful to someone that age just getting interested in investing. If a parent has a child that age getting interested in the stock market, this might be an OK present. There is some good information in chapter 16 on the characteristics of excellent businesses and in chapter 18 on where to find information on companies that have shares listed on stock exchanges. A key point made in the book is there are two separate parts to successfully investing in the stock market: 1) identifying excellent businesses 2) only buying shares of these companies when you know the prices are cheap.   

Warren Buffett's company is Berkshire Hathaway. The best place to learn about Warren Buffett is the Berkshire website. It's free. The quality of the man's writing on business and the stock market (almost) matches his skill as an investor. If you are really interested in learning about investing you will appreciate and enjoy reading Warren Buffett's letters to shareholders posted for free on the Berkshire website far more than this book.
