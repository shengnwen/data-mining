The Good Neighbor explores the relationship between new neighbors: a gay couple (hypermasculine Will and sensitive Rory) and a married coulple (Meg, a tough, career obsessed lawyer and Austin who takes care of their two sons between jobs). Rory and Austin are at home most days in their beautiful gated community in Southern Florida. Nature takes it's course & repressed Austin falls for Rory.

As with Quinn's last novel,"Back Where It Started," the main characters are totally defined by their sexual positions in the bedroom. Will's nickname is bruit; Rory is sexy and refined; Meg is too bust working to entertain thoughts about sex; Austin falls for Rory, plays the sexual dominate role & gets his old job back.

The most depressing news came at the end: Jay Quinn is "at work on his next novel." I gave this novel two stars (rather than one) only because I was able to read it all the way through. You can guess the end within 75 pages or less
