This book does not contain the gifts of the Catholic faith, but instead is a new age spiritual treatise of total, unqualified tolerance. What comes to mind is the old phrase &quot;if it feels good, do it&quot;.This is exactly  what is wrong with society. Too much of doing one's &quot;own thing&quot;.  Nothing about obedience and belief in what will strenghten us through mid  life is contained in the book. Do not read this book if you are looking for  the answer to your mid life crisis.One thing about reaching fifty is that  you can cut through the mustard and see a hidden agenda under a guise of  honesty.This book will not lead one to their home, but farther away into  confusion
