This was a very simple read, almost too simple.  I was looking for a more in-depth read and this wasn't it.  The info I read in this book may be helpful to those who are learning this stuff for the first time but for those of you looking to expand on information you already have, I would pass on this book.  It is very sophomoric in writing and in illustration too
