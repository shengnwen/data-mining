For an intro to Aerosmith, this is a good book, although the author tells the story with magazine interviews and redundancy. Most people probably already know this info, and he tells it with little creativity. I liked the  pictures, though. If you're a hardcore fan and want to get down to the real  nitty-gritty, read Walk This Way - it is AWESOME!
