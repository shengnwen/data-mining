An understanding of the late Ottoman period, the First World War, and the War's aftermath is essential to understanding the modern Middle East. This is a good, accessable step in that direction. It should be mentioned that there were also revolts in the same general time frame against a similar British occupation in Iraq. And the informed reader will also see parallels with the present conflict in Iraq.
