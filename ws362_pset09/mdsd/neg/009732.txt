I was given this book for free by the owner of a bookstore when I told him that that I was starting a bookstore.    
I learned maybe, oh, 5 or 6 things that were slightly important. 
I especially learned how radically the bookmarket has changed in such a short period of time, and how mired in the past this book is (even with it's new chapter on the Internet).  
In any business, there will always be a middle man- but the face of the middleman in the book business is so changed that it is tough to write a book that stays current.  
For the young bucks starting in the industry, do subject and content searches of discussion boards hosted by the big bookselling pages: amazon.com (most useful), and abe.com.  Getting a part time job doing grunt work (shelving, cleaning) at a local used bookstore will provide you with more practical education in a day than this book will.
