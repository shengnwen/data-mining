Being an avid penguin collector, I have many, many penguin books, but this is definitely my least favorite.  The story is about a grown-up penguin telling a group of little penguins what will happen if they do things they shouldn't.  In the meantime, one of the little penguins is doing all these things.  Even though the story the Nanny penguin tells is supposed to be exciting, I found it a little on the boring side.  I do like the pictures; they are bright and pleasant to look at.  However, the rest of the story is, in my opinion, somewhat lacking.  True, it does have a well-developed plot line, but it just did not seem very thrilling at all.  Younger children might like it, say maybe through kindergarten, but the rest would probably not
