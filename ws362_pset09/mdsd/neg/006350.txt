This is a rather peculiar and disappointing book that reads as if it was written in a hurry. There are points where the text breaks down into short, disjointed and purely descriptive sentences that - given that this is supposedly an academic book - really makes one wonder what point the author is trying to make. Whilst the basic information is all good, there were a few inaccuracies, such as  in the chapter on Danny Elfman - the score of is Batman is NOT at the University of Texas in Austin, and the source she cites for the information is simply misquoted. Overall, in terms of Burton and his films, this doesn't offer anything obviously new, and parts of the book read like a precise of other authors rather than her own arguments. Her single unique selling point is looking at Burton's film making in the context of Alfred Jarry's pataphysics and the idea of surrealism (Jarry was one of the late 19th/ early 20th century figures who inspired surrealism). Nothing wrong with this - "surreal" is a commonly used adjective when discussing Burton's work - but overall the book comes across as rushed and flimsy. There's a good book in here struggling to get out, but it needed a good hard edit before being published
