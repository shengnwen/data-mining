After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.  

I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.   

Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:

"Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."

It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow.
When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.

I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them
