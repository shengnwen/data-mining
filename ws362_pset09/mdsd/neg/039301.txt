I really tried to give this book three stars, but just couldn't do it.  This is the second book in the Sister Fidelma series, and I have to say that I still don't really empathize with the good Sister.  She is way too pedantic, and bossy, and although I'm not sure about a woman's place in her world in Celtic Ireland, I can't think that they would have acted the way this woman acts.  This series is like Kinsey Mulhone without the frequent stops to McDonald's.  Tremayne tries to make Fidelma a hard-bitten private eye, but it doesn't seem to work because of the historical setting.  When I finished the book I felt unsatisfied.  Actually the mystery isn't too bad in this book, but the form of writing and the history are woefully inadequate.  I said that I'd read one more of the series after I read the first book, and then decide.  I think the jury is still out, so I think I'll try one more before I decide to scrap the rest.  If you're looking for a good medieval mystery with a wonderful story, and you've finished all of Ellis Peters' books, try Susanna Gregory.  There are seven books in the Matthew Bartholomew series, although Amazon only lists about two or three.  It's a wonderful series with a great sense of period
