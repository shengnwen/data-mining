This book offer the same general advices that most baby sleep book offer, like keeping baby on a schedule, establish a bed routine, be consistent. The method suggested for teaching baby to sleep on her own is certainly more gentle than the ferber one, in that at least the baby is not left alone in her room -but it still is a crying it out method -at least for my baby. My 9 motnhs old has problems with night fears and this book didn't offer any advice on how to deal with it. So in conclusion I'm still nursing my baby to sleep and bringing her to bed when she wakes up in fear at night, but now I don't try to put her back into her crib so she sleeps longer
