I have just finished reading Ender's Shadow, the first of the Bean quartet novels and I enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed the original book. There's something about the way Card presents characters that captures you into reading the book non-stop. So you can imagine my disappointment when I started reading Xenocide.

Judging from the other reviews, I realized that Xenocide is a kind of a book that you either love as you loved Ender's Game (and everyone loves that one) or hate it because of the way it progresses, portrays characters and overall plot involved.

Frankly, I think I'm in the later category. I was so tired of reading this book that I couldn't force myself to finish it. 
Not only the characters were completely unbelieavable, but I thought trying to mix cultures and jump from one to another every chapter was quite pointless. I admit, it was daring on Card's part to try to attempt it, but he just couldn't handle it, I think. The same way as he couldn't handle brining too much fiction into sci-fi realm.
Some of the plot twists were completely outrageous even for sci-fi standards. And mixing so many philosophical topics in under-300 pages book is simply wrong. You can't expect to try to find a solution to life, death, soul, humanity and everythign else he tried to mention using nothing but a bunch of unbeliavable 'wanna-be' genius characters. And to add to all this disappointment is the sheer normality of Ender Wiggin. It's as if he's in this book just to remind us that it's part of the series. He really was not needed in this novel at all. 

In conclusion, I thought the book lacked progression, pace, presentation and believable characters. Overall, it was a pretty poor novel, but I guess every writer gets one of those once in a while (some more so than others).

It's worth reading, but don't feel like you're betraying the series if you suddenly have an urge to throw the book away. it just happens to be poorly written.
