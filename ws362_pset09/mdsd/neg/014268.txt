This book for some reason includes re-creations of proto-types. How do you recreate a prototype? Sounds like a dumb idea to me. ...I don't know, but I liked the book mostly because of the interesting photos of GI Joes, and the information that it added to what I already know. The parts of the book (like the value guide) which I thought were garbage I just skipped over. There are lots of entertaining photos in the book, and interesting information too. Is it some kind of Collector's Bible for GI Joe? No, I don't think so
