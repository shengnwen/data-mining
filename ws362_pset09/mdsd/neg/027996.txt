The color illustrations in this book are quite attractive and show that there was a lot of time, effort and skill expended in their creation.  However, the text was written on a far more elementary level than I expected .  It would be more helpful for the beginner than for an accomplished photographer seeking new methods and/or techniques to sharpen their
interpretative skills
