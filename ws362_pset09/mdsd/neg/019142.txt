"Inclined to teach or moralize excessively"
This book wasn't about characters. Good writing consists of good characters doing interesting things. This book holds the issue of abortion at its center, along with the issue of cloning. The writing was cliche, characters undeveloped and the plot was weak and predictable. Agree with the other reader, Harlequin romance novel minus the juicy sex scenes disguised as thought provoking literature. Not my cup of tea..
