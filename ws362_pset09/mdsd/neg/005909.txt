I went to the school in the Milwaukee that Sacred Hearts Holy Angels is based on. It is also the school that the author attended and while many of the things are true about the white dinner, partying, and though there were some of those sex driven gals there, there were many things that just didn't fit. Yes, this is fiction, but even being fiction, it was poorly written and mocks fine literature. I agree with another reviewer of this book... if she had only paid attention to Mr. Grandy's lectures!!
