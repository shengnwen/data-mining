All though the fairy tales certainly have the teeth marks of Christianity, I should point out that Grimm's fairy tales are undeniably of Heathen, NOT Christian origin. The author and the below reviewer below failed to recognise the fact tht Grimm was a scholar that deeply studied Teutonic Mythology, in fact he wrote a 4 volumn set dedicated to the study of anceint Germanic Heathenism. I HIGHLY doubt that Grimm felt that the fairy tales were of Christain origin. In fact, when little red riding hood was devoured by the wolf and then released by the hunter this is a direct reflection of the anceint germanic legend of Wotan being released from the belly of the Fenris wolf through his son Vidar the Silent. This is purely pagan expression of rebirth. Jack and the Beanstalk is blatently Heathen, and very few, if any Christain expression can be seriously extracted from this tale. Here is a boy named Jack that travels to Elfland via a &quot;bean stalk&quot;(one of the nine worlds of the World Tree), in which he makes a deal with one of the elves and then takes a journey to Giantland(another one of the nine worlds of the World Tree). In this story, Jack slays a giant and brings food back to his familily. While this could be construed as a good &quot;Christian&quot; deed, I should point out that providing for ones familily was of extreme importants to those whom practiced Heathen religion in anceint times. I do, however, feel that Grimms fairy tales are an inner expression of those whom have germanic roots and I feel that anyone whom has pride in their Northern heritedge, whether  Christian or Asatru(Germanic Heathen), should Grimms fairy tales(which is NOT racist if one respects other cultures and ways of thinking)
