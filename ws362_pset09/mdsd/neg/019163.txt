Bujold is one of the most insightful authors writing today.  I am usually thrilled by her grasp of human nature and the beauty of her writing.  If you want to see her in her true form, buy a book from the Vorkosigan series or the Palladin of Souls group of books.  The Sharing Knife is just not up there.  It was billed as a romantic fantasy book, but it's really just a romance novel.  The fantasy part of it is based around only one idea, not a full, rich world.  The romance story itself is a little frustrating since the female lead was not appealing to me.  Instead of a wonderfully human, flawed but admirable character, she is just flawed.  With all this said, I would not have been so frustrated with this book if I had not read Bujold's other books.  It may well be a star among other books in the romantic fantasy world, but it's not a star for Bujold
