The best part of this book was the cover. A wonderful picture of a sunset in the mountains. Had the cover made it clear that the &quot;author&quot; did nothing more than take excerpts from other books I never would have  bought the book. The excerpts were taken so that you never really knew who  you were reading about. His choices left me feeling used and I am sure he  ruined several good books for me. None of the stories related in  &quot;Wild&quot; has convinced me to read the whole book. What a shame
