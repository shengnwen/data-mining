I agree with all the low-starred reviews.  I agree with the following failures:

--ignores taxes (brushed aside in a footnote)

--ignores (is guilty of) data mining (clearly there are tons of 'strategies' that will give market-beating returns--but only in hindsight.  Prichter's Elliot Wave theory also probably will beat the market some of the time). 

--ignores why foreign stocks should not be bought (author self contradicts himself)

--ignores what will happen if everybody buys dividend stocks, as per Siegel's rehashed "Dogs of the Dow" theory (check out the soaring price of DVY--seems like people are jumping on the bandwagon); how does one measure if a stock or mutual fund is 'overvalued'?  Better to subscribe to Morningstar.com IMO

--is a bit too glib about the depreciation of the dollar given the developed world's aging population, and is too PollyAnna/Micawber-ish about how easy it will for India to buy America's assets with no problems to US citizens.

All in all, a good book to read, but keep these caveats in mind.
