I bought this book because I went to a conference in which Burroughs gave a pretty decent speech.  I read two of his books (Magical Thinking and Sellevision) and the humor must have gone over my head.  I don't really care what grown ups do in their spare time, as long as it doesn't frighten the horses, but this one seems cliche-ridden and the jokes fall flat.  I know the literary marketplace has niches, but Sellevision's only redeeming virtue was that it was a quick read.  He missed some of his best opportunities at humor, and the "poetic justice" fizzled out when the exploititative director of programming John Smythe winds up happily divorced with his jailbait girlfriend at a cheap motel.  Max, the gay protagonist goes from flop (no pun) to failure to porn star (I wondered how long it would take for him to get there, since the plot development almost telegraphed it). Thin on plot, two-dimensional characters with cardboard brains.  How long did it take the author to dusctate this one? Mybe John Watters could do something with it, but he would have to bring it to life with a decent writer.
