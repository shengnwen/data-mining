As a fan of Indian fiction I was really excited to read this novel.  I had read a glowing review on it and put my name on the local library list for it. Boy was I disappointed! The writing was overly simple and dull.  Ramchand, the main character, elicited no sympathy from me.  I never felt like the author adequately explained the inner turmoil that was so central to his character. Overall I found the book depressing
