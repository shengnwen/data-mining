How you could follow up Flyy Girl with this ish, I will never know. I didn't finish the book. Only thing I did was skip around to see what happened with Victor and Tracey. I dont know what happened with you!! Were you in that much of a rush to put the sequel out that you didn't care if it was good or not? I guess you knew it was gonna sell anyways because you knew that everybody was waiting on this.. Omar you should be ashamed of yourself.. I WOULD NOT recommend anyone to buy this book. Borrow it, check it out from the library, or ask somebody what happens... Believe me if you spend your money on this you are gone be mad as hell
