I bought this book thinking it would be a great coffee-table book for my theatrical home.  I even thought I could use it for trivia games with my theatre students.  But it only focuses on 10 movies - one for each chapter.  And the trivia questions are for people who are obsessed with that particular film.  I was hoping for a book full of fun, random questions about a wide array of movie musicals, but this book is not that.  However, if you've watched Wizard of Oz 50 times, this would be the perfect book for you
