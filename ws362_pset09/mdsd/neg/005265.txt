Meanspirited book by a man who acts like he knows the "real" Martha Stewart.  If he did, his book would be authorized.  I am always amazed by writers who are quick to tear apart a successful person but who could never do anything anywhere what that successful person has done.

Martha Stewart came from modest background and by nothing more than her own brain, guts and hard work, built a huge company that employs thousands of people, provides wonderful products.  

If she was a man, no one would call her a B****.  

You want someone sweet who will bake cookies for you and coddle you, go visit your grandma.  You want someone who is sharp and expects the best, go work for Omnimedia and let Martha be your CEO.

The author of this book is a weasel
