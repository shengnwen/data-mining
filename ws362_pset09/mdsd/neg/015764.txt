Save your money, but more than that, save your time.  Joshi seems to be channeling Dorothy Parker in his vicious "critiques" of modern horror writers.  He doesn't just keep his vitriol for the writers either--there's plenty of contempt for the "uneducated" readers.  Joshi is apparently the embodiment of "those who can't" gripe about those who do.  Check this guy's credits.  He hasn't done anything beyond editing and deconstructing.  This book is mean-spirited, off-base and laughably pompous.  This guy needs to remove the stick
