This book has been compaired to "The DiVinci Code" by Dan Brown. Yes, they are similar - neither author is a good writer! Oy, where do I begin? There are SO many mistakes I couldn't belive it. For one thing, Loomis is in LOVE with the word, "which" - which got very tedious. I am still amazed at the disappearing dog. At one point the hero (totally cardboard and unbelievable) is attacked in his appartment. The dog growls to let our hero know the bad guy is going to break in. A vicious fight starts and...not a peep from the dog! Where was he? Hiding in the closet? I have three dogs and believe me if someone so much as put his hand on me, he had teethmarks. I gave up on this mess about a third of the way through
