This is one of the worst books on bookbinding it has been my misfortune to purchase. It lacks detailed information on techniques  and substitutes what is generally a "go out and buy" attitude. It encourages the purchase of materials such as premade scrapbooking items rather than giving ideas for an individual to make and incorporate in the creative act. 

Altering books is one of the crafts that affords the integration of everyday materials in a way that is fun and INEXPENSIVE.  This book should have a shopping list in the back and get it over with.

Showing examples of other artist's work is fine but if that is all there is the author could just put together a book of "other people's ideas".

There are numerous other books on altered books and journals and I would encourage anyone interested in engaging in this craft look to those instead.
