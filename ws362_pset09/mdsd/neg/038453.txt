I have used other products in the past from this company and never needed to use their customer support or tech support, but this time the CD-rom did not work and I had too.  Well, they are the worst.  No help for us in this regard except for them telling us that we can buy a different product from them that might work with XP.  It is another $159 and it is not geared to this age group.  If your computer uses XP DO NOT BUY FROM HOOKED ON PHONICS.  Their explanation was that the workbooks will still work without the CD.  Are you kidding me!  The games are the fun part of this package and things that the kids are interested in, if they don't work what's the point
