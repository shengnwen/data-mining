I thought the advice given was nothing new, cliche-ish and thus very uninspiring. The book often refers the reader to other books for what I believe it lacked--depth and focus. Also I disagree with the writers idea of how to handle anger. They mention how, in early editions of this book, they had encouraged readers to physically express anger safely but now recommend verbal expression instead. The importance of safe physical expression of anger is clearly and effectively explained in John Lee's &quot;Facing the Fire&quot;--a must-read for anyone having issues over anger especially suppressed anger left over from the past
