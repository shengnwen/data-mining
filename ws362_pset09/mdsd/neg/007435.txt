First, I'd like to say that I am a big fan of both Andre Norton and Mercedes Lackey.  That said, this isn't one of their better works. I picked this up for reading over vacation as I had seen the book in print for a number of years and thought I would give it a try.  My problem with the book, is that the characters aren't very engaging.  I've only read this first of 3 (4?) books, and I doubt I will continue simply because I found that I do not care about the well being of the heroes or the destruction of the villans.  This is definitely a "light reading" novel
