It's wonderful, in a way, when a person writes a book whose predictions turn out to be completely wrong.  (Less wonderful when people keep buying his nonsense!)

A review of this book can be very brief -- just two points need be made:

1. There wasn't a great depression in the 1990s (to the posters who say there was a "recession" in the early 90s, I say: the unemployment rate in the US during the real Great Depression was 25% at its peak.  It never cracked 6.5% in the 1990s.  A mild recession does not a depression make, nor does it justify the title or apocalyptic tone of this book.)

2. Had the US adopted Batra's recommended policies -- dramatic increases in trade restrictions, etc. -- there WOULD have been a depression.  One of the central causes of the real Great Depression was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which increased tariffs dramatically.  Batra proposed similar measures in this book.  In other words, in order to prevent a depression that never came, Batra argued that we ought to adopt measures that caused an actual depression in the past
