The book has a very simple and clear way to describe what 3D design is about. It takes a simple project and teaches how to design it from scratch using basic design elements and explains how to develop it to a 3D animation film touching on cinematography and aesthetics(though very subtle and superficial). 

It is a great source for beginners and people who are not familiar with design and 3D terminology and elements. However even somewhat little experienced designers involved in 3D or graphic design would see that they already know most of the stuff told in the book. It is like "3D & Design for Dummies"
