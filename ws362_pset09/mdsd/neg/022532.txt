My opinion can be expressed by a single word: "Frustrating"
As a Scientist who does not work within the field of Genetics, most of the terms I have hoped to find in the dictionary, surprisingly, are not defined!! As a single example, "two-hybrid analysis" is not included, in spite of being one of the most frequently used techniques within genetic analysis.

Probably, the Dictionary is addressed to readers outside from science.
