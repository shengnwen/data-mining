If recipes like Fillet of Beef in Tomato, Caper, and Anchovy Sauce; Wild Mushroom Polenta with Thyme and Aged Goat Cheese; Pan-Sauteed Swordfish with Anchovies, Garlic and Tomato Fondue and Cappellini with Pan-Seared Calamari, Tomatoes, and Lemon sound like spur of the moment then this is the book for you.  Very little in this book looked as though I could just go to the kitchen and whip something up.  I will be donating this book to charity
