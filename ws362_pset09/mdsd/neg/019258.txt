I am a long-time fan of Anne Rice and was really looking forward to this book; but I was extremely disappointed in it. I found the book to be tedious, repetitive, and boring. Ms Rice's famed attention to historical detail (which I have always enjoyed) is there, but so much so that I wanted to scream, "Let's get on with it!" 

There is no plot to speak of. Jesus spends most of his time wondering about the circumstances of his birth, which Mary and Joseph refuse to discuss. Half way through the book, I found myself wondering, "Is that it?" The book  picks up a little toward the end, but not much. 

The characters are so one-dimensional that they could be wearing cardboard signs around their necks that read, for example, Mary--childlike; Joseph--strong, silent type, and so on. I keep asking why was Ms Rice so afraid to use her wonderfully proven imagination? The novel may be about Jesus, but it is still a work of fiction. Some critics have said that she was afraid of offending people, so she bored them instead. 

I think the Washington Post critic Melvin Jules Bukiet said it best when he wrote, "Anne Rice sucked the life out of the greatest story ever told.
