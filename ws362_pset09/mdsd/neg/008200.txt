I bought this book soon after we adopted our daughter.  I found the writing style to be convoluted and precocious, much like the way children speak in contemporary movies (adult words from a child's mouth).  Sorry, not a fan.  We are still looking for a book that addresses an open, domestic adoption that can speak to children, not adults
