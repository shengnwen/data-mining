Well, being a great admirer of Spence's courtroom techniques and dramatics (I am a third year law student), I must say that I was profoundly disappointed with this latest book. Spence's radical ideas undermine what America is all about--freedom, opportunity, limited government, and free markets. Ironically, if Spence's ideas were implemented, there would be no liberty in America. The book is laced with brilliantly disguised notions of communism, socialism, statism, fascism, egalatarianism, determinism, and a hodgepodge of other ideas opposed to the American way. Spence would be a great candidate to run on the Nader ticket in 2004. Just for funsies, let's cut to the chase and address his criticism of the &quot;corporation.&quot; Ask yourself, what IS a corporation? A corporation is merely a business association that is subject to the laws of the relevant state. Nothing more, nothing less. It's just a business...a business that creates jobs, puts food on the tables of millions, and creates wealth for the economy at large. The vast majority of Americans employed by corporations wouldn't have it any other way. The corporation is American as apple pie, and it creates wealth, and for the millions whose livelihood depends upon the corporation, it creates freedom (dare I say, liberty?) in addition to prosperity. In short, Spence's radical ideas, while creative, do not comport with reality. He should stick with his specialty: courtroom dramatics and six figure jury verdicts
