Before, i purchased this book, i saw the rating is 4.5 stars, i thought the book would be a good one. However, after purchasing the book and read through it, i regret of purchasing this book.  And the reason I regret of purchasing this book, because it's not as interest as i thought it would be.  Doctor Phil writes too much of nonesense before he even tell you the step to correct the problems.  But even when he shows the step to correct the problem, it's nothing interesting to learn neither. I almost given up reading this book many time.  The book really is boring.  I don't find it exciting as i would expected it.  
In addition, I like to purchase Dr. Phil book, because i liked his show.  I thought the book should be as good as i watched the show. But it turned out opposite.  I would not buy another book from Dr. Phil.  I grade this book a C or lower, average or below average.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It's not worth the money.
