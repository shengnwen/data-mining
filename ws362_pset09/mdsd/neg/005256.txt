I usually would briefly summarize the plot in my reviews, but there really isn't one to write about.  It feels like a "days of our lives" soap opera of Betsy's life...she and eric are in love, she and eric have a fight, then she and eric make up, re-wash and rinse.  I wouldn't mind this as much except Betsy is getting more annoying with each book.  I keep waiting for her to grow up and be more queenly.  Her though process is like a 13 year old, and I just want to shake her and tell her to grow up.  I feel like the author is making Betsy more immature so that she can put Betsy in sillier situations (that anyone with a brain can figure out in 2 minutes) to get a cheap laugh from the readers.  This is one book in the series that you can skip without loosing anything.

To be honest, I truly think Betsy's demon sister is a better character to read about.  Maybe the author could do that after Betsy's story fizzles out...like the next book.
