I like to appreciate one's art and give everyone the benefit of the doubt.  Although Wearstler has the creative team to package her, her talent leaves me feeling short changed.  

If you have seen one Wearstler design, you have seen them all.  Her style is the same regurgitated interpretation of the last.  However, I will say that her "Beverly Hills Estate" is probably the best work I have seen of hers.  

This book is a little over the top.  I am a fan of Beverly Hills, I am from Beverly Hills, but you will not find a Beverly Hills woman or any other woman for that matter doing domestic chores in couture gowns.   

I think it is interesting that most of her projects, even the ones featured in Modern Glamour, are her own residences or hotels.  I believe she lived in the Hillcrest/Trousdale Estate, Hollywood Compound and she even acknowledges the Hancock Park/Sycamore Street apartment.  

Thank goodness for Brad...he is the one who purchases the hotels.  

Even BG, the Bergdorf Goodman restaurant in NY, leaves me feeling uninspired.

Kudos to the ones behind the scenes - hotelier husband, decorator/designer mother, stylist, publicist and writer.

Kelly's contributions to that of a tastemaker are not up to par with her predecessors.

But you do have to give her credit for believing in herself
