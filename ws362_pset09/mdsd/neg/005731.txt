WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! Info in this book is so elementary that I'm not sure whether I'm more embarrassed or angry to have paid money for it and the publisher &amp; author should be ashamed to accept money for it. If someone has a dog &amp; doesn't know to rub him, play ball with her, talk silly to him, then this book is needed. But, those who care about their dog are already doing what's suggested in this book. Those who don't care won't be interested in any dog books. So, the book must have been written for the very VERY young. There should have been a warning on the cover
