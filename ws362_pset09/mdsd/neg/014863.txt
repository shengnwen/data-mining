'A Voyage to Weirdness' is a more apt title for Lindsay's classic. There is a lot I didn't like about this book though the ending did redeem it somewhat. However, it took over 200-something pages to get there and I'm still not sure if it was worth my time.

For one thing, it seemed as though Lindsay made his world as weird as possible, not for any special meaning, but simply for the sake of weirdness. That's fine in itself, but it worked to make everything pretty meaningless on the whole. Consequently, it was slow plodding along through paragraphs of description that seemed to go pretty much nowehere and have no relevance to the main story. Parts of the world sounded downright juvenile and made me wonder if I was reading a book adaptation of a sci-fi B-movie.

Another problem I found was that, even though I can bring Lindsay's world to mind down to the minute details, I found myself cold towards the characters themselves. Maskull himself had no redeeming qualities to actually make me feel for his plight and by the end of the novel I found I had forgotten all about him. This may have been intended, but it the whole novel left no impact on me.  

Despite all this, however, the ending was unexpected and did make me slightly glad I read through it to the end. Lindsay's was clearly intending a message with this novel, but I don't believe he completely succeeded at it. When taking as a whole, this novel could have been exceptionally better and much more remarkable if Lindsay could have stuck more to the meaning of his  story instead of bogging it down with endlessly weird descriptions that went absolutely nowhere.
