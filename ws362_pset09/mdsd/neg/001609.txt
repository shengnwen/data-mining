This is not one of my favorites. It was a ok read with not alot of action and the ending I wish could have had a little more excitment.The interaction between Jack and Daisy seemed alittle forced with her telling him he's not her type and there was no chemistry between them, something was missing there for me. The way Howard described Jack - graying hair, thick neck, body builder, is that supposed to be attractive? I felt Howard wrote more about the puppys antics than she cared to write about the romance or action. The book was worth reading if you have nothing else to read or important to do. It just could have been so much better. Not up to Howards usual books
