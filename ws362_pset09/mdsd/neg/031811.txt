I had to buy this book for my Organic Class and I hate it! If I am going to pay textbook prices for a book, I expect it to be professionally written, not shifting into first and second person and speaking in sentence fragments. I was supposed to keep it for 2nd semester, but I hated it so much I sold it back after first semester was over. What a waste of money.
