This book has been around for so long I finally decided to pick it up after such great reviews and recommendations from others.  I found this book to be of NO help whatsoever. The stories in the book in my opinion have nothing to do with anything and the repetitive speaking is what actually made me not even want to continue reading. The entire book is just saying the same thing over and over and over again but in a different way, actually sometimes the same exact way. Page 1 of a book should not say the same thing as page 200.  I just was really tired of all the same things being said I had to stop reading.
