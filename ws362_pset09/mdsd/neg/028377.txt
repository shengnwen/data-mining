Ok ..I read all the reviews, good and bad and bought the book anyway. After reading his book I don't know if this guy actually had Hashimoto's syndrome. Anyway, he does give some food for thought in the direction of diet,etc. and what to add and to avoid. Since he doesn't give much in the way of sources to prove or support his claims of why his life style changes will work, I'm a bit skeptical of his claims. Still.. like many of us who would like to get off synthroid, I thought, ok .. I'll give it a shot. 

I have to agree with the other reviewers who criticized him for not giving dosage amounts for the suppliments etc., and for the 'diary pages'. The number of pages listed for the actual writing IS misleading. Don't waste your money buying this, browse it in the book store first. If you think it's of value to you after actually seeing it, then get it
