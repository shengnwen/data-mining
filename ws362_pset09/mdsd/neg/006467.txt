I am a textile designer and already own the book Textile Designs. I bought the Floral CD thinking that it would supplement my reference library. I was wrong. The scans have dirt and dust in them and look as though they were scanned on a home flatbed scanner. In my opinion, the scans are below average quality and I would send the product back if I could.
