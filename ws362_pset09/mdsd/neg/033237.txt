This book makes me absolutely sick. I remember reading it in Jr. High as I was struggling with anorexia and bulimia and remember getting so many ideas from it. It basically tells you how to become the best damn anorexic/bulimic you can be. It's overly verbose with awful anologies- and not truthful- the woman was sick when she wrote it. I would never recommend this book to anyone- eating disorder or no
