I bought this book based on its description, thinking it would be a great little story about accepting people's differences.  However, after a couple of times through, I gave up trying to put a favorable spin on it for my little girl.  While it is a fairly entertaining little story, it is marred for us by the message that David's father is acceptable because he is so big and frightening that he scares people into giving the children what they want. David's father is cool because he's a bully?  It seems to me we already have too many &quot;might makes right&quot; stories
