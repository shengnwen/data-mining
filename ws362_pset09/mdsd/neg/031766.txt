I cannot understand why he bothered to write this book, or who he expects to read it. Does he actually think people take him seriously?

Not only does Jack Thompson make assumptions he claims to be fact all the time, but he refuses to confront the people who challenge him to debates. 

He claims gamers have no souls because they occasionally spend time playing sometimes violent scenarios in simulated worlds. He does not for one moment take into account that these are real people who do other things as well. Some of the most avid videogamers I know are straight A students.
