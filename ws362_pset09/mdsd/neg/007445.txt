How typical that instead of debating the greatest issues facing our world today on merits, logic, and arguments; Horowitz "a angry ex-Democratic radical" now joins with the neocons in upping the scare antics to get another book on the best sellers list.

The book from the onset portrays Ms. Clinton and Mr. Soros as socialists, a term more respected than the neoconservative warmongerers who scared the American people into the invasion of Iraq.

It then goes into length about history of the Democratic Party and how it has nothing, nada good to offer. A fact which is interesting considering the author's own lovefest with the Party when he was a 60's hippie. 

If Horowitz seems content in bashing his own roots so be it because that in a nutshell is what this book is about, exposing what Mr. Horowitz's considers his own shameful past.

Highly recommended for the easily brainwashed amongst us
