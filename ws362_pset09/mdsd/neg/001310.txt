I picked up, Sheldon Cashdan's The Witch Must Die: The Hidden Meaning of Fairy Tales because I had an idea for a fairy tale inspired short story and wanted to do a little bit of research. I gleaned a few insights from the pages of the book, but mostly found it did not live up to all my expectations.
The book is classified as pscyhology and Cashdan makes the case for fairy tales offering psychologists and patients insights into psychological problems. This was something I had a hard time swallowing, but then maybe this has something to do with my lack of conviction in pscyhology.
There are a lot of fairy tales out there, and there's no way Cashdan could possibly be expected to offer a full analyzation of each one, but he does base his conclusions on a very small sampling of fairy tales, to the point that some of what was said seemed a bit repetitive.
There was also far too much time discussing the movie versions, particularly the Disney versions of many of the stories. While a comparison of Disney movies to their original tales would make an excellent subject for a book, in The Witch Must Die it only serves to confuse the issue.
So, I will continue with my fairy tale research. I have a volume containing the complete Brothers Grimm fairy tales which I intend to get to one of these days and a couple of weeks ago picked up a copy of Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales by Bruno Bettelheim, which Cashdan had referenced a few times, at a used book sale
