No doubt D.S. Freeman was a great writer.  No doubt that Freeman was even a good historian.  However, every Civil War historian worth his salt knows that while Freeman's biography of Lee may be the place to start to read about the General, it is not the place to finish.  While there probably isn't still a definitive biography of Lee, one should be wary of just reading Freeman's work.  While Freeman did spend almost his entire life researching Lee, his idol worship of Lee gets in the way of serious scholarship.  Surely Lee is not quite the imperfect person that later biographers set out to prove, nor was he the perfect person that Freeman wrote about.  He was a person, with great things about him, faults, and all the rest.  While Lee does not deserve to be run through the mud just to tarnish his image, one should probably read Freeman's bio, T.L. Connelly's The Marble Man, and Emory Thomas' bio of Lee to get a fuller picture.  Freeman's work is exhaustively researched and is very well written, but reads more like idolatry than biography
