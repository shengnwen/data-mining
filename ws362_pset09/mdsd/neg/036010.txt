That's what this book should have been titled. Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If "Sex and the City" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.

Feminism is not about having to use "scary" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are. It's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone...ever
