One of the many problems with this book is the order in which the topics are presented.  Right off the bat, They decide to put linear equations ahead of all other types of DE's.  Are they really as simple to solve as seperable equations?  The entire second chapter is a complete mess and is very disorganized.  The forumla for the integrating factor of linear equations is difficult to ascertain, and it is never clearly stated (it's there, but their notation is convoluted).  I don't want to sound like someone who is just having difficulty with the math taking it out on the innocent textbook.  

I have consulted other textbooks on the topic, and I have to say that I really like Zill's DE's for the logical way in which it is organized, and   
Kohler and Johnson's text for its clear explanations.  My professor actually commented on how bad this book is.  All DE textbooks are NOT created equally, and if you are struggling through this one, try finding older editions of those other two from your University's library.
