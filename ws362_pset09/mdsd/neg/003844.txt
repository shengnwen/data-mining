   Poorly done character work provides no insight into this weakly timed and tasteless rendition of a low caliber shot in the dark at a horror "novel".  No scene work, outside of the "Beast house", implies that this author is grinding out a novel with the intent to write a second or third in a series of books about cheap sex, gore, beasitality and pediphilia intent on making the reader retch.  This book would banned from some web sites, and the nanny guards would block it from most computers.      

Three hundred and nine pages could have been shrunk to about one hundred considering the large print, oversized margins and full blank pages between chapters.  Publishers at Leisure Fiction should have reconsidered printing this one.

Save your money and buy a book that is properly labeled as adult porn. At least you will know what you are getting
