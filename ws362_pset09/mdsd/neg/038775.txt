I was not impressed with this book AT ALL.  Having done some reading on the subject already, I felt it had nothing new to offer that was not already given in free articles or short chapters in general parenting books.  I typically enjoy Elizabeth Pantley's books and articles and found this one a disappointment.  I didn't expect a "magic bullet" approach, as that's not her style, but at least a few fresh ideas or new perspectives would have been nice
