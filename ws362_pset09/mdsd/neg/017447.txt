I have been a fan of Connie Willis for quite some time and I highly recommend her earlier time travel novels, 'The Doomsday Book', and 'To Say Nothing Of The Dog' and her very humorous short novel about fads and trends entitled 'Bellweather'.  Her more recent book, 'Passage' concerns near-death experiences.  It has the same humorous tone as the earlier novels but I found the novel disturbing and felt unsettled after reading it.

I suggest that  'Bellweather' be read prior to reading 'Passage'.  Otherwise, the reader might be so put off as to avoid the author's other fine novels and short stories
