After two weeks on this diet plan I could bearly lift my head up.  I nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights...not to mention hardly staying awake while at work.  I thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of Atkins, but I was never tired on Atkins.  I don't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs...or what the problem was.  All I know is I am happily following Atkins and losing much more rapidly than I did on this CAD plan.  In two weeks I lost 6 lbs. on CAD...14 on Atkins.  You figure it out
