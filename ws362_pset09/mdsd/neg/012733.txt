I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you
