I have heard that Alice Walker is an incredible writer, which may be true (it is forgivable, since this was her first novel), but I found The Third Life of Grange Copeland to be extremely disappointing. First of all, I expected more quality in it -- this read like a soap opera story. This is why I shy away from best-sellers, but I thought Walker might be different. I can see her strengths in writing, but I do not even feel as if a vivid portrait of anything was painted. The characters, the home, the reasons behind many of the abrupt actions were all left unanswered. After putting up with that plot throughout the book, I expected a decent ending (I stuck it out). However, the ending was the worst part, as it came suddenly and then the novel was over. I still plan on reading other books by Alice Walker, but I would not recommend this one to anyone demanding a good plot
