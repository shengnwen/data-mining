If you are interested in information about real estate training programs or how to get a job in real estate this is the book for you.  75 pages of at 225 page book are dedicated to listing of different real estate  programs, most of which are located at community colleges. The rest of the  book is dedicated to finding your first job in real estate.  I did not find  this book very helpful.  I found &quot;Your Successful Real Estate  Career&quot; by Kenneth Edwards to be much more useful
