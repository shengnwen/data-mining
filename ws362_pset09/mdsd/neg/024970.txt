I have a hard time mustering more than three stars for this novel.  With respect to his discussion of the science of sleeping - I found his reporting of current and historical research interesting but his own theories somewhat half-baked.  The autobiographical portion of the book simply wasn't  engaging.  Not funny (like Devaid Sedaris) or terribly interesting either.  Overall I think the book was fair at best
