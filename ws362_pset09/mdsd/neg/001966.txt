This book may be good for some, however it is misleading in the description. I was led to beleive that this book was in fact comic book coversations to help explain simple situations to my child with Autism. Instead, you have to write your own comic strips to do the explaining. Not worth the book in my opinion if it is still up to me to do all the work, I already do that without this book
