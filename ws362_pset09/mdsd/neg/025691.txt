I totally agree with the authors' arguments. We do indeed have a class system in the United States, and it really does matter. But my god this is a horrible book. The authors go on and on and on and on and on and on about the same things. This is another one of those books that should have been shortened into a 10 page magazine article. It was so bad that I had to stop reading it half way through.

A much better book is Paul Fussell's somewhat dated "Class: A Guide Through the American Status System"
