This book is useless and guaranteed to provide absolutely no valuable information for anyone. The author, having inherited a truck load of easily marketable merchandise, and has the temerity to then offer marketing advice to Ebay newbies. One might as well read a book about how to make a fortune from a banking heir. A greater waste of time and money in a single volume can hardly be imagined.  If you need advice on how to make money on Ebay do yourself a favor try this book -- The eBay Myth-Bu$ter: Turn 199 Misconceptions Into Money!
