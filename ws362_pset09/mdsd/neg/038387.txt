I made 3 recipes from this book and then gave up.  All of them were mediocre to poor.  I cook all the time but I usually sub vegan ingredients for butter, eggs, etc. and everything comes out amazing.  This cookbook is also unclear about the instructions.  I recommend the Joy of Cooking - always the best recipes and everything can pretty much be made vegan.  They even have the most delicious recipe for vegan cakes.

This cookbook seems like it was thrown together to make some money.  The cupcakes tasted like healthy bran muffins with tofu on top.  Don't waste your money
