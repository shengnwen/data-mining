Someone recommended this book as the epitome of Augustine's philosophical work. It tries to replicate the style of Plato's dialogues, but its shallow logic, infantile writing, and general  poor scholarship as well as just plain lousy thought and development makes me feel like I got gypped buying it.If I could, I  would ask for a refund. Ugggg
