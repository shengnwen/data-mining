This review is on just the physical quality of the books, not the inside content/story itself: 

To answer a question posed by another Reviewer, yes, it is true...  I just received my books one through twelve shipment yesterday and the quality of the books is poor.  They looked very handsome on the pictures available at various websites but up close and physically in my hand, I found that the end of book pages do not line up (tattered/not smooth) and the cover of the books are flimsy with peel-on like plastic sticker displaying the title of the book.  I got this set as a collector's item for keepsake but not worth it.
