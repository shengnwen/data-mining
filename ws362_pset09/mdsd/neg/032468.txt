I read this book partially because I had to for a class, partially a suggestion from my dad because he'd read Gleick's other books.  I read about halfway through it and, I must say, for a book about how the world is getting too fast, this book jumped around pretty quickly.  It'd be talking about watches for about 6 pages (which was the longest chapter I got to), then the next chapter would come, it'd be less than half that length and about TV and newscasters.  Seriously, it seemed like it had ADD!  I grew up in this faster-paced world and I know that it's faster than what used to be.  I hear stories, I know that television didn't exist a hundred years ago, and I certainly don't need 281 telling me that my generation has it bad because everything's sped up, especially when the chapters could most definately be cut in half because all you need to read is about the first half of any chapter to get what you'd like out of it.  Not to keep rambling, but we all know the world's faster, so why don't we just slow down what we can and don't waste our time reading this book?
