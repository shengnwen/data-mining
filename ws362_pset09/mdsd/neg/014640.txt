Jeff Bigger's book is well written; however it offers little to our understanding of the unique ethnic contributions of the German and Scotch-Irish settlers who dominated the cultural landscape of Appalachia.  This is seen in his treatment of twentieth century women.  Loretta Lynn (a native of Eastern Kentucky) is briefly discussed on only one page while four pages were written about Billie Holiday (born in eastern Pennsylvania and raised in Baltimore) and Janis Joplin.  Dolly Parton (an East Tennessee, native) earned only one page of text and Rosa Parks (born in Tuskegee Alabama) received five pages.  Janis Joplin was born and raised in Port Arthur, Texas.  It seems Biggers is confused about the geographic boundaries of Appalachia.  He, like many non-Appalachian natives who regard themselves as enlightened scholars of culture, want to see Appalachia as anything but white and nearly homogeneous with regard to ethnicity.  Rediscovering the South's Celtic Heritage does a much better job of showing the region's culture as it developed over time
