After utilizing this book as the required textbook for the graduate level 'Models of Teaching' course at the University of Memphis, I can honestly say that, throughout my pursuit of a Master's Degree in Education, this has to be one of the worst texts I have ever had to suffer.  I found it to be poorly written, badly formatted, and terribly confusing in its organization.  Even my instructor -- who holds a doctorate in education and is a highly-regarded professional consultant in the field of adult education -- is still unsure exactly how many so-called 'models' were introduced by this unforgiveably overpriced excuse for a text!  Thank heaven my classmates and I could rely on good lectures and excellent group learning activities. Leave this one on the shelf!! Better yet, tell Joyce, Weil and Calhoun to head back to English class and then re-focus their efforts on creating a teaching tool that will serve to help the student rather than frustrate him
