I read this book in about half an hour and was not impressed.  It is all just everyday common sense, no "unleashing of power" here.  The "Keys" described in this book are normal things that most people do who are good at what they do and take pride in their work and their life.  If you don't already do these things naturally I seriously doubt this book would change your behavior.  No "life-changing ideas" here. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for this book. Save your money.
