I was quite disappointed with this book. I hoped for more to look at and less to read in a garden design book. It is more of a text book than a book for inspiration. If you are ready to sit down and read the basics on garden design, then this is for you. If you are hoping for inspiration from looking at photos of beautiful gardens, then look elsewhere. There are only 8 photos - before and after photos of the author's own garden
