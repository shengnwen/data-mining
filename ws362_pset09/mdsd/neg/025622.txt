I bought this book after seeing a review in USA Today (perhaps, I should have actually read the review--my bad). One of the best comic novels I ever read was by Furst many years ago, hence I thought this book might be entertaining.  In actuality, it is plodding and dull, with a protagonist who is neither engaging nor particularly interesting. There may be a story involved but it's not particularly apparent in the first half or so.  Most books of this length I'd have digested in a sitting or two; this one has taken what seems like forever and I'm not sure I'll ever finish it, unless something starts to happen pretty soon.  Very disappointing
