I have to say that I am a fan of Stephen King. After all I have read just about everything he has published over the years. Often his prose is easy to slip into. But here... here... King's plot is a mess. I think that this might have been created right at the end of his cocain period and his mind was like a TV that wont settle on any particular channel. At times the introspection of the characters is mesmerising, and you can find yourself caught up in 70 page jaunts dealing with arcane issues like poetry festivals or walks in the woods. 

About half way through this massive book I started to feel that their was not really going to be a cohesive plot to this story. That this was going to be ramblings that were not pasted together. The characters were not very likeable, and it was hard to sympathise with them as they spiral downwards over the course of the book. King starts in on a wholey new story here and then proceeds to tie together three 'novelas'. Slowly the spaceship that is uncovered in the opening pages starts to take a grip over the entire small neighboring New England town. 

I'm a pretty hard critic of King's even though I have spent so much time with his books. In my opinion, nine times out of ten he manages to miss the mark in some crucial aspect. Prior to reading Tommyknockers, the one book, or series, that was most trying for me to get through was the Gunslinger saga. I think that Tommyknockers was both better and far worse than this series. If I were you, and had yet to read much of Kings work, I would steer away from this one and try a classic like Salem's Lot or a few of his short stories 'Skelleton Crew'. King is probably best at the short story and if you have yet to read many of them, you are in for a treat
