This book is too technical and has too much math. A better book for the elementary learner is &quot;Practical Statistics: Simply Explained,&quot; by Russell Langley.  Bulmer's book may be useful to me later on after I understand basic statistics. But don't waste your money if you know little about statistics and you don't like complex mathematical explanations
