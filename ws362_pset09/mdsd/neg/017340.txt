i love clive barker, but he should stick to writing books and not just pick through his old books and put bits and pieces of them all in a book just to make a dime.  if you want to read some of barkers works read the  actual books!  i am sorry to inform the other four dimwits who reviewed it  but this book is not good at all.  i had to force myself to read it it was  so dull.  and if you are wondering why i bought it, i didn't i recieved it  as a gift and that is the only excuse i can think of for owning this book
