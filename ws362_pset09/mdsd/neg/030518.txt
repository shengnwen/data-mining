I find Indian culture pretty fascinating. Indian cuisine, too, is outstanding. So, when my book club selected another Indian novel (this one with yummy recipes included), I was optimistic. However, of the three books involving India that my club has read, this is definitely my least favorite. The author is really not a very talented writer, in my opinion. Though she obviously knows a lot about her culture -- that is authentic and genuine -- she knows little about the art of subtlety, character development, and moving of the plot. The "shocking" surprise in this novel is pretty obvious from the get-go. The relationships between the characters, besides being unbelievable, are simply beaten into the reader again and again. "So-and-so is upset for reasons a, b, and c." Malladi doesn't give her readers credit for being particularly bright. We don't need to have these things explained to us. We're not idiots! (Though, I do feel a little dumber having finished this book!) My advice, look for authors like Chitra Divakaruni and Jhumpa Lahiri to get your fix of Indian-inspired literature. This book offers little more than a trip to you favorite Indian restaurant and an episode of Jenny Jones might give you. You can do better..
