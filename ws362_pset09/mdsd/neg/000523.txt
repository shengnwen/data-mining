I didn't buy this book but ran through it in the store, it's very short so easy to go through in less than an hour.  It amounts to nothing but a cheap "self-help" book designed as a book about entrepreneurship.  The entire book is basically - "go out there and do it".  There's absolutely no substance and I think the reviewers who rated this highly have to be the author himself or people affiliated with him because there is no way any literate could think this book had anything of value.  You should also take a look at the source himself, his self appointed claim to to fame is 'starting' dozens of companies.  Do you know what it takes to start a company? Nothing more than a few bucks in registration and incorporation fees.  You can take a look at his so-called companies on his website and you'll see they're nothing but worthless web based businesses for the most part, the only one that isn't is his "Ford dealership consulting contract" which is some vague consulting gig for a little regional Ford dealership and not to mention his family has owned Ford dealerships for decades.

One tip he neglected to mention in his list of vague general statements was to be a success don't waste money on useless books like this
