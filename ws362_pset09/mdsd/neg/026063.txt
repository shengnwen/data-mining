This is my first Barbara Vine (R.R.) novel. Very simply, it concerns a man gathering information about a Victorian ancestor, a doctor deeply interested in hemophilia. The story can be rougly split into three plot lines: the biographer's relationship with his wife, the biographer's duties as a member of the House of Lords, and the biographer's investigation into his relatives' lives.

All three plot lines contain an obscene amount of repetition about already-mentioned facts. Having edited in the past, I could have thrown out at least half of the book without a loss of plot focus. There was no "building to an exciting climax!" or "weaving of an intricate story!" as  has been indicated in other reviews. I had figured out the obvious "mystery" less than halfway through the book, and spent the next 200 pages wishing with all my heart that the narrator-biographer would get to the point already. I've read books easily two to three times as long, and much more detailed, and I haven't been nearly as bored to distraction as I was with this one.

The story lines concerning the wife and House of Lords simply made me want to shake the narrator-biographer - the man "comiserates" - whines - so much that you wonder why anyone puts up with him. 

I've spent 30+ years reading books from all genres except fantasy, and I've rarely been so impatient with a plot. All in all, I don't think I'll be reading anymore Barbara Vine novels.
