I really did not find this book enjoyable, in fact I gave up half-way through.  It was more confusing than funny and I could not feel any sympathy for the characters.  It was just a bunch of caricatures  idiotically fumbling their way through a meaningless life... The humor was  so far-fetched, and sometimes just too obvious, that the book never even  extracted a chuckle out of me.  I could see how some people might enjoy it,  it did have a lot of extravagance, arrogance and simple lunacy in it... but  it did not work for me
