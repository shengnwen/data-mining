Like his "History of Witchcraft and Demonology" Summers got it wrong.  He consistenly attempts to tie witchcraft and devil worship to eachother.  Most of this text is completely assinine, bearing such resentment and fear of the occult as to make the biased opinions seem obvious.  Summers, as a catholic priest, wrote many books on the occult, from the view point of the church.  His books on witchcraft are offensive to any practicing witch, and are dangerous in the hands of those who are still looking for a reason to hate witchcraft.  In fact, his books are responsible for much of the hatred and misinformtion about witchcraft.

If you're looking for works on either witchcraft or black magic, there are much better resources available
