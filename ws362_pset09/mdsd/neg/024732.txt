I bought this book as I always loved climbing trees in England as a child.  This book hit a cord straight in the heart ! if you love trees and feel a deep connection to them this book will hurt like hell !  The poor trees  have to take nails and drilled holes all over to support our homes.  Unlike  the birds we yet again end up destroying.  Um I guess this isn't paradise  for the trees any way you look at it.  But lets not become the chains that  literally bind them.  This book inspires one to feel for the trees freedom  not my own
