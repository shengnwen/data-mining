The book is well written, but is neither the most thorough treatment of the topic, nor the most authentic treatment.  Readers wanting to know what the Jewish traditions are, and why, and how to do them, will want Lamm's book on this subject.  Readers who enjoy presentation and validation of creative but non-traditional practices adapted or invented by less observant Jewish mourners will enjoy this book.
