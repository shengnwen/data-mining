Having recently discovered the "running" sub-genre of fiction thanks to one my running partners lending me books, I must say that this is not one I'd put near the top of the must read list.

Although the premise of the book, which others have described accurately, is interesting, the idea falls flat do to the incredibly poor writing tying it all together.  I have literally never, in all my years of reading, read dialogue so unnatural.  The things that come out of Bullet's mouth are especially ridiculous considering we are supposed to believe, at the beginning of the book, that he is a loud mouthed teenager.  

The author's inclusions of several modern/pop culture references (googling, mp3s, Starbuck's, etc) come off especially poorly as well.  While I realize this book was published recently, and this is the reality we now live in, the way they were thrown in was almost a calling out to the reader "look how hip I am...I'm down with 2005".

The impression I took from the book, was one that the author probably felt this would make an excellent movie.  In all honesty, considering many scripts read flatly, and it's up to the actors to add life to the dialogue, I think that might be a fair assumption.

Overall, I'm surprised that the other Amazon reviewers have rated this book so highly.  On fiction standards alone, it's pretty bad.  As a runner, it sparked a little interest in me, but if you're looking for a book leaning more on the running aspects of its characters, this is definitely not the one.  The only thrilling thing about it for me was when I'd finally finished
