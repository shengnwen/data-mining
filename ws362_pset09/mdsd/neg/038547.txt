I bought this book over the weekend. I read the first chapter that you can see in the "Look Inside" feature. I was intrigued by the comparison of this book to the theories in Betty Edward's "Drawing on the Right side of the Brain" book. I used Edward's book and it changed the way I draw and create art. I was just like one of her before and after examples. Back to this book. The first chapter, the one you can review for free, was very thought provoking. Most of the photography composition "rules" are adopted from the Graphic Design world. One such rule is the "rule of thirds". These rules help get you away from the beginner composition problems like centering everything in the viewfinder. Once you are more experienced, you create compositions more intuitively. This book helps you get away from these simplistic "rules" and helps you to see and compose pictures naturally. After the first chapter, there were two chapters on basic camera operation, then the bulk of the book was exercises. I didn't find the exercises very useful for me. The book was put together a bit amateurishly. It is all in black and white and is printed on cheap paper. There were no inspirational pictures to prove this theory works. I believe the pictures were more about teaching a point than anything else. The author has a good concept, but fails to put together a very convincing book. I was disappointed and will return the book. I hope the author comes out with a better version of the book and gets some help from a graphic designer
