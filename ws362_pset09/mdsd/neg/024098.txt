The writing style of this book is very good and easy to absorb. It's relaxed instead of tense, and it flows. The characters are interesting and I could relate to them. What threw me, though, was the skipping structure. In one chapter, Rose and her dad Finn, move in. We never learn how they settle in, what they encounter, what they think about it. In the next chapter, a section starts with(something like)"...Colin promised to teach Rose the lute for a week now......" (Completely skipping over the first week of their living in a castle.) Then, all of a sudden, he's teaching her the lute. Another section starts with the heroine (the mother) telling herself that she shouldn't be interested in Finn. Then, all of a sudden, Finn and the mother are in bed together! Then, later in the book, we have some flashbacks to the first time they made love (without actually going there). Then at another point, Finn is asking the Saint about her life, which is then told in a passive way. This goes on and on throughout the book. Major events are told passively. Motives go unmotivated - why do Rose and Colin fall in love? Colin later leaves to join a monestary, joins a band of travelling entertainers instead - but we never get to see how or why he decides to leave home. We just come across his mother finding the Note he left. Big chunks of the story go unexplained and unexplored, leaving me to wonder why I should care about any of them at all? Then, of course, most of the characters die. Why oh why and what is the point? I don't mind people dying in stories, surely it can impact the plot. But EVERYBODY dies! Remember that midnight movie, the sci fi one that is a cartoon with Journey's Song "Open Arms" in it. Anyway, the charcter stands up and carelessly waves his arms and says "She dies, he dies, everybody dies." That's what this book reminded me of.
