We visited about eleven cities in northern and central Italy and we carried both the Lonely Planet Italy and the Rough Guide Italy with us.  I had the Rough Guide Italy and had no problems looking up information.  My companion had the Lonely Planet Italy and she eventually gave up on it.  She found the LP to be lacking in basic information and basically a book better left at home.  We would recommend the Rough Guide instead
