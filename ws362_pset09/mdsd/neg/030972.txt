I was drawn to the story because the horse and the family needed healing on many levels.  I wanted to know more about how the horse and teenager were rehabilitated.  Tom Booker, a.k.a. the Horse Whisperer, was an appealing character because he was a very balanced person.  It was his role to be the healer.  He had his wounds, but used them intuitively to help others.  The author portrayed him as a spiritual sort of guy.  Suddenly, we are led to believe that he has an epiphany:  He needs Annie! Unfortunately, their mutual desire was portrayed on a superficial level.  Tom kept remembering her eyes, her smile, etc.  This was teenage crush material; not at all in keeping with his stature or implied integrety.  Furthermore, without giving the ending of the book away, Tom's final decision was totally unbelievable to me, considering the fact that he'd earned the teenage girl's trust.  Just what she needed, more fodder for Post-Traumatic Stress disorder!  

The book begins in a promising way, especially when Tom comes on the scene.  However, the ending just didn't live up to my expectations.  I skipped the sex scenes and think the main characters would have been a little better off if they had, too!
