Like other pseudo-history books (e.g., "Holy Blood, Holy Grail"), the author takes a barely plausible hypothesis and attempts to con the reader into believing it is fact.  However, when Stanford does dare to delve into areas that can be easily checked by the reader, his con game is exposed.  For example, at one point in the book, he mentions a trip to Bologna to find the church of San Petronio.  He claims he could not find the church after an extensive search.  However, even a first-time visitor to Bologna would be able to find San Petronio as it is the largest church in the city (when it was originally built, the city attempted to make it larger than St. Peter's in Rome) and stands very conspicuously in the main piazza of Bologna!  If such a glaring misstatement can be so easily exposed, how can the knowledgable reader believe anything else Stanford has to say about the viability of Pope Joan?

Perhaps unwittingly, Stanford does provide the reader with what might be the most credible basis for the legend of Pope Joan when he mentions the influence of Marozia on the papacy in the 10th century.   Marozia was an Italian noblewoman and daughter of the powerful Roman consul Theophylact and his wife Theodora.  She was also the mistress of Pope Sergius III (904-911) and bore him a son who, through her influence, became Pope John XI in 931.  Marozia wielded considerable influence on her son the Pope and it is quite possible that the Roman citizenry mockingly referred to him as "Pope Joan" (as in Latin, John = Ioannes and Joan = Ioanna).  Investigating the influence of Marozia and the Theophylact family on the papacy as it was growing in strength would have made for a far more interesting  book.  Unfortunately, The Legend of Pope Joan does not offer us that
