This is a book that begs the question: why bother?  After several books in the 'Complete' series that have been good to excellent, WotC comes up with a dud in Complete Scoundrel.  The first part of the book is the best written and most helpful, especially to folks who might be trying to create a character of this type.  Using examples from literature and pop culture, they manage to convey some good points and characteristics of some scoundrel archetypes.  But if you've played D&D for at least a couple years, wouldn't all of this make intuitive sense anyway?
The rest of the book is loaded down with more prestige classes and feats. Enough already!  Most players never get to make it to qualify for a prestige class, and none of the ones offered here are worth trying for.  The feats are even more worthless.  And I could not even find a piece of equipment in the book that I would want a character to try out.  As for the remainder of the book with 3 organizations offered, they were nothing special to me.  For a player who normally likes to play characters classified as scoundrels, I can do just as well or better by not having read any of this book.
I'll be kind and give it 2 stars for the well-written first section
