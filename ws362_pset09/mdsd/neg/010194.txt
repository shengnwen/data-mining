I love a good, fun, guilty pleasure type read as good as the next woman but this book had no point.  It was just silly.  It is fun to read books with these funny and extravagant characters when something actually happens.  This was more of a childish running commentary.  I got to the end and just wondered why even waste time writing something like this?
