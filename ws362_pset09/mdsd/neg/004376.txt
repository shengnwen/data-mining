The "active liberty" advocated by Justice Breyer is another term for "passive tyranny."  He substitutes his own personal moral judgment as opposed to ruling on the text of the Constitution.  I don't care how Justice Breyer feels about an issue. A judge should not impose a moral viewpoint when the text of a law is silent.  The Constitution can be amended as it has been 27 times before.  But amendments are difficult to pass, as they should be, and those of Justice Breyer's political philosophy do not trust the people to get it right so they create terms like active liberty to confuse the uninformed.  For those who agree with Justice Breyer I would like to play them in poker, with "active rules" which "grow" and "evolve" during the course of the game so that I can win every hand.  You would be a fool to agree to play a game of poker with evolving rules and likewise should reject Justice Breyer's notions of "passive tyranny.
