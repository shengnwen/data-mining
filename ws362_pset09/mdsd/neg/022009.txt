I suppose I'm going to be alone in these reviews in complaining loudly about Ellis's stylistic sloppiness.  I recall a particularly amusing section in the introduction in which he describes Jefferson's message in the Declaration as "a recipe for anarchy," and proceeds to note that a government which "attempted to operate in accordance with these principles would be committing suicide."  Yes, Joseph, a government attempting to implement no government would be doing itself in.  Is this what passes for lofty criticism these days?

I picked up this book in an effort to become more interested in--and more fair to--Thomas Jefferson.  I went in believing him to be a cold, conniving man whose life was a long exercise in "do what I say, not what I do."  This book did nothing to change that impression; if anything changed, it was my opinion of Ellis, of whom I'd had somewhat higher hopes.  His writing is not nearly good enough to cover up his attempted slights of hand in excusing Jefferson's worst characteristics; in my book, "psychological agility" isn't distinguished from hypocrisy--it IS hypocrisy.  

The book's tone reminded me rather startlingly of the modern theory texts I was once forced to read; full of unprovable suppositions and distinctions without differences.
