Chapter two is worth reading, and so is chapter three.  The rest of the book is unintelligble.  Capra's cultural and historical analysis and argument are logically inconsistent with &quot;the new physics.&quot;  Furthermore, Capra offers no treatment of Chinese civilization and culture aside from exploiting pop Chinese mystical terms.  Most of the book is a grand exercise in equivocation.  I'm sorry to run contrary to so many other readers, but my opinion is that this book will not be remembered well--if at all
