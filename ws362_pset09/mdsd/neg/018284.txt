There are quite a few things that I did not like about this book. Luckily I borrowed it from my Spanish teacher in 8th grade and did not have to continue my life knowing that I wasted my money on a bad book.

Some people will tell you that learning vocabulary is the hardest thing in learning a language. This is most certainly false. With proper learning techniques learning vocabulary is not difficult at all; I did, however, feel that this book introduced far too many vocabulary words at one time.

The author attempts to retard the importance of the study of grammar while learning Latin. To be successful in your study of Latin, however, you must have a very _clear_ understanding of the language's grammar. The explanations in this book cause one to develop a very fuzzy understanding that is insufficient for clear thinking, reading, translation, and composition.

I highly recommend that you do not purchase this book and instead purchase Wheelock's Latin. I am going through that book right now, and everything is very clearly explained; the number of vocabulary items introduced in each lesson is perfect in my opinion -- not too much, not too little -- and I do not ever develop that "fuzzy" understanding that came from reading this book
