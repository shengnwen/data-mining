This is the first book I've read by this author, and I thought it was horrible.  The characters are incredibly unrealistic.  Frankie is the most annoying of them all, second is Grace.  I couldn't relate at all, it took for ever to finish because I couldn't stand reading it, and it was just uninteresting.  I'll probably read another book just to see if this book is    not like her usual work.  I'm now reading a Dean Koontz book (one of my favorite authors), and it's so refreshing to read an author who at least has some characters that are relatable in some way
