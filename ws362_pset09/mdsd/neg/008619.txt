If you are looking for "Short and Snappy Answers to Defeat the Cultist on your Doorstep", this is not the book you want.

While each Saying is considered in a brief page or two, the style of this book is to discuss and analyze the text very closely, but so closely that the discussion bogs down into such things as transitive vs intransitive verbs, etc.  Yes, it explains the subtlety of the text but in such detail that the answer can only be appreciated by a Believer. Unfortunately, I find that it does not answer my questions about the Hard Sayings of Jesus very well either.

Nothing in this book equps me to answer the Hard Questions of the Cultist who stands on the street corner passing out tracts or comes to my door offering "The Truth". On such occasions, which often degenerate into a theological streetfight, I need to use the Word as a sword. Therefore, I want a big sword not a magnifying glass.

As a Christian, I appreciate this book as it requires me to ponder the depth and richness of God's Word. But this is not the book to present to a skeptic who needs simpler, more direct, less obtuse answers to his or her questions.
