I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.

As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)

I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.
