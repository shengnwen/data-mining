A friend recommended this book to me as a treat in preparation for my vacation to Charleston with my mother.  So I sent her a copy for us to read together.  It was not a treat.  I was disappointed there were not enough descriptions about Charleston and the Low Country.  I've been to lovely Charleston and Beaufort and this book didn't make it recognizable.  I agree that character development was shallow.  What was that mess in Mexico that made no sense?  And, nothing is more aggravating than reading a 'professionally' written book with TYPOS!  And repetitious descriptions.  The ending was implausible and a rush to have some closure.  PLEASE do not compare this author to the talented Pat Conroy.   So we waded through the 'pluff mud' of Islands, and are giving Siddons another chance with Peachtree Road, but my mother has finished it, calling it 'bizarre'.  Gee - can't wait
