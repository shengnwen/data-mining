A to Z has a big problem in my opinion. It is a very simple children's book with some very cute illustrations of animals (A to Z).  Each animal is engaged in an action that also begins with the first letter of it's name  (e.g. Kangaroos Kissing).  There are lots of made up animals, I'm assuming  to account for the rarity of animals beginning with &quot;Q&quot; and  &quot;X&quot; etc.  The part that I don't like is the fictitious  &quot;Uglybirds&quot; whose action is simply &quot;Being Ugly&quot;.  The  illustration that goes along with this so-called ugliness is very  disturbing.  The &quot;Uglybirds&quot; have atypical bird features that  seem intentional.  They are green and purple, and have messed up feathers  and big bulging eyes and are very &quot;Different&quot; from the  &quot;normal&quot; birds in this and other books.  Upon reading this, my  wife and I agreed that we would never repeat this section while reading to  our daughter.  Although I do intend on teaching my daughter about ugliness  (Racism, Violence, contempt, etc.).  I think that it is a quality that  shouldn't be used to describe physical appearance.  When my daughter  encounters a person who is physically unusual, I hope that I have instilled  in her the values to disregard what others might find &quot;Ugly&quot;.  I  know that some might think that I'm overanalyzing such an innocent entry in  a child's book, I think that parents need to be more careful about the  messages that they are sending about ugliness
