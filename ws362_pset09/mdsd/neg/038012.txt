Esposito sure has a nice way of glossing over the truth.  The heart of the matter is missed and the fundamental force behind the Islamic faith is left in the corner of the closet somewhere.  Since he shared his ideas, and we do have 1st Amendment rights, here are mine - the Islamic faith and the teachings of the Koran are to drive the believer of these misconceptions with a goal of world domination - religiously and if necessary, violently.  How blatant and how clear the Koran is.  How necessary for us to realize that to stop the core of this terrorism is to stop the spread of this &quot;religious system&quot;, or dare I/we say - militant system?  It's also time to put an end to political correctness
