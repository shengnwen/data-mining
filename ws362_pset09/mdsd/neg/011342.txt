This book had a couple of big flaws. One was that much of the material was superficial and obvious. The other was that it was terribly written, and must have had an unskilled editor. After reading a particularly incoherent "case study" that barely supported the book's thesis, and may have mildly undermined it, I just had to stop reading it
