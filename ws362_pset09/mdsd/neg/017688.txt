Trashy, trashy, trashy novel!

He is an abusive hero with two sides to his personality-since he is half English and half Arabic. Frustratingly, his less redeeming qualities is attributed to his Arabic culture and Muslim religion, which is very insulting for anyone who comes from the Middle East, and his admirable qualities-not surprisingly- stem from his English background. The heroine is just as abusive as the hero, yet hailed and praised by the author because she happens to be "English"-extremely stereo-typical and racist for both characterization.

Does Coulter ever take into account that many romance readers have ethinic backgrounds and that she has to be a responsible writer and must depict some form of veracity-good and bad- when she takes on a project that deals with a culture that is not her own? Many innocent readers may be mislead and misinformed about a culture they do not know about and mistake these types of fictions as a true historical background when in actuality, women tended to possess political, economical and social powerful positions within the harem and were not these submissive, useless women Coulter made them out to be. All I ask of an author is to balance the good and the bad so as not to misinform the public-which Coulter failed in this novel. 

I am not normally picky when it comes to historical truths in fictional Romances; in fact, I write many reviews telling oher readers to lighten up when it comes to historical errors the author may have made inadvertantly. However, this is an exceptional case because of the extreme lenghts Coulter went to in insulting and degrading this particular culture without adding any positivty to form some sort of balance in the story-line-very infuriaiting.

My advise is to skip this novel, I could not even finish it and threw it away
