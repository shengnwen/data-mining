As a student starting law school I thought that this book would give me an advantage in my legal research and writing class, boy was  wrong... The book is full of useful information but none that realy pertains to law student. It is however, very basic in its approach and gives you a good start, so it is not a total waste.., The subtitle says that the book is for "non-lawyers", as if somewhere out there is a person who is not a lawyer and finds legal research fun. my recomendation is, that if you want a brief explanation of legal research and how to do it so that you are not totaly lost when you start law school this is a good book, but if you need it for some legal purpose and you are not a law student call a lawyer, trust me it is well worth the fees. Among the books flaws is that it tells you where to go to get the information but neglects to tell you that the resources they list, in the case of Lexis-Nexis and West Law require very expensive memberships and that most Law Schools restrict the use of their Law Library to students in their Law School and do not even allow students from the affiliated university to use the Law Library, as the Law Students in attendence at the law school require all of the resources of the Library and Legal Librarian ad nauseum and outsiders are most unwelcome.
