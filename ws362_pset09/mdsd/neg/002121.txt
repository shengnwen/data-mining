Wow, I hate to go against the tide but I felt very strongly about this book and unfortunately, not positively. I read this book aloud to my 13 year old daughter as part of our homeschool curriculum and both of our general impressions of this book were similarly negative to the point that we were glad to reach the last page and be done with it. We both found the book to be poorly written, the plot to be extremely predictable, the character development to be lacking, the dialog of the characters and the plot line to be unrealistic,the character motivations to be unclear and the historical inaccuracies to be glaring. The plot was clearly contrived from the very beginning to the end. At the final page we were relieved to be through but frustrated that we wasted our time and confused as to all the loose ends left by the author. I certainly would not personally recommend this book.
