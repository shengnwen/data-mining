I found the level of cynicism in this book extremely repulsive.  Weinberg consults for large organizations that apparently don't really want their problems to be solved or don't accept consultants' solutions, and he has therefore built an elaborate structure of "wisdom" around continuing to take their money and performing pointless services nevertheless.  If you find yourself in his situation, you may enjoy this book.  If not, read Alan Weiss's book Million Dollar Consulting instead, which offers advice for building a successful consulting practice around genuinely useful services
