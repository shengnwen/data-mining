This text is an easy read, and you will understand the reactions that are given in the text examples. So why the low rating? Organic chemistry is all about "prediction". And when it comes to teaching you how to predict the outcomes of reactions you've never seen before, it is lacking! You can study this text two hours a day, every day, and unless you have an uncanny ability to understand chemistry (I don't)--you will still not have this most fundamental skill you need to succeed.  Try "Organic Chemistry as a Second Language" and "Organic Chemistry II as a Second Language".  They will have you predicting and understanding Orgo in no time!! This course isn't hard at all- once someone explains it to you properly. David Klein (the author of those two books) does that beautifully
