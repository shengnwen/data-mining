Sorry, that's just not possible.  I've read Neal Stephenson's books and he is a very, very good author.  This book is bad.  The story is extemely disjointed.  It jumps all over the place from character to character with no sense that things are coming together.  And things don't come together.  It's a very disappointing book.  Rather reread Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon, Zodiac or the Baroque Cycle.  Even The Big U is better than Cobweb
