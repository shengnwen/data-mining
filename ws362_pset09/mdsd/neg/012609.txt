I searched amazon.com for "women's fiction" and came across the hugely popular Sophie Kinsella. I'd read a few of her books in her Madeleine Wickham-avatar, and found them delightful. I figured I couldn't possibly go wrong with such rave reviews. Oh, what a disappointment I was in for. Can You Keep a Secret falls into every stereotype women have had to contend with for the last century or more. To me, chick-lit translates into stories about real women -- women who are strong and smart. What's interesting about a caricature of incompetent women who are incomplete without a husband/boyfriend/significant-other, and can think of nothing else? I know we're better than that
