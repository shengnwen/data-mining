The author leads us to believe that prohibition of drugs in any form is a terrible idea and is the reason why so many people are getting rich off of the drug trade.  His theory has many holes and though I understand what he is trying to say, I didn't like  his Marxist-style commentary.  He rambles through the first 5 chapters like a lost tourist and has some very foolish ideas on how to treat the drug epidemic.  Not one of the better books on the subject of drug use and abuse
