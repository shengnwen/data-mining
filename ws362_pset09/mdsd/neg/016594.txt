Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, by Mildred Taylor was a very disappointing book. There is no particular story; the book starts rising action here and there and down again here and there. There is no specific climax. Basically, it's like there's no story. What I also hated about this book was the ending and the fact that there was no moral in the story. The book was full of cliches from every chaper by chaper. Each chapter was too long( this is not a dumb complaint). Instead of just starting a new chapter, Taylor just skips a line to basically start a new chapter. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense to you. 

Like any novels that have to do with early 40-50s racism, in my opinion, there should ALWAYS be a moral,  stating that racism is wrong and people could just get along regardless of their skin color. This book had no moral. The ending was an ending wrapping up what was only a minor part of the story. I see a lot of positive reviews around here so maybe I am the only one who dislikes the book. But regardless of the reviews, I highly DONT recommend this book to any reader.
