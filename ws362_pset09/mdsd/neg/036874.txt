This book is good if you want to take years fixing your dogs problems and avoid every problem until then.  I personally can't avoid every 'unperfect' dog until then.  It goes over desentization (not rocket science) but doesn't give any good answers to what to do when your dog is having issues.  I'm not a fan of the 'just run the other direction' theory.  It's not good if you want to actually address your problem and avoids the topic of when it's puppy-ness or real aggression concerns
