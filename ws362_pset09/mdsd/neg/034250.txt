The whole book just meandered from the get-go, never going anywhere.  One could surmise early who would be killed and who the killer would be, but the murder was certainly an afterthought.

I'm also tired of Qwill's relationship with the boring Polly.  And the great number of times he mentions his mustache.

A great disappointment!
