The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them. It teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well, and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy. I love that this book comes in boardbook form, but I am very dissapointed with the illustrations
