So call &quot;LEAN Manufacturing Implementation&quot; title is very appealing. Very bad decision buying this book. I have several other books on the subject. From Mr. Pyzdek to Womack (warranted satisfacton with this guy's book) and some other japanese authors on the subject. I paid $6.00 for the book &quot;The machine that changed the world&quot; I learned more reading this book. This book is highly priced. Shame on APICS backing up this kinda of got-to-write-a-book authors. I hope the author could read this comentary and give me money back. This book is just the product of somebody not enought professional to accept HE CAN'T WRITE A BOOK ON THE SUBJECT. Very repetitive, boring. Anyways...!!
