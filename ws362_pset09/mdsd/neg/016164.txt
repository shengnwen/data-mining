I bought this book nearly as soon as it came out, and I absolutely loved it.  The cartoons and the layout of the book are superb. I did not really use the CD's, however, because I was in transition between computers.  It was still nice knowing that there were 60,000 more cartoons waiting for me if ever I wanted to read them, and with the stellar quality of the book, I assumed the same for the CD's.  

I was wrong.  The cartoons on the CD's are very low resoluton- this means that the pictures are not clear; they look a little blocky and pixelated.  Also, the large, multi-panel cartoons have been compressed even more so as to fit on to one page.  I was severely disappointed. The captions, however, are very nice.  Too bad it's often difficult to see what they're referring to. I don't really have the complete cartoons of the New Yorker: I've got about half, with the other half illegibly thrown into the mix.  

Why then two stars?  It's simple: The book itself is very nice.  With the price lower now, It is a very reasonable price for the Best Cartoons of the New Yorker, which is what this book is without the CD's.  The book is wonderful, just don't be confused into thinking that you will be able to read every cartoon as the book claims
