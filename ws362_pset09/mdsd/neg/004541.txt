	I Do not recommend this book because of the characters, the lack of a clear objective and the ending, that left me depressed and unsettled. Joel was one of the characters that bothered me. I didn't like the way he handled the situation when his friend died. The way he waited before telling anyone, and they way he acted angry at his parents and the Zabrinskys for no reason at all bothered me a lot. " `Joel', She said, `are you sure you've told us everything you know?' `About what?' he demanded roughly as if he didn't understand what she meant." Another thing I disliked about the book was, there wasn't a clear plot or objective to the story. After Tony's death, the rest of the book was basically about Joel trying to tell someone about it. I found that very boring. The last thing that left a discontented feeling in my mind was the ending. By the middle of the book, I was very sad, and by the end of the book, that feeling never went away. After Tony's death I found that there was no silver lining, or feel of hope at the end. This left me unhappy. The story just sort of cut off, leaving you sad and a little confused. Those were some key reasons I do not recommend the book On My Honor.
