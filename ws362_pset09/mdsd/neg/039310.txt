I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE IM A ZOMBIE FAN.I WISH I SAVED MY MONEY.THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A GUY WHO IS A COP AND HIS WIFE IS CARRYING SOME OTHER GUYS BABY.WHEN THEY ACTUALLY STOP JUMPING IN AND OUT OF BED WITH EACH OTHER THE BATTLES WITH THE ZOMBIES IS QUIT BORING.AND OF ALL PLACES TO BUILD A NEW LIFE THEY TRY TO DO IT IN A PRISON.HOW STUPID.LESS SEX AND MORE ACTION THIS STORY DESPERATELY NEEDS.RENT A GOOD ZOMBIE MOVIE WITH YOUR TEN BUCKS INSTEAD OF BUYING THIS GARBAGE
