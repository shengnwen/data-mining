A very disappointing read-laborious, predictable, no interesting plot or characterization. The supporting characters that make Eve such an interesting person and the books such fascinating reads were missing--for a book set during Christmas, this lack was even more apparent. I am a huge fan of this series, and this book was the first that felt like a huge waste of my money. I will wait for the paperback version of the next In Death offering
