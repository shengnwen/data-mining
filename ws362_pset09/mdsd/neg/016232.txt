This book suffers from poor editing and proofreading. From the first chapter on, there are many mistakes such as an exercise which says the answers are in the appendix, but the appendix skips the exercises for that chapter. Then one exercise had a list of words to be matched to the English translation, but not only repeated one of the Latin entries but listed a different pronounciation. Throughout the book I found many errors of omission or just plain mistakes. The website for the Idiot's Guides has been down for a re-make and so I haven't been able to see if an addendum is posted. I'd skip this book and go to one of the standard texts. With the number of mistakes in this book, it makes me wonder about the rest of the content; am I trying to learn something not realizing it is another mistake? Avoid this book
