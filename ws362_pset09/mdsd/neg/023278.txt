As a beginning to intermediate beader, this book was a disappointment to me.  I guess I should have taken the title more seriously!  The projects lack inspiration and the photographs are of poor quality.  Many of the pictures are repetitive.  I also felt that the book is not organized in a logical fashion and, although it covers wirework, it does not even mention wrapping a donut or a pendant or a basic rosary turn.  If you are looking for a really good basic book on beading or you want to find some fresh new projects, this book is not for you
