I read this book in the Spanish version, to improve my command of Spanish.  That part was worth it.  The book is called Maridos de Hollywood.  In English, I wouldn't waste the time.  What's the point?  There is no point, unless it's Jackie Collins idea of entertainment, apparently shared by those who buy her books.  There are some long, drawn-out tales of parallel lives, but no very deep insights, only surface stuff, maybe what Ms. Collins believes Hollywood is like itself.  In this book, she writes some interspersing chapters, all in italics, about a female pyromaniac, who is abused by various males in her life and some females also.  When she gets pushed too far, she lights a match and it's &quot;hasta la vista, baby,&quot; to her antagonists.  This is the climax of the books: she lights up the big guy's yacht on New Year's Eve, and four deaths (and some supposed heroics) result.  But who is this mystery woman?  Unless I missed it in the Spanish version, we never find out.  So what's the point?  Just to keep you guessing, I guess.  The Spanish translation was interesting, since the translator took pains to literally translate idiomatic expressions.  I'm glad I read it for that reason, but for the content?  Forget it!  Diximus
