Johnny Tremain is the absolute worst book I have ever read in my entire life, hands down. No book has filled me with such a sense of dread as I opened it like Johnny Tremain has. The way this book is written is as follows;
*30 Pages of Filler
*One page of plot
For the entire book. That's really it. This haphazardly thown together clump of ink and pulped wood is like a swirling vortex of bad writing and mediocrity. I would not wish this book on anybody. not even my worst foes. I promise you if Amazon had a way to input stars lower then one, that vote would be mine for this book. Teachers; Don't let this be used in class. Everybody else; Spare yourself the misery and torment you would otherwise bring upon yourself by so much as reading the first paragraph
