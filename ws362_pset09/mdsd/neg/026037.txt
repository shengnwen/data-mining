There is not enough cheese and crackers in this world to go along with the "whine" that Ms. Lamott serves up in Plan B.  I have loved her previous works and based on their merit, I pushed on into this book, beginning each new chapter with hope and ending in dissappointment until I finally had to toss it into the garbage.  It was tedious, from menopausal maladies to blaming George Bush for all the problems in her life.  And God Himself, or "Herself", as Ms. Lamott would say, seems to be a reflection of who SHE is and not the other way around.  Yes, God loves us just the way we are but He also loves us too much to leave us that way...except in her case apparently.  I wanted to like it and I am sorry to say that it fell way below my expectations.  Bummer
