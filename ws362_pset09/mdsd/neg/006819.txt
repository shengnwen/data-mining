Spiegelman's first book "Black Maps," was one I very much enjoyed.  I wish I could say the same for this.  It wasn't bad, but it seemed to plod along, without much happening, never being terribly involving or suspenseful.  For me, part of the problem was that I never really cared about any of the characters except Jane, Marsh's girlfriend, who was the most interesting one of the group and received a bad deal in her relationship with Marsh.  Maybe I'm tired of perpetually angst-driven, commitment-phobic protagonists.  So while it wasn't terrible, it was definitely a disappointment.  Read "Black Maps" and, if you do read this, wait for it in paperback
