Mr Babbin should note at least some of the following facts. The (unelected) Bush regime supports the integrationist EU. The UN General Assembly does represent the world's nations. The US state has consistently promoted the nuclear proliferation of its favoured allies - Israel and Pakistan for example. The author's technique is the McCarthyite smear - those who disagree with him (that is, most of the world's people) belong in an asylum. 
The reason why most of us think that the Bush regime is arrogant is simply that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld show the contempt for the decent opinion of mankind displayed by Mr Babbin.
