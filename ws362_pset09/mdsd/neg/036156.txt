This is a very biased, rambling memoir of one mother who hates young adult literature. I would agree that there is an overabundance of problem novels for teens, but the novels she targets are generally really good books. To me it sounds like just another mother who wants to fight the schools on what books they choose. Glad she takes an interest for her own children's sake, but honestly, give the schools a break and let the kids read whatever they want to read.
