what's that book about?
rebellion? i don't think to be a rebel is necessary to have sex with everyone you meet, both male and female.
is the intent of the author to shock you? he didn't shock me, he just disgusted me. 
i didn't like this book at all, and if you are looking for a book with a meaning, you won't like this one
