While the first edition was the seminal standard, I don't see how the second edition can be considered the same.  First of all just look at the back cover, that's glaring.  The numeraters and denomenaters in the differential expressions are reversed from what they should be.   Such things make me hesitant to trust any of the rest of this text.  If nothing else 40 years is too long for a single edition to be used.  McCabe & Smith is about to come out with their 7th edition in since about the same time as the 1st of this one
