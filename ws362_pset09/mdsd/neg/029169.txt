i realised early the mistake i made in my reading of this.  i started to read it as a book written for teenagers; i was incorrect, as it is only a book written about teenagers.  every passage of speech is littered with "dude", "nuthin'", "way...", and 'ha' is constantly dropped from 'have'.  this doesn't emulate teenspeak, just acts as a poor imitation.  most of the situations that advance the plot seem quite forced, from the boat race to the visit to see 'rocky horror' at the local cinema.  the characters are all forced and stereotypical, and whilst there are somewhat enjoyable descriptions of place they in no way serve the story itself
