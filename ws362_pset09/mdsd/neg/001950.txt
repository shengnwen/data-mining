Having been asked by a European friend for a book recommendation to learn the nuts and bolts of American history, I gave this book a pre-read with the idea that it might be a fun way for her to learn the basics.  Unfortunately, I found this book to be highly subjective and slanted toward the left.  It's a shame because the author is effective in presenting this historical overview in a light, fun manner.  If only his ideology hadn't interfered..
