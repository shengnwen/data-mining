I reread this book recently and failed to see why it had stuck out in my mind as one of the better espionage books I had come across. The plot is derivatave, taking elements from authors like Ludlum as well as modern movies...believe me this isn't anything anyone familiar with the genre hasn't seen many times. The main characters are pretty clichd, the new family man who must return to the CIA (think Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan) and the coldhearted assassin who will stop at nothing to fulfill his mission. On the positive side, I was never bored with the book. It hums along on a decent page and builds tension fairly well. Unfortunately, the ending is anticlimactic and the story goes more or less where expected. Basically, if you are looking for the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries, this is it
