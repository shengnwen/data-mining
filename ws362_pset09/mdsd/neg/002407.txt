Zulakika's Basque Violence is a confusing and chaotic work which attempts to examine the cultural background to the question of why a terroristic form of violence haunts the Basque people.  The works' shortcomings are abundant and ubiquitous throughout his writing.  No one outside of the field of ethnography will be able to comprehend the overpowering amount of  ethnographic jargon that inundates Zulakika's work.  His work is also delinquent in the fact that very few readers outside of the Basque culture could understand or find the thesis of the work. The reader feels as if he or she is stuck the eccentric mind of a bedlamite, who is rattling off the hagiology of the Basque culture from the Paleolithic era to modern day. The book is structured in what would appear at first glance to be studies of different areas of Basque culture and its relation to the violence that has been occurring in the area; however, the book fails to accomplish this task as well.  Readers will be greatly disappointed with this work because it does not realize any of the intended goals that the author set for himself work
