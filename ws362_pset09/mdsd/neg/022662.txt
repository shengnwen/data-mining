I was planning to perform all the maintenance work on my 2 cars, an Audi S4 and a Honda CR-V. I have done oil changes and air filter changes in the past but I wanted to do more. I bought this book and the "Auto Repairs for Dummies" book in addition to the specific service manuals for the 2 cars. This book gives very very brief explanations with big text fonts and big pictures (not much meat) of how things work so don't hope to perform any actual work by following the book. If you just want to know how cars work and don't wish to perform any actual work then this book may be is for you. I highly recommend the dummy book and forget about this book if you do plan to perform work on your car. The dummy book has a lot more details and it actually shows you how to do the work. I often turned to the dummy book when the service manuals are not explaining things in detail
