I read this book for the first time when I had been studying philosphy for about six months.  at the time I liked it, with my limited knowledge of the subject.  rereading it now Im not so sure.  Ok, Scruton writes good, and has a lot of points to make, and I agree on many of them.  What annoys me greatly, and not just about Scruton, but also with very many of the anglo-american philosophers are their understanding of so-called continental philosophy.  His short account of Foucault in this book shows almost no understanding at all of Foucaults ideas.  Its plain dumb, like many other "anglo-american" readings of "continental" philosophy.  spare me the self-referentially inconsistent arguments...sorry the outburst but its way off the point that Foucault, Derrida and others are trying to make.  

To get back to the book, I still think its ok in many ways, but it needs to be read along with another book as counterpoint.
