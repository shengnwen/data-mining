I've read over 150 thrillers/mysteries during the past 5 years and this novel ranks as one of the five worst. The story is a complete bore and the killer is so perfectly obvious that it seems that the only way the author keeps the story moving is to include monotonous drama about a sexually abused teenager and an emotionally limited inspector. The title, the ending and the loose ends are all meaningless and disappointments. The moral of the story: don't pay attention to the rave reviews on the inside flaps
