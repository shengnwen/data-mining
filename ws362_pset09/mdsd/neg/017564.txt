I found this book engaging and entertaining, however was led to believe by the promotional materials that it would be a bit denser with information.  If one edited out the personal anecdotes, endless references by the author to her own credentials (yes, yes, you have an advanced degree as does a substantial percentage of the population, please on to the information now) and "chimpanzees lite," the book would be a leaner (50+ pages maybe) read rather than the slightly bloated tome it currently is.  Perhaps this is the publisher's fault.

Read it for the insightful and charming stories of the author's own well loved pooches.  For information on primatology, go to the horses' mouths (primatologists - many fine accessible books available).  For information on dog behavior, perhaps there is more out there
