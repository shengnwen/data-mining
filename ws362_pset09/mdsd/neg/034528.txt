The book arrived quickly and appeared to be in new condition.  However, as I began to read it I ran into a problem.  It appears there was an issue when binding the book.  Pages 86 to 102 and missing completely and pages 201 to 235 are printed twice.  
I received excellent custoemr service from AMAZON when I reported the problem and a replacement book arrived within 5 days of my compliant.  Repalcement book is also new and was boudn crooectly with all pages appearing only once
