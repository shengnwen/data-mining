A researcher I---and alot of others--- have immense respect for (and a great guy), Peter Whitmey of Canada, summed it up well: "I really don't see why we are wasting time analyzing and debunking every statement Judyth has made over the past few years.  I personally think this woman simply wants to insert herself into history, based on a possible fleeting connection to Lee Harvey Oswald, and the best thing we can do now is ignore her and get on with solving the crime." Good words from a well-respected man. 

Avoid this book.
[the "we" is in reference to the many researchers wasting their times chasing their tales and getting tied up in knots over someone who may have had a fleeting connection to LHO...my best friend's mom knew JFK: does that make her a grassy knoll shooter now???? :)
