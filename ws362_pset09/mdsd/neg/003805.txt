The book starts off where Black Notice left off.  Although I have read Black Notice, that was a few months ago, so I found the book confusing and lacking in necessary detail.  And I think that writing the book in first person present was a huge mistake.  While we see through the characters eyes, the view is bland and colorless.  I did not feel that there was any connection with the character, but that she was trying a writing exercise in communicating what you physically see
