Wendy doniger has recently received a lot of flak for her so called "research". For the past 2 decades she virtually ruled the field of indology unchallenged. With the emergence of a new set of Indian scholars who have disputed the various premises of her work, Doniger has been caught o the back foot. An obessive desire to interpret virtually every fable or fact of hinduism using freud's psyco-analytical theories brings to light truely ridiculous conclusions. It is a well known fact that the Manu-smriti is not the final say of indian laws and opinions. People who do not know the difference between strutis and smritis should not have the arrogance to project hinduism in less than factual ways. For authoritative studies on indology read books by carl jung and Rajiv Malhotra. Doniger's books will only satisfy your appetite for tabloidy scandalous reports on hinduism
