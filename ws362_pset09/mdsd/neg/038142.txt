As an American with shoddy French skills who has been living in the Il de France for the past six months, I found this book incredibly superficial at best and whiny and self-indulgent at worst.  First of all, to call this book a love story is ridiculous.  Frederic has less presence in the book than her pedigreed dog (or was THAT the "love story"?). From what I read, poor old Frederic seemed no more than a ticket to stay in France, rent free, because she had nothing better to do.
And let me see, what were her insights?  That French is difficult?  That French people like meat?  Wow, great journalism, there.  One day in France is all you need to figure that out.  As far as her assessments on the psychology of French women (they're threatened, which explains their lack of friendliness towards her), what self-serving balderdash is that?  Let me propose a few alternate theories:  A) threatened and rude women come in every nationality; B) maybe they weren't talking to her because it's difficult to communicate with someone with lousy French skills; C) Maybe they just didn't like HER.
For the life of me, I don't understand the positive reviews of this book.  But maybe in an age of CNN, MTV and people who travel no further than to the other side of their living room to search for their lost remote control, this is what qualifies for insightful journalism/entertainment.
Now, Ms. Turnbull might attribute my negativity towards her book to some sort of jealousy since I have had none of the advantages she had while living here.  I pay rent.  I knew no-one when I got here.  I was forced to communicate without the convenience of a fluent boyfriend to translate for me.  I had to make friends based on personality, wit and mime skills.  But I'd like to suggest that if she'd had some of those "disadvantages" (and a little depth) her book might have been less annoying, more interesting and worth the short time spent reading it
