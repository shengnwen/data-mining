I didn't find this book the least bit romantic, which is unfortunate, because the sci-fi elements are very weak and unoriginal. The &quot;hero,&quot; Lorgin, is an unlikeable, overbearing jerk with no respect for the &quot;heroine,&quot; Deanna (rightfully, I suppose, because she's none too bright). I like cheesey sci-fi (&quot;Earth Girls are Easy&quot; used to be one of my favorite movies), and I can stomach a lot of unlikely actions in the name of some laughs - but there were almost none to be had, here. The vast majority of the humor wasn't funny at all, and the parts that were, were brief and infrequent. I did not enjoy this book
