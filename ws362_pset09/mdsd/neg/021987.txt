As anyone who makes a living designing books can tell you, most books are not $200 art books. But that's what Derek Birdsall seems to concentrate on in his "Notes on Book Design." Really, it's a no-brainer to make the art as large as possible and have the specs in a sans serif font. I don't need endless examples showing me exactly that. I'd like to see what Birdsall does with 30,000 words that the publisher insists page out to 272 pages in a 6 x 9 size, but "not look too horsey or airy." I bet he'd quit.

Addditionally, his choice of a typewriter font for the text make the book useless to the reader. Birdsall insists his publisher could not choose a better font--I doubt that.  I got one for ya, Birdsall--Garamond. You should try it some time! 

Ultimately, the tome serves neither the page designs shown as illustrations (too small in most cases) nor the reader. Perhaps a design student may get something out of this, but there must be better books out there on the same subject
