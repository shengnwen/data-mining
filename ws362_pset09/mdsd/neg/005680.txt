My son is a Junior in High School and brought this 5th Edition book home last week.  I spent an hour going through this book and I have to tell you that I am disappointed in the content.  It lacks historical information and focuses on Social issues.  I want my son to know the historical information behind these social issues.  

It is sad that so much of our history is no longer being taught in our schools in favor of diversity
