1. May reflect the author or editor's own lack of interest in pro sports.  Mentions that Vegas has pro baseball and hockey teams but inexplicably fails to provide any info about them (name of team, phone number, website and e-mail addresses, dates of season, ticket prices, name and location of arena or stadium, major-league affiliations).  If many folks don't care about Vegas's spectator sports options, that's fine.  But my family makes a point of visiting the local pro baseball & hockey teams wherever we travel in the US & Canada, and the author didn't put forth even minimal effort to inform us of our options.
2. The "Side Trips" chapter covers many interesting attractions, such as the Hoover Dam, Area 51, Red Rock Canyon & Lake Mead.  But it makes no mention of Nevada's famous brothels (or infamous, depending on your point of view) -- some of which are in counties adjacent to Vegas/Clark County.  If some readers find the brothels offensive or unappealing, that's fine.  But the author should provide the information and let the reader decide whether to skip it or read it.
3. The guide has a "section" on Internet access, but doesn't bother to list even one Internet cafe (or coffeehouse with free Net access).  How hard is that?
4. The accommodations section is fairly thorough, but misses a rather obvious property:  the Marriott Grand Chateau Resort.  It's large and right on the Strip - hard to miss.  It was under construction long before the guide's publication date and occupancy starts in October '05
