Drab storytelling at its worst, but to compare this to Capote's In Cold Blood is to insult a truly great writer. Those who are so impressed with this amateurish work should go back and read no more than the first chapter of In Cold Blood and then reconsider your flattering comments.

The outstanding reviews of this mediocre work indicate that, aside from the classics, there remains a paucity of worthy literary fiction.
