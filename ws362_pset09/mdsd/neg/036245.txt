The Berenstain Bears and the Messy Room is about Bother and Sister Bear who never clean their room. One day, Momma bear had enough and made the cubs change their way. After talking, they decide to do something about it.  This book teaches children about responsibility. This book is good for children from 4-11. I thought it was a pretty good book
