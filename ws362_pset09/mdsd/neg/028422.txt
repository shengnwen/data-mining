Having seen the movie and read the screenplay, I can never fail to understand how something like this was ever taken seriously.  There is absolutely nothing original here; the writing is shallow, tedious and unbelievably hackneyed and I marvel that such mediocre talent could be so hyped, so gushed over and can only wonder how such 'writing' could ever have been made into a movie let alone win an Academy Award! It baffles me completely.  Perhaps the powers-that-be in Hollywood owed something to Robin Williams.....

Incidentally, there is much whispering in industry circles that Affleck and Damon didn't really even write this screenplay.  Instead it was the result of a collaboration between Gus Van Zant, Robin Williams and Rob Reiner.  As a matter of fact much of William's comedic dialogue was improvised by the master himself, yet authorship was, strangely, still credited to Affleck and Damon - probably for shrewd publicity and marketing reasons.  The fact that these two have not produced any screenplays worthwhile since tends to verify suspicions about their real and minimal contributions to Good Will Hunting
