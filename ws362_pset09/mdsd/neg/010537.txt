Don't ask me why I ended up reading this, but I like to think of myself as "open-minded," so I did. It's an amusing way to spend the time. No surprises as to the plot, which could have been recycled from old MacGuyver episodes, and the mysterious clues weren't all that mysterious, but the writing is fun and airy and the two lead characters -- basically the only ones in the book -- are fun cariactures. I'm going to call this book "mysterical" (mystery + hysterical) and say that if you like inoffensive, pleasant, non-challenging reading it's great
