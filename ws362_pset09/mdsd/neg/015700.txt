The first two entries into this library were great, but this book did not live up to my expectations.  Some of the advice given was outdated, and sometimes just plain wrong.  I have used it a bit, and I do read the monthly chapters as my child ages, but I would not use it as my primary source of information, and certainly not as my sole source of information.
