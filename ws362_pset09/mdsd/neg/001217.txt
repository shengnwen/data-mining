I purchased this book to find out more about decorated stoneware. This book is basically a haphazard listing of pieces that were auctioned off at different auctions. The descriptions are not always above or below an item. Sometimes they are very hard to follow.The prices are the actual auction price. No information on how to tell where a piece is from, that is not marked. No easy way to read this book
