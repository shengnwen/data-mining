Like so many of you, I love Stephen King. I really do. He has given us so much that he is certainly forgiven for writing a stinker. But hey, we already had to read Gerald's Game! At least Gerald's story wasn't very long. However, Wolves of the Calla feels extraordinarily long because it is so damned boring. Also like so many of you, I do in fact plan to read all of King's books despite being let down by a few bad lemons. But, knowing this, knowing that so many readers will read on no matter what the hell King puts on the menu--shouldn't he take it upon himself to aim for a little less indulgence? If you cut all of the fat from Wolves you'd be left with one tasty little steak, perhaps a great short story that never got its chance to shine. Instead we have a book that simply doesn't do anything. You know from the get-go what's going to happen in the end and in King's own words (out of Roland's mouth)--that's only worth 5 minutes of actual fun and those five minutes--after a several hour investment--simply do not pay off. I was bored out of my f---ing mind listening to this overblown and obvious tale and I didn't even have Frank Muller as the reader to help me get through the journey. On that note, I truly hope Mr. Muller is on the mend. King ... well ... he's written his tale to its conclusion and so be it. But if Cell, a very mediocre book, is the indication of where King's going--is the best of him behind us now
