This book should only be sold as fiction and come with "Horse Whispers and Lies" attached.  Monty, shame on you...trying to take credit for inventing the slant load horse trailer, making claims to have been a Champion Calf Roper, and going to horse shows in a railroad box car?  
His family says that it's all a bunch of lies.  The content of the book on horse handling is good, but Monty Roberts did not invent the methods used.  They have been around for years.  
Monte, is a good horseman, he should not have made the preposterous, boastful statements that are included throughout the book.
