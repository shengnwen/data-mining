My wife bought this for our daughter for christmas several years back and frankly it is a terrible book. This coming from a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. It basically has no story or interesting plot at all. The purpose of the book is just to have a bunch of tongue twisters just to have them there. I really was surprised how bad this book was since I love so many other Dr. Seuss books (our child has at least 15 other seuss books we love). Honestly, my child picks this book periodically for bed time stories, and my wife and i will cringe when reading this. Also, our child doesn't really seem to care for it either.
