I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only.   Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO?  I wanted to know the man.  What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have?  How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father?  How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings?   What experiences in his life molded him into what he became?  These and many other questions were not answered.   How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes?    Try it again Janet, the third time never fails
