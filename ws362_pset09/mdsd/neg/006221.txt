I had hoped this book would be another Austen fan delight along the lines of 'The Jane Austen Book Club', but was disappointed to find bad writing, flat characters, and a contrived storyline.  It was like any grocery store romance novel, without the graphic sex scenes.  It tried too, too hard to create a 'Pride and Prejudice' parallel in Jane's life, and made the character of Jane Austen into a very unimpressive, flimsy, mousy woman.  Nothing like the brilliantly witty, mysterious and deep person her fans know her as  (although it makes cringeworthy attempts at wit, mystery, and depth, to the author's credit at least demonstrating her genuine admiration for Austen).  The writing was just too reminiscent of high school 'boy meets girl' dime store novels.  Even the battle over Darcy between the main character, Eliza, and her nemesis, Faith, was portrayed as very 'high school' for two grown women characters.  Overall, I wanted to like the characters, but I just couldn't relate to them.  I wanted to enjoy the story, but it was just too cliche.  I wanted to enjoy the romance, but it was just too immature.  Check out 'The Jane Austen Book Club' for a GREAT and very clever read in Austen's style
