some of these stories or so corny for example in the story Delcardes' cat kull invites a talking cat to live in the palace the cat's servant is throwing his voice into the cat to try to get kull to agree to Delcardes forbidden choise of husband. So Thusa doom the most powerfull necromancer in the history of the world is reduced tying up the cats servant and throwing his voice into the cat to lure kull into a deadly trap in the end thusa doom is unmasked in front of everyone, shakes him fist and escapes &quot;i'll get you yet kull&quot; so much for the power of necromancy, this story reads like a scooby doo cartoon this book is so corny it's kind of cool. Kull is worth a read but don't expect to much and don't pay alot of this book
