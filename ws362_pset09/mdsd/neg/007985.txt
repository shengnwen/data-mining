Very disappointed to get this book which has no bar code and clearly appears to be "home project" of copyright violation: Poorly bound with delayed delivery. As a collector of books, any one would be disappointed to get this wreck of disjointedly bound, unauthentic appearing copy of a book. I have contacted the publisher to investigate a possible copyright violation. It is a shame that Amazon.com is the cybervehicle of such books!
