First, of all, I would like to begin by saying that I'm not one of those reviewers that enjoy bashing books for the mere sake of it, nor do I bash books I have not read.  It is rare that I end up reading a book that I simply detest, because I usually read up on them beforehand, and know what I am getting into.  Given that I love black comedies, horrors, sci-fi, and over-the-top shocking stories, I thought that I would enjoy this book; I did not.  My main complaint with this book isn't the content (it was original, and over-the-top), or the subject matter; my complaint is the bad writing.  Each chapter was one to three pages, and the story was badly written.  I felt like I was reading a sexed up cyberpunk cat-in-the-hat.  If you took the pictures out of the book, and reduced the fonts down to a normal size, the entire book would have been maybe 30-40 pages of fluff.  This book had virtually no plot, no character development, and was comprised almost exclusively of attempting to shock the reader with adjective-ridden fluff of some odd LSD-like sex trip.  All-in-all, this is just a poorly written attempt at a book.

If you want to experience good fiction in this genre, try any of Chuck Palahniuk's novels; or in film try Takashi Miike's films like Visitor Q, or Ichi the Killer.
