THE FIRST RULE OF UNARMED COMBAT IS NEVER BE UNARMED. People on battle fields don't fight unarmed. 
This is a very primitive form of close combat. The tecniques described through out the book are repeative and very basic. Any one whos been in a street fight would know these tecniques. I feel sorry for Marines that bought into this system. If your looking for a form of unarmed combat check out Systema.
