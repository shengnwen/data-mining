Reading the other reviews, I see some people are so admiring of M. Night Shyamalan that anything he writes or directs is a work of creative genius. No doubt Shyamalan is talented but maybe his fame and fortune came too soon to keep his ego in check. I know some of the people mentioned in the book and was curious how their interactions with Shyamalan would be portrayed. Shyamalan is his own number one fan and he has no patience for anyone who disagrees with him or critizes his work. He has had a few successful movies and believes all studio executives should trust in him completely. I was amazed that Shyamalan approved of the book since it shows so much of his darker side. Shyamalan sets his own rules. He can feels he has the right to demand a certain salary but then feels  betrayed by an actress who asks for more than the SAG minimum he has offered her. He loves his family yet doesn't seem to accept that a film executive can break his rules by placing her family above work. The book is worth a read if you are a Shyaman fan or wonder what led up to the disaster that became LADY IN THE WATER. There is no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is a rare talent with new ideas. It is only his ego that stands in his way of even great succes
