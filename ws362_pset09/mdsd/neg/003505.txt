This book was very disappointing. I had to force myself to finish it. The repetition begins on the third page and then beats us over the head until the end. Why a book celebrating women and their friendships has to bash men is beyond me. In writing a book contemplating death, Radish never once considers faith. Her characters are all carbon copies of one another, and the story which is supposedly about great transformations teaches us nothing except that a vacation refreshes us. Duh! Don't spend your vacation, or any of your valuable time on this one
