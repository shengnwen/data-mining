For years I have avoided Jodi Picoult novels and if this one is typical, with good reason.  For my book club, I am plowing through the nauseating minuate that bulks this novel to over 400 pages.  The constant, brief shifts in first-person narration are too fast and give views on characters, such as a judge who likes show tunes, that are irrelevant to the novel at the expense of more fully developing the title character.  The first-person narration works for important characters but otherwise I think the author is using an easy narrative device to propel the action of her novel, which is, even with this technique, infuriatingly slow and has the effect of jarring the reader every page or two as one must determine the narrator yet again.  

Also, the focus on the child-custody battle removes attention from who I think is the most interesting character--the child Faith.  If one can get past the didactic symbolism of the name Faith White, and the constant phrasing such as "here is a story about faith" (p. 275) followed by "he'll do whatever is in his power to make sure I keep Faith," (p.291), which makes me cringe at each repetition, the child seeing or hearing God is, to me, the most interesting aspect of the plot but one that receives little attention.  

Overall, I think this novel is heavy-handed, overly descriptive and replete with such obvious symbolism and detail it makes my eyes hurt. The characters never seem real and I never sympathize with any of their easily predictable reactions and emotions, but find the potential of the plot is never fully realized in any engaging way. Try a different novel- many others dealing with religion exist that are far better written and much more interesting
