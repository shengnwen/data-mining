I know this type of person. I've watched his unbearable TV show. I ask, why can't we all just get along?  Being a peace lover, and a church going Christian, his ways are VERY un-Christian like.  Jesus would not approve, Bill, but luckily for you, God is very forgiving.  Attacking others is not very nice.  Most of us learned that in Kindergarten.  And I really wonder how TRADITIONAL it is to hate others when you can't, or won't, comprehend what their lives are like.  Perhaps we should go back to burning at the stake, lynching, or segregation to prove just how Christian, Traditional and Patriotic the United States really is. Do I need to remind you, Bill, and your brain-washed followers that this country was founded by men trying to escape persecution for believing something different?  Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all citizens?  Those who hate will love this book, those with an open, loving, tolerant mind will know better.
