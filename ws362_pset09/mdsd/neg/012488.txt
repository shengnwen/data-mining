I am reviewing the audio version of the book.  I would give this zero stars if I could, only because of the narration.  As usualy, Dave Barry is very funny, but it doesn't come through in this version because it's impossible to get past the narrator's reading.  In a word, he is AWFUL.  He sounds like a combination between a bad Paul Harvey impersonator and the adult voice of Ralphie in &quot;A Christmas Story.&quot;  His timing and inflection are totally wrong for the material and he completely ruins the whole book.  I couldn't get through one of the five CDs before I wanted to throw the thing out the window.  It would have been great if they had used someone like Harry Anderson (who played a fictionalized version of Dave on TV a few years ago) to read this, and then perhaps Barry's humor would have come through.  If you like Dave Barry, skip the audio book and read the paper version
