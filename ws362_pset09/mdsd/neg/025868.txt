This comic is so stupid. When you boil it down, it's NOTHING but " White people do this, and black people do THIS" jokes with "Bush is stupid!" thrown into the mix. This is like an officially licensed webcomic. Not worth the money, or time to read it. And despite it's OCCAISIONAL message against racism, the jokes are usually racist. People who will enjoy this book are those who are too lazy to read a real boo
