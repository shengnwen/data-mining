Although this books dives into the area of color to say that you are a summer, winter, spring, makes absolutely no sense.  A summer where?  Ireland?  Africa?  Thailand? Dallas?  Summer is different in each of these places so this theory simply doesn't add up.  In addition, not all blonde hair blue eyed women fall into the same category.  Nor do brunettes. What this book does is ease the pain of actually having to diagnose a person to their own unique color characteristics.  By telling you that you are this or that you are templated into the category of being something less than what you are.  What would you be called if you can wear pink and orange?  Is there such a thing as slightly warm or a spring/winter? Through this and most theories similiar, people are missing out on colors that truly enhance their overall appearance. If you want to know your "colors" find a reputable image consultant who understands more than how to make a template.  Find one that will give you fabric swatches and explain why you can be more than one season.  Find a professional who understands the true meaning of making your colors unique to you without the template. Don't waste time being templated into the rest of what society believes is true because no one person has the same exact coloring as the next. Most professionals will tell you this.  Take their word for it
