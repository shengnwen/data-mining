Awful, awful book.  I am a student enrolled in an art school and wanted to improve in my anatomy and digital painting skills so I picked up this book.  Luckily I did not have to put out any money to buy this book.  I borrowed it from a friend.  He too thought it was awful.  The drawings in this books are amateur and crude at best. I went through pages after pages of anatomical errors.  The only good things in the book were some of the fantasy picture the author borrowed from other great fantasy artists. Trust me, stay clear from this book
