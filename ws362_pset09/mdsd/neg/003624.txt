This spiral bound almost-a-pamphlet lists the 14 'super' foods that anyone could find on the net. This book gives you a weak two paragraph synopsis of each food followed by 8-10 recipes for that food that are hardly healthy. One of the recipes called for Cheez Whiz for crying out loud!

This book is junk, find the super foods online (hint - look at the picture on the cover of the book as displayed above they are all there) and there are a plethora of free healthy recipes out there.
