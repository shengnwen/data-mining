This book is not about love, it's about the worst side of human nature.  I wrote a review that was censored by Amazon because I listed the disgusting human behavior carried out in this book.     It's horrifying that we are censored if we list the things that happen in a book that Amazon is happy to sell to you.  So, heads up, maybe a lot of people who didn't like it are being censored.  I wouldn't trust the reviews. The people in the book have no heart or affection for one another.  Granted we all may have different definitions of love, but Morrison's is totally awful (quit reading if you don't want info on the end of the book):  two women who were friends until age 11 spend the rest of their lives hating each other.  As old women, one is fatally injured trying to hurt the other at which point they realize they loved each other all along.  Yeah, I guess Morrison can call that love but it's a pretty sick idea of love if you ask me.  Morrison is a good writer but the characters are really obnoxious people - she should be ashamed for writing such a cold, mean-spirited novel when she has such talent
