This book had a lot of promise.  However, I think even a teenager would have laughed at the plot holes in this one.  Set in 2006/2007 the book overlooks the power of the internet to spread information.  US forces are the only major players in stopping the virus and the three top commanders end up in a firefight.  The troops are told to shoot and ask questions later, but when a civilian is hit by a truck and a medic says he is burning up with fever they leave him with food and water in case he isn't infected.  The author even gets his east/west directions mixed up for almost an entire chapter.  Knowing that Africa is to the west of the Suez Canal is a pretty basic thing.  I gave it two stars for one reason.  I was ready to discard the book after getting a third of the way through, but I wanted to find out what happened to the characters.  Not interested enough to look for a sequel
