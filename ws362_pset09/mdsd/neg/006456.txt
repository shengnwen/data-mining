This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.

If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can
