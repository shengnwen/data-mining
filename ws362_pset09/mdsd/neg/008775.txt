Yes, folks, it's All Happening Now!  The dawn of the New Age of Enlightenment.  What we've all been waiting for (pant).  The Cosmic Consciousness, the Cosmic Christ incarnating like never before.  What a time to be alive!   Matthew Fox delivers his revelation on the Real Truth about the Cosmos and its Christ, neatly woven in eco-speak and Gaia-gabble.  I tried.  Truly, I tried to understand what he's on about.  I found a lot of Consciousness, Awareness, Forces, Being, Quanta, Fields, Trends, and Direction.  Lots of spirituality but no religion.  Lots of gender but no sex.  Lots of insight and belief, but no dogma, no doctrine, no drama ... a wondrous postmodern utopia, and so  disconnected from anything real and so utterly irrelevant to our human condition.  If you're looking for a book (and an author) to inspire you to change your life, look elsewhere.  Though the words are golden, the soup is thin.  This is a book for utopians, so you can read it with impunity -- it won't change your life.  And fortunately for the rest of us, Fox and his Creation Spiritualists don't have what it takes to really change anything.  Sadly, not even themselves
