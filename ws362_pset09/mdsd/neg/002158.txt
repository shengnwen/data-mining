I have read hundreds of graphic novels, and I saw the buzz on this.  I guess I have never been a huge Grant Morrison fan, though he has his moments.  This was his attempt to create a completely new universe out of old characters.  I tried to get started, couldn't finish.  If you are a completest, go for it.  There is better stuff out there.

Re-readability: 2/10

*I always put re-readability in my reviews for people who like to keep their TPB to re-read
