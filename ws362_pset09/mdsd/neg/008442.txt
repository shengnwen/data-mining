If you're impressed with books by ageing wannabees desperately seeking reassurance through the challenging medium of bored, penniless prostitutes, you'll find this riveting. Otherwise you'll probably find it to be indulgent garbage. 
I first went to Cuba in 1995 (being from Europe it was not a problem to travel there), around the time the Buena Vista Social Club was gaining worldwide recognition. It was a fascinating place. I stopped going about five years ago, as the place was becoming oppressive, full of miserable sex tourists and those same bored, penniless prostitutes who practically throw themselves at any foreigner who has a few dollars to offer (the average monthly wage in Cuba is about $10). It is also becoming more dangerous, due in part to the growing desperation and in part to the increase in drug activity. Inevitably, AIDS is becoming more widespread. 
Baker seems at home amidst the seedier side of modern day Cuba. A quick look at the website makes it easier to understand why that might be. His gullibility, so apparent in the book, is perhaps less easy to comprehend. Don Juan, he clearly ain't. But he is supposed to be well traveled. 
If what you are really interested in is a well-researched book on Cuba, believe me, there are much better ones than this.
Don't be conned
