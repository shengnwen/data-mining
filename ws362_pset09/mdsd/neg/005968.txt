As an attending/assistant professor of anesthesiology I frequently recommend books for residents to read. I still recommend this book, but with the caveat that much of the information is outdated and some of it is no longer even held to be fact. The underlying theme of the book - that comorbid states influence anesthesia and vice versa - is still true. I tell residents to get a used copy or wait until a new edition comes out
