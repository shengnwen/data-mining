Shame on Routledge for touting as a centenary edition this dog, riddled with egregious typos ("simiotics"? "ernestly"?), whose footnotes refer one to pages on which that which is alleged to have taken place does not, in fact, take place.
I like the intros, and the very spacey Micky James foreword.
But Routledge does not deserve the $18.95 I gave them for this book, which is, apparently, in the public domain, and which I can read, without typos, online.
Shame!!!!
