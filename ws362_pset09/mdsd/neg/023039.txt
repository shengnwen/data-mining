It was an okay read, but most of the information here was on bad treatment of the animals. Not that this isn't important, but I wanted to know more about the things that we are eating. More about the use of sick and diseased animals.  The animals are going to die and the plants aren't pretty (Just drive around Greely, CO) The smell would make most of us very ill, but that is what they do to get the food to us.  

I wanted to know about the hormones, chemicals, diseases. She should have covered more of that. Not really worth 20 buck
