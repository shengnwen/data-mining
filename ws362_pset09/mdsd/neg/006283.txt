This book is an utterly corrupt, crackpot method of lying to others in order to manipulate them, to live under a constant cloud of suspicion, and to essentially ruin your personal relationships.  Shall I give you an example?  From page 122:  "You and a friend are deciding on what movie to see.  You suggest 'Lost In Paradise', but your friend, who doesn't want to see this, offers as evidence a coworker who has already seen it and didn't like it.  you then say 'Oh, well, if no one in your office liked it, I guess it's probably no good.'  If she lets it go at that - not correcting you - then you know she LIED INITIALLY" (emphasis mine).  Excuse me?  What kind of special social retard do you have to be to 'know' your friend is a LIAR because she doesn't want to see a movie?  A little earlier, a technique called "Insert a False Fact" shows up.  INSERT A FALSE FACT?  Isn't that known as LYING?  And this in the context of a party, no less... hoo boy... start lying to everyone at a party because you suspect people of being liars - you're gonna wind up friendless pretty quick.  If you just tell the truth, you'll be amazed at the nice people you meet - who needs a book which rationalizes lying and manipulation?  Trust me, if you have a moral compass, you don't need this rag
