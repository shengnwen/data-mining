I used this book in my reactions engineering class.  It was full of mistakes even though it was the 5th printing.  The only reason the book was even useable was because Schmidt was a professor at the school I took the class at so he could clear up the mistakes in the book.  The sections on CSTRs and PFRs was acceptable but still filled with mistakes and unclear problems at the end.  So if you don't go to the University of Minnesota I would not recommand this book due to all the errors
