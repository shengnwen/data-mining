Let me start off by saying that I'm not a fan of contemporary art.  That being said, this book is incredibly difficult to read.  For me, each sentence took several re-reads before I could get some type of clue as to what he was trying to say.  I consider myself a good reader and this book was way out there with the uppity language.  My husband would get a kick out of me reading sentences to him, just because they were impossible to understand.  If you like this sort of thing, then you might like the book.  I, however, did not like the book.  I also did not like how they would describe a work of art in great detail, yet show you a totally different piece from that artist.  It made if difficult to visually see what they were talking about.  My professor did a much better job explaining the material covered in this book
