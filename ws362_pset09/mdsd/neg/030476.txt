A not very original contribution to the now quite vast literature on postmodern, global society written by a world-weary globetrotter. That's not to say that there no interesting observations made in Iyer's essay-like chapters, but there are no marked aspects of "The Global Soul" that make it stand out from other books of the same genre. Iyer's tendency to whine about just about every place he visits becomes almost incessant and tends to detract from any relevant criticisms or observations he's trying to get across. Even more annoying are his frequent lamentations about his own lot - basically he seems to be trying get his readers to feel sorry for him because he has a job that gives him the opportunity to travel all around the world, frequently. However, it seems that despite some of the obvious drawbacks like jetlag and occasional feelings of alienation, most people would find such a lifestyle enviable. Generally though, Iyer's book deals with a class of rootless travellers who by no means come even close to representing a significant portion of the world's population, even if the poorer, so-called Third World is excluded. He as much as acknowledges this in his chapter about Hong Kong, when he admits that he largely failed to discuss the Chinese, who make up 6 million of the city's 6.2 million people. Perhaps the best chapter is the last, in which he talks about his new-found home in a provincial Japanese city. Quite telling is his statement that he is drawn to Japan because of its &quot;ability to draw a strict line around itself - to sustain an unbending sense of within and without...&quot; In other words, Iyer, the rootless `global soul' living in a post-national world, finds the well-ordered nation-state that Japan represents appealing. Perhaps this can be taken as a metaphor for the world as a whole, since it may not be as borderless and populated by `rootless souls' as our popular culture would have us believe
