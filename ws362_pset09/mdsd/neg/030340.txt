I was a bit excited to get a copy of this book as I've heard a good deal about it.  So I picked up a copy and read it in a day which is a bit unusual for me.  All in all I was extremely disapointed in every aspect imaginable.  Donald Miller spends the entire book rambling as if he were on an acid trip.  His jesus seems to be more the type of say a hispanic fellow (Heyzeus)who sells drugs down on the corner.  He preaches a gospel of love without justice; one in which a hippie jesus comes over and wants to chat and share his bong with you.  Holiness is apparently not all that important, but then again love is all that matters.  Blue like Jazz is a waste of time and a hindrance to anyone's spiritual growth..
