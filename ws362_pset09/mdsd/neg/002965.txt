Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story
