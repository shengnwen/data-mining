I cannot imagine, being Shannon Tweeds and Gene Simmons children and picking up this book one day with the thoughts of maybe getting to know a different more in depth side of your mother. Most Biographies involve birth to the present and everything in between. I knew Shannon Tweed as an 80's movie D-Lister. She was basically in every single sitcom or drama back then as a guest star, or walk on. Her face is sort of recognizable, you might say "I know her from somewhere" but you can't place her.  She is beautiful, she is married to a rock star, and she of course is now in her own reality television show just like everyone else. This book, all 200 pages, lots of pictures, and large type is kind of pathetic. Not in a way that she herself is, but cmon, if you are going to write a "this is my story", spout some details, spill your emotions, give us something besides how you noticed your future husband was very aroused the first time you met him, and how many names you can drop. There are pictures of this woman, taken from playboy, that are full on nude Furry parts and all, I would be mortified if I was her children. There is a time and place for everything; a biography isn't one of them to show your naughty places. Tacky. I read this book, in ½ an hour, and I am not lying. It was that simple. Shannon, your shacking up with Gene Simmons, and your book is basically devoted to your boobs.
