I read (or tried to read) the first six or seven stories in this book and wondered - these are the best horror and fantasy stories??  I was bored to tears by each of them, by authors who seem to have no idea how to inspire wonder in the mind of the reader.  As a writer of such genre fiction myself, I am offended and appalled that these stories were published anywhere, let alone selected for a best of anthology.  Ellen Datlow shows me time and time again that she knows nothing about editing fiction.  Bring back Robert Silverberg, Jack Vance, Sam Delany, Roger Zelasny, Fritz Leiber ....
