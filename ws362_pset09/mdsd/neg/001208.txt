Often Wrong, Never in Doubt or The Diary of Mr. Deustch and his fantastic ego. Although the book is readable, what at first sight looks like a personal and empathic touch becomes the centre of the book, and offers the message "look how I do things. Do them in the same way as ME and you'll succeed". It's not an arrogant book, simply the author considers himself as a visionary who's got the key of success in his hands.

One of the clearest examples is the chapter Do!, that opens the part named Your Own World, in which the reader expects that the chat about the author's life will stop (we have already reached the middle of the book...) This chapter starts motivating the reader, but after 2 paragraphs, the author returns to himself, talking about all his trajectory until achieving a talk-show. In the next chapters, he will explain how he achieved his forty's sculptural body, why he sold his agency in the best moment, and he will finally bring us to the long queues of autographs that he has to suffer.

His life is interesting, there's no doubt about it, and if he wants the rest of mortals to know it, he should publish an autobiography. There's no need to disguise it as a management book, because without any doubt, it is not.
