We received this book as a gift for our 3 yr old.  I read it to her and it was really disturbing.  Other reviews have noted that it must be read "in context" as far as the time it was written.  I disagree - when was a child's viewing a mother's brutal murder (Babar seeing his mother being shot before his eyes)  ever appropriate fare for a little child?  Then, Babar has to run for his life and later on in the book, there is another death.  Also, Babar is surprised when his cousins have no clothes - this is upsetting to him.  I find it offensive - elephants don't need to be like people - they don't need clothes.  I don't see the charm in this book at all.  I don't see the attraction.  One thing -- Babar marrying his cousin is the one thing that is not shocking - its not like incest, like brother and sister or like they grew up together -- people have been marrying cousins for thousands of years - up until at least the beginning of this century - hardly immoral
