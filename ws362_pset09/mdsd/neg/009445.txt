I was very excited when I received my book. Unfortunatly my excitement turned to dissapointment as I thumbed through the pages. While the book was filled with easy to do garnishes it was elementary and below my expectations. While the beginning of the book had some good points and conveyed a general understanding of garnishing, It was less than what I expected from 4 well educated chefs
