I thought that this book was o.k. for the most part, but I really didn't like some parts at all. What really gave the book a bad effect was what LaVaughn finds out about Jody. I think that kind of ruins the book. I was very sure that she was going to talk to Jody, or something, but after she finds out the true thing behind him, I think it was a total waste of writing. I don't really reccommend this book to anyone, it had a nice writing style, but the actual writing wasn't that great
