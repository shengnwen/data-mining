The premise of this book is that Kessler is looking for "the next big thing" to invest in.  What area in healthcare is scalable so that it can be made smaller/faster/cheaper thus saving/making money.  Just like computers have gotten faster and cheaper - he is on a mission to find something similar in the world of medicine.  

Kessler is a smart guy and also, as he points out so many times in the book, very well connected.  But reading a few articles in WebMD and a paragraph or two in the PDR does not make him a doctor, nor does it make him capable of understanding medicine to the point where he should be writing a book about how to change the medical world.  The idea that you could get rid of doctors and some day have computers do all the medicine is mind-boggling.  Even if computer programs were sophisticated enough to do the surgeries or replace the radiologists, who is going to program these machines or run these tests? 

The world of medicine has gotten expensive because of more regulations, more malpractice, more formularies, more hoop jumping, more administrative work and more middlemen between the patient and the doctor.  America has the best healthcare available but few are getting it because the insurance companies are dictating what can and can't be done, when it should be done, who you can see and how often you can see them. If you want good care, seek a specialist and pay cash.  If you need to treat something like a cold that's probably going to go away anyway whether you do something or not, Kessler's idea of the ATM-like medicine dispensers in the pharmacy is fine.  

I would not recommend this book for anything more than a conversation starter.
