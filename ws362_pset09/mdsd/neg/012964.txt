I mean no disrespect to a prior reviewer--Jill Switzer--or to anyone for that matter.  But I do resent having been enticed to buy this book.  

Ms Switzer expresses 'enormous gratitude' for the advice given in this book, which has led to a book deal. She wrote the review in July 2004--her only one--when she was 'putting the spit and polish on her manuscript.'  I searched Amazon for her book but apparently it's not published yet, or Amazon hasn't yet begun selling it.  Please look for Ms Switzer's book to check the authenticity of her review.  

Another disquieting piece of advice in the book was the suggestion that the writer employ an indexing specialist.  MS_Word does a pretty good job of indexing--am I wrong? 

The book does not give sound advice regarding what to do when a publishing house tries not to pay a writer (usually first time writers will need to field such a 'try on'.)  I remember it saying that under no circumstances should you bother the Editor of the Publishing House regarding money matters.  

Overall, this book felt like it was designed for 'wannabees' who would never be.  

Strange also, that this book, like so many others that seem to pander to the interests of the Publishers, won't state expected income in dollar terms for things like romance novels.  

Thank God for Amazon's new 'real name' system--now I can read reviews with some certitude of genuineness.
