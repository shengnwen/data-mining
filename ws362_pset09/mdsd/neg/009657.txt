Yet another ridiculous dog worshiping book. It suggests that "humans" should become more like "canines". I don't see how having unprotected intercourse in public, sniffing rears, licking one's private parts, chasing cars, and rolling in manure is a good, productive, moral outlook on life.

Dogs bite approx. five million people a year in the United States, mainly children, innocent joggers and mailmen. I guess the dogs bit them first and growled later. This is a book that preaches to the choir: a choir of brainwashed dog freaks who can't see how foolish they are. Take it from an outside eye, an eye that isn't part of the dog worshiping fad: This book is stupid. If you want to pattern your life on a lower species, small-brained, subservient, man-made domesticated animal, may I suggest a good shrink?
