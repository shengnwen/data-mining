Let me start by saying that I was really looking forward to this book. The reviews were pretty terrific in general. I thought it was time for someone to write a story with a plus-sized woman as the central character shown in a positve light. However, up until chapter 24 I was still wondering how I was going to finish this torture without setting it ablaze in sheer frustration. Once again we have a story where the author continues the stereotype of fat people having NO self esteem, neurotic self-talk and desolate love lives. Happiness, strength and self esteem only seem to kick in after a gym membership success story and weight loss. Give me a break...by the time Maggie's life starts to turn around, I already hate her. Her chronic insecurities, emotional weakness and incessant whining didn't end for over 200 pages!!! At this point, I was hoping for a nasty accident and was relieved when it was over. Why can't someone write a story that involves a strong plus-sized character with a healthy self esteem and a positive love life. Ms. Palmer has missed on this one. I'm just sorry the library didn't have this book and that I actually had to pay for it. Ms. Palmer has a decent sense of humor and there were a few lines where I smiled, but most of all I was just plain disappointed
