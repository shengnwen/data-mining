Since this is a review about the book, I normally do not wish to mention anything about the author. But it is truly hard to do so: apart from the several pages devoted to his interaction with Pete, the style of writing betrays a strange disconnection of the author from his subject: while his life did cross paths with Pete's more often than most of us readers, the author doesn't seem to have "gotten" his subject. He quotes George Harrison at the back while seemingly being unable to see what George, the master of thoughtful sarcasm, meant.

Pete's writing his own book and that will be worth the wait. Get another book in the meantime, unless you can pick this up at your local used books place.
