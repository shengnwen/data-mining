In my experience (and I wish it were not so!), gays tend to share some unpleasant character traits, such as effeminacy or lack of masculinity, cliquishness, and lewdness.  The book's chief merit is that it doesn't deny their existence, but its chief defect is that it attempts, largely unsuccessfully, to try to interpret these characteristics in a more favorable light.  I agree that some of these favorable interpretations are reasonable: for example, I agree that the greater amoralism of gays opens up certain aesthetic or artistic possibilities, at least given a certain understanding of art.  But from the point of view that is most interesting to me, as someone trying to assess the romantic possibilities, I disagree that something very good can be built on such things
