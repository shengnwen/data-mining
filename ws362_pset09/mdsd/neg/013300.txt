  I always shake my head and smile when I read Robert B. Parker's novels. That I keep reading them is evidence of his talent as a writer. Even so, after about the first 20 pages, I could not help but notice that Jesse Stone is simply a re-working of the Spenser character. I still hold out the hope that someday, Parker will get over his hangups about conservatives, organized religion, the concept of man and wife, and surburbia. The sub-plot about the right-wing militia was laughable! In Massachusetts of all places?? Parker's blind faith in The Professional Therapist as the god-given solution to all of man's problems is passing out of the annoying phase and is now in the realm of nauseating. Its sad that a man of such talent has such a stunted, fatalistic view of Man. If only Parker can overcome this handicap, he will possibly make the leap from fair to good
