Do NOT buy this book.  The biggest flaw this book has is the lack of organization and a poor understanding of it's target audience's needs.  I purchased this book with the hope of finally understanding how to install and use these free software tools to create and maintain my own internet business.  I spent the first day just trying to get the software to load properly.  I couldn't find the troubleshooting section in this book and it offered no online support.  It did offer three different methods of installation on different OS but the sections just ran together with no clearly defined break between OS's.  The book store I bought it from wouldn't take it back because there policy wouldn't allow a refund on books that have the software envelope torn open.  How are we supposed to know if the book is any good with out installing the software that comes with it?  The two are designed to go with each other.  All I can tell you is save yourself some trouble and buy a different book.  Sam really dropped the ball on this one
