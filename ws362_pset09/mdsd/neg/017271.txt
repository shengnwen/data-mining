The idea of eating less meat has always appealed to me. I found this book in hopes of learning how to find other sources of protein. I just wanted a book to tell me some easy to read guidelines, all I found in this book was a lot of big words. You have to have a PHD in nutrition to read it. The more I read the more confused I got. This book is NOT for the casual reader
