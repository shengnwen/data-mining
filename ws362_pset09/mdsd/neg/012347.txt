Positives about this book is that, unlike other books which offer "cure", nowhere does Null states or implies that the book is intended to cure or eliminate any sort of disease or illness, besides that aspect, the book is largely disappointing. Unfortunately much of the information contained here can be found on the Internet, but there are several problems as well.

In certain illness or diseases he can state up to 30-50 possible herbs/vitamins (which can be confusing at times). The problem is that for some of them he is reluctant to tell you the appropriate dosages to take. Secondly, there side effects, for example; take 200 B6 over the long run can cause nerve damage, which brings up the next point, which he is reluctant to tell the precautionary details of combining certain herbs and supplements, which can be toxic and deadly. You can't just tells the reader, take this take that, and not tell them what might happen. For example he recommends Echinacea, for cancer, and CTS, and other health problems, but in certain cases Echinacea has been known to cause, liver inflammation, kidney failure, or irregular heart rate. That just one example of many herbs that can be toxic....

This is book that pretty much, I or you can make just by going to the library, and the internet searching for diseases and illness, but somebody who is scholar, and has PhD, should not take the short cut to make easy $$$, and just throw information, without and facts research. IN THE END YOU CAN'T DISTINGUISH THIS BOOK FROM WHAT YOU READ ON THE INTERNET, SO THAN YOU HAVE TO ASK YOU'RE SELF THIS QUESTION? WHY BOTHER BUYING IT.

P.S this absolutely not the "whole encoylopedia" of natural healing, he leaves out a few hundred other major disease/ilness.
