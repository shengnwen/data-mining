This book is very misleading.  First of all, as stated in the other reviews, there are an enormous amount of errors located in the book.  I could see this backfiring on many people who are new to the information as the contradictions and misprints will leave a newbie wondering which idea is correct.  I have taken the CEDIA exam and I can say that not a single question located anywhere in that book was on the exam.  I think the book could be a good overview learning tool if they would have bothered to proof read it before going to print
