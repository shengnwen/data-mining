Stalin despite the flattering summary above was not a great Marxist thinker. Stalin not only missed the basic ideology of Marxism but is also a very poor writer, who's works at best are boring, inacurate and documents of lies. If you want to read a great Marxist writer I would suggest Lenin or Trotsky. Put these works where they belong, in the fire along with Mein Kampf and anything in favour of George Bush
