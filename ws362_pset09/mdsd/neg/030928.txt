Perhaps the author should have also made references to these 'somber' historical facts: 
Israel invaded Egypt in 1956 and made rapid progress across the Sinai Peninsula towards the Canal Zone in less than one week. (There are many literatures that speak of three days.)
Israel defeated four armies in 1967 (third Arab Israeli War) also known as Six Day's war.
The Fourth Arab Israeli War - Yom Kippur War in 1973 - Israel fought a coalition of Arab Nations led by Egypt and Syria and defeated them in ten days.(Despite the political acrimonies that portrayed Sadat (another Lion!!!) 'triumphant').
The Golan Height is still under Israel's flag. (Right!?)
However, why the legend "Lion" has been restricted to Damascus?
Why the book was not entitled "The New Lion of Syria.....???
Can Mr.Lesch give us an explanation?
