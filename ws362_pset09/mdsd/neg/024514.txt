Richard II is most likely Shakespeare's dullest and most obscured play.  Of course, this is only the perspective of a sixteen year old student.  It does seem however to be a common trend among many of the readers.  This was  just one of six required summer readings for my Advance Placement  Literature course, and let me just state that under no other circumstances  would I have read this book.  And to tell you the truth, I didn't read the  book.  I purchased the audio cassette from &quot;Amazon.com."  After  completing the tape for a second time, and only understanding a few words,  I decided to get my hands on the book itself.  The only difference that I  could notice was my ability to distinguish who was saying what.  I do not  recommend this book to anyone without a Ph. D.  Even to all of you literary  geniuses, good luck!  You will certainly need it to stay awake.  I hope I  was able to deliver a delightful and ever so typical sixteen year old's  response
