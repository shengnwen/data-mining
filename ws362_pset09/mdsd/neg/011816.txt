When I read the book description on Amazon ("This atlas offers a balanced and comprehensive visual history of the age-old Arab-Israeli conflict") I had to laugh. First of all, for a "historical" book to describe the Arab-Israeli conflict as "age-old" is ludicrous, and I think, illustrates the kind of "historian" that Gilbert is (that is, not a very good one). This book is not comprehensive, and it is CERTAINLY not balanced. It's clearly Zionist in it's viewpoint and heavily skewed in its presentation
