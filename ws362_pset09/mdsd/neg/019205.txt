I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale. 
Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing
