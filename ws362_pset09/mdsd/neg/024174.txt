Darwin's work is groundbreaking, describing inborn emotional expression, including descriptions of animals as well as man. The book itself gets 4 stars for originality of concept and thoroughness of observation. The editing of the digital version leaves a lot to be desired, and gets 2 stars. No illustrations were included. None--and there is no warning about this anywhere. The pages were longer than the original version, so &quot;footnotes&quot; can be found at the bottom, middle, or top of a page. Some footnotes run into text, so if you're trying to read text and skip footnotes, sometimes it makes no sense whatsoever until you read a footnote, determine where the text actually started, and then re-read it including all the parts. Sometimes parts of sentences are just left out. This approach can work for a work of fiction, but I won't be buying any more &quot;illustrated&quot; or footnoted nonfiction digital books
