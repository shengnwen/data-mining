I belive that the author of this book is blaming society, especially Universities, a little too much.  In the beginning when he makes this assertion that Universites are racist he basis it on the astute obervation  that since there a few African Americans in the Universities that they are  racist or something like that.  Furthmore since the Military has more  African Americans it is a better instiution.  Here is a better explanation.   Universities are a lot more selective and thus can choose from the entire  population.  The Army will take anyone it can get its hands on. I just did  not like the Authors atitutde that the whole is racist. Furthermore he  knows nothing about music.  I love when he writes white soldiers are  listening to more black music and he uses Heavy Metal and Rock n Roll, both  white music!  In fact Heavy Metal is white protest music against Black  music!  Do some research or think before writting a book
