Vague, airy-fairy descriptions of the chakras are combined with a decisive, my-spiritual-path-is-THE-spiritual-path primer on the basics of spirituality.

Do you really want to take spiritual healing advice from someone who projects her own punishment agenda onto the divine (and you!) and glorifies suffering.  Check out Karla McLaren's "Your Aura & Your Chakras."  Like all authors, she has her own issues to work out, but the information is presented in a much clearer, much more neutral fashion
