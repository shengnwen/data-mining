I bought this book for a 12 yr old but decided to read it first before offering it to her. I'm glad I did. No one should read this book. The first line of this book is the reason I bought it but it went downhill from there. The history lesson was in no way applicable to the book. A story of teenagers in the '70's , the book was rife with drug abuse, family abuse, infidelity, brutality and suicide. I have absolutely no positive feelings about this book. I threw it in the trash when I finished with it.I'm frankly surprised that it got good reviews. Were we reading the same book
