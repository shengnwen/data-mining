I was sucked into buying this deck due to the images. As I looked at it, I found it to be less Celtic than Wiccan. The "Lord" and "Lady" cards are just one example of their misinterpretations of Celtic lore. Courtney Davis' Celtic Tarot is far more accurate, allowing for the fact that tarot's an import into the system in the first place
