From the description, we thought this was a book of advice and insights.  Instead, it is a little book of mundane aphorisms, one sentence nuggets of advice of uneven quality.  The book makes a lot of outdated assumptions about gender roles and the nature of fathers and sons and their relationship.  We're disappointed, since there aren't many books on the subject.  We're sorry we purchased it, even at the sale price of $1.50, and now we will just give it away.  Don't waste your money, or your time.
