The book's whole concentration is on subjugating females to males.  It's about all the things females are to do to serve the male sex, particularly the husband.  There is almost nothing about what men or husbands are supposed to do for their wives.

If the material in this book is correct, why would any woman want to get married?  The way husband wife relationships are described in this book is that the relation exists for the benefit of the husband, not the wife.  A woman would be better off single than being in the type of marriage relationship this book describes.

If the material in this book is correct why would any woman want to attend church?  Her only function would be as a servant to lift up the male leaders of the church.  She would be better off spending her time elsewhere where she is permitted to use all her gifts.

This book is the best argument I know for why women should not marry or go to church.
