Let me break it down for you, The book ledges Apricot Seeds contain  chemically locked(inert) amounts of Cyanide. Coincidently, cancer cells contain the magic protein that unlocks the Cyanide, in effect poisoning itself when it comes in contact with B17! It's a Miracle!  

Before you start coveting your neighbors Apricot Tree you must ask yourself; If this were true, don't you think it would be more widely in use today, and all over the news? The Herbal medicine industry would make a ton of money selling this cheap  gold-mine.

This is where the book takes a sharp LEFT turn and tells us that Big Government has falsified documents to hide the truths behind B17 and that is why we must pull the troops out of Iraq.  ;-)   Well, the book doesn't turn that sharp of a LEFT, but you  get the point..... IMHO I believe prayer has more proof of healing than B17.  However if I had Cancer, I'd be one Apricot Seed eating, drinking, snorting, smoking, junky right now. But I WOULD NOT, WOULD NOT, WOULD NOT, stop my Chemotherapy, colonoscopy, or whatever!  Ask your Doctor if taking small doses of B17 as a daily supplement will hurt/hinder any treatments he's prescribing  and go with that. Good luck in finding this stuff at your local Healthfood / Herbal remedy store
