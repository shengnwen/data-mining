There soon will be published a four-page review of this book, by my hand, in the journal 'Vigiliae Christianae'.  What follows here, is the summary of that review : 	Louth's 'Maximus the Confessor' wants to provide an  introduction to the theological thinking of Maximus the Confessor, a goal  the author hopes to achieve by providing translations of some of Maximus'  major theological treatises, especially 'Ambigua ad Thomam' and 'Ambigua ad  Johannem'. 	Although both the editor of the series 'The Early Church  Fathers' and Louth himself stress the necessity of an accessible modern  translation of &quot;key texts by the major Fathers&quot;, Louth's  translation of Maximus leaves a lot to be desired. 	First of all, his  negligent treatment of the original Greek text has been the cause of a  number of annoying mistakes in the translations.  In more than one case,  these mistakes even twist Maximus' theology in a way the Confessor himself  would not have agreed upon. 	It is hard to believe that the author of  this kind of translations has been able to provide such a sound and correct  introduction to them.  However, it goes without saying that the real  sources for further study of Maximus' thinking, i.e., the Confessor's  works, have not become more accessible by this edition.  On the contrary,  the numerous inaccuracies and definite errors in the translations might in  the future result in some strange conclusions about Maximus' theological  thinking
