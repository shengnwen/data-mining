This snide little book purports to be pro-McCartney, while digging up every nasty little rumor and innuendo ever spoken by a "source."

Taking the tone of a knowing insider (we get the drift when he first mentions "Eppy," the Beatles' nickname for Brian Epstein, and used as though the author were "Eppy's" best friend, EWWW), the author unaccountably starts the book in 1980 when Paul was detained in Japan for possessing marijuana. Then it jumps around, meanders, uses lots and lots of slang words (just in case we think Sandford isn't hip) and finally ends with a triumphant attack on Paul's marriage (which was not over when the book was published).

Don't bother.
