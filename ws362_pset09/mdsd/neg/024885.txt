The author basically believes that Satan rules the world with the help of evil angels and demons.  He bases this a bit on scripture, but just as much on the fact that it's the best answer he can think of for why, if there is a good God, bad things happen to good people, or good people do bad things. He's fixated on the question of blame (can't blame God because God is good, can't blame the good Christian because that would be unChristian, ergo we should blame Satan). If you're inclined to blame tragedy and sin on Satan and his minions, this is the book for you.  Otherwise, you probably won't make it through the first 50 pages. 

That said, the author is a good writer and has a lot of powerful anecdotes to illustrate his point.  And his advice is, essentially, to be aware of your own circumstances, desires, and surroundings, and think about the consequences of your choices in light of your faith, which is good (if obvious) advice for anyone.
