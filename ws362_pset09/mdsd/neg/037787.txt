I love all of The Berenstein Bear books. I've been reading them since I've been a kid. I'm now 20 years old and I still read the books. But this one offends me. I love Jan & Stan Berenstain, but why did they have to bring 'God' into the series? I am an atheist, and hearing/reading the word 'God' makes me sick! I'm sick of people being obsessed with all these mythical gods and stuck up in religion! I crave the day that religion and the belief in gods is completely destroyed from people's minds. Bringing 'God' into my favorite children's book series is an absolute disgrace
