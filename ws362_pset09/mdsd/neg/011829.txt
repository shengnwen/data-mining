As an avid collector of David Austin books and roses, I was very displeased with this over priced book. It's pretty much his older books just rehashed with a few more added roses. The quality of the photographs are not very impressive. The book just seems to photograph each rose by itself as opposed to a full bush. I was hoping for a lot better quality for the price I paid for this book.
