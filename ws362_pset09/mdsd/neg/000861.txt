If you have any interest in learning how to use a trend following methodology - or even how trend following really works - you should look elsewhere.  Nothing in this book is applicable beyond a brief chart in the last third that explains support and resistance.  While I do not agree with the position that trend following is dead, overrated, or otherwise worth ignoring, this book most assuredly is worth ignoring.  What little it offers in practical advice can be found in many better, less expensive books on basic technical trading
