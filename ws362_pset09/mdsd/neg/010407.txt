I liked McManus' books "Uprising" and "Chasing Daylight" (formerly titled "Seizing your Divine Moment').  However, for this wanna be Tony Robbins Lite book, the wheels fell off and the car is in the ditch.  Let me save all of you the time of reading his stream of conscious book (that you can read in one night) by giving you the content in a few simple statements:  It's all about me, I am special, I can do anything with Jesus and Religion is bad. That is the book in a nutshell.  You can buy 500 books that have "Soul Cravings" same thoughts and ideas. This book continues the trend in Christian writing today that makes sure people of the faith keep wading in the shallow end of the theology pool and keeps the focus on ourselves. 

I bet you can count on one hand the number of scripture references in this book, which is different than his other writings.  His next effort better have more heft and meaning that will help a person to learn and grow in his or her faith (and knock off the constant Religion is bad mantra), or he has lost a reader who enjoyed his work until now.
