Statistics is supposedly easy right...right!  But who knew that a textbook would go to such lengths to make it harder!

The definitions of all the terms we have to deal with in statistics are written so poorly and write themselves in circles.  Now, my reading comprehension is pretty high, but getting through these chapters is torture!

A word of advise, if you're taking a class using this book, DO NOT RELY ON IT!  Take good notes in class and use this book only as a reference and for assigned work.

ugh
