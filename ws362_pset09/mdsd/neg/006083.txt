I was happy to find this book, having enjoyed Sixteen Pleasures.  That novel was interesting and clever nad the premise was compelling.  Unfortunately Blues Lessons seems very dull, and not just in comparison.  I found the characters unbelievable and unsympathetic.  The protagonist was boring and the way he chose to live his life quite unlikely.  The love of his life was more interesting but the book provided little insight into her motivations for denying that love and for keeping her daughter from having a family.  The daughter seemed incredibly incurious about her father and was not at all a believable teenager.    The purported exploration into race relations was nonexistent.  Overall the book was a great disappointment and tedious to get through
