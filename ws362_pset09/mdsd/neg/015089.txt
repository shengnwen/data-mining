I am quite shocked to see so many good reviews of this book. My son just received this as a gift. It was awful. The use of "dino" in front of almost every term is annoying. The story line isn't that great and the 2 page spread of dinosaurs spewing green vomit larger than the boat is completely gross and not appropriate. I'm pretty open minded, but my toddler really doesn't need a book like this
