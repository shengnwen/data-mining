Although this book has many interesting moments, overall it was quite disturbing.  That the author/wife allowed and enabled Guy's (husband's) suicide makes one question her motives.  Was she so very angry?  Had she so lost her own sense of self?  The deeper family issues are glossed over in part as well.  Two of Guy's sons were also suicides.  Instead of requiring that her husband get help, she allowed him to disintegrate into his own depression and, indeed, she knew quite well when he was going to kill himself.  I don't want to blame the "victim" but I do question the decisions she made
