As a professional/advocate in the field of autism treatment, I am continually disheartened by the large number of false claims made about the causes/treatments of this disorder. This book only adds to that trend.

As of the writing of this review, there are still no definitive data to suggest that autism is caused by environmental toxins or vaccinations (although the author suggests otherwise). While the effects of environmental influences continue to be investigated by competent researchers, it is irresponsible to suggest to parents of children with autism that we already know the cause of this neurological disorder. The only influence/potential cause of autism that has strong evidence to this point is a genetic influence.

Homeopathic treatment of autism? How can the author seriously suggest that such a treatment is advisable? Homeopathic compounds have NEVER been shown to be effective for ANY disorder (autism or otherwise) under controlled conditions (and by that I mean double-blind placebo-controlled studies). Although many persons have reported a benefit of homeopathic rememdies in their own lives, just as many people have reported the same effect when given a placebo. This suggests that homeopathy rests on people's beliefs for its perceived effectiveness.

I typically suggest that people search the "Association for Science in Autism Treatment" on the internet to get a handle on what professionals really know about the causes and effective treatments for autism.
