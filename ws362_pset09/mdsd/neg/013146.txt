I expected this book to have ideas, rituals, projects, etc. to share with your child/children on the traditions of the god and goddess, which it did.  What I didn't expect was the small section on Youth and Maiden Lovemaking, and the irresponsible advice it touted.  Written by a 14-year old (which is surprising enough) who obviously has no idea what he's talking about, it opens with "A lot to being a Pagan is being a good lover.  My attitude is, why not start sooner than later?"  This child is 14!  Our kids are already out there experimenting at early ages, and now we have this boy promoting that?!  Next he talks about STDs - "You may hear about STDs, and the fact is, the *only* way to prevent STDs are condoms and outercourse."  Uh, no...the *only* way to fully prevent an STD is abstinence, but since that is not a realistic way to think, why not say that condoms will *protect* you from STDs, but not always *prevent*, so make sure you use them correctly and responsibly.  And you can't get an STD from "outercourse"?  Really?  I think this kid needs to go back and do his homework on this one.  

It's a shame, because up until this point, this chapter was really beautiful and informative, but by throwing in this drivel it managed to take away from the previous good advice and end this chapter on a negligent and dangerous note.
