The problem with any prison reform movement is the approach from extremes....you either have some moron like the previous reviewer "metaldrummer" who, until HE is a victim of crime, will always rant, rave and whine about how prisoners are being "mistreated" if they don't have silk sheets in their prison suites, and his solution to all this would be to tear down all prison walls to allow everyone to live together happily ever after.  Then, the other extreme (and we'll again use the moron "metaldrummer", but this time AFTER he or his children become victims of senseless, violent crime), and THEN his opinion would be to rebuild all the prisons, lock 'em all up, throw away the keys, and torture them.  

The lesson here....ignore extremist morons, and therefore this book
