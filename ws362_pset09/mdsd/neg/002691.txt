The contents of the book are OK if you already know Java and want to quickly brush up. There is too much assumed to just pick this book up as your first Java certification book. My major complaint is that there are numerous errors in the question and answers and on the CD's practice exam which is the main reason for buying. It is very frustrating to look at a list of answers and feel that none of them are correct or to look for a third when only two are - you find yourself doubting your knowledge and then, doubting the rest of the book's contents
