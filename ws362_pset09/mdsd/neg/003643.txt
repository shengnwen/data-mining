For those of you who love Jack Kirby....Skip this one.  It takes his classic New Gods and deprives the reader of the colorful atmosphere and mood that made the series so special.  Did DC think that new readers would purchase this in black and white?  That color would be too expensive?  I cannot imagine why the suits at DC decided to publish Kirby's work in this format. Wait for the color version
