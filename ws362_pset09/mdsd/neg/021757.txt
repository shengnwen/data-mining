This book is primarily a piece of apologetic literature. It's conclusions are ill supported, illogical, and truly fanciful. Whether you are a Christian or not, and I am, this book is the type of tripe that is infiltrating our culture. This book is not taken seriously by any academic institution because it is simply so flawed and inaccurate.

What has essentially happened is the author, who apparently is a Christian, has started from the premise that Genesis is historically accurate. From this base he then makes connections to various aspects of Greek culture and sculptures. The connections are fanciful and tenous. The example of Noah is a perfect example. The mention of the Global flood another.

What authors like this fellow don't understand is that by writing simple minded books like this he undermines the beauty of our faith AND legitimate scholarship and learning for many. 

I also viewed his letter to Bill Moyers on his website, as if Bill Moyers owes this clown any type of explanation. Mr. Moyes faith is his alone, and if he finds logic in the work of Campbell-as most of the world does- he should not apologize to those not on his intelectual level, or his level of faith
