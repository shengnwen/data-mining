I have both "Five in a Row" (for older kids) and "Before Five in a Row", which is designed for younger kids ages 2-4. While "Five in a Row" is not bad, "Before Five in a Row" is not worth it. Many of the children's books (at least 7 or 8) are out of print and a few are nearly impossible to obtain, even at our public library.  As others have pointed out, the suggested activities are mostly common-sense and rather unimaginative anyway. Also, the "Five in a Row" series has an evangelical Christian focus, which may not be appropriate for everyone.
Some better alternatives for preschool children include "Ready for Reading" by Ashley Bishop and "Peak with Books" by Marjorie Nelsen. These books are non-sectarian and use classic children's books that are more readily available than the titles suggested in "Before Five in a Row.
