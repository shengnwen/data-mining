The only time I buy a book fresh off the shelf is when I travel.  It's sort of a treat for myself.  Normally, I buy all my books used or at a discount online.  The airport bookstore didn't have many books to offer in the trade paperback size.  All the smaller paperbacks available seemed to be by the same three authors and I didn't want to carry a heavy hardback.  I must have bought this book for the lovely picture on the cover as what is in between the covers is mostly air.

It IS refreshing to read a squeaky clean book for a change.  However, I just don't believe there have been people like these since 1925--maybe 1825.  It's dull and trite with ho hum characters.  I liked the parents, but maybe that's because I'm closer to their ages than Macy's.  I like Drag too, but I think he is probably the least real character in the book.  You would think someone my age would like a book like this, but I just didn't really care about anybody.

This book is a lightweight compared with those by Marian Keyes, Isabel Wolff, Jennifer Weiner's first three books and Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books.  Those books have sparks of cleverness.  This one just fizzles.  Then there's the huge world of books above those that have guts AND sparkle.

More of a book for teenagers, but dressed like an adult
