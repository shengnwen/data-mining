This exceedingly short memoir of a Swedish SS volunteer in the last days of the SS Nordland division in 1945 is short on real specifics yet long on multiple condemnations of the Bolshevik hordes. Wallin through Hillblad (the editor), gives little in detail on his unit or men he fought with. This contrasts with his unrepentant and relentless anti-Soviet propaganda which even reaches out to American flyers. Wallin conveniently forgets a couple of facts: (1) Nazi Germany was the aggressor nation in WWII., and (2) Wallin volunteered to fight for this criminal regime. 

Apart from this, the quality of the Wallin's writing or recollection and Hillblads editing is very simplistic. Fictional works like the Forgotten Soldier capture the drama and action of the Eastern Front conflict much better and without the speeches. One star only and that is for the few pages of photos at the end of the book. "Twilight of the Gods" yeah, sure Erik
