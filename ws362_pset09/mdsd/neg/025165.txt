The author spends the entire book describing his highly romanticized time travelling with three "gypsies" he picks up in order to follow "the paths" of their ancestors.  Highly speculative, his theories are so fanciful (think "Foucault's Pendulum" style associations) and without corroboration that, while they may be fascinating and interesting 'what-ifs' for people versed in Rromani studies, I am afraid this book will only spread more misconceptions, spawn unrigorous standards in research undertakings and give an even worse name to 'gadje' ethnographers than they already have made for themselves.  He stereotypes various clans and nations to make them fit into his limited perspective of them (i.e. he wants there to be a natisye of "entertainers," another of "tinkers" etc) so as to concoct a hypothetical story of diaspora.  Unless you've read EVERY other book out there on the subject, skip this one.  If you're looking for a good primer, especially as a 'gadjo', go with Ian Hancock's book "We Are the Romani People."  Sadly, Moreau's journey was much more fun for him to live than it is for us to read
