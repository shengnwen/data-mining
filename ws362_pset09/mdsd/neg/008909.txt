I haven't progressed too far in the book, but so far I've been bothered by a few things.  While it does a good job of presenting you with dialogues and vocab at an appropriate pace, its romanization is inconsistent at best - I've often run into mysterious vowels missing the appropriate marks, making me wonder whether or not they mean to use a different word, and the book reflects a stunning lack of editing and spellchecking, each of which ought to be done especially carefully in a book that's trying to teach a foreign language.  Furthermore, questions and dialogues often include words that have not yet been taught and which are not in the glossary - one can only find them by flipping several pages forward to some other dialogue in which they're actually defined, though there's no way of knowing where this dialogue will be.  Lastly, as other commenters have noted, there's not enough korean script, especially in the answers section.  Given that I can't trust their romanization, it would be nice to see the correct responses actually written in Hangul as well.

On the plus side, for the non-perfectionist, the book is small, portable, and has enough Korean in it that if you just sit down for about 2 hours a week with it, you'll pick up a good deal.
