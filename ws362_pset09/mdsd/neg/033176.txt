A good story with strong characters lures the reader's imagination, inspires excitement and anticipation of what happens next.  This is not one of those stories.  It's not a bad book by any means.  Shining moments appear.  However, Taita is a character hard with which to sympathize.  All the other characters are as translucent as the page held up to a strong light, and the heaped action reaches a point of banality in its lack of specificity.  Did I mention it's predictable?  You should have expected that.

Pick up a Clavell or Jennings instead.  This is Soap Opera history
