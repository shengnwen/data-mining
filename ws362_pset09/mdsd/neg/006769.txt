This book is a big waste of time and money just like many other Maya books. I have bought and read over 5 Maya books geared towards begginers and none of them including this one is helpful. They have many great tutorials, but all the directions are very hard to understand because they leave alot of missing information out. Its like they expect you to really know the software in and out to study their beginner books series.

My advice for begginners is to use a less demanding program. Many people who use Maya are pros and thats not to say you won't be either. But unless you go to school, these books in my opionion are worthless. Even though the tutorials are made by people who have big names in the CGI industry, doesn't mean they have the teaching skills to get us small people going.

I recommend Lightwave, because the book, Inside Lightwave 8 taught me in a breeze how to ge up and running fast
