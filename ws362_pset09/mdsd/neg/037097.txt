The only reason I completed this silly, disappointing novel was because I had just finished all of Welty's remarkable short stories and her flawless novella, "The Optimist's Daughter."  It's as if a completely different author had written this superficial, fatuous novel.  If you desire to read about 20 forgettable people in a seriously inbred family speaking at the same time about the impending wedding of one of their own, then this novel is for you.   The only explanation for this work is that it came very early in Welty's career.  I realize that others have defended this novel as revealing quintessential Southern dialogue and acute psychological tension in the characters.  While the dialogue is clearly of the South, it is senseless, repetitive and tedious, and the characters dash madly in and out of the novel, without making any lasting impression on this reader. Instead, read Welty's short stories and "The Optimist's Daughter" and you will discover a totally different Welty:  one whose fully realized characters and profound psychological insights will leave you with the enduring belief in her genius.
