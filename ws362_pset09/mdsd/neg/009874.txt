My blog's gone flat these days and I was looking to color outside the lines a bit.  Keri's book is great.  The illustrations are fun and the tips are good but it's definitely targeted to women.  I think I'll give it to my daughter when she's a bit older. 

For instance: Under Solitude there is a page on "the Art of Resting" which depicts flannel pj's (I hate pajamas), endless cups of tea (I hate tea), it shows a woman sitting in a yoga position resting (I like to sit and relax just anyway I happen to flop down, I'm a terminally tired parent).  All this stuff could be done by any guy, but the tone is clearly directed at gentle womanly stuff.  Guys (and I've been characterized as overly sensitive) need an occasional aggressive outlet, it's just part of the biochemistry.

Good book, but read more carefully about it if you're male before buying
