This book is so scattered and disjointed.  Topics don't flow, random jumps are made, and the text is written poorly to top it off.  If you're going to get a cell biology book, get Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fourth Edition by Bruce Alberts.  Might be a bit thicker but for the same price you get much better information
