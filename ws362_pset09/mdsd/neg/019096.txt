While Paulos undertakes a very ambitious and intriguing topic in this book, his efforts do not go far at all ... a lot of the material covered in this book was covered in his previous books that dealt solely with  mathematics and his efforts at bridging the analysis of mathematics with  stories is weak at best. He should have put much more emphasis on the craft  of building and reading stories and how that relates to peoples  understandings of probability and statistics. Disappointing
