The author spent his entire life in journalism and not academia and it shows in the book.  The book is written at the 8th grade reading and intellectual level, which accounts for its popularity.  The book is a collection of interesting tidbits about the ancient Greek world that the author collected in his hobby reading.  An analogy would be describing a religious belief system by the sequence of body postures used by the worshippers and ignoring their intellectual beliefs about the spiritual world.  There is a total lack of academic rigor.  The author tells you what to think instead of presenting the evidence and making you think for yourself.  What is worse is the absent material.  The author totally ignores the usually understood reason for the trial being revenge from a high level public official that Socrates frequently publicly ridiculed for being incompetent.  Another journalist aspect is the occasional political propaganda presented.  Watch out for irrelevant and false references to the current world and notice how they are presented as proof by blatant assertion
