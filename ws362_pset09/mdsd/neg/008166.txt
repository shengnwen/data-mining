I am constantly amazed at what can get published.  The plot of this book requires the reader to suspend any sense of logic and rationality.  In fact, the plot is so far-fetched I thought it was a parody.  The characters are not believable at all.  The reader is supposed to believe that Mozart has been re-incarnated as Frankie.  Um right.  And I am the queen of Spain.  This is the first book by the author that I have read and I am not anxious to pick up another one.  I found the plot lines and character developments to be insultingly stupid.  Almost too embarassed to donate this book.  I pray for the trees sacrificed to make this
