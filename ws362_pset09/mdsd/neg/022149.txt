While most of the content of this book is helpful, it is a religious-based book "undercover."  The farther I got in the book, the more I felt that their own religious beliefs were in the way of their professionalism.  My respect for their ability to include all people's freedom of spirituality dwindled with every page.  If this is the kind of book it is, Authors, that's fine, but don't sneak in your own religion without advising your readers
