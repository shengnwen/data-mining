The author slips over this line once too often to rate the book above 2 stars - and that's in a fairly slim book (just under 200 pages).

The forward by backward by forward tale of this couple's ultimate day alive - the details of a past that had them returning to this spot - the nature of animals being their passion and study - and their passion as animals being the authors study - how time moves on and through all of us without paying much notice to us.

However, the author spends a great deal of time examining their lives which really are practically unfulfilled and fairly dull lives to begin with - in deep scientific detail.  What they had for breakfast, what clothes they wore, how much and how little they actually feel for one another at various moments throughout the day - 

But no one ever really wakes up or comes to life - so it comes to matter very little - even to their daughter - whether the couple is alive or dead
