This was the first print book of Sylvia's I read. I had gotten a couple of her lectures-on-tape from the library (as much stand-up comedy as spirituality). In the first one ("Making Contact ...", I believe) she categorically, emphatically stated that one does NOT "see auras" - she goes so far as to suggest that those who claim to do so see an eye doctor. On Page 11 of this book "Francine" spends two paragraphs referring to aura colors, specifically on "cementing" one's aura to green or blue. Contradictory? I think so.
I'll be honest, the more I read of Sylvia, the more skeptical I become.
