I enjoyed the coverage of the Cleveland scene and there is a nice chapter on Suicide, but on balance this book is irritating.  Much of it reads like a wrinkly love letter to Patti Smith, Heylin absolutely loathes British punk and the book ends with a "Postlude" that is both a bilious screed against any and all other writers on punk and also a frank mash note to Smith.  That's hardly writing on "The Birth Of American Punk Rock," as per the subtitle, but rather some kind of personal emotional problem better suited to a therapeutic setting.  See p. 331 for Heylin's sad description of Jon Savage's "England's Dreaming:"  this is just unforgivable.  So:  find a used copy and pick out the interesting bits, ignore the rest
