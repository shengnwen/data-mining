I was very disapointed in this book. However, that disapointment is not necessarily the author's fault, but my own. I wanted to learn something new about Orpheus &amp; Eurydice. Instead, I got a short, padded, overpriced book of average poetry, with no background information or any sort of explanation of the subject. Those who are looking for romantic poetry may get something out of this, but my copy went directly to the recycle box
