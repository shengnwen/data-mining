I'm amazed this book received so many good reviews, the only reason I can see is that the reviewers are all Managers or it's a sign of a skewed process.

Anyway the books own description should give it away "Intended for both business people and technologists".  What are the chances of that being true?  I'd say none.

Basically this is a Managers book with all the consultant doublespeak you'd expect.  It's written from such a high level it will give you nose bleed and makes tons of assumptions that only a Manager would buy into.  If you are a techie and buy this book you will waste your time at best and learn misleading/incorrect info at worse
