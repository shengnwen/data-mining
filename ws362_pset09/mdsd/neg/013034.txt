I wanted to enjoy &quot;To Repel Ghosts&quot; so much. I have seen many of Jean Michel basquiats paintings and drawings. He was as poetic visually as he was when writing his thoughts down. Kevin Youngs book suffers because he seems to want to live through Basquiats words...but that is all that they seem to be is words...without soul!!!
