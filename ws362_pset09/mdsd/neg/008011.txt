This book is as bad as his radio show.  Edell is a pompous fool.  He never met a drug he didn't like. The answer to every problem is a prescription drug.  In addition, he believes people should have the freedom to use non-prescription drugs like marijuana and cocaine.  Yet, we shouldn't have the freedom to use supplements like vitamins and herbs.  He wants the medical industry and the government to take control of those.  He has an inferiority complex because he was never circumcised and was made fun of as a kid because of it.  He rails against circumcision despite overwhelming evidence showing its value.  Edell is the type of guy that gives doctors a bad reputation.  He thinks he knows it all and that people are too ignorant to make decisions about their health
