After hearing Falick on a podcast and hearing the "story behind the book," I picked this up at the local yarn store to leaf through it -- and quickly remembered why I hand't bought it the first five times I'd looked at it.

I find the concept of this book somewhat garbled -- is it a pattern book? If so, there aren't enough interesting patterns to make it worth the investment (most are very dated). Is it a profile book? If so, there really isn't enough in-depth info about either the yarn stores or the store owners to make it entertaining.

The photography, however, is gorgeous. So I've finally categorized this book as a "collectible." If you're looking for knitting patterns, don't bother. But if you want something pretty to set on your coffee table -- or if you own every other knitting book out there and need this one to complete your library -- then go for it. Otherwise, leaf through it at the store, admire the pictures, then put it gently back on the shelf and walk away
