As the story goes:  Leaving his car, a man and his friend walk down a dark lane passing under a street lamp along the way.  Upon arriving at their destination, the man discovers he has lost his keys.  He and his friend  quickly re-trace their steps and the man begins his search under the light  of the lamp.  His friend asks &quot;why do you choose to search under the  lamp, we first walked nearly 200 meters&quot;.  He answers, &quot;you fool,  can't you see we've been provided with light *here* !&quot;.  Even a  scholar or two can be led astray under the influence of purposeful  guidance.  Another reviewer commented, 'Microsoft is obliged to create its  own language'.  As an IS professional with a background in business  management and 20 years experience dealing with this company, I too have  labored with this language - the language of obfuscation.  This book covers  the obvious strengths of Microsoft in Research and Development.  And no one  disputes the talent attracted to this company.  However, time proves the  true direction of travel despite the claimants' insistence of a praisworthy  course.  The accurate reasons for Microsoft's success lie in ruthless,  paranoid management, expert public relations and remarkable skills at  marketing, not innovation or the development of superior products.  History  may well prove Microsoft's legacy as squandering the advantages and  qualities alluded to in this book.  Perhaps the author's would be  well-advised to supplement 'the before' with a reflective 'after' as  appropriate in the future
