I got this book after reading so many great reviews of how it helped people quit. Well, I have no idea how they even got through this waste of paper. At first I thought it was just me, not paying attention to where I left off, but then I saw that some pages were exactly the same, word for word.  How many times can you tell someone smoking is disgusting and you don't need willpower to quit? Apparently many. The repetition in this book made me so angry at the poor quality, I wanted to smoke more. This guy is a joke- He quit smoking through hypnosis and now he thinks he knows all the secrets? Um, no. He is just trying to make money (and apparently its working) off people willing to try any way to quit. 

I almost feel guilty trying to re-sell this book and get some of my money back..
