I have little to add to what's already been said by other reviewers other than I can't believe she seriously holds these views.  I admit that I only read parts of the book while at the bookstore, but no one who is educated, and I presume she is, can really think that evolution is unproven.  You might as well say that the Earth is flat, or square, or whatever.

She writes this drivel because it targets the far-right and gives them what they want.  Apparently this works because she churns out this trash about once a year
