As a second generation Irish-American Catholic, I hoped to find a good story wrapped within the unique Irish-American perspective of life.  However, I was very disappointed for the following reasons:  1) the story was too simplistic (and full of tired cliches), 2) the characters were one-dimensional stereotypes and 3) the main characters (and their family) were claustrophobic in their smug superiority.  I have seen too many families that present just this outward image while hiding a truth that would be more beneficial for all to see the light of day.  Isn't it ironic now that the theme of the distorted family image of the O'Sulivan family is in fact duplicated by the depiction of the Coyne/McGrail clan.

Surely I won't be coming back for a second helping
