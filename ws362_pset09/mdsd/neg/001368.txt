Arthur took a classic and added his own garbage to it.  I started reading it (and getting alot out of it) when I came across some material that just didn't have the ring of truth in it.  I looked in an older copy of Think and Grow Rich and discovered that the parts that I didn't agree with (from a moral and business standpoint) were the lines that Arthur Pell added.  The up-to-date examples were ok, it was the changes to the original core values that I just couldn't tolerate.  Get the original or another version that has high reviews.  I give this version 5 stars for the Napoleon Hill part, -3 stars for Dr. Arthur's input, for a total of 2 stars.  DON'T BUY THIS VERSION OF A TRUE CLASSIC
