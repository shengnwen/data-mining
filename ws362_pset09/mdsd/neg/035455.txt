I confess I bought this for 2 reasons, I treasure my copy of Damon Knight's proto-bio of Fort from the 70's, and wanting to see a contemporary re-examination of Fort's life &amp; work; and the chance to read some new John Keel writing with the foreword.  I had then 2 realizations, Damon Knight's bio still stands as the only legitimate bio on Fort (who is worthy of far better than this mishmash) and a paragraph by Keel is often more insightful than entire books by others.  I'd read Bennett's &quot;Looking for Orthon&quot; and enjoyed it, an adept descriptive travelog of the saucer mania in the 1950's.  But this alleged study of the life, work &amp; ideas on Fort is a travesty.  This book is more about Bennett's fortean awakening, his political education and his various axes he wishes to grind in public.  All in all, it's more about the author and less about Fort.  My conclusion- don't bother.  Get Knight's book through inter-library loan or out of print book services
