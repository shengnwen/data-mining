I bought this expecting to get 101 generic rock licks that I could use while improvising, but that's not what this book is.  It's just a variety of very recignizeable bits and pieces of various songs, some rhythm parts, some solo parts.  I would only recommend this if you're interested in learning three or four bars of a Nirvana song, two or three bars of a Pink Floyd song, etc.  Like, "Impress your friends by knowing the first two bars of Lithium by Nirvana".  You may as well just buy the songbooks for your favorite albums and get the whole songs - it's not like there's any analysis of anything in here.  I can't see any purpose in this book existing except maybe if you're thinking of buying a Fender Cyber-Twin amp, this is a great demonstration of all the sounds that it can produce
