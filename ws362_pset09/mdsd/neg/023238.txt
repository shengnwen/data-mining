The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.

The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other. In the middle of the book somewhere, it all comes together leading to a high-testoterone (but somewhat unbelievable) climax
