This is Mr. Hansens translation of the fourth chapter of the Tao Te Ching.

Guidance pours out but in using it, something is not filled.
Whew! It's like the ancestor of the ten-thousand natural kinds.
Dull its sharp, untie its tie, blend its bright, together its 
diffused particles.
Ooh! it's like it partly endures.
I don't know whose son it is.
It is before the emperor of signs.

Whew! It's like you don't know how to read classic Chinese, Mr. Hansen.  Ooh! It's like your ignorance is pouring out.  I don't know whose son you are, but they wasted a great deal of money on your education. Whew! Ooh!

P.S. 

I would suggest, Mr.Hansen, stop consulting Rick Flair when translating ancient Chinese characters.
