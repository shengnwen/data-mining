I returned the book because after I paid for it, I found something in the information that I hadn't been able to see beforehand in the listing, and it said that the book was paperback.  We did not want paperback, and also had someone contact us who'd had this course before at the school where the class is, and we bought a used hardback Algebra 2 book from them for less than half what we had paid for this one.  The course itself is pretty good
