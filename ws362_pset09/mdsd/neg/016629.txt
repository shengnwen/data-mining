I read this book on the advice of a friend who said it was an american literary masterpiece.  To my surprise I found the book boring and devoid of any value.  Miller spews out a self-absorbed diatribe intermingled with profane and tedious nonsense.  

After a while I thought - why am I wasting precious time on this book? 

There are other far better literary works.
