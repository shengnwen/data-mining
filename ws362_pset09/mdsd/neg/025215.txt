I was disappointed in this book.  I had started getting these books on CD from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few I listened to.  I enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things.  Those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well.  The mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story.  There is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line.  I felt very let down at the end of this audio book
