Book 2 in the 'Monkeewrench' series is, ultimately, disappointing, especially if you're looking for more of Grace and company. Their brief apperances in the book only serve to clue in the otherwise-lost Maagozzi and Rolseth.
"Live Bait" suffers from a very unoriginal premise, and, once again, too many characters. At times, it feels like it was written as a standalone story, then the authors decided to squeeze  in the characters from 'Monkeewrench' to try to strengthen it. Unfortunately, even they can't make this book more memorable. The best parts, once again, are Grace's scenes with Magozzi. There's also a promising hint of things to come in book 3, "Dead Run". With any luck, focusing on Grace and the team,  and getting out of Minneapolis for a little while, will give this series the 'reboot' it needs
