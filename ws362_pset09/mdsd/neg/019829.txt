I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer.  The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel.  I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them
