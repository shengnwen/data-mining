Intelligent Design is, ultimately, an intellectually dead end. This is the large elephant in the living room of Mr. Woodward and Mr. Johnson. What is the practical use of a theory such as this? In what ways does it lead to expanding humankind's knowledge? To simply avoid answering this adds nothing to the &quot;argument&quot; for intelligent design. What great predictions will I.D. give us in the end? I find this history lacking in that it provides no real reason to use I.D. as a productive approach to science
