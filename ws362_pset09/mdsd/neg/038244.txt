I am sorry to say, my expectations for this book were rather high I guess.  There just isn't much content in this book.  The number of illustrations are quite few and rather poorly drawn.  The text is as expected, mostly sarcastic and full of quip and clever rhetoric, however it comes a bit light when the authors attempt to grapple with the technical in describing the various bits.   Was expecting more.  Disappointed.  (the book didn't even talk about the Japanese submarine aircraft carrier, and that project actually did see the light of day
