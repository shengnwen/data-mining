I've enjoyed Stephen Fry's work as an actor and comedian, and looked forward to my first crack at one of his books. But "The Hippopotamus", while loaded with clever lines, completely failed as a novel for me because of the author's intense desire to shock the reader and thus "prove" his superiority. Fry apparently believes he has accomplished this with a plot involving bestiality, but he is unable to sustain the kind of intense focus it would take to really explore the dark world of mental delusion he temporarily assigns to one of his characters, an adolescent boy. By the end (SPOILER coming up; stop reading if you don't want to know), everything has reverted to a happy, sunny world. The boy who suffered the delusions has instantly forgotten them and, even more inexplicably, a complete cipher of a character has agreed to go on a date with the narrator, despite the fact that his idea of attracting a woman is to promise to "lick her like a lolly". Fry really gives away his underlying lack of grit when he equates a liking for McDonald's hamburgers with mental health. (Mickey D's advertising sure works well.) 

It's too bad that Fry's goal of being shocking supersedes his interest in creating believable characters and situations, because he definitely has talent as a writer. His style is engaging and intelligent. I may try one of his other books, but I can't recommend this one
