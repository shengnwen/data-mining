I agree with the other reviewers who panned this book.  I found it misleading and very misguided.

With regard to fasting, it is not a healthy practice and medical proof has shown how fasting adversely affects the entire body and can also adversely affect insulin production.  For those who do want to fast, Shelton's book is much better.  People who fast for dietary purposes may lose weight, but the likelihood of regaining it is great because fasting does not teach nutrition or portion control.  Losing weight involves changing BEHAVIOR in re food, not avoiding it altogether.  That is just a nostrum that really isn't helpful in the long run.

Cott was the Vitamin Guru for an entire generation - many children, some of whom I've known personally were put through the megavitamin routine; hated it; complained that the pills "made them feel like throwing up" and viewed it as punishment.  Many adults would have trouble swallowing horse pills in large dosages and to be subjected to this twice a day seems cruel and unusual.  While the health benefits of vitamins have been proven, unusually high dosages are not a panacea for all problems, behavioral included.  In fact, many times this method backfires big time
