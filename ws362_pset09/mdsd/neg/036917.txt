It is another sign of deterioration in the field of Speech-Language Pathology when the person elected to head the national organization in a time of crisis specializes in a medical procedure, rather than speech and language therapy. The field is in danger of losing even more of its focus and credibility than it already has. Unless SLP's concentrate on the core essentials of slp practice and find and refine treatment methods that have clinical research to back up their efficacy, the future is dim. Branching out into medical methods, as Logemann has done, is irrelevant to the serious needs of slp practice today. That Logemann was elected to head our national organization is a bad sign - not because of any merit or lack of it on her part but because the field seems to have no sense of what direction it should have. In the end, it seems to be a battle among three divisions in our field: those who are simply quacks and who are totally unconcerned with efficacy and who want the field to remain on an intuitive and &quot;artistic/creative&quot; level, those who want to rush into medical procedures that have nothing to do with speech and language problems, and those who want to concentrate on the core essentials of the speech and language disorders which our clients bring to us but who want to junk the quack treatments that discredit the field. What happens in the next few years, and the leadership we are given will determine if the field has a future
