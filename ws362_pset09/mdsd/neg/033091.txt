The author of this book was obviously not applying "emotional intelligence" principles when writing this book.  The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner.  I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible.  It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing?  Just know that to be successful, you HAVE to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive, kind and generally good person to work with. If you don't believe me, save yourself the time/energy and buy the Cliffs notes
