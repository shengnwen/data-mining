I have enjoyed reading the authors book, Power Factor Training and also  their other three books specializing for specific bodyparts using the Power  factor training method. However, this log book is a complete waste of time.  The information about why the power index and other things is repeated in  the beginning and the charts are organized in a haphazard way which makes  me completely useless unless you are someone who hates to make your own  chart and print it out for use, this book could be useful although it might  not pack along well in a gym bag. Who can write in those small charts  anyway, the print would have to be so small.  The authors need to come out  with something more useful than just a log book. Something which advances  the Power Factor training routines and not just repeated information in  every other book. Plus it would be beneficial if they would start updating  their website
