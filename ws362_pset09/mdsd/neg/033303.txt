I wanted to love this book because I think the theory of how stress affects the body is sound. However, I could not love this book because although the books seems to show connection between stress and frailties or illness in the body, it fails to  help us learn how to effect change and find solutions.  It is filled with many discouraging examples of patients with extraordinary problems, but not with success stories, not with stories of achievement, not with stories of people beating these problems, not with solutions that could turn the tables in the favor of the patient. Knowing a problem is one thing, and I believe most of us who purchase this book already believe the connection of stress and disease exists, however, we really need tools and solutions to understand how to change things. It could have been a great book, a best selling book, if that was included. I'm extremely disappointed.
