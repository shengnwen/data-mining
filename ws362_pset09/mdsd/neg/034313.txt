I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much. 
It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather.
I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate.
Dumpster fodder.
