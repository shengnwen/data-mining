Karen Rose became an auto-buy for me after I read her latest, You Can't Hide, then bought I'm Watching You. Those two are the most enjoyable romantic suspense books I've read in a long time. Rose made me enjoy a serial killer story - something that had become passe for me over the last few years. 

I can't give Have You Seen Her the same accolades. First, Steven Thatcher is a wimp, his whining and hanging on to his baggage made him the most unattractive man I've come across in a romance. That he was the hero truly made this book lose a few stars. Special Agent, Neil, deserved the girl, not Thatcher, and Jenna should have stuck to her conclusion that Thatcher would always be suspicious of any man who so much as spoke to her. I just couldn't see how Jenna could have her HEA with a man like that. Each time Steven went into his childish knee-jerk reaction, I was willing Jenna to forget the guy and look at Neil instead.

I was also disappointed over how dumb the police were not to guess who the real killer was. All I can say is that I'm so glad I didn't read this book first when I decided to try Karen Rose. It would have put me off completely and I'd have missed the not-to-be-missed books of the two Reagan brothers
