I enjoyed the first section of the book with a nice historical overview of clocks.  From there it was disappointing.  If you are a complete beginner with no creativity you may find this helpful, but as an intermediate woodworker I felt most of these could be re-created from a simple photo without a need for critical dimensions.  As well, most of these &quot;clock&quot; plans were simple wood sculptures...with a hole for a $10 clock insert. I think there is only one tall clock in the book and one Shaker style wall clock. If you're a complete beginner, take a look.  If you're looking for more ideas to improve your basic or intermediate skills, keep looking
