On the surface, this appears to be a strong case for Clinton.  But as you deeply analyze this book,you will find the arugemnt to support Clinton is very weak.  I saw her on the O'Reilly Factor and he also pointed out what I saw.  The author does nothing to explain: Why does she support the war in Iraq?  What would she do differently from Bush?  What will her standing be on illegal immigration?  Will she actually prosecute illegal immigrants?  What is her standing on health care?  In the words of the author, "The Lucky People get it!"  She has no clue!

The author seems more concerned about trying to promote the first woman President of teh United States rather than knowing the facts.  Now, I am not speaking out against Clinton, but I feel that a book written to support her campagin should do more express what Hillary really stands for.  The author seemed very ignorant of that.  And she shouldn't be if she is to write a book on this subject
