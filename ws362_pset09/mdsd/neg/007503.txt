I read this book while I was pregnant and referenced it after, and though it built up my confidence before I breast fed, it underminded it afterword.  It gives very little advice about those mom's who have major trouble (beyond typical latch on problems) and children who have medical issues that require them to have some formula. The authors persuasive yet one-sided approach made me suspicious of my doctors motives reguarding supplemetation of formula for my child for medical reasons( which thankfully I listened to the doctor in the end). It also gives little help or support to moms going back to work or those who want to be descreate about breast feeding, and does a very good job making you feel guity about any choices that may be contradictory to the authors feelings.  The author is also big on using antidotes, rather then evidence, to support her views.  However,this book does a good job in touting the benefits of breast feeding and giving you lots of information why breast milk is best, but this is information you can obtain in most breastfeedin books. I have been sucessfully nursing now for several months, and I feel that this book did very little to contribute to that. Nursing mothers need good information and support, not propaganda.  Save your money and buy the Dr. Sears book
