I hated this book.  I kept reading, hoping to have that "aha" moment where I finally put all the pieces together... but there was not one.  I did not think there was anything remarkable about Alison, and I never really  liked her.  She was wishy-washy, spineless, and settled way too many times during the story.  I felt so sorry for every character in the book.... except for Alison's friends.. Nola and Jess - who were poorly developed.  I found myself flipping back pages/chapters to see if I'd missed something about these random people.  The middle part of the story dragged on and on.... and then in a matter of one or two chapters.. everything was resolved ... but I still felt unresolved since the resolutions were so weak.
