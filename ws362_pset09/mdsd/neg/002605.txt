I just read this book and it didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know.  I am shocked, however, at the so called  reviewer named Janet.  She must either be Wendy herself or a family member.  Who else would get so angry and disgruntled because someone didn't like Wendy?  Not everyone likes everyone else.  How dare &quot;Janet&quot; call another reader &quot;angry and disguntled&quot; or a prankster just because the reader didn't like Wendy or has a poor opinion of the author.  I, myself, have gone to Wendy and have to agree with the person who thinks Wendy's book is autobiographical.  If &quot;Janet&quot; wants to call me angry and disgruntled or a prankster, I don't really care.  I think Janet is angry and disgruntled personally
