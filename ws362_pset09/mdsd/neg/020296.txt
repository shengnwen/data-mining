I was disappointed with this book simply because it lacked specifics.  It was written in a vague sense of the MLM industry that could be applied to nearly any profession where money is a lure. Rather than being a balanced  review of an industry, it smacks of one's bitter experience with a specific  company. My challenge to the author is to write a guide book on MLM's based  on biblical principles that shows the pros, cons and how to avoid the  pitfalls of the industry
