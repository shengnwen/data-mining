I agree with other reviewers that said the book is not very helpful if you are writing a PCI device driver.  It's full of register definitions and timing diagrams but I never got a feel for how to put it all together.  This book may be useful for hardware designers but it is largely worthless for software engineers.  If you're writing a driver and you want more info, don't waste your money here
