This book makes people want to quit undergraduate chemical engineering at my school.  I'd rather do slave work in a mineshaft than to try to read this dry and abstruse book again!  What a waste of people's lives when professors force their students to try to learn from this book. The subject matter itself should be challenging part and not the presentation.  You know, I think when authors spent too many years using the concepts, they feel like what is obvious to them is good enough for any novice to understand.  I felt like I had to translate heiroglyphics and learn fluid dynamics at the same time.  Of course, I don't mean to be so depressing and leave anyone hanging.  A good book like Fundamentals of Heat&amp;Mass Transfer should be like a day at disneyland compared to this book.  Schaum's outlines can be quite nice too. Good luck
