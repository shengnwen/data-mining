I have been a Betty Grable fan since I was small.  It is odd for a kid today to rather watch old movies than new ones.  I am now in my twenties and interested in bios.  Betty and Ginger Rogers have always been my favorites.  After reading this book, I do not like Betty Grable.  It seems as if the author and Ms. Grable are both very stuck on HER.  She seems VAIN from my understanding of the book.  I could not finish it because the more I read, the more I disliked her, and I want to enjoy her movies.  Ginger Rogers "Ginger: My story" and Ester Williams "Million Dollar Marmaid" autobiographies were much more interesting.  I suggest those over this one any day
