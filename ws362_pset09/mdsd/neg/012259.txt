but I don't. No intaglio press. No letter press. Heck, I don't even have an old washing machine mangle to 'make-do' as a press, which was an authors' recommendation. This book is fine (as far as it goes) into prints you really can make at home i.e. by hand rubbing, but almost all of the chapters include projects that require a press. I was hoping for some innovative ways to do, say, etchings AT HOME and not have to drag my stuff to an art school and pay for press time. If you're so far along as to have invested in a real press in your own home studio, you already know everything that's in this book. If you want a book that's half what it purports to be, you might get a few ideas. Nothing is a total waste -- you might glean something from it that will improve your technique or broaden your experimentation, but don't count on it for prints you can really make AT HOME besides the usual monoprints and reliefs
