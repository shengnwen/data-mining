If nothing else, the slimmer page-count in this volume made it a much quicker read than his previous book "The Soccer Field Is Empty."  The dialogue was still more than a little stilted, and some of the amazing deus ex machinas lead me to roll my eyes.

As with his pervious novel, Mr. Roeder clearly has a great deal of affection for his characters and the idealized world they inhabit.  But with any author attempting to publish his own work, the affection can be a bit of detriment.  

With that said, I do admire Mr. Roeder's chutzpah evidence in creating this world and sticking with it.

Decent book for the beach or an airplane, but not high art
