This isn't a kick a** book like I was hoping.  It isn't a celebration of the single state; it seems more the the author was regretfully resigned to this delightful condition.  Some of the adivce runs like &quot;bla bla until you can find a man&quot; or &quot;it's not your fault you are single, you've tried long and hard to find a man&quot;.  As if we were waiting with baited breath for prince charming.  I guess it's okay for the needy types
