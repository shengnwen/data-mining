I didn't find any information in this book that was particularly enlightening.  Most was basic and there was little useful mention of how these issues manifest in adulthood---or suggestions for change.  The author bounces back and forth from how it affects the child still in the alcoholic home to the adult child.  It would be more beneficial to separate those stages and focus on one or the other.  I found it difficult to apply her information in any useful way
