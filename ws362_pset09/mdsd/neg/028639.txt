I love to hate this book.  Every page was painful and frustrating.  I use examples from his commentary on Biblical texts every so often.  I reference his book as a "what not to do/read" when teaching frequently.  The author dedicates his book to Survivors of the Holocaust and Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse.  Survivors Should Never Read This.  I don't believe God executes Justice on Earth.  If your friend was married to the Abusing God described by this author, you would tell her to run and never look back.  How can anyone responsibly teach this theology?!  How can anyone encourage people to "stay with" an Abusing God?!  If you have to read it, please borrow it from the library.  Don't buy it
