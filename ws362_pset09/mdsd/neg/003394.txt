One day in Villeperce, Tom Ripley is followed by an American teen-aged boy of 16 who calls himself Billy Rollins. He is currently working as a gardener with Madame Jeanne Boutin and claims to have read about Tom Ripley in the newspapers in the States. But Tom soon discovers that the boy is in fact Frank Pierson, the son of an American food magnate from Maine, who detested his father so profoundly that he killed him by pushing his wheelchair over the top of a cliff. Frank's mother Lily sent a private detective to France to look for the missing son...
A weak story line, unbelievable situations, characters who behave in a ridiculous fashion and plenty of clichs about Germany, Berlin and the gay scene are all aspects which contribute to the bad quality of this poorly designed suspense story. Neither "The Boy Who Followed Ripley" nor "Ripley Underground" nor "Ripley Underwater" match the original "The Talented Mr Ripley". Readers would be well advised to enjoy the latter and then forget any novel bearing the name "Ripley".
