Be forwarned, this book merely reprint articles from past (and some may say ancient) issues of Model Railroader magazine.  An expert model-railroader could probably create some of them, however, for a novice this provides little more than ideas for layouts.  Also, many of the plans are for HO and N scale, with very few O scale layouts.  

Overall, I'd say there are better layout books out there for you to spend your money on
