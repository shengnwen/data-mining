I am a commercial artist and have some computer experience, mostly word processing and the internet. I've been waiting to take the plunge into computer graphics for years, and finally overcame my paranoia and bought the software and this book. It was not a good choice. With its black and white photos, dense dry technical-writing style and limited scope, it was very off-putting: a book to reluctantly plow through, not devour. I recommend Paint shop Pro8 Zero to Hero instead. It has great color photos and is project oriented - a good approach for the artist.
