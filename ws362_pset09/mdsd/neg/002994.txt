I've enjoyed Wendy Wasserstein's work, so I expected more from her. I THOUGHT I'd find some real humor.  This little book is boring.  A 300-word article would have been more than enough. It's not funny, not interesting, not entertaining, nor does it offer any real point.  These "books" will probably be the sort of thing you give as a joke birthday/retirement gift, or "collect"  yourself, just to have a "set," thinking they might be "worth something" or "meaningful" someday.  I kept hoping for the book to go from a dwaddle to a trot, but it was the same yawn.  A cursory read, 10 minutes tops, is about all you'll need-- it continues as it begins, so no need to read more than a few pages. I doubt I'd follow-up with the other 6 sins if they lack the depth and wit of this one.
