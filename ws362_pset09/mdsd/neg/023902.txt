I tried to keep an open-minded perspective on the arguments made in this book but they're just outrageous.  Despite the military flexing along the Taiwan Straits in 1996 (from where most of the arguments and extrapolations  in this book are drawn) and the recent verbal jousts during the  Presidential elections where the upsart and pro-independence DPP forged  ahead, China remains to be a superpower to be reckoned and does what any  other superpower would do to edge favorably.  What the writers here have  amassed is far-fetched scenarios and conclusions that makes it a good  science fiction if it weren't terrestial based
