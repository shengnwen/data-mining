I used this book in high school for a photography class. When I saw that it had been revised and updated, I bought a copy online to check out for offering at a seminar I would be doing. I couldn't have been more disappointed. To me, revised and updated means improving. This has the same old 70s (60s?) photos, and I am not sure a word in the book has changed. There is just more to it than this - basic photography is no longer only analog. Equipment has changed. This book does not reflect those changes. I subsequently returned my copy
