As a college graduate with a degree in economics i bought this book with gusto and enthusiasm.  It was a sad mistake because I felt let down by the quality of the writing.  Soros explains that he is an expert on the subject and able-minded to write such a book because he has sympathy for the future of the world.  I believe that is his only qualification in that this book lacks any reason behind the statements.  Soros makes blatant remarks about US and World institutions without ever providing an example to back it.  I was mostly interested in his SDR's topic but then found that he glazed over it and never fully explained what he expects them to help.  Quite disappointing.  He lacks basic essay writing skills although I am sure some of his other books are up to the standard
