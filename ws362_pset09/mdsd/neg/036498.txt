Although written in a conversational style that is easy to follow, the book is filled with inaccuracies concerning the novels for which it purports to serve as an explanation.  I am best acquainted with Jane Austen's works, and read with surprise and then horror as the author put words into the mouths of incorrect characters.  I am no historian and thus cannot independently verify the accuracy of the substantive part of the book (the explanations of customs and such), but the author's sloppiness in researching the novels about which she is writing makes me doubtful about the other aspects of her performance.  A huge disappointment
