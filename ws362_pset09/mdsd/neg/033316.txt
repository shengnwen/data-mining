This book is nice reading if you already know what the gun trade is about, but it gives only minimal information on the actual construction of firearms. Too much talk and crude drawings do not really promote this publication. If you're after a nuts-and-bolts handbook for firearms construction, don't buy this one, but start off with something simple. P.T.Luty's book would be a useful alternative
