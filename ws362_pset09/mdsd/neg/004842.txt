This book is ridiculously myopic and ignorant at best, extremely racist at worst.  

If you are intelligent enough to realize that word "racism" applies to all races, then you don't need this book.  If, however, you think that the only people who are racist are whites, make sure you pick this book up to for your propaganda horse-blinders.

Simply because the book is well written does not make it true.  If the author states something as fact, don't buy into it.  If the author cites a source, check out the source; it will be, without a doubt, written by someone who shares the exact same mendacious views (Who's parroting now?).  Citing a source that is without any genuinely academic purpose does not create a strong foundation for supporting an already weak hypothesis.  Even the author, within the first 10 pages, admits that what she is trying to prove is "invisible", and therefore that much more insidious.  In other words, the department of "I just pulled these stats, findings, thoughts, citations, and facts out of my rear" is alive and well within this book.  

If you read this book with an open-mind, and you haven't already been tainted by one side or the other, you'll see more hypocrisy in this book than a book titled "Why I Love and Practice Democracy" written by Joseph Stalin.  Within the first two chapters you'll find yourself wanting to debate the author, calling her out on her BS, and asking her why there aren't inter-connected footnotes that chronicle her contradictions.

If I could give it zero stars, I would.  The book does nothing but stoke the coals of racial tensions, persuading those who believe in "The Man" and "The System" to dig in their heels with their misguided and misinformed positions
