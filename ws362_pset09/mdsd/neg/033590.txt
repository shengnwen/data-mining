This is such a short and unsubstantial book- do not bother buying it. Go to your local book store or library, buy the coffee drink of your choice. You can read this in 1 1/2 hours. As others have said, it is written to the 5th grade level. As for the method shown in the book and the website, I would never use only a single simple tool alone. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. If you want to read a REAL book about this topic, read books by James O'Shaughnessy or by William O'Neil.
