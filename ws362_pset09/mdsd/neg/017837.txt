I read this book as part of a Contemporary World Literature course I took in college, and I thought it was the worst book I have ever read.  The book is supposed to be about a white woman in South Africa whose father is in prison because of his anti-apartheid views.  The strange thing is I learned NOTHING about South Africa, living conditions for whites and blacks in South Africa, and the effect that apartheid had on people in living in South Africa.  This book was written in a hoity-toity, avant garde, stream of conciousness fashion that it was impossible to know what was going on.  I found myself counting the number of pages until I finished the book.  The author of this book should seriously consider writing a book that is coherent, informs people, and broadens their horizon of knowledge, which this book certainly does NOT do
