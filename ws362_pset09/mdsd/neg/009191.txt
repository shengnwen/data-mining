I found most of the information in Smith's book to be outdated and no longer useful.  A much better choice is &quot;Guide to Careers in Federal Law Enforcement,&quot; by Thomas H. Ackerman, which is by far the best book  ever written on the subject.  Also, a good resource for background  information is &quot;Handbook of Federal Police and Investigative  Agencies,&quot; by Donald A. Torres
