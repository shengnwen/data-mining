Despite the pedigree and the weel thought out ideas of this book, most of solutions are either pie-in-the-sky or they are simply wrong.  First of all the setting is correct, America is the only super power and the world is threatened by terrorism and AIDs and gloibalizaiton is something that exists.  The prescription in this book is for America to 'lead' by cooperating and to 'fight poverty' and do lots of other do-gooder things in order to make others happy about globalization, perhaps 'solve' the AIDS problem and 'contain' dictators like Saddam.   We know from the thesis of "The Pentagons New Map" that the world is already divided into two spheres, one that 'works' and one that is disfunctional.  According to Huntingon the world is divided into 'civlizations'  This book only adds to these not mutually exclusive ideas by claiming that peaceful solutions can be found to problems and that America can use its influence, economic and political, to make others agree.

First of all, America is the new empire.  Cooperation doesnt work.  First of all, most of Europe positions itself as being 'anti-america'.  Second, Americas true ally, India, has gets little attention here.  The author, of course, denies that the main source of the worlds problems are found in that long belt that includes North Africa, the Middle East and Cnetral Asia, namely Muslim nations and those that border them.  The Democracy problem was solved  in South America, it yearns to be solved in the Middle East however this book provides no clear solutions.  Cooperation couldnt stop the Rwandan genoicde and it will do nothing to stop AIDS so long as African cultures deny it sexists, therefore cooperation is a dead letter.  America, unfortunatly, must go it alone, and those who choose to follow will be rich and happy, those who dont will be poor and undemocratic.  

Besides its only a matter of time before the world ceases to be unipolar.
