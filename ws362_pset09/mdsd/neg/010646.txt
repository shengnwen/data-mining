If you are seeking recipes and information about an array of spices, and herbs, you will find this selection too narrow. There are a handful of European-style recipes that feature Mediterranean herbs, but most are fundamentally Asian. South America, Native North America, and many other cuisines full of exciting flavors are entirely unrepresented. You will, however, find numerous recipes containing ginger, as well as the key spices in Indian curries. 

The health claims presented by a series of enthusiasts are a rehash of what is now common knowledge among most of us who have been paying attention to nutrition news over the last decade. Claims are unsubstantiated and, even if substantiated elsewhere, are mixed with those for which claims have been entirely inconclusive, at best. 

If you really need a new recipe for ginger cookies or rhubarb-berry crisp, or maybe Asian-style bbq ribs, this is the book for you. Or perhaps if you are rather new to healthful Eastern cuisine, this is a nice introduction
