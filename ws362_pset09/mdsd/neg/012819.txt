I bought this book because it was required (a textbook for a class I was taking).  Because it was a college-level class, I was expecting a college-level textbook.  That's not what it is at all.  The book is filled with color illustrations that aren't even very helpful.  I was hoping for more reading and explanation of terms.  Illustrations are great if they are used right -- to compliment the text instead of replace it.  I wouldn't recommend this book for someone who is serious about learning the ins and outs of networking
