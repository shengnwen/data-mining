I read this and am reminded of 1984. The tortured arrival at a non offensive language, suggestions for such to writers, is repulsive.

This is intellectual vandalism. Works of literature are not vehicles for consciousness raising unless that is the subject.

Something about this makes me wonder if the writer has gotten on a narrow path, obsessive in nature, and cannot simply do her job
