This book is a coffee table book. The pictures are nice, but it does not give any new or valuable information regarding garden design (no reference to styles or history whatsoever). It is not a book for porfessionals. I only gave it the 2 stars because the cover and pictures are pretty. If you are seriously interested in design, don't buy this book.
