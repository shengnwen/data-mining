I really enjoy watching Tyler Florence on the Food Network, and the other recipes of his that I've tried from the Food Network website have turned out well. However, I've just finished making the Arroz con Pollo recipe in this book, and I'm so annoyed that I had to write. The cookbook really could've used more careful editing. The rice to liquid ratio was so off that the rice ended up a gloppy mess. I know I shouldn't have followed the recipe blindly, since if I had stopped to think about it for a second, I would've realized that there was no way that the proportions were correct, especially when compared with the Arroz con Pollo recipe on Epicurious.com. What's even more frustrating is that the flavors of the dish were excellent, and the dish had the potential to be outstanding. Thus, I'm wary of trying another recipe in the book, but if I do, I'll be a lot less blindly trusting
