Did I miss something?  I used to read JG for the romance, the sweetness and the chemistry between her characters.  I like mystery novels too, but JG just doesn't "have it".  I miss her historicals and the way Heartbreaker and Mercy were written.  Please go back to those!  Also, please put us out of our misery and right Noah Clayborne's story...then go back to historicals
