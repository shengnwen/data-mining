Pretty poorly written, repetitive, confusing, seems slightly bootlegged and almost too contrived.  The author is too deeply rooted in orthodox Christianity in order to even make a run for the alternative.  I love the subject matter though - that's why I bought this book.  I am slightly disappointed to say the least.
