First, the good news: 
1. I lost 8 pounds in two weeks on this diet, even with the occasional skim latte and granola bar. 
2. Following it wasn't logistically impossible, as some have complained. Even as very busy grad students, my roommate and I were able to stick to it by making meals in advance and marking off on a daily list the things we were supposed to eat or drink throughout the day. 
3. I really liked the cranberry water, and still make it when cranberries are in season. I'm not much of a water drinker, but enjoy guzzling the cranberry water, so it helps me stay hydrated and cleansed. 
Now the bad news:
1. I gained back all 8 pounds and more within the weeks following the diet, even though I eat little junk food.
2. No noticable reduction in cellulite while I was on the plan.
3. I frequently felt hungry or experienced cravings (hence the skim lattes and granola bars mentioned above). I was having fantasies of buying a loaf of crusty bread at my favorite bakery and tearing into it the minute I got into my car. Definitely not a good sign.
4. As with all diets, food and body became an obsession.
Finally, two things that made this experience somewhat worthwhile:
1. I learned about cranberry water.
2. It brought me a step closer to leaving the insane world of dieting. That was three years ago. I'm not and don't ever expect to be a size 8 like I wanted at that time, but I have no regrets.
