A CROSS WITHOUT HELL IS A CONTRADICTION: READ THE APOSTLE'S CREED.

I fully agree with the UNPOPULAR reviewer "Andy Grey" who gave it one star.  It is impossible for annihilationist to comprehend sin and the law of God both of which are linked to the doctrine of hell.  They annihlate the law and sin with hell.  The endorsers deny Anselms teaching of the infintie debt and Why God Became Man.

Instead buy the book "Eternal Christianity" by Jim Cronfel to read all of the quotes from this book if the denials of sin and the law and the atonement and justification.


PATRIPASSIANISM IN THIS BOOK:

"There is no question now of the Father inflicting punishment on the Son or of the Son intervening on our behalf with the Father, for it is the Father himself who takes the initiative in his love, bears the penalty of sin himself, and so dies." p 152

DENIAL OF ETERNAL SIN BEARING:

"God in Christ bore our sins and died our death because of his love and justice, we must not think of it as expressing eternal sin-bearing in the heart of God. What Scripture does give us warrant to say, however, is that God's eternal holy love, which was uniquely exhibited in the sacrifice on the cross, continues to suffer with us in every situation in which it is called forth." p 329 - 330


DENIAL OF PARDON BY ATONEMENT:

"Nor, as we have seen, has Christ by his sacrifice prevailed upon God to pardon us." p 173

Andy Grey is currently running 3 for 44 helpful votes.  Goes to show that the truth is sparce and the path is narrow.  I ask: do the "unhelpful" voters deny sin themselves? are they saved? or are they in it for popularity
