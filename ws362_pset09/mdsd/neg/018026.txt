Yes, I bought this book with the hope of increasing my hope regarding writing. 
 
 First, I was first disappointed by the style of the author. The text rambled with anecdotes, that began to repeat themselves so insidiously by the middle of the book gave up and went to the last four chapters hoping there would be some more helpful and encouraging matter. Unfortunately, those chapters read like the earlier ones. 
 
 Second, I was surprised to find ninety-percent of the text were anecdotes strung together about horrible trials of famous and not-so-famous authors. The anecdotes are depressing, not hopeful. Quite honestly, reading about hundreds of authors, each of who sounded like Job in their trials, was depressing. Given I wouldn't fancy myself as a future Grisham or Rowling or whatever, reading awful stories about how they almost didn't make it don't inspire hope. 
 
 Books I have enjoyed much more include Zinsser &quot;On Writing Well,&quot; which melds interesting stories with great writing and instruction; Stephen King's combination autobiography and how to, &quot;On Writing&quot;; and of course, keeping track of the guest columns in the New York Times on writing..
