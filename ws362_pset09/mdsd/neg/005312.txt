I have all of Nicholas Sparks novels, and I can honestly say that this one left much to be desired.  I have also raved about Nicholas Sparks' works to everyone; however, I don't have much to rave about this time.  The book was too predictable; although I have often figured out other story lines written by Sparks, but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had.  I am disappointed in the book and hope to see that Nicholas Sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines.  Hopefully he can find time (outside of coaching track) to write another wonderful novel such as The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding, and the list goes on (but stops at Dear John)
