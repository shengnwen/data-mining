I picked this book up because I was intrigued by the title.  Unfortunately, it only took me seconds to see that the author had a very specific ideology that was ignoring other psychological and historical viewpoints.   For example, the author points out that &quot;adults are on time&quot; and that being late is an &quot;act of passive aggressiveness.&quot;  While this can be true many times, it is certainly not true all the time.  Anyone who knows the Jungian based Myers-Briggs personality test will know that &quot;perceivers&quot; are notoriously late because they get easily distracted while &quot;judgers&quot; are frequently early for every appointment.  But in the author's world, only the &quot;J&quot; personality type is &quot;mature.&quot;  Another statement the author makes, on the very same page, is that being adult means &quot;raising your own children.&quot;  Sounds fair on its face.  However, it ignores historical and economic facts.  The nuclear family of two parents and children is a 20th century creation.  In the past, societies had extended families that were heavily involved in the rearing of the children while parents worked.  This is still true in many societies even today.  So how does this become a definition of maturity across the board?  I don't get it.  Obviously, people shouldn't just have children willy-nilly and ignore their needs.  But the author's perspective is pretty much B&amp;W.  Their is no gray.  (IMO, this is in itself a statement of immaturity.)  The whole thing just smacks of a certain political mindset.  My advice: Take the Myers-Briggs test, find out what you are, figure out what parts of your personality need some work.  This is a far better solution than having this author spoon feed you her personal views
