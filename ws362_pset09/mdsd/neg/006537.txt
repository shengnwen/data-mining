I paid for a book, and what I got was a short article with a lot of old-fashioned black and white pictures.  I expected a lot more substance and a lot more material.  I finished the "book" in 15 minutes, and will give it to a friend.  This is like one of those little gift items you find at the Hallmark store -- not a "real" book.  What is there is wonderful, but if you pay full price expect to be disappointed
