I bought this book because I thought I'd relate with the author's choice of the title "The Best Little Boy in the World".  It took me less than fifty pages to realize that this was one of the worst books I've ever read.  I can imagine that this book probably made a lot of difference when it was written, but today, I like to think we've progressed beyond the self-loathing, hatred of our own nature, and belittling of anyone that isn't like us to make this book less relevant for today.  If I was recommending a book to a teenager to help them with their coming out process, I definitely would not recommend this book.  I mean, come on, coming out is traumatic enough as it is, why would I want to make it worse by suggesting they read a book that will only put them down and make them feel worse about themselves?
