You could say that I "know" Dick Cheney. So, you can imagine my surprise when I read all the way through the book and didn't so much as pick up a single word about Cheney's purported 'crotchal afflictions'. Most independent researchers would have know about Cheney's purported triad of herpes, crabs, and friction blisters that chronically plague his loins. Other than that, the book was good, I recommened it!

P.S. the devil lives in herpe blisters, so wash them with holy water and then soak in communal wine.
