I agree with the other reviewer.  The bible verses often do not seem to fit the story or they aren't appropriate for the age group.  Often, my daughter (age 8) would "get" the intent of the devotion, but would then be confused by the "scripture answer" in the back of the book.  I also find it tedious to keep flipping to the back for the answers.   However, it IS a great conversation starter
