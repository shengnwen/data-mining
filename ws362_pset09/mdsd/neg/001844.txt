about as helpful, intelligent and/or reliable as a ham sandwich, this book is one man's bitter tirade against an administration who decided he needn't work for them.  the ambition and reasoning for writing the book is solely for the money coming in for book sales - do not believe it was any sort of civic duty.

the book grounded up Aldrich's reliability and outright respectability.  he is no more than a whiner and opportunist with this book
