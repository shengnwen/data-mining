I have enjoyed previous financial books by Mr. Stein and his television appearances on financial programs as well as his appearance on Seinfeld.  Mr. Stein seems insightful, knowledgeable and personable.  However his self help book that I am reviewing now I found to be shallow in depth.  One cannot find happiness by deciding what you want  and obtaining it for the same reason a child only finds temporary pleasure in a new toy until he/she gets bored with it. Finding fulfillment in life is more complex and more meaningful than this book discusses.   I would probably be for Mr. Stein sticking to finance and comedy; self help is not his talent in the opinion of this reviwer
