Although Anne made some excellent points, it was still one-sided. She still speaks of Republicans in general as being better which is wrong because many of them are just as hypocritical as Democrats (and some are worse because they know what God commands but don't actually care), and although she gives some explanations as to why Republicans are the better party, they are deceptive and wrong.

For example that Republicans are better because they promote Chrisitianity and are specific in their arguments: yes, that is true in some ways, however many promote false Christianity and make it look bad because many of them are not truly Christians but putting up a show. That needs to be said otherwise people get the impression often that all Christians are hypocrites and that it's all about financial gain or vain glory. And merely having a specific argument doesn't make an argument better. For example I can say, "Democrats are out to get your kids and the poor because they want to raise taxes on the poor and give tax cuts to the rich and want to force children to learn white wash" but so called Republicans like George Bush want to do that too and have done that.

I would like to say that this is a good book to give to a young girl, because it shows you can still be fememine, wise, and a Christian, and yet not be a fool or knowledgeable and emotionally immature (in other words a nerd), but it has too many big errors.

It's helpful howewver for everyone in general who wants to know what is wrong with some type of arguing and how to argue constructively. Although she doesn't give a thorough explanation on that subject, it's very good and concise. And I just happened to be comforted by her words because the day before had been attacked with vagueries by a pastor from an AOG church
