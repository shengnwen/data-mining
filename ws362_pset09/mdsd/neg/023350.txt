The reviews by BookwormJDC and P.Murray are on target.  They give some excellent examples from the book.

Let me help answer the question that I always want to get out of these reviews: "Should I read this book?"

If you are going to a dinner party hosted by Al Franken or Michael Moore, or need to win favor, respect or envy from anyone on the far left, get this book.  Everything that is wrong with America, Capitalism and Free Trade is explained in charts, cartoons and talking points.  You will look like a genius as you expound on the ills of the world over a glass of California wine.

It reads like a college term paper (Doesn't rise anywhere near the level of thesis.).  There are a plethora of facts, all of which support the theme.  It's easy to read and the authors do a good job of staying on point.  If you have a term paper due, get this book.  Don't plagiarize it, just look at the technique and style.  

Here's where I think the term papers get separated from the theses.  In a well-written term paper you can get away with presenting a problem and gloss over the solution.  I like the term reviewer BookWormJDC used to describe the treatment of solutions offered to address the litany of injustices described in the book, "ill-considered".   Simply put, their solutions would not stand up to the same level of scrutiny expended on the problems.

Most of the issues raised are nothing new, but they are well documented and presented. What I found more excruciatingly tedious with each successive chapter was the lack of anything positive in the book.  Ok, I get it. There is greed, oppression and injustice in the world, now what? Anytime they felt compelled to site anything positive, it was snuffed out by starting the sentence with "Although" and finishing up with what's wrong with it!  

If you want to participate in the global economy, either for the evil corporations, or the oppressed peoples of the world, there is really nothing to help you in this book
