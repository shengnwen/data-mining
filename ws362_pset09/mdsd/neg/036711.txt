The first Dr. Sears book I read was &quot;The Baby Book&quot;, which I found helpful and somewhat insightful as many other parents that are gentle in raising their children. But I became very turned off by this book and the entire Dr. Sears following that has thousands of parents looking to him as the guru of child care. This book, like all the others in the &quot;Sears library&quot; of books is a carbon copy of his other books and reiterates the same beliefs. He uses this book as a medium to promote his attachment parenting beliefs and uses the title &quot;the successful child&quot; to make parents believe that his parenting beliefs are the rule rather than the exception. Yes, I know that Dr. Sears has eight kids and is a well renowned pediatrician, but that doesn't make him the authority on parenting and child development and other issues that he has written books on including family nutrition, pregnancy, and childbirth, and to suggest so would make his books utterly self-congratulatory other than proven techniques that work across the board. I hope the parents of his patients don't feel that they have to conform to his beliefs in terms of how they choose to raise their children. It is good to take what is useful to you as a parent from various sources such as this book; but I refuse to see Dr. Sears as an authority on my child's development and on my role as a parent just because he has written dozens of books that are regurgitations of each other. As a parent, you must learn to think for yourself as well as seek out information from other sources
