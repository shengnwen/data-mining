I love to read plays and performed in many. I was so curious about this play-the book was in excellent condition-got it in time. No complaints there. I read the play and thought it was the worst play. IT's not "cutting edge" just dark and morbid. I know we want to go beyond the line but this was just dumb. I would never direct this play and I am directing in Chicago..but to each is own-if you liked it that's what makes the world go round..enjo
