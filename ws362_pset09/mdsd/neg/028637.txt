This book has interesting monologues to read; but as far as using it to find audition material. . .forget it.  It is not clearly organized.  I like monologue books that are divided into serious, comedic, etc, so I can go straight to the type of monologue I want.  But this book is full of monologues with obscure chapter headings that make absolutely no sense.  This is not a resourceful book. . .I would use it only for entertainment purposes, but then again, if I time for that, I'd rather read the entire play, rather than an excerpt
