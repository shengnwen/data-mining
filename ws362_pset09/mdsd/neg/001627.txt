Robert Putnam's book bemoans the declne in "civic participation" among Americans since its heyday in the 50's and 60's.  Although few would argue that bridge clubs aren't what they used to be, who would have predicted the rise of 20,000 member mega-churches back in 1962?  This underlines the basic problem with this book: it focuses too much on what constituted "communities" and "activities" in the past, without looking at how people form new and different kinds of communities today.  While I agree that television has dramatically increased the couch potato index, and participation in traditional FORMAL organizations has declined, I would argue that membership and participation in new kinds of groups that are more relevant to people in the 21st century has risen.  For example, while young people famously are less likely to vote in our dual-party system, college students today volunteer more that any generation before them.  In addition, while participation in mainline Protestant churches has stedily declined, engagement in evangelical churches has risen dramatically.  While I personally feel that the sterile suburban, drive-everywhere-in-my-SUV existance is soul crushing, and the popularity of reality TV may be a sign of the apocolypse, I also don't pine for the days where mom was expected to stay home with the kids and go to the bridge club once a week, while dad worked 9-5, returned home to supper, and went to the Men's Club on Tuesdays at 8.  And while Putnam's basic premise may resonate with many, its fetishization of days past blunts the strength of his overall argument
