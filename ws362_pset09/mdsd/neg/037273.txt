the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid
