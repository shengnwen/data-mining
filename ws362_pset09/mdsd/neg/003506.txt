I am sure the story of Rama is a beautiful one that is full of rich historical context.  Unfortunately this book does not really capture it.  One can really sense the author struggling with the translation as some passages sound like they were written by a child.  I did find some parts of the book very quotable and for that reason I gave it two stars
