You must know by now, the prize for determining longitude at sea prior to satalites, etc.
A race between the sextant types (astronomy) and the creation of a clock that does not lose time at sea(now available at all malls).
If your interest lies with navigation, as does mine, this isn't your book.  If your interest lies in the historic quest for the perfect clock, even though the author doesn't really go into why and how this clock is such so superior to others (ie the engineering), then this book is for you
