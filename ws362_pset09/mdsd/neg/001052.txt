In a time of heady progress in biochemistry and pharmacology, along comes a clinician to tell us once again that addiction is a state of mind that can be cured by correcting skewed thought patterns. In fact, the neuroplasticity of the brain responds to addictive drugs by altering the function of existing neuropathways. Addicted people are different from normal people by virtue of dysfunctions along the serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine &quot;pleasure pathways.&quot; The attitudes expressed in this book are at least 15 years out of date, and likely to be of limited use to anyone attempting to free themselves from addiction.
