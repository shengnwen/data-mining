This was the worst Ellis book ever written. It was boring, arrogant and a complete waste of time. I bought the book for my vacation where i can read anything and I forced myself to read it... assuming it would get better, which it never did.

If Ellis really cashed in his chips and moved to the 'burbs, well, he completely lost his edge. 

If your shopping for a read, buy something from McInerney who can still write without the drugs
