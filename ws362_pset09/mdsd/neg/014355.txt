   The fact is that Hollywood has become little more then a Gossip new town with magazines like variety and web-sites like Ain't It Cool and DARk Horizons putting out tons and tons of both electronic and newsprint propoganda that is as fake as anything we saw the superpowers do during the  Cold War.    This book seems to celebrate it, but it's eally sad, All three movies listed on the 2003 summer weekend were large on visual effects or glamor, but weak scripts and even weaker casting of people who can not act.   How anyone can see this as a good thing is beyound all rational thought to me, or good taste
