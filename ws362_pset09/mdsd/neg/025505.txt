And wasn't it awful. Slow, nonsensical, not to mention boring....

Basically, it's about a poor guy who finds a black pearl. And then bad stuff happens. That is all the book is about. No sub-plot, no nothing. To be honest, the best bit was when the main character's baby gets shot and dies.

The book (about 70 pages long, to be honest I can't remember. I don't want to remember) is really slow to start with, and stays that way until the last 10 pages where a million things happen at once. It is way too descriptive, and nothing remotely interesting happens. And then it just ends. It was really empty.

I have read other "Classics" such as War of the Worlds, Animal Farm, Lord Of The Flies, etc, all of which had more substance and staying power than this.
