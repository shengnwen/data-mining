I admire Ishiguro for writing a risk-taking book, most unlike any I have read befire.  Unfortunately, this novel fails in its objectives, except for itself being a unique piece of fiction.

The protagonist is an english detective, who appears to be completely delusional about his current circumstances, and who is willing to take these delusions to great lengths.  Because of this, the plot eventually becomes irrelevant to reality.  This is when the book shows its signs of brilliance, when the plot is recognized as meaningless and the major themes take over in a Chinese battle.  

Unfortunately this brilliant culmination hardly makes up for the rest of the novel.  Besides the poor/meaningless plot, the novel does not have a single character the reader cares about.  The thematic sequence, during which the book finally seems to be about something, is all too fleeting.  Soon after the plot returns even more absurd than before.  It's a truly frustrating experience
