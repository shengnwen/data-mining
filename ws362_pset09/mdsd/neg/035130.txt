Decent starting point for cooking-impaired college students if they don't mind eating eggs and potatoes often.  A little more variation in the recipes would be nice as well as some pointers on how to substitute ingredients and an explanation on why some ingredients do (What is the purpose of using cornstarch?  I know, some of it is common sense, but heyyyyyyy.... I'm a stupid college student). For example, for one recipe for frying chicken, I used pork and it tasted fine.   

Also, some of the recipes don't really work.  Baking chicken drumsticks at 375 degrees in the oven for 40 minutes is not enough for thoroughly cooked chicken.   

On the upside, the cooking tips were really helpful.  The book could use more of those, like be aware that if you heat oil, it pops and it could land on your face or burn your arm.

Overall, this book provides some ideas, but I wouldn't rely on it too much.  Not really worth the purchase.  Flip through it in the bookstore like I did and save some bucks for uhhh.... buying food. =
