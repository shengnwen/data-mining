This had a great summary to look forward to. It didnt deliver one bit, I was really creeped out that this stupid lady would take her child back to the place where she was violently raped and beaten just to get revenge. This is a case of ultra neo feminism where your pride takes precident over your childs well being. Skip this book and take your kids out to a park instea
