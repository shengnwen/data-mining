This book was a very interesting book but for me it was extremely long.  I had a lot of work to do and therefore it took me a very long time to read.  I can see why some people may like this story but it has too many sub plots and too many pages.  If you have a long time to read a story and you have a thing for Russian history or war in general than you will probably enjoy this story.  It is one book that should probably read before you die but don't read it in high school.  Just a suggestion
