I bought this book along with "Hegemony or Survival" after Venezuela's Hugo Chavez held it up in the UN. I had not even heard of Chomsky before then. After reading more about the controversial Chomsky on the Internet, I canceled "Hegemony or Survival" and decided to keep "What Uncle Sam Really Wants" (a shorter read) to get a better feel for Chomsky's work before I spend more money on it.

After what I read on the Internet, I started reading this book with caution. To be fair, I have to admit that I never completed it... for a reason...

I don't like many of the things that the US government does abroad. I think we stick our noses in too many people's business in the name of "national interest". I would like to see the US pull back its military and rather guard our own borders. I'd like to see the US stop giving so much money to foreign countries, and rather use that money to make a decent education available to every US child, and make decent health care available to every US family.

That being said, the US has a major foreign presence right now, whether I like it or not. What I found tough to believe is that the US has this foreign presence as part of some major conspiracy to dominate the world and make all foreign economies subservient to our own, which is how I understood Chomsky's message. 

Hugo Chavez loves to believe that because it gives him a stick with which to bash the US.

I think the US simply looks at unfolding events around the world in the light of how it will impact, firstly, the US and secondly, global stability, and then acts according to that interpretation. While some of the US actions abroad are highly questionable, I think those actions stand on their own as cases of bad judgment. That's a far cry from a conspiracy to dominate the world.

And that is why I didn't finish the book. I'm sure lots of people will consider my views simplistic or naive, but this book was just too much for me to believe.
