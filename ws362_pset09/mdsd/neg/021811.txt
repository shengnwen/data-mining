This was one of the two worst books I've ever read in my life.  I had hoped it might be like "Foucault's Pendulum" by Umberto Eco (a book I like), as some friend suggested.  But it bore no similarity at all, except in being dense, long, and somewhat difficult to follow.  

I found "Infinite Jest" to be plotless, self-absorbed, and wallowing in pointless cruelty and hideousness.  It gave me a clear image of the author as being arrogant and self-congratulatory, and completely lacking in any kind of moral or ethical center.

Life is just too short to waste on stuff like this.  I only wish I could get back the time I spent reading this horrible book.  I stuck with it all the way to the end hoping for some sort of payoff, something that would tie it all up and make the experience worth it, but there was nothing.  It just ended.
