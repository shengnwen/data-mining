First of all, almost half the material in this book is right out of Paul Fussell's "Class..." and the author even quotes straight out of this book. I hope he got a nice chunk from the sales! 

I recommend MOST of the advice given in this book to novices who are of the working class or those who have never read Paul Fussell's book. However, being someone who has lived around old moneyed folks most of my life, I can tell you there are some advices in this book that is just wrong. For example: Cartier tank watchs are a must for old money, capri pants and anything shiny is out and cufflinks are pretentious. All wrong. In Palm Beach, capris are on every woman out for a casual walk, shopping, etc. especially in that shiny silk material most quality neckties are made of. Cartiers are definitely nouveau, whynot recommend a Rolex! Lastly, cufflinks on Frech shirts are worn by most preppies turned attorney/banker in New York - not everyone can pull this off, ONLY those gents who gone to the right schools and belong to the right clubs and speak properly.

This is a cute book, nice attempt and has some sage advice. HOwever, take the advice in this book with a grain of salt. Please note the author did not grow up among the upper class, she just dated someone who was and read Paul Fussell's book.
