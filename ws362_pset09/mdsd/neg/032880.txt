This was the first time I had read an alternate history novel. The idea behind it was fine yet Turtledove switched so much between differnt stories that no one story had much depth and feeling to it. The mini stories, though trying to get a feel from all sides of a war, were superfically set up. There were some characters i wanted Turtledove to go more depth in and others i felt he could have elimintated. The ending of the novel was were the climax was for most characters. I also didnt like how at the end a lot of characters were left hanging. Overall I wasnt that pleased with the way Turtledove wrote about the experiences of war
