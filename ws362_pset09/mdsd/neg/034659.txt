"Winter Rose" is the story of wild child Rois and her sensible sister Laurel and their obsession with the mysterious and cursed Corbett.

I tried to like this book, it took me three attempts to read the whole thing, but I did! I just found that I didn't really enjoy it and found it difficult to get into.

For me, the language was beautiful, in parts, but the pretty metaphors, similes and adjectives got in the way of the story and at times I felt I was lost in the description and was desperately trying to find an interesting storyline.

The storyline was interesting but I don't think it needed to be so long and there wasn't really enough to keep me interested or encouraged me to wade through the description to find it. At points I felt the author used so much description to thicken up the storyline which was lacking. 

The characters also didn't come across as very developed. None of them seemed to really have any flaws (apart from Corbett's grandfather) and I think this made them seem very two dimensional and distant, even the narrator, and I didn't find myself caring about any of them. 

I'm a fan of fantasy but I think this particular story is a bit too mysterious for me, and I'm still not sure what happened in some points, this wasn't due to my lack of reading abilities but rather a lack of interest in what happened. It just didn't have me hooked.  

I've not read any other of McKillip's books and I'd like to because I've read that this isn't her best so if you're a fan of her writing style I'd give it ago. But if your like me, and prefer a really strong story to very pretty writing you might want to give it a miss.
