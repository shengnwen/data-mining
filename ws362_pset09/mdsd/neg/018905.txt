Maybe you thought Yumi was the main character, but the one to be most admired is certainly Cass.  She is the strong one, the stable one, the woman I most liked.  Yumi turns out to be a pretty crappy mother, among her many other faults.  It was an okay book, but predictable.  Although I saw it coming, the ending did turn out to my liking. Momoko was another undervalued jewel.  In the scheme of likeable women, Yumi (for me) came in a distant third
