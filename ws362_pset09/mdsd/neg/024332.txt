Repetitive, self-contradictory, predictable, boring. I still have a few pages to read and can't work up the energy to finishing reading them. The book is 100 - 150 pages too long, much of it is junk that could have been edited out. I have always been curious about Lumley's "Necroscope" series but now I wont even bother. I want my 7 bucks back.

The characters uninteresting, their actions somewhat pointless. The situations they get into are not very interesting either.
I thought is was odd that only the female charater kept getting her clothes ripped off as she ran through the woods, stupid. The "vilian" was totally unintersting and his behavior is never really explained in a way that makes sense for the story. 

The back cover exlaims "ALIEN ATTACK!" but there is no alien attack really, just one alien who has trapped a few people. I will stay way away from Lumley
