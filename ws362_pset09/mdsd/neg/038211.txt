Looking for a bit of sea adventure?  Fancy a run with some real life salts who face whatever the hurricane ravaged winter seas throw at them?  Well don't go looking to Redmond O'Hanlon's "Trawler".

O'Hanlon takes two potentially fascinating subjects - trawler fishing and the biology behind the creatures of the seas - and blends them into a putrid stew of nothingness.

This is a very difficult book to read. Physically difficult! Aye!  O'Hanlon's pointless, manic use of exclamation and emphasis - EMPHASIS! Aye! - lends nothing to the story but then there is so little story, it's really no loss.

"Trawler" dredges the bottom of literary technique and hauls up nothing but stream of consciousness drivel.  I found the book a total waste of time and will certainly never read another piece of work by O'Hanlon.  Aye!  I won't!  Never!
