Full disclosure: This reviewer is prejudiced! He hates air travel in general. In particular he dislikes airports, airlines, airplanes, flight personnel, the so called "food" and virtually anything and everything connected with air travel. For good measure, I just had a very unpleasant encounter with a rude flight attendant from a certain airline based in Minneapolis. I was all set for an expose ripping the industry for unsafe practices, sloppy maintenance, money grubbing from Washington and a host of other sins real and imagined. What I received instead was a disappointingly bland report of cockpit recordings from troubled airliners in flight.  Many of these flights crashed with great loss of life, others somehow survived their ordeals. In virtually all of the 28 incidents, I was unmoved. Even the transcripts of the Valuejet crash into the Everglades and the Challenger Space tragedy left me unimpressed. (Other reviewers have hinted that some of the latter was "reconstructed").  The one exception was the final episode concerning the heroic efforts of the crew of United 232, which crashed in Sioux City, Iowa with many survivors. As well as being unmoved by the second hand reporting of these events, I agree with the reviewer from Dublin who felt somehow "soiled" by these proceedings. BB reminded me of old movies of cars going off a cliff. Finally, I have to disagree with the author's statement on page X in the introduction: "The airline industry is constantly striving to make air travel safer" This reviewer believes in the precise opposite. The industry, aided and abetted by a cowed FAA, is cutting every maintenance corner it can to save $$. I believe there is a dark side to this business that goes unreported both on the pages of BB-and elsewhere.  BB is nonetheless recommended for pilots, airplane buffs and similar folk. "Ordinary" people looking for an exciting saga will doubtless be disappointed
