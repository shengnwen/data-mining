i purchased this book for my cousin who is 7 years old.  She looked at it and thought it was cool.  When she opened it she found the instruction booklet missing.  Also when she painted her fingernails, the nail polish was peel- off, and came off within a few hours.  This product is un-satisfatory, and i suggest you don't purchase it
