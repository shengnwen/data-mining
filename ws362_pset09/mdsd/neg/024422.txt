This book gives prices in FF (French Francs).  France changed from Francs to Euros in 2000. Does that give you a hint of how out-dated this book is?  Granted, a lot of the information will still be valid, but much will not; needs another edition with a serious update.  Also, could use lots of photos or drawings to illustrate the points she's making (for examples, Price discusses various types of French pottery; it would be nice to see what she's talking about) 
This is probably a better book for armchair travel than for actually guiding you through French flea markets.  Good luck
