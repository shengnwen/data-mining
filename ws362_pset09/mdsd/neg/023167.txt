This is a bubble gum type of book that does not teach anything about making money on the markets. It is a platform to sell Investor Business Daily services. If you want to learn trading look for articles written by Toby Crabel or Arthur Merrill, even Linda Raschke. They are full time professional money managers that happend to write few articles... some of them you can probably find on Ebay for cheaper...
