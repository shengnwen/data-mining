This book reprints the SECRET WAR 5 issue mini-series and the SECRET WAR: FROM THE FILES OF NICK FURY one shot. The story by Bendis is disappointing, particularly how the ending transpires. The (painted) art is by Gabriele Dell'Otto, which at the time the mini-series was being published was being hyped by Marvel as the next Alex Ross (that prediction didn't come to pass). While the art wasn't bad, it did not possess the take-your-breath-away impact the Alex Ross' work does. It also was an odd pairing with Bendis, whose work is more light-hearted in tone (Spidey has some one-liners in this book) while the painted art conveys a dark and moody tone.

What really is the downfall of this book is that HALF of this book is made up of chat logs, dossiers, etc. Again, HALF OF THE BOOK (I counted the pages - the story was 128 pages). While they do add to the story, this takes away from the enjoyment experience of the book immensely. A few pages I would understand, but when you cannot proceed to the next chapter of the story due to the voluminous pages of text material (which one cannot ignore if one hasn't read the book before), then it becomes a chore to go through the book.

At this price point, even with the online discounts, it simply is not worth it. Save your money
