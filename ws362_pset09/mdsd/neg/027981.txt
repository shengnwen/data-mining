I used this book for a research project on ID that I was writing for a class. As a Christian, I find much of the book to be somewhat offensive. The story of "Dave and Katy's Metaphysical Adventure" is cheap emotional manipulation in the form of a sermon. The message is clear - the reason your teenager is "turning away from God" isn't because teenagers are at an age where they are questioning the beliefs of their parents and trying to figure out what they believe themselves, it is because he is learning evolution in school. As page 100 says, "Creation is the first element of the Christian Worldview, the foundation on which everything is built". This means Young Earth Creationism, the literal reading of Genesis. In this book, and the popular accompanying study guide, which is widely used by churches, this literalist interpretation is being taught as a statement of faith, i.e. "if you don't believe the literal reading of Creation, then you don't believe". Old Earth Creationists need not apply. Ironically, this also casts doubt on many of the Intelligent Design advocates who lean toward Old Earth Creationism, such as Phillip Johnson, and about half of the pro-ID scientists who testified in the Kansas Science Standards hearings in May 2005. This also is ironic since Colson writes the forward for Dembski's book "The Design Revolution", where it is stated that the identity of the Creator doesn't matter.
