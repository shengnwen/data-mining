This set of CDs is a fraud!  Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a "translation" by some hack poet.  So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you.  But it is definitely not Chaucer
