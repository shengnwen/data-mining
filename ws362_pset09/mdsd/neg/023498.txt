I read this book as a requirement for a class in eschatology in seminary. Pentecost block-quotes other authors for about 60 percent of his text, at which point he could've just provided a bibliography. There is little originality in thought here. Pentecost surveys the narrow world of premillenial dispensationalism and says anyone who disagrees with his viewpoint does not take the text "literally" and ignores the "clear, plain meaning of scripture." But his hermeneutic is a bit inconsistent. He insists that various parts of the apocalyptic imagery presented in Revelation, Daniel and other parts of the Bible must be taken literally. 

But he then turns around and says the odd beasts in the Revelation are figurative. Okay...who's not being "literal" here?

Like too many evangelical theologians, Pentecost has no concept of how apocalyptic worked in the Second Temple period. I would imagine that, having translated the Testaments of the XII Patriarchs, I've done more background work than he did in the area (unless reading the notes in the Scofield Bible counts).

Instead, he spends all of his time demonizing those blasted amillenialists. An enormous waste of time and energy.

Then again, the book is almost 600 pages long, and uneducated people are always impressed when they see you reading something large. But for my money, you could learn more about how to live like Christ in the light of his imminent coming (the point of eschatology) by reading an even bigger book you probably already own: the yellow one with restaurant listings
