I bought this book as a gift for a friend based on the great categories it has to offer for recording book information. I was so disappointed to find that the spaces allowed for writing are so small. Also, the book is hard to navigate. The hard cover and hard binding don't allow for anyone to write it in it (inflexible). I gave it as a gift still, but I had to apologize for what a cruddy book it was
