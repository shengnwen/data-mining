"Team-Based Strategic Planning: A Complete Guide to Structuring, Facilitating and Implementing the Process" is one of those dense, impenetrable tomes blessed with having the American Management Association for its publisher. Hence, it smacks of authority. 

Yet the book is written in a nearly unreadable language: the language of management-speak, uttered to obfuscate rather than enlighten, to deflect rather than engage.

One does not have to go far before running into verbal blockades such as this: "Organizations with an existing plan, however good or poor, should preface a plan update or total ground up revision with an upfront step: a review of the existing mission, plan, and accomplishments." Other similar all-star collections of jargon appear on nearly every page. 

Shall we spend a moment considering this thought? First, people not organizations are the doers. Does "however good or poor" modify the existing plan or the organizations? Can there exist a nonexistent plan? Can a "ground up revision" be used for mulching the perennial garden? Can you actually preface and update, plus be upfront, in the same sentence? Finally, it's clear that organizations without existing plans will not be able to review their existing plans.

Language is not the only barrier. Some charts are full of type faces, sometimes six or more, calling to mind ransom notes assembled from letters clipped from magazines. Others are collections of thick symbols and unfriendly bold type and all caps that scream out MOCK IMPORTANCE.

My advice is to look for management advice that is dispensed in clear English with understandable graphics. [...]
