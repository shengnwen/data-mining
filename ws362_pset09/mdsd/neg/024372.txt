The recently released movie "Breach" tells the "inside" story of the sting operation to capture Soviet spy Robert Hannsen. Expertly acted, wonderfully disrected, the film examines how the FBI managed to capture one of its own by planting it's own mole to work with Hannsen, and how that investigation ensued. Naturally, upon leaving the movie, my curiosity was peaked by the incident, so I purchased this book to fill in the gaps and connect the dots even more. 

What I ended up reading was a mere recount of Hannsen's life, the life of Louis Freeh, one-time FBI director, and a few e-mails and smutty stories Hannsen wrote about his wife. The book disappoints by mainly rehashing information already known, and failing to present much, if anything, of the FBI investigation that brought Hannsen down. Hannsen comes across neither interesting nor threatening, but moreso an angry employee looking to seek vengence on his employer, the US Government, by selling top secret documents to a country on the verge of falling apart.

Okay, so we knew that. It took you 9/10 of the book to get to the investigation itself, and the pages that discussed it were minimal indeed. I learned more about this event from listening to an NPR story on the movie than reading this book. 

The author seemingly sets up a dichotomy between Hannsen and Freeh early on in the book, but there really is no payoff to both of those stories as Freeh ends up in an incompetent mess, leaving the FBI, and working for a credit card company. It left me asking, what in the heck was he featured so prominently in this book? Probably to fill out the pages on an initially sketchy story.

Don't believe the review on the back. Pass this book up, buy a ticket at your local movie theater, and spend two hours with Ryan Phillipe, Chris Cooper, and Laura Linney. THAT will be a great use of your time
