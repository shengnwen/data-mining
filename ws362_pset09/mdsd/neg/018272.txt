I was prepared to like this book, especially after the rave reviews found here on Amazon, and Audible. But I found that Haunted Ground: A novel, quickly lost my interest. Why, you may ask? Because the author has too many characters and she head-hops between them constantly. Each section is narrated by a new character, and frankly I lost interest. I prefer books with one, possibly two voices but not a half dozen. This is particularly disconcerting in audio format. Plus, I found the drippy American character with the tortured past and murdered sister a bit trite and maudlin. 

Feh, overall, 2 stars. If she had stuck to a single or maybe dual perspective it might've captured my interest
