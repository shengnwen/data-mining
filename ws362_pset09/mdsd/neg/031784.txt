When a book is entitled "Thailand in Pictures", you expect... well... pictures. Lots of them. Especially when it's a book for children. This book doesn't even provide anything like the good scenic pictures of cities or landscapes that text-based travel guides provide, and they usually have only a few pages of illustration. A very poor picture of a mudslide during monsoon season... why would anyone really be interested in seeing that? Maybe if it was engulfing an entire home or something, but this photo just looks like a lump of wet dirt. I bought this because it looked like the closest thing I could find to a pictoral book on Thailand, and returned it the next day. Don't waste your money on it
