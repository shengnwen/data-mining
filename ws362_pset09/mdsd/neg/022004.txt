I was very disappointed about this book. I find it poorly organized and lacking in content. It basicly consists of very long lists of items, and each item occupying approximately one line, and containing only very little description, and there are very few photos. Everyone who has tried knows that evaluating antiques is very tricky, and even from detailed descriptions and pictures it can be close to impossible. These lists are rather useless unless accompanied by lots of details. Perhaps for very specific items, i.e. china, glass, etc. it could be useful, but I think it has very limited use for furniture
