It seems many reviews discuss this book through the prism of their politics, as opposed to reviewing it _as a book_.

As a book, I was quite disappointed. Firstly, a good half of the book is taken up with the PRE-war planning on invading Iraq, rehashing material presented (much better) in Woodward's or Clark's books.

When we finally get to the post-invasion planning, the book suffers from a fatal flaw - the author's own axe-grinding. The author was a principal on the multi-agency project, led as I remember out of the State Department, which compiled a long set of guides for how the reconstruction should go. In one of the more notable (but already known) failures, these guides were discarded by the Bush administration, as the authors were viewed as too "soft". OK, fine. However, the author harps on this over and over and over. Over and over, the book reads like this: "So then Bremer made this decision, which turned out wrong. We told you so.".

This is also weakened by the fact that the authors recommendation is virtually _always_ "form a multi-sided commission to study the issue" - not exactly gripping reading. Frankly, I can see why more action-minded minds might have started to ignore the author and his comission - sometimes multi-sided comissions are not the right answer!

The blurb for the book gives the impression that the author was a "True believer" (one of Rice's friends, etc.) who became disullusioned over time. This may be true, but the book is written instead with the advantage of 20/20 hindsight - the author's recommendations were always right, Bremer's/Cheney's always wrong, according to the book. Not only does this strain credulity, but it made this a rather unenlightening read for me - i would have been much more interested in something that discussed how the planning _evolved_, rather than the litany of "we told you so's" that this book presents.
