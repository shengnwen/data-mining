She wastes the first chapters, and my time, going to extremes with kooky consultants that only someone who doesn't deserve to be hired would use.  It adds to the drama and despair I suppose, but it comes off as contrived, and as an attempt to pander to her extremist/pessimist reading coterie.
I don't think Babs could have possibly put more words in quotations.  Her OCD with quotated words and terms is a distraction that ultimately drove me nuts. I can't believe she's an accomplished writer.
Her writing style can best be described as unsmooth and read-stoppage inducing.
Oh well, her intentions were good
