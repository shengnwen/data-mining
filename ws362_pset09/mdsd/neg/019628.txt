I am a student of Acupuncture currently working on a BSc degree in Oriental Medicine and bought this book for a research project on Acupuncture and Pain Management. Even though the author is a practiving Doctor of Naturopathy as well as Osteopathy, he has very little insight into Acupuncture. He calls TCM theory and diagnisis - which is the basis of successful Acupuncture - "antiquated Chinese mythology". Page 9 reads: "I (the authhor) maintain that much of what traditional acupuncturists hold to be true consists of theories and quaint explanations steeming from Chinese mythology and antiquity. The value of these to an age not versed in modern scientific terminology is obvious." One the same page ee also remarks that "Myths and antique phraseology are often perpetuated as a result of an inability to see what is real in the vast literature that has grown around this subject...". No TCM diagnosis is applied, no point selections guidelines are given, no treatment formulas suggested. The title of this book is misleading. It should be called "sticking a needle where it hurts - a guide for the ignorant".
