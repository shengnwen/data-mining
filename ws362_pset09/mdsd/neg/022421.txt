A diary is supposed to allow me to record my personal information.  By adding the irrelevant photos and so-called motivational quotes, they have reduced the space for my personal information even further.

I used the first edition for four years.  At least I was generally able to squeeze in the essentials of my workouts.  However, the new edition has less space available for each day, and still only room for two workouts.  The space for each workout is much less than adequate, and forget ever trying to squeeze in a record of more than two on any day.

Do you ever workout more than twice a day?  Then, skip this product!
