This was my first exposure to Neruda's poetry and it left an extremely bad taste in my mouth. It seemed nonsensical and adolescent, like a teenager who thinks he's smarter than he actually is, writing poetry to impress his 9th grade English teacher. I was ready to conclude that Neruda was not worth wasting my time on until I got on here and discovered all the other one-star reviews berating the quality of the translation. For now I will reserve judgment on Neruda until I read a decent translation.  This is a dreadful book
