As a fan of detective fiction, I am often amused by the sub-genres that develop; gourmet cooks, fly fishermen, lesbians, you name it.  So as a student of Spanish and a lover of Spain, I was pleased to discover a modern Spanish private detective.  Pepe Carvalho is a hard-boiled loner, a gourmet cook, a former communist and a former CIA spy.  He lives in Barcelona.  He has many sexual adventures.  So far, so good.  Unfortunately, there is very little detection in this book.  A crime occurs. Carvalho wanders around getting hit on the head.  He meets two beautiful women.  A past conflict with a police inspector is hinted at.  The criminal is revealed in an unconvincing way.  Carvalho goes home.  I kept waiting for some sluething, but it never happened.  The best part of this book was some very slight references to modern Spanish society and some probably accurate references to the history of the Spanish Communist Party.  The author is a prize winner, highly regarded and very successful.  I'll try him again, but this is not an exciting detective story
