i got this book for xmas and was very happy until i started to read it. this book is useless except for some very good pictures of the plants, names of the plants and some very basic info on care(this plant likes shade or sun.) one example is they give the exact same advice on how to fertilize almost every plant. everyone knows different plants like different fertilizers. the advice on how to landscape is good if you like the way planned communities and supermarkets are landscaped. if you want something that looks tropical or unique this book is not for you. there are other books out there that are much better and cheaper.
