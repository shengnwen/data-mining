The book Teacup Full Of Roses had a few topics that teens today could relate to. Nevertheless, this was not a very enjoyable book to me . I didn't like it because of how short it was. I think it should have been longer to give more details. In my opinion, the prolouge didn't fit well with the ending of the book. Overall, I give the book a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I would not reccomend this book to anyone because it was lacking a few things, which made it confusing
