i have just finished reading cannibals and kings by marvin harris. i am an  avid reader and can put a 200 page book away with ease. cannibals and kings  however took me over a month to put myself through it. harris' dry humor  mixed with completely boring material does not make a best seller. i  understand thaat the origin of mankind can not be the most interesting  topic no matter who writes it, but with harris behind the pen this book is  headed for disater. i recommend this book with anyone who has sleeping  problems becuase everytime i started to read a few lines from this book i  was sleeping liek a baby with in 5 minutes
