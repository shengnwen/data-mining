I like Eyewitness Guides a lot, particularly for their glossy graphics combined with comprehensive information, but this really doesn't make the cut.  How is it possible to cram Scotland into 224 pages? Well, it is not.  Besides having very poor coverage on Glasgow and particularly Edinburgh, it also has - well, more poor coverage.  Maps for the bigger islands in Northern Scotland are sorely lacking.  More effort has really got to be invested in making this guide before it is worth your money.  I know DK can make some really great guides, so it saddens me that they are now churning out trash like this
