Awful.  If it was possible to get a zero, this book would deserve it...Material might be interesting if it was presented in a "manly" manner, at least readable...It's the same stuff over and over again, as if the author is trying to convince himself...

A book on "Manliness" ought to be manly, straight forward, tell it like it is and move on...readers and critics be damned, take it or leave it...this book is any and everything but that, and this critic chooses to leave it and suggest that you do the same...

The author's points are "manly" in one important aspect (at least to the academic world).  He goes against "political correctness" and takes a stand against what is considered "acceptable thought..." Three cheers for him on this point...but if he really wanted to make his point, he should have written a "book," not a bulky unreadable dissertation...Little wonder that it is #9,151 on the Amazon Best Seller List and, most likely, dropping fast.    

Having said all of this, to be fair, I must point out that our men's book club had a most lively discussion about this book.  Only two people had struggled through the book (two out of nine), but the ideas in the book provoked great discussion. Unfortunately not much of the discussion was about what was in the book
