This is an amazing cookbook but for the 100 or so needed corrections that Whole Foods has listed on its website. I could read this book for hours, it really has some delicious and creative healthful recipes. Unfortunately, I've learned not to go beyond READING it, as I've wasted grocery cash and time finding out that the proof (reading) was not in the "putting" for Whole Foods editorial staff! Wait till the much-needed revised edition comes out
