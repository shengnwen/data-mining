I was dissappointed in this journal, because it seemed like more of a workbook. I was expecting more of a self help book, not a book which I had to write my own opinions. I bought this book to hear the opinions of another person, that is not what I recieved. I do not think that is helpful, but if you like to do exercises, go ahead and try it
