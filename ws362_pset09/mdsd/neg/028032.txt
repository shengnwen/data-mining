I haven't bought or read the book.(I read Trends which I found to have no detail or market research-just cute man bashing).  What I challenge anyone who has read this book is give me 10 discreet things (ok 3) that the author gives you to help market to women. I mean take back to the office and put to use things. I don't mean 'women want complexity' - more than that. What do we mean by 'complexity'? Or how do we create an online  experience for a woman that increases click-thru to purchase.  Do we upsell items on the first page (because that is how women prefer it)? Do we put shoes next to the business suits because women multi-task?  Or??... you get the point. My take is most of her material is anecdotal- even personal opinion. I may be wrong - someone help me on this.
