This book provides an intriguing look back at a time when the Dot Com Boom was at its zenith, shortly before the crash. Interestingly, there is no sense of the impending doom that lies just over the horizon.

Lewis' "Liar's Poker" was extremely enjoyable, particularly because of the flash and personality of the central players. In this book, Lewis seems to have lost his way as he tries to wring interest from a much less compelling or likable chief character. The tone of the book is further weakened by the constant labels applied to Clark's disciples as the "smartest," "best," "greatest," and "most ingenious," individuals in their various fields.

What strains credibility, however, is the attribution of all Clark's successes to his incredible intelligence and foresight, while the fault of his failures is cast on the incompetent actions and short-sighted beliefs of others. History will probably not judge Clark as charitably as Lewis -- especially since most of the Clark's companies have either failed outright or remain but shells of their Dot Com era glory (most notably SGI, Netscape, and Healtheon).

Throughout the book, Jim Clark is touted for wealth that amounts to between $3 and $4 billion. The list of 2004 Forbes 400 Richest in America shows Jim Clark with an approximated net worth of $700 million. For a man who brags he will quit making money when his fortune eclipses that of Oracle's Larry Ellison, today Clark probably most regrets the loss of his favorite designation: billionaire.
