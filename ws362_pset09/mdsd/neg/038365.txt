I thought this book was one of the worst textbooks I have ever picked up. The best thing about it was finishing it! Organizational Behavior is not the only class I am taking and yet I poured way more time and effort into reading this book than it deserved. It is NOT student friendly. There are no callouts and I simply believe there is a better way to deliver this information than I experienced in this text. That's not to say there isn't a ton of good information in it, but that it's poorly organized and assumes that the reader is familiar with organizational behavior and will know the references the author names by last name only. Also, the entire first chapter was spent telling the reader what he will learn in the remaining 17 chapters. Get on with it. Throughout, the author continues to reference what the reader will learn in upcoming chapters. STOP IT. Revise this piece of junk to something more student-friendly. When I am a teacher, I will not come close to asking my students to use this. I do not recommend this book for someone who is not planning on becoming an organizational behavior major. If you're a teacher, please don't ask your student to read this. Terrible
