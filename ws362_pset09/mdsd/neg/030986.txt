I really have no problem with the basic concepts of the book. In fact, I agree completely with them. We should pay ourselves first and do so automatically. My problem comes from two things:

1. The author's ideas aren't original. He's just given them cutesy names like Latte Factor so that he could more easily market them.

2. I don't see what the Latte Factor has to do with anything else in this book, which left me confused. The Latte Factor simply means we all have things in our lives that we waste money on, money that could be used to generate wealth. The rest of the book delves into the importance of paying yourself first by setting up an automatic system that puts a portion of each paycheck into some kind of retirement vehicle, like a 401k. Well, if one does that, then where does the Latte Factor come in? If I'm automatically setting money aside, then why should I be concerned about what I spend on a day to day basis? The Latte Factor is only meaningful to someone who lives on a budget, but the author states repeatedly that living on a budget is wrong and doesn't work. So what's the point of the Latte Factor!? As long as I'm automatically setting aside money to generate wealth, who cares if I indulge at Starbucks or anywhere else? Maybe I'm making too big a deal of this, but it really bugs me. Still, I would recommend the book to someone who has no clue about wealth generation and retirement planning
