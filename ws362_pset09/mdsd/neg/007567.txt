I love looking through baby name books, and, truth be told, I was running out of names for my Sims, so I picked this one up.

Although lengthy, the book gives you lists of names.  Never once did I see a definition or a reason why a certain name is popular.  I like unique names, but there are no prenunciation keys or anything helpful.  

Just lists.

Famous names, names famous people used for their kids, unique middle names, and, of course, the most popular names.  There's a lot of overlapping--the list of most popular names in Canada and the US and the UK are devastatingly similar.  Even more disappointing is the part where they start listing popular names in other countries, and I flip the page to find the list of 100 in the US quickly dwindles through France and Ireland to not even five in Middle Eastern countries.

Just when this book starts getting interesting, they ruin it by forgetting the follow-through.  I would like to have seen a history on each name, reasons why they are popular, and a pronunciation key to help sound out difficult, unique names.  I finally ended up flipping through the index, picking out names for my Sims, then sending it back
