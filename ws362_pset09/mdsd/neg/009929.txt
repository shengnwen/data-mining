Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars
