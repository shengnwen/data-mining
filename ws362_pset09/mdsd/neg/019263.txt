I bought a paperback that included both "Of Mice and Men"(OMM) and "Cannery Row."  For me, "Cannery Row" seemed like it was not written by the same author. Whereas OMM had me in its grip, even though I have seen several movie versions, "Cannery Row" left me asking just what was so great about Steinbeck anyway?  

I just think whereas OMM is a timeless story (the story of two guys, one smart, one not-so-sharp but innocent, trying to make a buck will play out forever), "Cannery Row" just doesn't seem to withstand the test of time. Yes, Steinbeck has some nice still-relevant social comment about the impact of the automobile and how the traits we don't admire in someone are the same traits that can make one successful. Howver, outside of that, the story was just a mediocre character study.  And therein lied the problem for me-too many characters I had no interest in. 

I have to side with the other reviewers who suggest Steinbeck's other work in order to absorb the full wonder of this man.
