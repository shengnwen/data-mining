Roshumba Williams may very well be the sweetest person on the face of the earth but this book is terrible! Contradictive statements, lackluster presentation, absence of photographs, surface information and a feel that it was published to grab a little piece of the book sales pie. I question if the positive comment writers really read this book. And how can anyone who knows this Roshumba Williams personally write an unbiased report about this book?
  I am afraid this book was thrown together by a corporate ladder climber who duped Roshumba Williams into believing it was a great way to make MONEY. Doesn't seem to have been built for the end consumer in any way. I can see only two uses for this book. A door stop as I am now using mine. Or print the next batch on toilet paper thus rendering it useful.
   A total WASTE of my hard earned dollars!!
