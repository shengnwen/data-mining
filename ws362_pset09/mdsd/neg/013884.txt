I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews.  I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak.  Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance
