I've loved Jeanne Ray's other books (Julie & Romeo, Step Ball Change, and Eat Cake). I found them all to be well written, funny and entertaining reads, with varied and likeable characters. This book doesn't come close to meeting the standard set by the others. It isn't funny at all. All of the characters act horribly, including the martyred Julie who lets everyone in her family walk all over her. I haven't read a book in a long time where I didn't like a single character. (And I liked these people in the first book - Julie and Romeo). I highly recommend her other books, but I'd stay away from this one
