I am not a big fan of Rush Limbaugh, I would even admit to somewhat disliking the man.  I also tend to fall to more of the moderate side of the political isle.  So you would think that I would have really liked this book, unfortunately for me I did not.  I am all for going after the many misstatements that Rush makes and his very far right wing view of the world.  I would have even enjoyed a bit of grief given to the conservative section of the Republican party, but this book went way beyond what I wanted to read.  The author started out taking on the items are mentioned above, it was just that the author used this as a starting point.  He went after everything to the right of full blown socialism. 

As I read I kept thinking what in the world is this guy thinking.  He has an issue with about everything that is remotely associated with the Republican party.  He was mad at business owners having the ability to move their businesses around the U.S., he does not like any kind of anti union activity and he is aghast that anyone might be opposed to government control of all aspects of the community.  Overall the author takes the opportunity of this book to beat up on everything slightly red.  The venom kept increasing through the book to the point that you feel like the author is standing up in front of you yelling.  

Overall the book was far too negative for me.  The author has a huge chip on his shoulder and he is going to let the world know about it.  I was looking for a funny and campy book that took as many shots at Rush about his politics as it did about his waistline.  If you are a hard core hater of all things Republican then you will probably enjoy the book.   If you are looking for anything a bit less over the top then keep looking.
