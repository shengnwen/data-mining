I love Lee.  I mean his stuff is just so much fun.  When I finally gave him a chance and started reading his stuff I was hooked.  Then I read Flesh Gothic and while good it just was not quite as good as the others I had read.  I could not call what I felt disappointment but it was like a bump in the road.  Then I read the Messenger.  This is the worst I have read from Lee.  It contained none of the fun of his other novels.  Stay away from this one.
