We can't add anything to Christianity, there are no more Gospels.  Nothing that we need to add, no stories we need to tell, or make up to explain who God is or what He thinks.  It is all before us.  He's told His story, He's revealed His character, and His Truth through the bible.  Glenda's book, to me, is half-baked.  She even admits she is no theologian.  Maybe that's where she should start with the bible herself, instead of making up stories about her conversations with God that are not biblically sound and contradict the Truth of who He is.  She puts way too much emphasis on the individual.  She stressed throughout her book that "we" are love, If we are Love, then why do we need a Savior.  If we are perfect why did He send His son to die for our sins?  Glenda's book is not one of Christianity, it is philosophy.  Self help, not surrender to a higher power.  She is promoting herself, her work.  We don't need her telling us what He thinks, He already has.  We ourselves, can go directly to the source.  He layed Himself out to us, fully exposed.  No hypothesizing necessary from authors like Glenda.
