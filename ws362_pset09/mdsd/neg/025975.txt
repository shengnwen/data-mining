One word: boring. This book took 40 pages just to describe people dying everywhere and that the remaining survivors ended up in a hall together. After that, no zombie-killing action for the next 100 pages or so. All of it went something like this: "We were all scared. We didn't know what to do. Michael showed signs of irritation at the group's indecisiveness. How could dead bodies move? Some of us wanted to leave, others wanted to stay here. The whole world was coming to an end." Way too much imagery about their surroundings and emotions but not enough horror element to warrant this as a horror novel. Makes a good read for people who just want to throw away their time at amateur work that offers nothing particularly interesting. The spotlight review written by "citymars" is yet another testimony to the points I'm trying to make. 

If you really like this or want to see for yourself what I meant, you can download a free ebook version at David Moody's website. Other titles that ARE actually worth reading are: "The Rising" by Brian Keene and "The Walking Dead" series by Robert Kirkman.
