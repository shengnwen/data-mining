I, too, lost my father at an early age.  I was seeking a book to help as I struggled with his death many years later.  
I rate this book a "2" because it didn't seem to provide the insight or informal counseling that i would have expected in a book, but rather was just a story with several examples of how other folks wrestled with the loss.  I couldn't finish the book and have moved on to other books as I wrestle with these issues
