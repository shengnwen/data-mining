I have often enjoyed this author's work; however, this time I believe that the author uses her evangelical Christianity to mask unexamined prejudices. I believe that, in this book, the author uses holy scripture and psuedo-intellectual gloss rather than rigorous scholarship to discuss race, gender, sexuality and the church. I find her arguments on sexuality shamefully dismissive. I hope that the author will reconsider this work
