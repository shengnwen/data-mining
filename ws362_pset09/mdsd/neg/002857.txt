Reading through reviews of this text, I notice two main criticisms and will address them separately.

The first is that the book has some sort of liberal bias.  As far as I am concered, no bias of this sort is present.  I hold my textbooks to the same standard that I hold news outlets, and I found The American Pageant to be just as objective as the BBC or The Washington Post.  Dr. Bailey looks at both sides of controversial issues, does not, despite the beliefs of other reviewers, pan President Reagan, and has plenty of criticism of the left.

Why, then, the low rating?  This has to do with issue number two, namely Dr. Bailey's writing style.  It is, in a word, irritating.  He feels the need to bring ridiculously flowery language and bizarre metaphors into every situation.  I counted at least six comparisons of national banks, Wall Street moguls and railroad barons to octopuses.  Teddy Roosevelt had, according to Dr. Bailey, "mule-like molars" which he "bared at liberals and reactionaries alike".  It's extraordinarily difficult to cut through the (pardon my French here) merde and figure out what on earth is going on.

I'm not looking for a dry history book, really I'm not.  I believe American history can be interesting without bordering on the insane.  Dr. Bailey crosses the line from making his readers think that he may be insane to actually making his readers go insane.  

I've not read any other US History textbook, so as far as I know this may be the best one.  I certainly hope not, for all of our sakes
