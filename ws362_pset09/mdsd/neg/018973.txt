I have read almost all of David Hawkins books and now wonder about his credability.  In this book his calibrations of politics, political leaders and current topics are all aligned with the conservative fundamentalists.  
Up to this point I had believed Hawkins to be an objective and brilliant researcher and scientist but now I have my doubts?   One example of his bias is George Bush  (Any student of public speaking can readily identify speakers who lie or deceive).  Applied Kinesiology would indeed be a wonderful tool if you could also calibrate the user of it!
