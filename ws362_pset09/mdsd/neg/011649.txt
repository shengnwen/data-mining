It is strange that a book dedicated to present deconstruction and chora actually "plays" of representing it. Derrida's reading on plato's chora is indeed relevant to architecture. It is not an easy reading, which is typical of many of derrida's writings. Unfortunately, this book becomes yet more difficult to read with this "funny" perfurated edition. Different from Deconstruction, it is not an easy task to interpret the meaning of those holes. They are certainly dispensable.
