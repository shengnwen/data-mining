Shaonnon Drake is the nom de plume of Heather Graham.  Both are basically in the "bodice ripper" genre I guess. (Graham is the name for hardcovers and Drake for the paperbacks, it would appear).  

This book was so bad I almost stopped at the "Prologe" in which the errors were almost laughable.  The author's vision of WW-II combat seems to have come from watching the final battle in the movie Zulu one too many times.

From there I was able to wade as far a a slice of Chapter 2 where a combination of boredom and lack of interest in the plot overwhelmed me.  I'm glad I just checked this out from the library, because I hate to think I would have spent money for it
