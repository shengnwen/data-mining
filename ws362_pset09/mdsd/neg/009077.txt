I was very interested in the first story in this collection because at the outset it looked like it would take a look beneath the surface of relationships. Instead the story quickly became a silly adolescent soap opera acted out by supposed adults. The four central characters are comprised of two married couples. Each spouse has an affair with his/her friend's spouse. And they all pretend this isn't going on and that they're still all friends. The four characters are among the most unlikeable, narcissistic, immature, non-credible characters I've ever read about. The two male characters teach at a college, but could just as easily be portrayed as accountants, factory workers, or computer programmers. The characters have absolutely no depth. The men in the story clearly suffer from "Peter Pan" syndrome. The author is trying so hard to say something important with these stories, but it's a mystery what that is. In short he seems to think that immature behavior somehow represents honesty. If you want to read about four people who never outgrew high school adolescent behavior this may be the book for you. Apparently Dubus saw something he liked in these characters because he wrote three novellas including them. Unfortunately the movie is just as dismal as the book--even more so actually
