The purpose of this book is for Mr. LaPierre to make as much money as he can from ignorant Americans who tend to believe him. The amount of untruthful material in here is just plain amazing! If the reader takes just three minutes to Google the UN conference on small arms and light weapons, he/she would find that no UN body has ever contemplated regulating legal sale and posession of small weapons in any of its member states. However, their main goal is eradicating illicit (i.e. illegal) trafficking. If Mr. LaPierre so vigourously opposes UN in this effort, it clearly means that his organisation supports smuggling and illegal sale of guns.

This book is most likely going to be preaching to the choir. Other than really uneducated and disinterested readers, nobody else is going to buy the misinformation it is trying to present as fact
