As a first time mother, I was looking for a book that would answer my seemingly endless list of questions. While this book does provide some good information, it is hard to decipher the facts from the sarcastic comments and attempts at wit. Every section and statement is worded in what I assume the author saw as a clever way, but after trying 5 or 6 topics, I gave up trying to get any useful information. If you're like me and are looking for a more straight-forward, well-researched book, try Your Pregnancy Week by Week by Glade B. Curtis. It is by far the best organized and most clearly worded pregnancy book I have read - having tried The Pregnancy Bible, What to Expect (too cynical and scary), as well as The Mother of all Pregnancy Books.
