I have really enjoyed most of the Jury series, especially the interactions between Jury and Plant.  This book, however, fails to deliver in my opinion.  She starts off with a wonderful premise and could have really built upon it....but she didn't.  The book starts to become annoying because she gets lost in "educating" the reader on quantum physics.  I kept nodding off and wondering if I'd ever be able to finish this book.  
I skimmed through so much of the last few chapters and still found that you're left hanging at the end.  It's not even the fact that Harry walks away in the end, it's more that Grimes fails to give anything in the story proper closure.  

I don't really know what she was aiming at with this one, but it really missed the mark for me.  I agree with the other reviewer who said she seems to be tired of writing Jury.  Even Melrose Plant has lost some luster in this book and he usually shines through in most of them.  

I noticed the next title in this series is "Dust" ... I fear that may be a literal description of this series at present.  It's dry as dust to me.
