No doubt the 4th turning was a refreshing revelation.  And the more dated predecessor Generations was a great secondary read.  From that I gathered there was a sort of synergistic relationship with each skipped generation.  Boomers relating to GI generation and Silent relating to the 13th generation, simply stated, a reciprocating bond of grandparents and their grandchildren.  Parents sure didn't like the antics and conduct of their children but they sure love those amazing grandchildren .  So it all makes sense that we get this tertiary and purely subjective read from Howe about what essentially are his darling grandchildren.

When I read about students turning in their teachers for espousing their pollitcal viewpoints I think millennial.  When I read about the yet to be calculated damages of Thimerosol in vaccines introduced in the 90's I think millennial.  Add ritalin and a V chip in the back of the neck and you get the ideal personae of a denizen of Huxley's Brave New World.
