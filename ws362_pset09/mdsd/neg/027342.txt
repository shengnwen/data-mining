While intially an engaging tale, I eventually found myself further ahead in solving the mystery than the characters.  At times the writing was wordy, and the characters began to tangle with each other (afterall, I was introduced to nearly every individual in the Cathedral at SOME point or another, whether or not they were relevent to the story).

I had started out with high hopes, and by the time I closed the book was forced that admit that I had, once again, been disappointed
