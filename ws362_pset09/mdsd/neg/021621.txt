Seth's UK publisher apparently paid £1.4m for this book WITHOUT EVEN READING A WORD!  Any publisher prepared to cough up that amount of cash so recklessly deserves an entire omelette on their face and that is pretty much what they got.

Seth is a fine writer and this is a well-crafted book.  It tells the story of his uncle (a one-armed dentist) and his aunt (a German refugee) with whom he spent some time when he first came to England.  Their tale is interesting without being remarkable and this is where the problem really lies.

Two Lives would make a wonderful 100 page short memoir.  I say this with confidence as 100 of these 500+ pages are very good indeed.  The correspondence between the couple and the stories that the letters unearth are moving and compelling reading.

The rest of the book is a bit dull really.  Something his publisher would have noticed had they bothered to read it (if indeed those stories are true).

Ho hum, publishers have their own reasons for throwing good money away.  Shame that they could have supported a whole host of exciting new authors with just a small portion of the cash they wasted on this.

If you are interested in this book (and you will wonder why you were when you read it) for goodness sake wait for the paperback.  This edition is too heavy in every sense of the word
