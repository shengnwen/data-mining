This fakebook is published in C, Bb, and Eb versions. The C version is now on the 3rd edition. But the publisher has not yet sold out of the 2nd editions for the Eb and Bb books, and so have not gotten around to releasing 3rd editions for the other keys. The editions are badly out of sync, in terms of the songs they contain, and sometimes even the key of the song. You can't use these split editions in an ensemble setting, so if you're getting this to play with friends who already have the older edition, avoid this one like the plague.

The low star rating, however, is for the song selection and generally hard-to-read (chords are too small, poor use of whitespace, and songs broken awkwardly across pages) typesetting  that you find in most Hal Leonard fake books.
