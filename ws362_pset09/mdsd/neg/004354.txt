On one hand, this book makes useful points and divorce and its impact on children and offers better alternatives.
The problem with it is that most of the evidence is anecdotal. I don't think a lot of the problems the people in the book had were due to divorce, but to the way their parents handled the divorce.
Many of them either leaned on their children too much for support or they went from giving their children attention and affection to ignoring them in favour of work and other mates.
A lot of the problems could have been lessened with more care. Especially in the case of the fellow who had a congenital heart defect. He needed attention and help, he didn't need to be shunted off to the side.
I'm also reading about attachment issues and how they can impact a person from the time they are a baby to an adult.
If a person has to divorce, they should ask themselves if it is the right thing to do and if all other options have been exausted. Forcing people to stay together in a stagnating marriage seems a bit cruel to me, like in the case of the intact family she used as an example. 
Also, I do not agree with her stating that children don't notice the tention and fighting in their family. They do. Children notice more than people give them credit for.
Like so many experts she paints with too broad a brush. She uses too many generalizations. It lessens the impact of her argument.
But, a lot of the advice she gives to the system could be used to make divorce easier on parents and children. Divorce isn't going away anytime soon, but, with responsibility and care perhaps it can be easier on children. It is hard for children to adapt to changes. I suggest looking at the advice she offers, but question her methods and conclusions
