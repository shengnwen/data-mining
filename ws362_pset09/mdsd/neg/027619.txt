This book is a joke! Don't even think about buying this book, unless you are a complete novice at cooking. I put this book on my wishlist, thinking it would give me some good recipes that I could whip up quickly, after coming home from work. What I found, aren't even really recipes, just lame instructions on how to go to the grocery store and buy a bag of salad and some dressing, etc. This book should be titled "Cooking For Dummies"!!
