Like others, I have read the whole Goldy Bear Culinary Mystery series and I have enjoyed each book...until now.  This book is slow to start and as I am only on page 100 after a week, hasn't picked up speed yet.  I can't get past Goldy wallowing in her sorrow.  Granted, I have never tripped over a dead body only to find out that it was my neighbor, but enough is enough already.   As another reader mentioned, there are a few disjointed parts for example, at one point Marla is driving Goldy to pick up Arch and Gus.  A couple of paragraphs later, Goldy is turning into the parking lot...but I thought Marla was driving???  I hope that this book was a fluke and Diane Mott Davidson will come back with a mystery of the same caliber that all of her fans have come to expect and enjoy
