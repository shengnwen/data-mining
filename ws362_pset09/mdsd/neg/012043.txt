I contemplated purchasing this online, but decided to take a look at it in a bookstore.  I'm glad I did.  If you're interested in learning yoga poses, look elsewhere.  Even if you're after a book that captures the beauty and art of yoga, look elsewhere.  The photos looked grainy and the book is so short and fat that it won't lie flat.  Keep shopping
