For the novice/beginner collector, this guide will serve as a basic introduction with lots of really great pictures and general information on some modern novelty candy containers. But for advanced/serious collectors, this guide is not helpful.  The valuation on most of these items is, in my opinion, inaccurate and historically there are many great items that were not included or mentioned. The organization of the items is poor and the authors could have really used this platform to give advice and encouragement or helpful information to current/future collectors. More research was needed
