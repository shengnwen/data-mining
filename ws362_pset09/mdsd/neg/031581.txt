I feel like I was tricked in to buying this book.  It had 5 star reviews and I was looking for something good to read.  Once I started to read it became obvious this is a very mediocre book.  I went back and checked the reviews and they were all written by people who had never reviewed other books.  I suspect they were "planted" to promote the book.  Unfortunately this seems to happen quite often on Amazon. Fool me once......
