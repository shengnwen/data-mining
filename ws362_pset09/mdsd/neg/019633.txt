I having nothing but praise for Ari Fleishcher's work as President Bush's press secretary.  But unfortunately, his decision to treat his book like just another press conference makes for a very disappointing, unsatisfying read.  What struck me the most was his failure to offer anything even remotely critical of the President.  His hero worship/adherance to the party line as press secretary makes perfect sense, but as an independent minded author, one is forced to question how in his years with the President, he failed to see a single thing that had been handled incorrectly.  Is this the immaculate Presidency?  Could anyone be that perfect?  As a supporter of President Bush, I was hoping to discern a more complete picture of his leadership skills and character.  But all you get here is a campaign ad.  He even spins the now infamous "Mission Accomplished" banner, using it as an opportunity to slam the press for failing to report the full breadth of the President's remarks.  I supported the war, but c'mon Ari, this was a screw up of monumental proportions in terms of public perception.  An honest statement like "we were right on the substance, but we made a big mistake in terms of giving our detractors ammunition" would have been welcome and refreshing.  Instead, like with most campaign commercials, after a while, you just stop listening and want to change the channel.
