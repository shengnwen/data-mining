Now I know that there is a difference a BIG difference between a songwriter, poet and comedian. I know this book is not intended to be funny, but to me the poetry "It is poetry:thoughts" was just funny to me. I cannot give this book a fair rating because it is not a fair book. When will songwriter, actors, atheletes,models whatever! realize that just because they are good at one thing, doesn't mean that they are good at the other! God help the corporate/mainstream talent industry
