It is a shame that a book on such an important topic as high pressure chemical processing has an introductory chapter that is so nauseating.  This is a great example of why technical writings should not be translated into English using a dictionary.  Rather, the text should be translated by someone with knowledge of the research area and a VERY GOOD knowledge of English.  There are many glaring examples of a poor understanding of English usage and grammar in the very first section of this book alone.  The rest of the text suffers from this section, and the native reader will likely decide to find another source of information rather than suffer through this volume.  My conclusion is that, aside from the list of citations, this book is an entire waste of time
