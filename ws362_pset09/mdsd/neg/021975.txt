I haven't read a ton of books on child development. I have a nine month old. I check Dr. Sears' Baby Book every once in a while. Surprisingly, I felt like this book had very little to teach me. Most of it I had heard before or seemed like it was just common sense. The references at the end of each chapter seemed slightly out of date and far from comprehensive. I only read the beginning as my child is not yet a toddler. Maybe it gets better. But for babies it felt like a waste of money
