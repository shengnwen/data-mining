I want to thank Mr. Kremer for altering me to ACW press.  Put ACW Press in google and you get christianbooks.com, a press with a strange (and apparently right wing book) list.  [When I went to the site, they were peddling a book about Saddam Hussein being an evil-doer extraordinaire--even if true, what does that have to do with Christianity?  Nothing, of course--it's just right-wing justification for Bush's disastrous unneccessary war.]
