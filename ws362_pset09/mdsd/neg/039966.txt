This shows all the hallmarks of another rigging of the review process by shameless spruiker Brad Sugars.

Notice all 5 star reviewers have only ever reviewed books by B.S. and .... low and behold they all recieve 5 stars, and most are thinly disguised promotions complete with embellished statements of the undoubted and profound effects it's purchase will have on your business, imploring you to buy it, complete with exclamation marks!

B.S. started Action International Business Coaching, with 700+ franchise holders, it seems to me a portion of those are working overtime through review writing to ingratiate themselves with "The Boss".

I don't doubt Mr B.S. has probably done some admirable things, but the two books of his that I made the mistake of purchasing (Instant Cashflow and Real Estate Riches) were the text equivalent of "Vaporware" with little beneficial content and many tired cliches.

So to summarise, boo to you Mr B.S., living proof that Snake Oil Salesmen never die, they just change industries, you've reached a new low..
