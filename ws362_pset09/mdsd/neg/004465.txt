I am a high school student and I am not ashamed to say that i have an affinity for children's literature, particularly english, such as Alice in  Wonderland, Harry Potter (all of them), and especially PETER PAN.  This  literature contains a magic that this author proceeds to bash at every  chance she gets.  I mean, are children supposed to read about oil spills  and war?  Preserve the magic of childhood people
