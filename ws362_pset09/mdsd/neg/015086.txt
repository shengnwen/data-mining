Not funny enough to succeed as satire, and certainly not erotic.  When I read the blurb annoucement that this was a satire on Voltaire's CANDIDE, my first reaction was, &quot;How do you write a satire of a satire?&quot;  The answer is, you can't; and CANDY ends up as just another tired, outdated...book.  Don't judge Southern by this novel...
