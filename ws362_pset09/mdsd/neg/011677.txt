The writer has such talent for making everything truly convincing, that I was very disappointed to realise, as I read, that this was really fiction. Too many inconsistencies and oddities. Kokopelli in Manitoba? boy, he's a long way from home! I've travelled in the South-West and known Navajo people, and Lakotas in South Dakota, and I've lived in Canada, though not Manitoba, and the points made by those who describe that western province are very convincing. No way do Andrews' descriptions ring true. 

The clincher was where at the end Andrews is strictly enjoined not to tell anyone of her experiences: she asks "what should I do" and is told "Write a book!" I think Andrews is almost slapping the more gullible readers upside the head! 

And it's sad, because on its own terms, it does in some ways convey a quite meaningful view of the world, and encourages us to be open to the deeper meanings and the spiritual connections and resonances of the natural world.  So I wish it were a real account, but as it isn't, I have to feel that such transformations of reality must do more harm than good. What happened to a medieval Christian when it was proved that the famous saint's relic everyone had revered was the bone of a dog's hind leg? Didn't it hurt the faith that had sustained him, and damage the good that was in that faith? Other reviewers have mentioned more accurate, reality-based reports of the shaman's world: I'll have to follow some of those up.
