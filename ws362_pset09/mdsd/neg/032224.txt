An excellent book for the same pretentious, self-congratulatory grown-ups who give themselves little kisses of self regard for their Channel 13 memberships and who shiver with uncontrollable pleasure at the very mention of "culture," or "art." Children, however, will be, as mine was, and I was, bored.  My child is too young to also have been repelled by Tony Kushner's fake, artsy-fartsy poeticisms that make reading the book out loud a tedius struggle, though he was not too young to have wondered, as I did, if an actual STORY was going to begin at some point. A good reliable general rule of thumb, especially where children's books are concerned, is that when critics fling about raves involving high school lit terms like "allegory" the cautious reader without a lot of loose pocket change will walk on by.  THE WILD THINGS, for eg, is a great book that hasn't got much of a story story, but that has a LOGIC and a story type rythym and language that doesn't try to force the ball out of the park
