So many dedicated viewers have benefited from Mr. Lehrer's extraordinary skills as a television journalist and host on/of his NEWSHOUR on PBS and as a moderator of Presidential debates.  For these endeavors alone, he can almost be considered a National Treasure.  His memoir A BUS OF MY OWN is also superb.  His PBS Special "My Heart, Your Heart" covered the treatment of heart disease, in a simple and understandable manner, better than anything I have ever seen (and also gave credit to the very worthy Dr. Oscar Mann, MD, an outstanding Washington-area cardiologist, who wrote his own inspiring memoir A JOURNEY OF HOPE).

With that said, I must admit that I was disappointed with THE PHONY MARINE.  The protagonist comes across as not very believable.  The supporting characters (e.g., a shark-like, former wife;  a rather wooden, not very plausible Fish & Wildlife special agent; two-dimensional co-workers, and so on) are also very weak.

While Mr. Lehrer gets the name of the University of Michigan right, Mr. Lehrer has the protagonist graduating from "Michigan Western State College" in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  The correct name of the institution is Western Michigan University, and that was the name of the place when the protagonist was supposed to have attended the university.

I was hoping for a better book.  I have also read Mr. Lehrer's other novels, and was similarly unimpressed.

Mr. Lehrer has enormous talent . . . but, IMHO, it does not extend to writing novels.
