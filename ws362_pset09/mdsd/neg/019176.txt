I began reading this book after the still birth of my son. I needed something comforting, this is not it. It's a "compasionate" view from a man who has no understanding of the pain he is dealing with and focuses mearly on his soap box on abortion. A tad condescending, I give him a break because he is a good man and a strong leader. He begins with a scripture out of context then explains it failing to back his explaination up with scripture (the biggest downfall of the book - since that is its main focus) or with reasoning. It really just frustrated me as you might be able to tell, and I wonder if Hayford has truely ever felt the loss of someone so close to him. Read "As I lay my Isaac Down" for a truely compassionate and meaty insight filled book on the subject. God bless you if you're searching in this subject, you're not alone
