My Lord John - a real disappointment - the book is so steeped in geneological detail on almost every page that it is almost incomprehensible - the main thrust of the story is lost, and the characters become confusing and uninteresting.

Definitely not one of the best of Heyer's work. The book is also unfinished, ending in the moddle of a sentence!

I would NOT recommend this book
