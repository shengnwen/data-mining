This text is a nightmare.  Terms are poorly defined, if defined at all, and examples are few and far between.  The illustrations are laughable.  I've seen better graphics in nursery books written 30 years ago.  If your professor assigns this text, and you're new to Java, be prepared to shell out more bucks for better sources or cruise the Internet to get the answers you need.  This book won't provide them.
