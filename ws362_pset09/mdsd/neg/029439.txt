As a writer of this time period, I thought this book would be useful to flesh-out my work and keep it as historically accurate as possible.  In this respect, I think it does a marginal job.

Most of my interest centres upon Britain and this book mainly focuses on the US (and not just urban locations such as New England, but the frontier states too).  So I suppose if you're looking for more European-based information it would be best to procure a different text.  The book is organised in a unique way, with such chapters as "Slang," "Around the House," and "Out on the Range."  Each of these chapters breaks down into a glossary of useful words and phrases pertaining to the chapter.  Sadly, the glossary represents the extent of the chapter.  

Little of the text works chronologically, which really doesn't make sense for such sections as "Clothing and Fashion."  Block text would actually be more useful in this section.  Illustrations would help too, but there really aren't any.  The entries are relatively cursory and superficial; this work probably best functions as a jumping-off point, but you'll probably want to buy additional books to describe your characters' clothing.

In total, this book offers good "bite" definitions for pertinent words and historical concepts, but that's about it.  It's more of a simple dictionary than an in-depth encyclopaedia
