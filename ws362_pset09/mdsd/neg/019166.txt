If you already know how to use another photo-editing program and you're transitioning to PhotoShop, this might just be the book for you. It has a rather clever and innovative way to show exactly where on a cluttered screen the item under discussion is, and it also has some decent "quick tips". The examples are also pretty good. However, I don't see how anyone can claim to write a book that will "teach" you a software program if it doesn't give you exercises to work your way through; Photoshop is way too powerful and complex to learn without also practicing. It also doesn't explain why you might want to use any of its myriad features/effects/filters. But as I said, if you're transitioning from another program and you already know what any photo-editing program should do, this could be an excellent choice
