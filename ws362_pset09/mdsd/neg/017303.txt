In general, my kid (14 months old) loves the Baby Einstein books. He has a lot of the board books, including the two large ones with bits of different textures (the touch and feel fun books "Violet's House" and "Baby McDonald on the Farm" which he LOVES). So I figured it would be a no-brainer to add this book to his collection.

It arrived yesterday and was put away on a shelf within minutes. While the illustrations are cute as always, the book itself is quite useless for a toddler my son's age. The pages are very thin and almost impossible to turn wihtout tearing them out even by an adult (I thought the spiral bound book would be a great idea and make it easier for him to turn the pages; maybe so in theory, but in practice this book is impossible for him to leaf through). The first page he tried to turn he tore out. The second too... then I took the book away.

As far as content goes, the title is misleading. Yea, there are 365 pictures with captions (in some cases several per page, in others one takes up the whole page) but they are by no means "activities". There is no logic to numbering these pictures as "days" except for the fact that there happen to be 365 captions. So when the book gives the impression that there's something in it for each day of the year, it is misleading.

In summary, neither the content nor the physical properties of the book are up to par. The only activity this book seems to offer is tearing out its fragile and thin pages, and there's not even 365 of those! Wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing
