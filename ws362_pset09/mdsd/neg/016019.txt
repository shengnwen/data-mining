Although it is argued (and mentioned on the cover) that this overview is revised, it seems to me a lot of 'ancient data' has escaped the attention of the compiler. Several regional and/or chronological sections contain information based on research now considered outdated. In fact, not just 'now' but even back in the early nineties when this revised edition was published. It is a pity that because of that many regional developments remain untouched: Where is central Mexico in this book? How about the Valley of Oaxaca (is 15 pages for Classic Oaxaca sufficient on any standard)? Etc etc. Only to those those who still consider Mesoamerica to be 'Maya and their neighbors' this overview will prove satisfactory. All others interested in an introduction to Mesoamerica should instead consider Smith and Masson's edited volume or Susan Toby Evans' recent compilation.
