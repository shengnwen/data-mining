This refers to the audio version of the book - I almost felt as though a ghost writter had written what I was hearing.  The narrator was not at all as good as Cherry Jones and for some strange reason Diane has resorted to some less than nice language that was not in the earlier books (that I have read and I have not read them all).  Too bad - this just doesn't rise to the level of her other books - a big disappointment
