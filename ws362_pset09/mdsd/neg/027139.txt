I read this The Mother Dance in order to "review" a book for a family relationships class. unfortunately, i felt so unmotivated by the authors writing style and lack of factual infromation and studies that i had to skim through it just to be able to finish my paper. Lerner breaks down the book into stereotypical highlights that many mothers come across in parenthood, but does not allow for single mothers or stay at home moms. also this is writen strictly from her vantage point. the majority stories are from the view of a feminist psychologist, who got pregnant later in life and had not really planned to have kids at all. Her testimonials are support for her narrarations and all come from a Heterosexual couples standpoint (which is smart, cause that is most likely who will buy this book). and when she does talk about minorities or underclass mothers, it is to preach about how there are too many social injustices in the world. the flow of the book seems like one never ending phone call, with one woman complaining about her kids, and the other one saying that she's been there too.If i was able to, i would return this book and try to get my money back. if you plan on buysing this, please at least brows through the first chapter at your local library or bookstore before you invest money into it
