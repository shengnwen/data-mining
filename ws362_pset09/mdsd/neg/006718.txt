I waited until I had read books 2 - 8 before I read this first book, and I was glad I did, because I wouldn't have read the other books if I'd read this one first.  But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.
   My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda.  The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught
