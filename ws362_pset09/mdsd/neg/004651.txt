Using the "search this book" feature led me to the same 9-word conclusion:  this book is full of fiber itself.  The fiber talk contained within helps to stave off reader hunger for more depth and compelling reading within.

I just wish the doctor bothered to look into L-glutamine, an amino acid that staves off hunger signals at the brain, making us THINK we're hungry instead of the stomach telling us.  I guess it was too much to hope for in light of farm subsidies and food politics
