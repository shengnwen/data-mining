This book does not reflect in any way the world of investment banking and really does resemble to an IBanker pitch book. This is especially fond in the ML director vaunting the his bank and how good they are with the new recruits. However, the Manager from DB drawn a pretty picture of the business and how it did built a department. Overall, it less than average book, Monkey business is a lot better.
