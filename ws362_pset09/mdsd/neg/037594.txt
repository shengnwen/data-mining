I don't think I would consider these the best loved poems. Yes, they are by classic authors. but in all honesty I found this to be just an average read of poems I could of found off the net.

My suggestion is, if your looking for brilliant poetry to check out Theological Immortal Romance by author Kevin Brian Wright here on amazon.
