I was very disappointed with the content and overall tone of this book.  I went to the library looking to find an unbiased guide of what to expect during the birth of my child, and instead came back with a very anti-medical diatribe that tells women why they should NOT have certain procedures.  I wanted to be able to read about what to expect, and then MAKE DECISIONS FOR MYSELF.  I question why this book was titled "The Thinking Woman's Guide" now, as it really gives you nothing to think about as much as it bestows guilt.

Goer fails to play devil's advocate on the side of obstetrics, again and again stating that there are no "pros" to some procedures and tests.  Oddly enough, the blurb on the book's back cover reads "But when it comes to one of the most important decisions of your life - how you will give birth - it is hard to garther accurate, unbiased information."  Interesting how Goer falls into the trap of bias herself
