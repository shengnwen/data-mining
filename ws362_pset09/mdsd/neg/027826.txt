It's a pretty sad world if the stories of Harry Potter cause controversy.  There is NOTHING controversial about these thrilling, fiction novels.  I feel that the churches should have other things to worry about... and if they do not, I am scared of our future.  Anyone who can find Harry Potter to associate with Lucifer has serious mental problems and should probably go see a psychiatrist
