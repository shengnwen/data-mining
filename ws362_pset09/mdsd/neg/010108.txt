I've occasionally enjoyed William F. Buckley's Blackford Oakes novels, but "Getting It Right" is by the far the worst novel he's written. While I commend Buckley for looking at two of the most extreme groups in American conservatism, his fictional treatment might have worked better as a memoir, since he himself was a pivotal player in many of the events shaping the course of the American conservative movement in the 1950's and 1960's. Instead he presents two one-dimensional protagonists who happen to fall in love, despite the fact that they are working for the political groups that are polar opposites of each other; the male protagonist for the John Birch Society, his female counterpart for Ayn Rand's Objectivist clique. Regrettably this novel was difficult to read through its entirety inspite of its relative brevity. I can only endorse it for those who are truly passionate about modern American conservatism and diehard fans of William Buckley's thoughts and prose
