although its a great idea, the CDROM is absolutely useless as a photo reference. this goes for figure drawing and other uses of the figure. the closeups are grainy at best and the navigation nothing more that a novelty  without high resolution.  the tutorial has some merit for just beginning,  but not really useful beyond a very short introduction. i am embarassed to  admit that i was lured into buying this book
