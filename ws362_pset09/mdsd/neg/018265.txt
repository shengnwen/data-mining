Rock Til You Drop is the quintessential screed every &quot;hip&quot;music journalist has against &quot;Dinosaur Rock&quot;. Trouble is, he doesn't even examine his own facts.  He admits early on that &quot;blame has to be laid at the feet of the boomers who continually support these over-the-hill acts&quot; and then goes on to spend the rest of the book taking on Jagger and Townsend. But that statement begs the question: if people are willing to spend their money that way, Jagger and Townsend have a right to keep delivering don't they? We KNOW cigarettes are bad, but if no one bought them, Phillip Morris would be out of business. Also, Strausbaugh takes on-exclusively- the behemoths of 70s-FM radio.  OK, so REO Speedwagon sucks.  But what about Tina Turner? If he had had the guts to take on the &quot;queen of rock an roll&quot;'s crappy Euro-pop which makes up 90% of her concerts before tossing out &quot;Proud Mary&quot; I would be more inclined to give him some props.  Or how about the Temptations, touring with only one original member left? (Ok he gets points for taking on icon Patti Smith) Also, I find that people who hate  70s rock acts are really just reacting to the unbelievable overplayed-ness of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; Stations.  Imagine, just imagine, Zep, Floyd, or the Stones had never sold more than a couple 100,000 copies. (Hard I know, but just try).  They'd be worshipped like the Velvet Underground and Big Star. Still, the book is quite good for a laugh, but best taken with the proverbial grain of salt
