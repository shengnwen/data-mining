Besides this book, I purchased at the same time The Insiders' Guide to Baltimore, which is $2.00 more and 150 pages longer.  I give this City Smart guide 2 stars, compared to a 5 star rating on the Insiders' Guide.     The reason for the wide difference in rating the two books: This book, City Smart, is trying to be hip, flippant, and tounge-in-cheek.  Instead, it comes off as very negative.  I purchased the two books at the same time, read this one first, and when I was done I really wasn't sure I wanted to visit Baltimore.      And that would be a mistake because Baltimore is indeed Charm City, and the other book really brings that out.  It has a much more upbeat, positive, optimistic, good-natured style; as well as more depth and details in the extra 150 pages.       The Insiders' Guide was true to the Baltimore I discovered, this City Smart guide was off-putting and off the mark
