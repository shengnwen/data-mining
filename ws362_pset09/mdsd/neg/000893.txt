I am not a negative person, however I do have some negative feelings about this book.  I have what I consider &quot;moderate&quot; sales experience, selling everything from shoes, to real estate, which is my current profession.  If you are looking for a book that gives you practical, applicable advice, this is not it.  It is more of a feel good, hey heres a few ideas that may help you in general type book. Basically a lot of mush.  I found myself having to sell my own self on even finishing the end of the book.  I made it, but my eyelids were heavy and I was totally uninspired.  I am truthfully surprised that this book has recieved such positive reviews.  In summary, it was a book of broad, unconnected ideas that will have little to no effect on actual sales performance or customer satisfaction
