I don't know what book the other reviewers read but it certainly wasn't this book. About half-way through the book I closed it, put it back in it's packaging, and asked amazon for my money back...It was just that bad. I don't call myself a singles expert, but I have read plenty of books on the single experience, and this, by far was a joke. The author seemed to have a problem with staying on the subject. She'd begin with a really great point then drift into a story about her friends or some wierd experience she had. It left me literally dazed and confused. I just didn't get it. How did the story relate to the point she was trying to make? At any rate, this book proves the saying once again, never judge a book by it's cover. The cover of this book has some really good key points to draw you in. The inside, however, is a hollow catastrophe.
