I'm going to say something that might sound odd: this is not a leadership book.  It deals pretty well with the everyday tasks and details of Churchill's style, but strangely not his &quot;executive success in the face of adversity.&quot; And Hayward's assertion that Churchill's style is  like that of an executive seems a little red-faced: Hayward spends a lot of  time defending against Churchill's critics that Churchill was disorganized  and a bad judge of character.  In all likelihood, he is forcing Churchill  into a category that he does not belong: indeed, Churchill may have been  disorganized, but he was a darn good prime minister. My opinion is that  Churchill deserves more than this. In place of this book, I would recommend  Lincoln On Leadership
