GREAT BOOK!  A great story with some mild, nose wrinkling, yucky stuff in all of the bugs the frog eats!  My 4,5 and 7 year old all enjoy this one.  I like asking the Kindergarteners if they are ready for lunch after I read it to them.  Great rhymes and fun pictures as well.  Another fabulous book with Karma Wilson's magic touch!  Great gift idea
