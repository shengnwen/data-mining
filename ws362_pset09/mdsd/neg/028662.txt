Let's see, where to begin? Take a Walter Mosley novel. Update it to the present day. Remove all the colorful characters and their exquisitely crafted dialogue, the period detail, the suspense, the action, the plot. Add guy fantasy-type hard core porn. Waaaay too much. An entire encyclopedia of it, in fact. Throw in a few gratuitous race baiting scenes and tales of abuse and incest, just so you know it's still Walter Mosley. What do you get? A regrettable little bore of a book. Why are we expected to care about his protagonist: 40-ish nebbishy cuckolded jerk who finds his inner stud with a porn star (in a platonic relationship, no less!) designer drugs and an improbable stable of willing babes. The 60's are over. Sex and drugs won't will cure whatever ails you. Really. Go back to writing great books, Mr. Mosley. I am mighty disappointed in you at the moment.
