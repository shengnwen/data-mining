I purchased this book after having read a story in the Boston Globe about speech and how important it is when giving presentations or job interviews.  I hoped that this book would give me better speaking skills.  To this end, there are some good points in this book, but they are buried between the name dropping and self promoting that the author does will annoying frequency.  

For example, the skill that seems to be the cornerstone of the techniques presented in this book is a method of breathing.  The author explains that not everyone gets this method at first and describes how one famous client (yet another name drop) required five one hour sessions before she got the hang of it.  Yet, the author expects the reader to be able to learn the breathing method from the one paragraph that she dedicates to explaining the method.  

In summary, I believe that it is possible to learn some skills from this book, but I wish that the author spent more time explaining the skills and less on self promotion.  You may want to consider another book
