Think carefully before buying this book.  You won't finish it.  The author spends most of his time describing (but not really analyzing) numerous works of art which are not illustrated in the book.  At first, I tried to look up each image online, but with the number of paintings he writes about, it quickly became impossible. It is pointless (not to mention boring) to read the descriptions without being able to see the works themeselves. A very small number of paintings are illustrated in the book, but even they are in black and white. The biographical portions of the text are interesting, but the book is perhaps 1/3 biography, 2/3 description, which makes it impossible to get through
