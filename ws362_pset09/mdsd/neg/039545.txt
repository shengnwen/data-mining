Having traveled to Tanzania, Ecuador, and through Europe and Canada on useful, reliable LP guidebooks, I was highly disappointed with LP China. During my trip, I spent time in Beijing and the Yunnan Province. The book was fine for Beijing and all its tourist sites, but don't assume that this book will lead you to any "undiscovered" gems in the great west. Instead we found ourselves in tourist trap after tourist trap (e.g., Dali, Lijiang) based on the cities LP China decided to highlight. We finally ended up finding a Chinese native guide who led us off the beaten track at which point the journey became interesting! But in the meantime, we wasted several days in pursuit of the charming, cultural, ethic towns and villages that the guide promised, each time our hopes destroyed by modern hotels and shopping centers aimed towards Chinese toursists (Lijiang is a great example of this). I don't mind if the book covers these tourist destinations, but PLEASE warn those of us who want to visit unspoiled places that we are walking into a tourist nightmare! This book does no such thing. I would not trust the descriptions if you want to have a unique and special adventure in China. It seems as though in the hurry to get out a new version to take advantage of increasing overseas tourist interest in China, they rushed a book out barely updating it from the previous version. Shame on you LP. I will think twice before buying your books again as my default travel guides
