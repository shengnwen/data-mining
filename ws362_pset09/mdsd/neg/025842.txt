If you are looking for a fun, trivia-type book, then this is the book to buy.  I was looking for a book that would provide more detail than what this book does.  It is laid out like a high school scrapbook....lots of pictures, many trivial pieces of information, etc.  Many of the captions on the photos were ok, but the authors didn't elaborate on some of the most interesting ones.  I guess I was expecting more than what was delivered
