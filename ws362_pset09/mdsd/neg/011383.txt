I was so disappointed in this book.  The author was so negative that the book was one great big downer.  After the misery of making it through this book, it became clear that it was written by someone who just doesn't get the whole disney thing.  I returned the book and purchased birnbaums and fodors guides which are about 100% better and written in a positive manner.  My husband and I have been to disney world and disneyland many times over the years and are planning our first trip with our children.  No one who feels that the majority of the theme parks are too "hokey" for them, has any business writing a guide for others
