Being interested in pharmacological psychedelics and their effects, I was most disappointed by this mundane travelogue. I struggled immeasurably to get through this tome. I kept aiming it at the trash can, but kept telling myself it was going to get better. It didn't and it ultimately ended up there. I expected an adventure novel into alternate dimensions or Davis' personal journey into mind altering hyper-dimensions. It was not to be. I understand the importance of Schultes work. All psychonauts owe this man a debt of gratitude. But this book is a tedious retracing of every footstep this man made in his discoveries, along with Wade Davis' personal journey and dealings with Schultes. Very dry reading in my opinion. SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW is a better book. Readers should be warned this is NOT a psychedelic adventure story, but a tiresome travelogue of plant classification. Important, I suppose, if that's what you're looking for. I prefer Schultes' own book PLANTS OF THE GODS. It's wonderfully illustrated and an easier read. Or if you're looking for a true psychonaut's adventures in South America, I'd suggest reading anything by Terence McKenna. He was one strange and brilliant fellow. Or THE COSMIC SERPENT by Jeremy Narby. Frankly, I'm surprised by the glowing reviews for this book. I found it to be quite boring.

Speaking of Wade Davis, there was a rumor some years ago that he was living amongst the Rastafarians in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica and planned to write a book about it. Now, that would be fascinating.
