I cannot fully express how disappointed I was after reading this massive report on complexity foundations.  The pre-release hype would have one believing that Wolfram was the next Newton or Einstein, with this book describing some paradigm-shifting new observation about science and our universe.  Unfortunately, the only one who seems to believe that this work is brilliant is Wolfram himself, whose self-congratulatory accolades color the text throughout the book.  So okay Mr. Wolfram.  I got it.  You believe you are supremely brilliant and anyone who doesn't agree is supremely dense.  But really, the observations in this books are almost self-evident at a level of "duh!" as rendered by a surly Napoleon Dynamite, "Gosh, everyone knows that!"  So, if you've got the stomach to sit through hundreds of pages of redundant charts, graphs and text... and if you can handle a massive missive of self-absorbtive congratulations, then go ahead and see if you can discover "A New Kind Of Science."  All I found was the old kind of self-delusion.
