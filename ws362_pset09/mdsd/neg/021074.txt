Contains many well corroborated general guidelines regarding improved diet and nutrition. However, the author often takes these guidelines to the extreme. Discerning readers will carefully consider his recommendations before implementing them.

And I doubt that microwave ovens render meat protein useless. Also, Dr. Young seems to have too many proprietary interests which of course raise questions about potential conflicts of interest and, therefore, the validity of his dietary claims.

I am juicing green vegetables daily and love it. I expected more from a Ph.D.
