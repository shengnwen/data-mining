This book is what I'd call repetetive and boring. It's not the type of book I'd read if I had no other choice. It was recommended to me and every time I turned the page, I hoped it would get better. But it was basically the same story almost every time. The same idea that racism is hard. We know that. This book states that more times than is necesary. So unless you are terribly interested in Vietnam or black history, I suggest you read something else
