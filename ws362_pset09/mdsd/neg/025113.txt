I believe this book is dangerous because it DOES have wisdom in it and DOES have some Biblical teaching- but intermingled with that are false teachings and concepts that will easily lead a struggling Christian parent astray. My heart aches for all those who gave this book fantastic reviews and said it changed the way they parent their children.

One thing that tipped me off about this book was how the author uses the verses in Proverbs to justify a Biblical mandate for spanking. He says that if we do not spank our children, we are disobeying God. No one should claim to know God's will so absolutely, especially based on his own intrepretation of a few verses. I actually am not opposed to spanking, done appropriately. But I do not believe that the "rod of correction" referred to in the Bible means that spanking is the only way to discipline a child. To me the rod is symbolic of any form of godly, loving discipline. 

I am somewhat suspicious that the reason many parents are thrilled with this book is because it has given them a handbook for parenting- telling them how to handle their children in a practical manner that fits with their beliefs as a Christians. As Christians we strongly believe in raising our children to love and obey God- which is why it's so tempting to pick up a book like this and believe everything the author says. It's easy that way! And also very dangerous!

Please, pray and seek God's wisdom as you read through the reviews. Please consider purchasing a different book and always listen to the gentle leading of the Lord over the teachings of man.
