I hated this book.  This family has two girls, Racie and Jaynell.  Rachie is a girly-girl and Jaynell is a tomboy.  It seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa.  Her parents are just plain crazy.  Mama repedily whipped Racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to "tear up" their hides each time they do something he does not like.  Once Jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar, nearly strangleing her, and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize. Then Jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on Racie.  Her parents are just crazy.  Then grandpa dies.  Dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it.  I understand that sparking fear in a child's eye is a good thing.  Children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy.  Racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs.  Jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful.  These people were crazy.  This book is crazy
