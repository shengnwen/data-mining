This book reads like a bad psych textbook from the 60's &amp; 70's; because thats basically what it is.  There are some masculine universal truths but you really have to search for them.  The case studies &amp; occupations are dated &amp; irrelivent to baby boomers in the 21st century and not very helpful IMHO.  Still there are a few pearls and saving graces but you really have to work hard to read this one
