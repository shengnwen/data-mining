Honestly, I knew with certainty who the killer was before Poirot showed up, on page 76.  It was very difficult to anticipate how the murderer did it, because basically that technique wouldn't have worked more than one time in a hundred.  And the motive was difficult to figure out, basically because there wasn't one.  I bought my copy in an airport transit lounge, and it served the purpose of killing two hours and introducing me to Agatha Christie and to Hercule Poirot.  Overall, though, I think I'll stick to Sherlock Holmes.  Oh, and don't buy this book expecting to learn about Iraq or archeology
