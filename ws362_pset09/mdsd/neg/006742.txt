In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.

from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as  a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.

everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.

it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses.
