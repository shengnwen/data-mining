 
 

The book Many Lives, Many Masters tells a fascinating story.  I am thankful to the book especially for all these reviews, that are about far more than the book itself. They show a beautiful wide rainbow of states of mind.  Our Mind. 
The single heart and soul warming story in this book creates many new questions for all of us, who are on our way to the spiritual awakening, trying to access the higher levels of our consciousness. 
There are many people, who already KNOW, what the others only BELIEVE, or want to know or believe.  
On our way there and in your quest for more, I recommend reading the book "I am me I am free" by DAVID ICKE, who shares his great experiences and knowledge in his very special own unique fantastic and loving way.    

Congratulations to all of us.  We deserve to be admired and praised.  

FIVE STARS to EVERY ONE OF US and still, let's shoot for more!!!
 
And, not to worry.  All we don't learn here, we will find out exactly how it is, when the right time comes.  It will be even much nicer, than we now think.  Wanna bet
