This is not a good, representative peice of Tupac's life nor his career.  The work tries to demonize 'Pac, the same thing the media has been doing since he hit the scene.  What is also disheartening about the book is that  it fails to explain the method to Tupac's &quot;madness.&quot;  It is as if  he was just some young, black troubled youth with overrated skills.  Along  with Ronnin' Ro and others, this is clearly a flawed and biased East coast  (New York) peice of work that is played out too much in hip hop; nothing  near the &quot;critical analysis&quot; or &quot;tough love&quot; that the  author claims it to be.  It's sad that a movie may one day be based on this  dirt. Buy The Rose that Grew from Concrete, Got Your Back, Hip Hop America,  The Three Wolves, anything but this garbage
