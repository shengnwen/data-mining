I'm sorry to report that Alan Cooper appears to be years out of touch with the software industry.  He lobbies for a new 'interaction design' class of professionals working toward designing how the user sees the system - but the industry started doing these things a good 15-20 years ago.  Also, he assertions that "in software, typically nothing is visible until it is done" is just plain wrong today; 20 years ago that was true but the software industry today uses storyboards, paper usability reviews, UI mockups, prototypes, etc all with the intent of designing a user friendly interface before the first line of code is written.  He starts off with flawed assumptions and ignorance and goes downhill from there.

For simple entertainment value and getting to vent frustration about bad systems I give the book 1 star, but if you're actually serious about understanding and improving software development, you're much better off reading any of a handful of books about "use case analysis"
