I bought this book to fill in gaps in my knowledge of Christian history.  I stopped reading after 15 pages when I found a second egregious error.  I am no scholar.  But when I read something I'm not sure of, I try to research it.  

On page 7 the author claimed that the writer of John's epistle was James.  All of the sources that I consulted confirmed that John's epistle was written by John.

On page 15 the author stated that Paul journeyed to Spain in his travels.  As I thought, checking other sources confirmed that Paul never traveled west of Italy.  

While these might seem like small things, the errors destroyed the book's credibility for me.  How could I trust the other material where my knowledge is weaker
