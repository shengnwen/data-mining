There is simply not enough value in this book to justify using it.  I'm sorry but words like Alta Vista and Cisco just should not appear anywhere in a value investing book.  Period and discussion over.  At least not up to the present.  Maybe in the future but I doubt it.  Also there is way too much verbage to describe much of nothing.  The modern budding value investor would be better served by other book including Security Analysis by Graham.  A lot of detail is missing here and much of the analysis leaves one wondering if the authors know what value investing really is
