Hang on a minute.  I don't understand what's going on here...The book is called 'Halliwell's Film, Video And Dvd Guide 2005 by John Walker' according to the front cover.  So who wrote it?  Leslie Halliwell or John Walker?

Leslie Halliwell was a superlative film critic/historian, but he died in 1989.  It shouldn't be allowed for a book to be called 'Halliwell's...' unless it's written by him alone. The fact is that Halliwell is NOT a brand name.  It's the name of an author who died in 1989.  He wrote the entire books himself - He wasn't just the curator of a collection - he was an author in his own right.  To start adding further reviews by John Walker means it is no longer Halliwell's guide. Simple as that...

Why isn't there a Walker's Film, Video And Dvd Guide 2005 by John Walker? Presumably because it wouldn't sell as many copies.

If you want the genuine Halliwell article then please search out ebay for copies from the 80s.  

What next?  The complete Works of Shakespeare by John Walker?
