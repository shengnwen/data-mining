I will admit that the story moved so slowly that I almost gave up on finishing the book.  The similarity between how the two young men died had me stopping to think, "okay, which one is she talking about now?"  I found it a bit confusing.  While I "almost" gave up on the book, I'm glad I didn't because I at least learned what a Chinese Partnership is!  I had never heard of that.  

I think Ms. Monroe very accurately portrayed the southern way of life and the uneasy relationship between blacks and whites even when both races are trying to reach out to each other.  

She also used the character of Adele to very ably show how greed can take precedence over family ties.  Adele justified her behavior by saying that her mother had always promised that the family home would be hers and then when her parents died everything was left to Adele's brother.  I can understand her frustration in this because knowing my love of reading my father had always told me that he wanted me to have his books.  Now there was no great monetary value to these books.  Their value was strictly sentimental; however, I very much wanted to have them because they had belonged to my father.  Unfortunately, he did not put anything about the books in his will and when my parents died, my older brother came in and scooped the books up and took them all.  I saw another similarity between Adele and my brother because it seemed that the accumulation of money was the most important thing in both of their lives.

I guess I am glad I read this book but it is not one I will keep because I cannot imagine myself ever plodding my way through it again.
