It is clear that Professor Butler does not know Greek, knows little or nothing about both ancient Greek culture and the critical tradition of the play.  This work is a travesty of scholarship at every level: it is poorly written and tendentious, but above all it will be totally irrelevant to the group of scholars whom Butler might have intellectually transformed (or at least moved), namely, classicists.  The already converted will find this book indispensable--I can see it gathering dust on many theorists' bookshelves next to those other books it is so necessary to own, but never read (e. g., Bourdieu's Distinction and Derrida's Glas).  I await the day when academics as smart as Butler clearly is actually try to speak to people outside a coterie audience
