I enjoyed alot of the facts in this book and I really enjoyed the excerpts from FBI files and such, but I did not enjoy the main author.  This book has some real valid and promising advice, but the author injects himself into the book far too much.  This book seems less like advice and more like a publicity campaign for the author.  Co-authored by Diane Holloway Ph.D., who did alot of the research and I believe is responsible for the excerpts I did enjoy.  If you're a die-hard Detroit fan, then I say go ahead and get this book but be warned the author has a pretty crummy current view of the city that's unfair and biased especially since he doesn't live here anymore
