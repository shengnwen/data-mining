   Never have I seen an author do so little with so much. Mr. Rodríguez seems to have taken all the most promising material he could think of - the Roaring 20's, promiscuous gay sex, a bearded lady, an exotic tropical island, communist plots, murder, the supernatural (to name a few examples) - and simply thrown it against the wall to see what would stick. Somehow the author's writing style fosters detachment rather than engagement; I never really connected with the main characters or got swept up in the narrative. In this author's hands the Roaring 20's become the Boring 20's, and I struggled to finish the book.

   The germ of an engaging novel is there - in the ongoing commentary by Eleonora Duse. She is the most interesting and well-developed of the characters in the book. However, I believe that the author has a very cinematic imagination, and that the shortcomings of the book result from an inability to translate the fabulous movie that he sees in his head into compelling prose. (One sees this most clearly in the Arabian Nights party scene, which would be fantastic on film, but falls strangely flat on the page). I only wish that Rodríguez had separated his material and written a novel about Eleonora's life, and turned the rest into the Fellini-esque movie of his dreams.

My recommendation: skip the book and wait for the movi
