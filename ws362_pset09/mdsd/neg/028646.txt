I decided to try the Covington books because they were supposed to be in the same vein as Jan Karon's Mitford and Ann B. Ross' Miss Julia books.  I am a huge Mitford fan, with the Miss Julia books being some of my next favorites.

The Covington books have a good potential story line, but the characters are very two dimensional and spend lots of time discussing trivial things.  I found the dialogue to bounce around a bit, and some of the character's thoughts and actions seem to come out of nowhere, without sufficient background or detail being laid.

Frankly, I also missed having some humor in the story line, though there are ample places that it could have been incorporated.  I guess this is consistent with the "flat" feeling I had about these books.
