I stumbled upon this book in my local bookstore and figured I would give a previously unknown author to myself a chance. Truly going into this book with an open mind, I was mostly disappointed with the experience afterwards. The story felt somewhat formulaic and the characters were very one-dimensional. Add to that the amount of gratuitous gore and sexually explicit references and it amounts to nothing more than a B movie. I would probably only recommend this novel if it's already sitting on your shelf and you've read everything else.
