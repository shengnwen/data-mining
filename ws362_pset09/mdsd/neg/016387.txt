The problem with all Indian cultural analysts living outside India including those writing on cinema is that while they fulfill a mandatory understanding of the cultural theories in vogue at the undergraduate level  in the US, Europe and Australia, they display a singular lack of  sensitivity while dealing with the material at hand. Their survival,  therefore, depends almost entirely on their reader's lack of knowledge of  the field of study which will include amongst other things the native  language, the local history as well as the local lores. On all these counts  Ms Chakravarty's book is sadly lacking in a defined sincerity of purpose.  There are pieces of information which cannot bear testimony - the  relationship of Ali Akbar Khan with the Navketan Productions, for one.  There are descriptions - such as the music composer SD Burman being  described as a baul singer - which are downright ridiculous. And, of  course, her command of the Hindi language is unquestionably poor! Surely  the West and the East deserve a better introduction to the Indian cinema  than this book
