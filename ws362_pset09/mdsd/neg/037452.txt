Amateur writing.

This book seems to be written for pure comical entertainment, because I just can't stop laughing. Perhaps some desperate editor found this series on a Fan Fiction website since that's all it really is. When I purchase books I don't only hope for a good plot but for good writing, like most people I'd assume. This book doesn't show either of those. Now I've given the novel two stars because I am a pious `Lost' fan and love to hear the story from other people's point of view and it wasn't totally incomprehensible.
