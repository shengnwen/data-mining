I've always liked John Barnes writing: Orbital Resonance, A Million Open Doors, PARTICULARLY The Man Who Pulled Down the Sky, just a long list of well-written books with excellent SF ideas. But about four years ago he ran into some sort of Block in his writing, and he's been doing brain candy for awhile. Gaudeamus, while having reasonably interesting dialog and at least one "indicated" character who is interesting (Travis), is so badly written that it's embarassing. By this I mean that it doesn't have any character development and the whole story is told by a hokey "reminiscence" trick, where Travis sits down and talks for an hour at a time, with all sorts of non-germane sidetracks. When the aliens show up, Travis and John (who is writing the adventure -- right?) are both drunk, which is supposed to explain any possible errors in the plot. The problem is that the "plot" just kind of passes by in a haze (...and then we saw the aliens land and they wanted to buy the Island of Manhattan! Ha, ha!) I hope John Barnes gets himself together again soon. I can't read this. (I skipped to the end to see what "happened": nothing.) Remember, I LIKE John Barnes, but some people reviewing this can't tell a non-plot when they see it and gave it a misleadingly high average rating
