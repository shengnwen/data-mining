I am a Rita Mae Brown fan and have been from her early novels on.  I own and have read all of the "Mrs. Murphy" Mystery series.  This book is awful.  I can't believe she wrote it. I had to force myself to finish it.  Characters did things that didn't work.  The writing was just plain bad. Technical facts about wine and grapes and terrorism and you name it are thrown together and not wrapped in much story. Even the dialog is flat. I've enjoyed every topic Ms. Brown has tackled in the past because of her excellent writing so I concluded she is either ill, has writer's block, or had a crazy deadline that stopped the creative juices. Read any of the other books in the series, but don't bother with this one
