and when didn't buy a new edition and I got out from behind my computer and started making cold calls, I got published. I know the pain of writing for so very long with no recognition. All I can say is that maybe this book can make you feel better temporarily, thinking you have some kind of inside track that nobody else has (LOL), but the only way to get published is to make your own inside track. This book won't help you do it
