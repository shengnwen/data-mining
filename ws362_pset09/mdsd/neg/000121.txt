I ordered HOW I STOLE HER HUSBAND after reading all the positive reviews here and thought I would get get a fun breezy romance type novel much like you can find it in any one of Jackie Collins books.  Reading it was very disappointing and rater boring and I'll explain why: 

The main character Alison takes a job as nanny for Peppers 3 year old daughter August, which is lengthly drawn out over 100 pages including all the likes and dislikes of this job.  Also we learn that Pepper seems to cheat on her husband Spence.

Spence, which we know has been Alison's High School Sweetheart, is on a business trip to Hong Kong, and noticeable absent the majority of the time, even Alison states on page 104 "I had begun to think of Spence as just an occasional talking point, not really part of the household".  Maybe I was wrong to begin with but I thought the romance between Alison and Spence was supposed to be the major plot line.

When he finally appears, he Alison and August go together to a restaurant the used to go back in High School talking about old times, still no romance building up yet.

Then the whole clan moves to New York, we learn that Pepper has another affair there; Alison, Spence and August go to central park together and one evening they go out to dinner without August and start kissing each other after that.  A few days later Alison moves into Spence's hotel room, and a week after that she decides to leave him after finding out he had had an affair with the prior nanny too.  Within a few days later than that she starts a new relationship with this guy Finn she knew.

This book is more a run down of events than any kind of a  romantic story, everything just seems to happen for no reason, I miss the gradual  growing attraction between Alison and Spence.  For me that makes this book a major disappointment
