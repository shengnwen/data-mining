Where's the father in this story?  With all the unfortunate divorcing going on in this world, I plan to inundate my child with stories about happy families with both a mom and a dad.  If it doesn't work out for him when he grows up and gets married, at least I can say I tried my best.  I'm tired of forcing the feminist agenda on our kids.  They need to know that not having a GOOD husband/father at home is not a good thing. Also, I thought the book was boring and the chair was ugly.
