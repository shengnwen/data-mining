This is perhaps the most expensive book besides collectables. Judging from the size and amount of information, it probably worths $5 - but I had to buy it simply because the professor uses it as textbook.
Granted that this is a book for business management professionals or to-be's, but this does not mean the book should be this expensive. You'll know what I mean when you see the book. I think they they are taking advantage of that fact that most people buy this book get reimbursed - my self for one will get reimbursement from my company, but I resent the fact that I have to buy such an expensive book and waste my company's money only because I have to. This is robbery - it's not printing book, it's more like printing money
