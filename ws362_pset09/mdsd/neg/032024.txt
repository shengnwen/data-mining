This book is very vague and general in content. In trying to determine how much of our home office furniture was deductible I looked up &quot;furniture&quot; and the book points you to &quot;Business Assets&quot; and within business assets there is no mention of furniture or like assets. What is written is a short very general list what &quot;might&quot; be deductible. I expected 422 deductions to be &quot;specific deductions&quot; or more importantly &quot;how to determine&quot; the eligibility of deductions. This book is far to vague to understand what is deductible and how to determine the eligibility
