It's beyond my comprehension how this book made #2 on the NYT list of the best novels of the last 25 years.  While it's well-written (in a structural, grammatical sense), it's devoid of any semblance of a plot or story line.  There were so many extraneous, disconnected sections that it made me wonder whether Mr. Delillo was somehow able to publish this book without the scrutiny of an editor.  My only satisfaction was in persevering to the end of this ponderous tome
