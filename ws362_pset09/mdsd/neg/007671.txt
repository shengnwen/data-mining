I think the author is a brilliant physicist with some incredible ideas, but he sure didn't express them in this book.  As stated by others, there a various anecdotes (many which are funny and enlightening), but most without real relevance.  I bought the book to learn about his ideas, but alas this book seems to be written for someone with a significant background in the subject matter already. My rating is really based on the readability (which is poor) since the book did such a poor job of relating his ideas I can't judge those
