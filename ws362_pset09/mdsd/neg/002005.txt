This is a boring textbook. No real indepth stuff here. Not software specific and not helpful to people want to actually learn computer animation. If you want to "read about" and discover all the wonderful terms and the history of-what to call things then maybe. Don't be drawn in by its heavy use of well known imagery and pretty pictures. It just doesn't have substance. I wish they had renamed this book- with a subheading stating language and terminology.

Look at the firt edition which is now $6.00. Art is a learnt through application. A large point of understanding concepts is to apply them. This book lacks showing the latter.
