This book is an insult. Sure, there are some facts about this television series, but the book seems directed at people whose IQ would never permit them to understand what is going on on-screen. The print is large with huge margins and wide spaces between lines of print. Had they printed it in regular format, the 300 pages could have neem accomodated in 200, which seems a blessing when one thinks of wasted trees. The language is on a 6th-grade level. This is bad enough, but why didn't the publishers provide even minimal proof-reading services? The book is chock-full of typos and grammatical errors that would embarrass anyone. There are even sentences that simply stop in the middle and hang there on the page looking like a bloody limb hanging off one of the palm trees on the beach of the survivors' island.

This book is a true embarrassment and shame. The writing is all right - no better - but the quality control is simply non-existent. How can anyone be this uncaring?

There are other Lost books on the market. Any of them would be better than this one
