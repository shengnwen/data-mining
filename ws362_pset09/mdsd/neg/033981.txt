Lev Manovich claims to have been trained in computer science. If he had any respect for the field, he would not have filled his book with deliberate misstatements about the nature of digital media. He uses these misstatements to fill out his narrative about the development of new media, and in doing so misinforms the "new media artists" he purports to educate.

The writing is reflective of Manovich's speaking/lecturing style: factually lazy, fluffed up with pointlessly obtuse language, and above all else BORING. 

If you are an artist looking to understand the development of new media, look elsewhere, as you will only be bored and misinformed by Manovich. If you are a computer scientist looking for media theory, you will also be bored, but also possibly offended by the lazy treatment of your area of expertise
