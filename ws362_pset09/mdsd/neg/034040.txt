In spite of enjoying most Patterson fiction and in spite of enjoying Will Patton readings of contemporary authors, this set is a dud. Not Patterson's best work and even Will Patton's reading cannot save this from being a work best not listened to in traffic or while operating heavy machinery. ZZZZZ
