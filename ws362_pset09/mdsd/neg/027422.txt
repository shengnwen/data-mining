I was really disappointed especially because I had read so many positive reviews of the book. It very boring and the only exercises there actually were was one little chapter. The book was more of an autobigraphy of the author as well as about the history of the acceptance of women's masturbation which I could have read online if i wanted to. I wouldn't consider this a self-help book at all.
