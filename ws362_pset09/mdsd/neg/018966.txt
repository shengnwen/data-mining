I agree with reviewer Carol C. "ccjello" (Kansas City, MO USA) who noted the authors comments re: 'It is filled with simplistic filler -- like lists of types of men & descriptions of each. For example, the "Jock" has "great sexual stamina" and "likes a screamer in bed." The "Nerd" "will go with you to flea markets" and has "kinky Star Trek fantasies", but, the author cautions, "don't bother with a Nerd if sex is vitally important to you". The author advises that take up sailing if you're looking for "Republicans and politically conservative men"; take up rock climbing if you like "high achievers" who are "always reaching for the top." Scuba divers are "deep"; runners "go the distance in relationships." You get the idea -- stereotypes abound'.  which is so odd since I was married close to four decades (am a widow) to a nerd who had more stamina than any 'jock' I dated before I married.

Perhaps dating isn't what the book is about, but more along the lines of how to find a man who will be a pal and sex buddy.  It obviously isn't for the serious man or woman who wants to develop a long relationship or marriage
