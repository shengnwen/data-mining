Fix-it and Forget-It:
5-Ingredient Favorites/
Comforting Slow-Cooker Recipes

By Phyllis Pellman Good

This is an interesting collection of more than 700 recipes gathered by Good from home cooks all over the country, said to be, "flexible, forgiving and absolutelyt scrumptious." It's a great book for busy young people who've never really learned to cook and need to stick to a budget. 

Good has set herself up with firm ground rules for the use of the term, "5 ingredients." First water doesn't count as an ingredient, salt and pepper count for only one, optional ingredients do not count against the 5. Also things "served with" do not count, as well.

She hastens to offer the fuller the slow cooker, the longer the cook time, so also is it this way with densely-packed contents and large chunks. 

Each recipe has a heading which includes home cook's name, number of servings, preparation time, cooking time and ideal slow cooker size for amounts given.
