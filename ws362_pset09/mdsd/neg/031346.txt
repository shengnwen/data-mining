This is a very strange book: it isn't a book of philosophy and it isn't a book for practice on Personal Time Management.

If you are a CEO or a Vice president you could find something useful (but we hope you've a philosophycal background far more interesting than this book suggests..) but if you're a down on the earth worker .... forget it! When your chief demands the impossible ... explain her/him that  you're a value oriented people and .... find yourself ... fired in 2 seconds!!!
