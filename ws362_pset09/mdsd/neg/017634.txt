Single motherhood seems like a good idea, when seen from the point of view of a woman. But it is not the woman the weakest human being involved in this equation but the child. So there comes some facts:

1. "A survey of 108 rapists undertaken by Raymond A. Knight and Robert A. Prentky, revealed that 60 percent came from female-headed homes, that 70 percent of those describable as "violent" came from female-headed homes, that 80 percent of those motivated by "displaced anger" came from female-headed homes."

2. Ramsey Clark in 1970, in his celebrated book "Crime in America", wrote, in discussing the male juvenile criminals who are a threat to the public, that "three-fourths came from broken homes."

The dirty little secret of this "single motherhood" phenomenon is that it doesn't produce better children than the old-fashioned family. Most criminals come from fatherless families. The poorest households are those with one parent. Children of a single mother achieve less in life than the rest, they have less sanity and they have no models of male responsibility so they tend to repeat the circle. A child needs a mother and a father (no, not a neighbour neither an uncle, but a daddy). 

I know that some women are not able to get a lifetime partner who helps them raise the children. But if this happens, it's best to remain childless. Please ladies, grow up. The world does not revolve around your reproductive wishes. Everybody has wishes that cannot fulfill. Don't make pay innocent human beings for your selfishness.
