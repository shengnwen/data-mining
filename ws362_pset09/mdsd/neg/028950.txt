Did you know that Burroughs was straight?  Or Ginsburg?  Yep -- not a word about their homoerotic interests, either in the poems selected (or oddly slashed up) or in the intros.  We do find out that Orlovsky was Ginsburg's &quot;companion&quot; -- is this the year 1928? The editor evidently thinks  so. Instead of providing an honest introduction to Beat work, she inflicts  salacious, incredibly obscure pieces upon us, like a 6-page rant from  Michael McClure about (and I quote) &quot;woman woman woman woman woman  woman woman.&quot; This anthology tells us a lot about the editor's  personal idiosyncracies, but it is not a balanced portrayal of the Beats
