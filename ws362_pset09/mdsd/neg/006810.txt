I would like to thank Joan Peters for confirming that concocting a fraud is still an American tradition.  The fallacious arguments presented in Peters thesis are discredited by her active participation in commiting a fraud.  For anyone really interested in the facts about this book and the Israel-Palestine conflict I highly recommend Norman Finkelstein's book, Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict.  Supporters of Joan Peters are simply supporting the disinformation that has lead to the unbalanced opinion of the US today.  The rest of the world recognizes this piece of literature as a fraud.  Please take the time to look at the evidence for yourself at www.normanfinkelstein.com
