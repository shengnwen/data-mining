There really isn't much to these CDs.  It's pretty much three weeks of material in a real Japanese Course (maybe even less).  You're just learning terms, not how to talk to people.  Most of the stuff on the CDs was stuff that I already learned in three weeks of a real Japanese course (colors, greetings, counting).  It's a total waste of money
