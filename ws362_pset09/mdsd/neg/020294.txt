My problem with Rebel Angels is mostly the incredible unlikeability of the main characters. Gemma comes across as incredibly stupid, or just someone who will easily cave if you apply a little peer pressure. She continues to make stupid decisions, just because her friends whine and complain or give her dirty looks. It's like the cheesy horror films where the whole audience is yelling "Don't go in there!" and the ditsy heroine does just that. Also, Gemma is just TOO realistic as a young lady of the Victorian era. Although maybe not as much as her friends, she is still preoccupied with being among the upper class and having a good reputation. She shows nearly no compassion to the unfortunate people she comes across. This especially bothered me when she met Nell Hawkins. At the end of the book, Gemma's character improves, but by then it was too late to salvage what I thought of the book.

The only character I liked at all was Kartik. He was the only relatable character in the entire book. And he was barely included in the story at all. Gemma treated him horribly, even when she didn't mean to. The closure concerning Gemma and Kartik was also horribly done. 

Also, the plot was terribly predictable. The only reason I kept reading was for the rushed descriptions of the scenery of the realms. And the hope that Kartik would make a spectacular entrance and sweep Gemma off her feet.

Overall, it was a poorly done follow-up. And that's saying something considering that I didn't like A Great and Terrible Beauty either
