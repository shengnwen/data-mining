As a 26 year old bride to be I did not relate to anything in this book.  I didn't even finish it.  She gave great advice with reminding her readers to say "I love you" everyday to thier spouse- but besides that I didn't really know what she was talking about.  I could see the emotions surfacing in individuals who were maybe a little older- not to offend- but thoes that had been on their own for a long time before getting married.  I was dissapointed.
