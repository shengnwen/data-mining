I ordered this book after reading a brief review of it in my local newspaper. From the review, I understood the book to contain odd Pennsylvania history, traditions, and locations--interesing and humorous items. I ordered it blindly, which was my own mistake. Upon receving the book, I was disappointed to see that much of the content focuses on the supernatural--something that I have no interest in. Unfortunately, the newspaper review made no mention of that
