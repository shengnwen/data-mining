What a crushing disappointment this book is. I couldn't help but be distracted from Zimbalist's thesis by the all too numerous typos and other errors. Albert Bell, Robb Nenn, Lou Pirini just to name a few misspellings. There are factual errors as well. I don't know whether this book needed a better editor or they just didn't care. Eitherway, this book is one to avoid for the serious baseball fan
