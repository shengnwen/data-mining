I was so excited to read this book for my book club based on the few reviews here.  I was sorely disappointed.  The opening story failed to capture me and left me thinking; "Why should I care about this character?"  This feeling didn't go away throughout the book.  Perlman LOVES the "in media res" method (starting the story in the middle, allowing the reader to gather information as the story continues), after awhile this gets annoying.  Another annoyance is that he seems to think men are scum, more so than a typical college coed looking for Mr. Right.  This made some stories predictable.  Finally, Mr. Perlman's use of point of view... I dislike when a character, who I know nothing about yet, because of the "in media res" says "you," seemingly to me, putting me on edge, gathering the material, trying to solve the problem, only to later discover it's not me(obviously - but I never knew who it was so I had to assume the role)....arghhhh!  I gave 2 stars because there were out of the nine, two stories that I enjoyed.
