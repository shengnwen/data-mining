Am I the only one who read this book?? The Killer's identity is revealed only in the last 20 pages or so. There were no clues prior to that as to his identity, except for the existence of a chat room - out of left field. And why didn't the librarian get more credit in the end in solving the crime?  Also, there was no connection between the drive-by murders and the serial killings. What a long book to slog through, for such a disappointing ending!
