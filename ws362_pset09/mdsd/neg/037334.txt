Book is suitable for use as a door stop but not much else. note the following example which is typical: &quot;Hypanthium: hypanthium (s.n. H), abl. sing. hypanthio.&quot; The words hypanthium and hypanthio are not further defined.    Want to see more examples? I seem to find them every time I try to use the book. For me Webester's has been more useful
