I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer from Texas. I tried reading  this book as a first year graduate student, and seemed to struggle with  every line. It was  only a year later, when taking a course on differential  geometry, that an instructor,  Doug Moore from UC Santa Barbara, bothered  to make these ideas more clear in his excellent lecture notes. Usually when  I give a bad review, I like to also recommend a much better book,  but  unfortunately I have none to offer in the area of Differential Topology. My  instructor's solution was to switch to Milnor's &quot;Morse Theory&quot;,  but I found this just as bad if not worse. If someone knows of a better  book, please let me know
