Optimal F is Ralph Vince's baby but it doesn't take into consideration that there is a trade out there that will take you out of the market.  I trade professionally and would never trade anywhere near with the risk he  talks about.  The best traders I know are always prepared for the worst  case secenario and just want to keep playing the game.  Optimal F will take  you out of the market very quickly
