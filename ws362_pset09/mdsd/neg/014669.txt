Given the extensive length and painstaking detail of the original  Ramayana, I welcomed the idea of a shortened prose version.  Unfortunately,  Narayan's version is poorly executed.  First, he never quite manages to  settle into a specific way of telling the story.  Sometimes he writes as  though he intended this to be a text book relating the events and  variations of the original story.  At other times, he writes as though he  is a story teller himself.  This uncomfortable juxtaposition detracts from  the flow of the book.  Also, while I realize that this is intended as a  shortened version, I think Narayan goes too far.  171 pages is not nearly  sufficient to adequately convey the stories and their intricacies.  Narayan  skips between detailed passages and quick, choppy narratives which ends up  being distracting and interupts the book's continuity.  Finally, I was  appalled by the frequent gramatic errors in the book.  Most noticeable were  the dangling prepositions scattered throughout the text, which prove very  distracting.  All of these problems combine to make this book an  unrewarding read as well as a shoddy version of a wonderful epic
