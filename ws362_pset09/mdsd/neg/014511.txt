This book presents some fascinating ideas, but lousy arguments.  Kohanov argues that horses have a healing ability because of their special ability to see auras, communicated across distances, and similar reasons.  I was extremely annoyed by such reasoning.  Auras have no reliable, emperical data that I have been made aware of (if such evidence exists, please show me)  The idea of morphic fields strikes me as silly, once again, no data!  However, on the up side, the idea that horses are valuable as therapuetic tools, I agree with, but the argument can be made substantially stronger
