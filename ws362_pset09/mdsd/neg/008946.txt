This was the one and only book required for my Real Estate Transactions course so I have nothing else to compare it to.  Nevertheless, I have used plenty other Examples and Explanations books, and have always been pleased.  However, this book is the worst one I have encountered.  The style of writing is confusing.  It is poorly organized.  Quite simply, avoid it at all costs.
