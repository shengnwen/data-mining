I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)

I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end. 

A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one. 

I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder..
