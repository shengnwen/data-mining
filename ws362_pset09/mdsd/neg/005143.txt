Bill Maher personifies the reason why I, a life-long democrat and a teacher, am moving away from the current "Democratic" party and leaning more toward independent.  I am sure he has wonderful ideas but couching them in a constant barrage of foul language and hate-filled rantings makes me realize that the party has left me, I haven't left the party.  JFK would, today, be considered a right-wing wacko using the Maher standards.  I was so excited to get this book, hoping to hear (I had the CD) wit and humor with far thinking ideas.  Instead it was the same nonsense spouted by the likes of Michael Moore and Cynthia McKinney. Sad really. I disagree with most of what Ann Coulter says, but at least she's intelligently funny.
