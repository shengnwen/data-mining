I would call this book nonsense if only the ideas inside of it weren't so off base as to be harmful. Giving kids a proper view of reality should help them navigate the world better. This book and its lessons will not do that...it actually steers them in the opposite direction. The book provides practical ways in which your children can be taught about the horrible injustices of capitalism and the wonderful world of communism (it teaches only about the wonderful theoretical parts of communism, on a child's level). Whites are persons of privilege and only whites can be racist because only whites have the power to be oppressors. Basic skills are trashed. I kept this book...but only as a great example of how some &quot;teachers&quot; (people who SHOULD be teaching children ACADEMIC subjects but apparently don't have the time for that) are trying to indoctrinate children
