This book's information is generally accurate, and it's easy to read.  However, readers should know that the American Academy of Pediatrics sold this book a formula company. Now, the company gives hundreds of thousands of copies of it emblazoned with their logo to pediatricians offices to give away for free.  If the American Academy of Pediatrics really cares about breastfeeding and the well-being of breastfeeding mothers and babies, why would they sell their book to a formula company?  Perhaps the answer is because the American Academy of Pediatrics depends nearly 100% on the pharmaceutical and formula industries for its financial support.  There are many excellent books on breastfeeding:  Newman and Pittman's The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers; Mohrbacher's Breastfeeding Made Simple; Sears and Sears' The Breastfeeding Book, to name but a few. Buying one of them will not support the American Academy of Pediatrics, and in turn, the formula industry.
