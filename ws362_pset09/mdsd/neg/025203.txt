The Story of Zahra is a book that could have been great but ends up being a mishmash of cliches and stereotypes.

The character Zahra does seem to have some sort of psychological disorder because she lets herself be used (sexually or otherwise) by everyone around her and seems to have a lack of will to live. She is a very pale shadow of the main characters of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar and Siri Hustvedts's The Blindfold. Her desperate need to be "loved" ends up becoming sickening to the reader.

There are glimpses of the Lebanese conflict as well as the Arab system of "proper" marriages but much of that is swept under the self-pitying monlogues of Zahra. The author is also not able to give the characters any dimension, instead they are very flat.  

The ending of the novel is quite shocking and powerful, however a lack of empathy with the main character makes it less so.
