Maimonides' Guide is a masterwork of philosophic interest to Jews and non-Jews interested in the problem posed by philosophy to revealed religion, but Friedlander's translation is not the way to approach it.  Besides removing the ambiguity of Maimonides' title by rendering it &quot;The Guide *for* the Perplexed&quot;, he translates technical Rabbanic hermaneutical terms into awkward and sometimes inappropriate Latin 'equivilants'.  Anyone who needs such translation won't be able to understand Maimonides' thought anyway, steeped in Rabbinics as it is; anyone looking to learn something of the Guide will be unable to do so with this translation.  Shlomo Pines' translation is universally considered superior; be sure to get both volumes
