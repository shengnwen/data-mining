So often it seems like an adequate book is well loved just because it appears in an "unusual" genre. If this book was about anything but wizards, it would be considered mildly entertaining, but not much else. I found it neither very intellectually stimulating, nor focused around an incredible plot. Of course, people can like what they like, but I feel like this book was a real let down.
