It's pretty and colorful and has more sidebars than text.  It starts with a ten page "why this book is great" embedded review and continues making it pretty throughout the book.

But there is no content.  The basic form of the book is to define a few terms, define a chart, have some barely related case study, go to the next chapter.  It's an easy book to teach from, but a horrible book to learn from.  For example, it brings up the four P's (Place, Promotion, Price, Product) with a paragraph or two for each.  It completely misses the idea that place might have changed from this new Internet thing.  Another book might mention how a major online retailer might immediately give you 25% ACD (All Commodity Distribution %) or discuss the importance of WalMart and mass retailers.  This book just blithy continues on, secure in the knowledge that you know the definition for the test.

The whole book is written as if you purchased a set of flashcards
