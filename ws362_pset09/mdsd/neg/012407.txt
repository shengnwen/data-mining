   This movie was influenced by the writings of the white people. The costuming was not correct, as they Indians progressed down The Trail of Tears, their clothes would have been torn, dirty and tattered. They did not have all the nice blankets that the movie protrayed! Many Indians froze to death because of lack of clothing and warm coverings. If it was really been written by the Indians that were on the Trail of Tears, it would have been protrayed all together different. It would have shown the REAL truth about what happened, like in the book called the "End of the Trail of Tears". This book shows the REAL truth, written by a real Native American, and all the hardships that they had to endure during their forced removal to Oklahoma
