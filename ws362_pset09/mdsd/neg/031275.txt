Per the editorial review: 
"In his own writings, Paul draws from Mithraic vocabulary and symbolism." 

That's interesting, considering the earliest Roman mention of Mithras was by Statius (ca. 80-92 AD) and modern scholarship places the earliest known Roman Mithraic bull-slaying monument to ca. 100 AD (see Richard Gordon, "The date and significance of CIMRM 598 [British Museum, Townley Collection]", JMS 2, 1977-8, 148-74) and Paul was dead by then. 

If this author was using the outdated work of Cumont to develop this untenable theory - well, that's simply embarrassing.  The controversial theory of David Ulansey offers no earlier concrete evidence either as all he has to go on is the second hand (or made up) account of Plutarch who connects the Roman cult with some Cilician pirates ca. 62 BC.  But beyond this unsubstantiated literary reference the only concrete evidence for the Roman cult appears in the latter part of the 1st century AD...after Paul had "flourished."
