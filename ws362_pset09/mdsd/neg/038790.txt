This book's a joke. It should be called the Jorge Cruise book since his photo appears practically on every page. He's a little too much into himself. There's no new info in this book I haven't already read somewhere else. Body for Life is much better. I wasted my money on this one. If you're a woman looking for a great book on exercise and nutrition to lose weight- I highly recommend Body for Life for Woman
