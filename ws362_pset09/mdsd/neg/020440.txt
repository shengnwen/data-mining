I usually like this author and have read almost all of her books; however, after reading this book I definitely felt cheated. The book is well written, and the characters were pleasing, although I thought Faith was not being true to her character as presented in earlier books in the series. Agatha Christie used to say that a mystery writer must play fair with his or her readers. All of the evidence and the clues must be laid out for the reader to try to solve the mystery before the author resolves it. To do otherwise is to cheat the reader who has invested time in reading the book. No reader had a chance to solve this mystery unless by sheer guessing. Once the murderer is revealed, the reader realizes that it really could have been anyone, and all the clues have meant nothing. I was very disappointed, so I will think twice about getting any of her new books
