I bought this book brand new, and every page I have turned has fallen out.  It does NOT use algebraic notation, and it is a much bigger nuisance than some say.  There's nothing more frustrating than looking to the solutions page after being stumped for twenty minutes plus, only to have to interpret each move of the solution.  Some of the problems are absurdly difficult (I'm about a 1500 player) and thus a waste of time since you don't learn anything from a seven move combination that only a master could spot.  This was my third tactics book, and remains the only area of chess where I can't improve.

As for telling you the theme involved, it actually made it harder for me to solve problems because it put blinders on me to other elements of the position.  One problem presented a pin, and the first move was to make a mating threat on the far side of the board.  I was so fixated on the pin I never even considered the correct move.

In every other area of chess we are taught principles that guide intelligent play.  But in tactics it's just "Here's a thousand problems.  Fail for long enough and you'll get slightly better."  Don't expect much improvement from this book.
