When I read Potatoes Not Prozac, I thought, "at last, a book on diet that doesn't focus on losing weight!" After all, food acts in the body in a much more complex way than simply making you lose or gain weight. Apparently DesMaisons decided to pick up on the weight-loss market and rewrite PnP for losing weight. I felt her style of explaining how I feel now and how I'm going to feel after doing her plan, little more than the common weight-loss testamonials you see in every second-rate diet advertisement. By the way, I have eliminated sugar from my diet and it has not "changed my life" or solved all my problems. The 4 billion dollar diet industry, which DesMaisons has become a part of with this book, banks on those types of claims.
