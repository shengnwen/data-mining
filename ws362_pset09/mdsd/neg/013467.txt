There was very little in this book that would be useful for leading anyone to Christ, which is what Godly leadership is all about.  Scripture was used out of context in far too many places.  Never was an emphasis made on encouraging a personal relationship with Christ.  There is no way that a person can SUCCESSFULLY use the concepts that Christ taught without KNOWING Him personally. There was lots of talk about being spiritual, but NONE about knowing the Holy Spirit.  I would highly recommend, instead, James Hunter's "The Servant"
