     Ruben Dario was the first great Spanish symbolist poet and perhaps the greatest of all Latin American poets.  It's good to see a substantial selection of his poetry in Spanish in accessible form.  The English translations, however, are inept almost beyond belief.  What the reader with some Spanish needs is a careful and competent trot, as in the wonderful "Penguin Book of Spanish Verse," where the translator gets every nuance.

What the reader gets is verse translations in which every consideration of meaning is subordinated to the need for rhyme.  Moreover, the translators, in the interest of a spurious readability, make no attempt to suggest the orotund classicizing side of Dario's diction. I have the impression that many such poems, among Dario's best, have been suppressed as too difficult and/or unfashionable.  Finally, the translators apparently wouldn't recognize a literary allusion or quotation in the original if it fell on them.  

The Stavans introduction is just contemptible, as both biography and literary criticism.  Stavans' prose style, as always, is just awful.  Mr. Stavans, there is no such English word as "illusive"!

I've never written an Amazon review before, but then I've rarely approached a book with such high hopes and been so disappointed
