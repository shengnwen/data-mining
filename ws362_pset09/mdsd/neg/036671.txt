I think that that is exactly what Neiderman had running through his mind when he wrote this series and book.

I have always loved Andrews and Neiderman's work. (I even ran a very popular VCA site) Heck I even liked one of the miniseries (the Orphans series). But ever since the DeBeers series I have liked the books less and less. And I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that I read books that are truly shocking now because I still get that wonderful "OMG" feeling when I re-read the early books of both Andrews and Neiderman. I remained optimistic with the wildflowers and shooting stars series even though I could not stand them. Then he lost me with the De Beers series (with the exception of Willow because I could dort of understand her and where she was coming from, in the first book anyway), and even more so with this last series. The Gemini series has had to have been the worst series of books I have ever read. And it's too bad because it could have been so wonderful. I love weird and freaky stories. And let's face it, a girl being forced to live as a boy is pretty twisted and freaky. But Neiderman dropped the ball. The entire story was boring. It barely held my interest but I was determined to try and get through it (mainly because I was hoping I hadn't wasted $7 on a book). Then came the ending and it was so obvious that he was desperately trying to come up with the most shocking thing ever just to keep people interested. Instead, I believe it had the opposite effect.

I'll still be reading April Showers, but (and I hate to say it) if it's as bad as De Beers and Gemini, I highly doubt that I will ever purchase another "V.C. Andrews" novel, and it so pains me to say that
