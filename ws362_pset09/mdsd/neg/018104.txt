This book was published 2001 by Brookings as part of a pair; the other being Unseen Wealth

Lev's book comprised his view, whereas Unseen Wealth included about 20 views including Lev's

Lev is primarily concerned with helping the accounting industry fill its black hole; intangibles being the difference between market value and the tangibles that the 100 years rules of tangible accounting prescribe for. Formerly this blackhole was also known as goodwill.

The trouble is as the service and globally/locally networked economies compounded over the last quarter century, goodwill (or transparent trustflows of an organisation mapped in flows of productivities and demands and across to partnering organisations) became the larger dynamic explaining how most value compounds (both finacially and in human terms like learning, community, social progress that take more than 90 days to invest in and may have diverse views of development).

I dont find in Lev's book any answers to such issues as how to resolve the wicked assumptions that all tangible accounting revolve round. These include:
people are costs, only machines are investments

separate units, separate 90 day periods rather than want to map how they interact and compound in non-lonear ways

What is really needed for tracking, strategizing, transparently governing, leading, developing intangibles (and human relationships) is an opposite type of maths that value multiplies instead of separating out bottom lines as if everything in teh world adds up perfectly in 90 days periods. Whilst Unseen Wealth is clear about the magnitude of the Intangibles Crisis, Lev is not so clear. However, his work is the middleground and epicentre if you are looking at intangibles only from the perspective of what to do if you are intent on perpetuating the traditional accounting profession as nearly as possible as is
