This book left me feeling angry that I even bothered to read it.  First, it seems like every other chapter is missing because the development of the plot and characters seems too fast and not believable...but the big disappointment was the ending, or lack of ending is more like it.  You spend time reading the whole book, finally getting into the characters and what is happening, and then bam, it just ends with this one paragraph ending that leaves you feeling empty and annoyed that the author did that and didn't give you more.
