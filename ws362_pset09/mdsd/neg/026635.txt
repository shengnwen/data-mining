I purhcased this book because I am intersted in world religions, especially those with elements of mysticism.  I have often heard references to the Kabbalah and I wanted to learn more about its contents.  I am a college student majoring in biology, psychology, and history, and my desire to study the Kabbalah stems not from required coursework but rather from personal interest.

If I were pursuing a degree in religious studies, or had I been repeatedly exposed to the concepts that Scholem discussed, I would have been fine.  However, it is nearly impossible for a layman to understand the subject matter as presented by Scholem.  There is simply too much jargon and Scholem's writing style makes me wonder as if he tried to make things overly complex to divulge his brilliance.  

If you are an experienced religious scholar, most likely this book will be excellent.  However, if you're a layman who is attempting to get a feel for the basic concepts and principles of Jewish Mysticism, this book will only frustrate you because it's too advanced
