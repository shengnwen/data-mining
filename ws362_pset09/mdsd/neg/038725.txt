This conclusion to the Year of Rogue Dragons trilogy was hamstrung from the every beginning with the lackluster plot and tone set by its predecessors. As the first two books in the series didn't exactly blow us away, I cannot say that The Ruin singlehandedly ruined the series, but it definitely left MUCH more to be desired. The Ruin made me so disinterested that only my status as a hardcore Forgotten Realms fan enabled me to truck through this book after several weeks and several sittings.  This once promising story is so devoid of any excitement, richness and character, I couldn't care less, with the exception of Pavel the priest, what happened to each and every personage. I could think of a lot of things, a rock for example, I could better empathize with. The author just seemed to randomly generate a band of 7 wildly dissimilar yet completely bland adventurers (a half-golem, song dragon, human priest, winged elf, halfing, ice dwarf, and a pseudodragon) and have them quest AND survive against humorously impossible odds. There is zero connection to them and the Forgotten Realms universe; the author might've well as written "abracadabra" and then have 7 adventurers appear out of nowhere to do battle with dragons. Cursory and transparent attempts were made at character development such as the love affair between the Dorn the half-golem and the Kara the song dragon (!?!?) but it is painfully obvious that this was nothing more than a page filler until the next gigantic battle. The redeeming qualities? It is a grandiose journey through a large breath of Faerun that includes Sammaster and Iyraclea and has plenty of varied and frenetic action albeit ill-conceived. 

Needless to say, I expected more out of the talented Mr. Byers.
