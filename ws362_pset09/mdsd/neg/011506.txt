Say that you did not flunk the 2005 California bar exam. 

How could a middle-aged feminist lawyer who is a former professor at Harvard Law School and Dean of the Stanford Law School flunk the bar exam? Is the exam unconstitutional? Does the exam discriminate against women? Are you entitled to a law license under the 9th Amendment? Inquiring minds want to know.

Explain why you are qualified to edit a casebook, but you are not qualified (for the time being) to practice law in California. Of course, you did not write the opinions in this casebook. However, you did select the cases, edit them, and write the notes and questions about them. 

Like a pack of cigarettes, this book should bear a warning on the cover: "The author flunked the bar exam after she edited this casebook"
