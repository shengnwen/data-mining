The notion that depression is not real and rather a state of mind is frustratingly misguiding and the reason that scores of people commit suicide around the world every day. Depression is a crippling disease that requires treatment and therapy just like any other and anybody who has ever fought it knows this. What this book screamed to me as someone who is vulnerable to mild depression, is that people allow themselves to be depressed; That depression is an attitude, perhaps one I can wake up tomorrow and throw out the window. But the truth is, it is not. It is not something we imagine nor is it something we can forget. In fact, sometimes, we don't even have a clue what is causing it in our lives so how can we simply &quot;pray for it to end.&quot; I'm somebody who talks to God and prays for help with a lot of the challenges that come across my life, but even I know that depression is not something, which will simply go away with prayer. A person needs friends, support, therapy and sometimes a prescription to fight depression
