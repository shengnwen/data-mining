I picked up this book because I heard it mentioned by Dr. PeterKreeft. Kreeft had said that the Golden Key was Christ, and that thesearch in the book was for what the key opens. I read MacDonald'sstory from cover to cover, and just couldn't make heads or tails ofit. Had it not been a library book, I would have highlighted thephrases that hinted at something biblical - perhaps then I could havestrung these clues together and made more sense out of thestory. Maybe I read too many business publications to appreciate sucha fairy tale. But this one really went over my head. I like Kreeft'sinterpretation more than I like the book from whence it came
