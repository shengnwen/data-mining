This book is wordy, sappy, and lacks any sense of pace or suspense.  This was one of the few books that I have ever had to will myself to finish, hoping that it would get better.  It never did.  I have an old copy of this that was my father's when he was a child.  After seeing &quot;Braveheart&quot;, I thought I would try this version of William Wallace's life.  I regret that I did.  The authors manage to take an exciting, heroic life like Wallace's and bury it under plodding, 19th-century prose that sucks all the excitement out of the story.  Not that I have anything against 19th-century writing -- I think Melville and Dostoyevsky are brilliant.  And I have no problems with long novels -- I truely enjoyed &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; by Salman Rushdie and &quot;Focault's Pendulum&quot; by Umberto Eco.  This book, however, could be half the length.  The authors do not cram the book with historical fact, or any worthwhile information.  Instead, they waste words on uninspired descriptions of scenes that do little to further the plot.  What is worse, I felt nothing for the characters, not even Wallace.  It is pretty bad when a heroic figure like that can be rendered so two-dimentionally.  It was a few years ago when I read this book and now find that the story and the characters are largely forgettable.  By contrast, I read The Lord of the Rings 20 years ago and I remember it all in vivid detail.  Don't waste your time with this book.  The illustrations by Wyeth are fantastic.  Otherwise, forget it
