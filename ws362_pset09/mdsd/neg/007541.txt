In this book, "Nessmuk" (a pseudonym for George W. Sears) provides a moderately entertaining read.  He writes during, and was an active participant in, the "back to nature movement" during the Victorian period.  He writes about the glory and romance of camping, woodcraft, woods travel, and flyfishing using minimalist methods.  The info on reflector fire-building, hatchets, fishing with worms/grubs is good, basic lore that everyone needs to learn; however, the book lacks detail on many other basic aspects of woodcraft and Northwoods style camping and outdoor survival, especially collecting and storing food and winter living. If the reader follows the author's recommendations during a lengthy outing in the Northwoods or boreal forest, they'd likely get into major trouble.  More info is needed than presented here by Nessmuk if one plans their own 10-day adventure crossing a big stretch of woods.  In summary, yes, it's a quaint and entertaining read, but if you want less romanticizing/glorification and more detail, check out "Camp and Trail Methods" by E. Kreps and "Northern Bushcraft" by Mors Kochanski.  (Note: This review written by a primitive survival expert and former fur trapper. I gave this book 2 stars to make a point regarding safety.  Many a person has died or nearly died in the outdoors by following the ways of romantics/mystics rather than seeking knowledge from and following the ways of realists -- the practitioners. Although Nessmuk teaches solid methods, he leaves too many important things unsaid for students of the outdoors.  If you just want to be entertained, then buy the book
