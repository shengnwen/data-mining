The characters in this book are forever taking showers.  When they're not taking showers, they are either planning to take a shower, wishing they could take a shower, or telling each other to take a shower.  

Why in the world does she make the main character, Kate, a scant *29* years old??  It's ridiculous.  Not only does she have an MD, she has at least one PhD.  And she has managed to reach the top of her field by 29.  But wait, there's more!  She also, during all this achievement, managed to squeeze out a baby at the tender age of TWENTY, and then raise it.  Uh huh.

Why does Johansen not just make Kate 39, and be a bit more realistic on all counts?  There is a hint early on when Kate muses that Benny, her ex-husband's new girlfriend, is only 23, which makes her so much more attractive than elderly Kate.  ARGH! Clearly, Johansen does not think a woman can be attractive at the advanced age of 39.  *snore*  How ridiculous
