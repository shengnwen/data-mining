I bought this book thinking that the author would have something enlightening to say about our society. Instead, what I found was an introductory chapter filled with self-promotion (he describes all the books he's written, the journals where his articles have been printed, how many degrees he has, etc.) and a defensive attitude that this book will be objective - that he (the author) is neither environmentalist nor "non-environmentalist". Yet how can claim he is sitting on the fence when one of his book's premises is that the collapse of societies can be partially attributed to  climate change? In order to assuage the criticisms of "non-environmentalists" he is  essentially denying his initial bias. Secondly, as a whole, the book itself presents little that is not already published in greater detail in works by other authors. Diamond has chosen to rehash typical examples (e.g. Easter Island, abandoned Viking settlements, etc.) for failed societies caused by mis-management of land and resources. If the reader is looking for something that is not already well documented elsewhere, then this book will be a disappointment. If we compare this book to works of somewhat outlandish theses (e.g. Gavin Menzies, Erich von Daniken), at least those revolutionary ideas, while seemingly unthinkable, are an entertaining read. Diamond's narrative is dry and uninspired.
