I beg to differ with the reviewer that described this work of fiction as being written on a third grade level - that is just plain mean-spirited.  It was actually written on a fifth-grade level!  I actually laughed aloud at the implausiblity of some of the situations - the one-dimensional characters, the coincidences and the fact that none of the other law enforcement agencies investigated any of the &quot;accidents&quot; incurred by the Winthrops is just ludicrous! And Dana's globetrotting at what must have been enormous expense when most of the questions could have been answered through a phone call.  Earlier Sheldon works were so entertaining - he should probably hang it up if this is all he can manage at this stage in his life
