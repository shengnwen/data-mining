I have been working with gourds for quite a few years now, something like over thirty.  There was very little in this work I found to be useful.  I am sorry to say I agree fully with another reviewer here who was less delighted with this particular work that probably I am.  I did give it two stars simply for effort though.  I strongly suggest you search further as there are quite a large number of books out there that are of better quality and certainly more worth the money spent.
