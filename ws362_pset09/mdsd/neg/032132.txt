As another earlier reviewer appropriately stated, this book is not for a Classics Scholar. Having read a large number of different translations of the Aeneid and having translated about 80% of the text from the original Latin myself, Fitzgerald's translation here is lacking in many aspects. He does not keep with the same lines as the original text, he takes great liberties in the use of various words, and sometimes his grammatical poetics is overly drammatic for the section of translation. While the Aeneid is a poem, one must consider that an Epic poem is not a Haiku.

If you're looking for an English translation to use in conjunction with a Aeneid translation course, seek another book. I prefered David West's translation when I was taking a few courses in college.

The Aeneid is a wonderful story, just don't read Fitzgerald's translation of it
