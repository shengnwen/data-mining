I agree with the reviewer who says this feels  like a heavily padded article. In recent years, a number of wonderful books with original research have come out on McGraw and his era (such as Baseball's Radical for All Seasons, Hit Em Where They Ain't) but this book ignors them, and adds nothing new. Deford's book is written in the smarmiest language possible. Mr. DeFord loves writing but I didn't love this book
