There are numerous, laughable cliches peppered throught this novel. One example that actually had me giggling out loud (in embarrassment for the writers) was where we find Dirk Jr and sister chained up in a cavern, with the water level slowly, very slowly, rising... 

Will they free themselves in time?
Will Dirk make yet another cliched joke at the most "tension-filled" moment?
Why are there no guards to make sure they can't escape? 

And finally,
 
Where are the sharks with lazers?

Seriously, the scene reminded me of the Austin Powers film.


But, what really made me throw the book down in disgust was the introduction of a new character at page 389. Described as a man who's "blue-green eyes seemed to twinkle with mischief". This roguish character's name? Clive Cussler.


Are you KIDDING ME?

 Is Cussler's ego so bloated that he has to force himself into the story at the expense of the reader's submersion?

Skip this one folks, and let's pray that Cussler isn't becoming the M. Night Shyalaman of the literary world
