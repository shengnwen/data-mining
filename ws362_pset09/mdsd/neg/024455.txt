How great to produce a book whose sole reason for existence is to capitalize off the sensationism surrounding this sad and ignorant individual:  This mini celebrity who has found his 15 minutes of fame by &quot;outrageously&quot; denigrating gay and lesbian people, women and other minorities, and by putting on an stupid, adolescent version of machismo, to appeal to teenie-bopper girls, pubescent boys and urban rednecks.  Fantastic idea for a book!  I really commend the social conscience here:  &quot;Kill my mom!&quot;  &quot;Smack the bitch!&quot;  &quot;I hate fags!&quot;  What a baaaad Boy!  Give me--and the American entertainment consumer--a break
