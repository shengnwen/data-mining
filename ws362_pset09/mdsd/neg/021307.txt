The book on Kennedy -- also called "A Matter of Character" -- is a stronger volume.   He finds some of the many flaws in Kennedy and examines them carefully.   Here we have a president who has nothing BUT flaws and Kessler is admiring throughout.    What is he thinking?    

I gave it an extra star for its attempt to do the impossible -- that is, to paint an admiring portrait of Little George.   If you've seen the final scene of "Pink Flamingos," you will have no trouble swallowing this.
