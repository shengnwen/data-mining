Now that Professor Chasteen's personal friends, ex-students, and professional connections have had their say, perhaps a dash of insight would be relevant. This is a lousy book, in part because the premise is ludicrous. There cannot be a concise history of Latin America for the same reason that there cannot be a concise rendering of Newton's Principia. Thus, what professor Chasteen has provided is a concise overview of his personal prejudices, the vast majority of which he directs against (and here's a surprise) the United States and Europe. That these prejudices are personal is evident from the dedication (in which he states that his Latin American children are improving the US simply by their presence) until the meandering, pointless fizzling out of his discussion 250 pages later. The history is mediocre, at best, and some of Chasteen's opinions are so ridiculous (anyone historian who singles out the Carter administration's foreign policies for admiration has been hitting the bong a little too hard) that you have to wonder why he continues to live in a country he so plainly abhors.

The writing is so saturated with neoliberal condescension that professor Chasteen's acknowledgement to the over 100 students who read the manuscript seems a wholly fitting exercise, given that they may well have written the dreadful thing
