Very poorly researched and technically inaccurate. I read this book several years ago and was astounded by the technical impossibilities which were treated as fact. Here are two. 1)The USS Agusta is allegeded to have suffered flooding in several equipment bays and compartments after the collision with the K-219.Fact: US submarines are all single-hulled and there are no spaces to flood other than the ten or so major compartments, and if one compartment floods the affected crew will drown or be crushed and the submarine will likely be lost as well (killing the rest of the crew). Simply put there are no tiny little spaces to flood. Leaks can occur but either they are patched or the submarine fills with water.  2)As the K-219 sank she hit bottom without imploding. The Captain of the USS Agusta is alleged to have said "They build them well in Russia". This is pure garbage. The reason K-219 didn't implode is that she was already filled with water before she reached crsuh depth (which for an American submarine would be no deeper than about 2,000 feet and perhaps for a Soviet submarine maybe a few hundred feet deeper except for the Titanium-hulled Alpha class, which can dive to perhaps 3,000- 4,000 feet before imploding).  Only a very thickly-hulled purpose-designed research submarine  can dive so deeply without collapsing.  These are just two extremely glaring technical defficiencies of this book which suggest that the book is more fabricated than researched
