Volume 1 (this book) was released a long long time ago and the advanced topics that were supposed to be covered in Volume 2 has never been addressed.  Volume 2 has been delayed at least 4 times already - all after the editor's gleaming comments had been made!  What does this say about the authors and publisher?  What it tells me is you are not important.  Why does it tell me that?  Who has a project or an employer that will let you wait a year after learning the absolute basics ("Hello World!") before requiring that you be capable of something more?  NONE!  These authors and publisher have made it so that you now have to get the advanced topics somewhere else and just hope that the other author has written the book to compliment Volume 1 of this book from these authors.  Not likely.  They made me have to basically switch bridges in mid-stream.  I do not know what their problem is but this is a sad sad way to do your customers.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!  Find another author/publisher who has both an introductory book and an advanced book already published.  It is an easy thing to find for 1.4.x of J2EE
