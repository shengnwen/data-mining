Okay, I also admit was very irritated by Chapter 4 of Lee's lip stutter or idiotic word faux pas... and then was even more disappointed in a poorly written mystery plot.  This is no mystery genre for mystery fans... but a thinly disguised story marketed for those who like to read "fluff" and nonsense. This is a well-known writer of OTHER books??  Good grief
