I've read all the previous Rita Mae Brown/Sneaky Pie Brown collaberations, so I was excited to see a new one at my local library.  Being a murder mystery fan and cat lover, I've truly enjoyed reading the series.  The best parts are the animals speaking (I love Pewter) and I have a special fondness for Mrs. Murphy because that's who I am (Mrs. Barbara Murphy).  I love Harry, and I don't mind that she's not at the post office anymore.  Her new adventures in grape growing and farming is who she really is--a country girl brought up on a farm.  But I have to say I also forced myself to keep reading this book assuming (hoping) that as I went further, the plot would get better.  I believe it took well over a 100 pages (or maybe it just seemed that long) to get to the "murder".  It also seemed that many of the "regular" characters were missing or barely mentioned especially Miranda, who is a big influence in Harry's life.  I think it was because of the way Ms. Brown went on and on about the biological terrorism, etc--it was like I was reading Time or Newsweek, not a fun, fictional murder mystery.  The winery settings and grape growing were interesting, but some of the conversations that took place between Fair and Harry, or Fair and BoomBoom about the diseases, etc. just didn't seem realistic.  As the story moved along, it did get a little easier to read, but I have to admit, for the first time, it was too obvious who did it and why.  I enjoyed the ending with all of the animals from the barn getting into the mix.  Well, I see another book is coming out early next year.  I'm still looking forward to reading it.
