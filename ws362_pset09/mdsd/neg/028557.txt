I'm not a terribly demanding reader, but I couldn't make it through this.  The characters are self-consciously cutesy -- early in the story the heroine (Jo), a writer of a household hints column (think "heloise") impresses a lot of cops at the scene of a possible murder by explaining all of the seemingly odd circumstances as the deceased having used various household remedies.  ("Why, chief!  That green stuff on her face -- it's a homemade cucumber facial!") In theory I wouln't mind this, but for me, it just doesn't come off; the cops are too dumb and Jo is too much like a parody of a 50s housewife.  When her beautiful wedding dress is badly ripped and  dipped in automotive grease, she perkily sends someone for the proper ingredients for a proper home remedy.  Ugh.

Then -- I don't like being preached at.  It's fine if Jo and friends want to pray -- they are religious characters.  But I don't need to be hit over the head with it every couple of pages.  Jo's friend Danny, who thinks her planned marriage is a mistake, asks her whether she knows enough about her prospective husband's spiritual path.  Do people really do this? I guess they must, but not anyone I've ever met.
