I've enjoyed what Sproul I've read over the years, but I was a bit disappointed in this offering. As others have said, I found it slightly helpful but generally mediocre.

Part of the problem is that the book is not what it is hyped as being. Rather than a systematic study of eschatology, this book is an attempt to refute Bertrand Russell's book Why I Am Not A Christian, specifically Russell's objection (shared by most liberal critics) that Christ promised he would return during the lifetime of the apostles. Sproul defends against Russell by arguing that Christ did return within their lifetime, but that it was a metaphorical return in the form of judgment (the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.) instead of a literal, visible return. 

Because the book is structured as an argument with Bertrand Russell, rather than a defense of a particular eschatological position, it loses much of its persuasive strength. Those who are already preterists will cheer in agreement; those who are not will think little more than, "Hmm, interesting argument." I wouldn't expect this book to change many minds.
