If you're like me and think that mathematics is great fun, then the idea of having a calendar with a new problem for each day probably sounds pretty intriguing. Indeed, this could be a great product if done well. But the calendar has several shortcomings. 

For one, many (most?) of the problems test knowledge rather than intelligence. For example, one problem shows a subtraction problem with one number written in Mayan numerals and the other written in Chinese. Now, if you recognize Mayan and Chinese numbers, this problem requires no thought whatsoever. If you don't, no amount of puzzling will avail you. Another asks, "If 100 quadrillion is written in scientific notation, you get 10^?" This is the same sort of thing. Mathematics should be about reasoning, not trivia. Particularly when each problem has the date as its solution, meaning that questions like the last are more statements of fact than questions.

My other problem with it is that it isn't presented very well. There's a lack of consistency in its formatting that suggests that it was thrown together somewhat haphazardly, and it's littered with typographical and mathematical errors. The question for January 19, for example, asks the reader to translate the hexadecimal number F4 into decimal. Aside from fitting my earlier complaint about this being a mere trivia question, anyone who knows hex will tell you that the answer is 244, not 19. The calendar has a page of errata buried on the publisher's atrociously bad website, but really, this is the sort of thing that should have been spotted instantly -- BEFORE the product went into circulation.

Looking around Amazon at some of Pappas' other products, many reviews seem to complain that they reflect a very low editorial standard, and I think this is the case with the 2006 Mathematics Calendar too. It's a great idea and does have a few interesting problems in it, but for the most part it's a disappointment. Stay away from this one
