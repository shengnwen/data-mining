I bought this book thinking it would help when my husband left for boot camp for the Air Force, I was so wrong!  Not only is this book more for Navy (should be called Married to the Navy) but it is also very outdated!  There are so many things discussed that doesn't even occur in the military anymore (not even in the Navy).  The term "Stepford Wives" comes to mind when you read this book.  Also it goes into how Officer and Enlisted wives should have nothing to do with each other.  I, myself, have found that to be an archaic rule and no one follows it anymore!  From what I can tell the book is a way of promoting her website; a website that does nothing to help military wives.
