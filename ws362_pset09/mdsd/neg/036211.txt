the very thesis of this book is disturbing, and added with the fact that some people are ignorant enough to believe it is just shocking.  my grandparents are survivors of Auschwitz and have the tatoos to prove it, they lived through the nightmare along with many many others- including elie wiesel, who wrote/spoke extensively about his experiences at the hands of the nazis.  that anyone would actually believe this anti-genocidal propoganda is beyond me, should we next begin to disbelieve that the rwandan genocide happened? what about pol pots slaughter of millions?  this book is not worth any history teachers-such as myself- time, no matter how much you want to look at all sides of the picture to paint an authentic historical scene for your students.
