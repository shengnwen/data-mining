Usually I love books by Silver RavenWolf, but I have mixed feelings about this one. Sure, Silver has some good information in here, but some of it is quite laughable with her overexaggerated facts and ridiculous spell names.
Silver has four offspring who all trekked through the teenage years in her household, so she of all people should know that teenagers do not like being talked down to, as she does throughout this entire book. In certain parts of it, I could literally feel her patting me on the head as I read.
I would recommend other Silver books like "To Ride A Silver Broomstick" in place of this one, which basically has the same information only goes more into details and less into spells
