I was very dissapointed with this book. It isn't even well written. I was expecting a solid history of the Myrtles and I got a history of the author. There is sexual content that adds absolutely nothing to the story. I wasn't at all interested in a description of her husbands backside as he made love to her friend. That tells the story of the Myrtles----how? The book isn't at all scary or creepy. The people who found it so must scare easily.It is mostly laughable.Keep your money in your pocket and pass this one by
