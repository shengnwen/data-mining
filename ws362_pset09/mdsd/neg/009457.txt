Throughout much of this book, Chideya uses a very quantitative approach  -with plenty of statistics- to prove her arguments.  In my opinon though,  she often doesn't supply all the pertinent stats, and occasionally draws  conclusions that are either too simplistic or not suggested by the figures  she uses. In all, I didn't feel like my own opinions were firmly challenged  while reading this book
