Reading this book, I was so aghast at the awful writing that I hardly remember what the plot was about. The only reason I forced myself to finish was because I had paid money for the book. I've learned two important lessons: First, next time I find a book at the used book store which looks &quot;new&quot; I'll know its because the book was so bad the previous owner didn't read it. And second, no more Rita Mae Brown! Anybody who was a fan of her older works should look else where
