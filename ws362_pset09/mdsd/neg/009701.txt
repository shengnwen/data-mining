This book was sooooo bad, I didn't even finish it.  Thank goodness I read a library copy, as I would have been very perturbed had I paid money for it.

I was hesitent about choosing this book based on the cover blurb.  Two elderly ladies with a valet? In Regency England? How shocking!  But I suspended my disbelief and decided to give it a try.  (I usually like Catherine Coulter's books) I wish I had just trusted my first instincts.

What didn't I like?  The conversations were just simply bizarre. There is absolutely no consideration given to the mores of the time period. (In one scene the "hero" bathes the naked heroine.  In a small country inn. Where the doctor who's been treating her knows she's a girl.  And he's told the entire countryside.  The local squires wife has donated her night gown for the "heroine" to wear.  The vicar has been by to give her last rights.  And yet, the young unmarried "hero" is permitted to nurse a young,naked, unmarried "heroine" who has been impersonating a boy, but everyone knows is a girl.  It is at this point that the book banged against the wall.

I did pick it up again...but I couldn't go more than a chapter beyond before I gave up.  This book was just inane.  Skip it
