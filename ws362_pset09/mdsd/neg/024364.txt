As a serious student of the Kennedy assassination I have read many theories of what happened that day in Dallas. As a high school student in the mid-seventies, I saw the Zapruder film on the Geraldo Rivera broadcast and was sure there was a conspiracy. I read all the information at the time and was hooked. Yet, after some time, I realized that almost all of the information was pro-conspiracy, full of ideas and claims, but short on evidence. By the time the eighties came along, with a generation of time, the theories got wilder in order to keep interest. If you don't like the evidence, just claim that it's faked. The autopsy photos? The President's body? What's next? Well, James Fetzer has hit a new low now claiming the Zapruder film has been altered. When I saw this book, I could not put it down. In order to keep the conspiracy cash register going, a few Professors with obviously too much time on their hands have come up with another ridiculous conspiracy theory that must make the earlier conspiracy buffs (who had legitimate beefs with various issues such as the rushed Warren Report and the incomplete autopsy) wince since their search for the truth has become a money-making bonanza. What could be next? The Babushka Lady with a machine-gun? Jack Ruby in the follow-up car? This theory has more assassins and firing angles than buildings surrounding  Dealey Plaza. Thank goodness for authors like Gerald Posner, who back their claims with solid evidence, or Richard Trask, who presents an refreshing book about the assassination without an agenda to prove. Buy this book only for the entertainment value to see how low the conspiracy buffs have gone, or for the interesting use of the assassination photos.
