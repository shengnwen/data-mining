you'd be much better off to buy other volumes in the series.  This two-volume anthology is generally a two-thousand page waste of time.  Most poetry is consigned to oblivion for a reason!  What is here rescued is frankly not worth it, and the &quot;literature&quot; here is of historical  rather than intrinsic interest.  A monument to &quot;inclusivity&quot; and  &quot;diversity,&quot; but full of poor writing, the Common Reader is here  advised to invest in Library of America's wonderful volumes of the poetry  of Frost, Stevens, Whitman, and, whenever they finally appear in the  future, Dickinson, Melville, Eliot, and Bishop
