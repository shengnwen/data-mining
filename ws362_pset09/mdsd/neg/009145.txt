Every 20 year old Californian I know has reccomended this book.  It was a lot of fun, and a fast read, but a month after reading it, I had to strain to remember anything about it.  I don't think you will find this book  particularly memorable unless you can relate to the main character -- ie.  fashion obsessed, boy crazy, rampant extrovert
