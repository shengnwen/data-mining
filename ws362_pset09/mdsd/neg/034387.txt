Let me start off by saying that the one star review has nothing to do with the content of the book. If all you care about is the content then change my review to 5 in your head. I love Alex Ross' work on this series and I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this graphic novel. I am someone who reads comic books and not the kind of person who saves them in air tight bags 20 miles below the surface of the earth. However, I was disgusted with the quality of this graphic novel. Not only is the binding cheap, but the pages are the flimsiest I have ever seen in any graphic novel. They are ultra thing and feel like they could rip or break with the slightest movement. I bougth the hardcover version because I wanted to keep this graphic novel around for some time. DC should really create books of greater quality then this. Especially with work as great as Alex Ross
