Needless to say, it wasn't. While Irving's literary style always has merit, he does a poor job at characterization- which is especially disappointing, considering the title of the book is "The World According To Garp." With a name like that, you'd expect the title character to be perceiving and insightful, but instead Garp is boring and egocentric, thinking of little but his own cheap desires. If that was the point, then I feel duped.

And while his mother is certainly more interesting- she's even more self-absorbed, and so it hardly makes up for anything. There's an almost sociopathic quality to his main characters, and while Irving probably didn't intend to portray them that way- it's still an enormous flaw I was unable to overlook
