I was looking for a book that gives a intro tutorial on creating machinima, but this book is so basic that it fails even at that basic expectation.  It has nice glossy pictures, but most topics of serious interest (e.g., copyright, setup, distribution, etc.) are nothing more than 1-2 pages, with half of each page space dedicated to pictures.  I flipped through this book literally in 3 mins, looking for one reason to keep it but to no avail.  It's going back to Amazon.  I don't want to sound mean, but I want to share my views so that others don't waste their time ordering and returning this
