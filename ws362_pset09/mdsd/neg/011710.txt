Ross Gregory Douthat often tells a good story, but ultimately runs into trouble when his assertions, which are nearly never supported with data, turn out to be wrong, as shown by the course of history. Especially noteworthy is the apparent bottom line for the book in which he claims that the gulf between George W. Bush and Bill Clinton was, "far less significant than the angry voices at either end of the spectrum would have one believe." With the murder of at least 200,000 Iraqi citizens, the rejection of Clinton's participation in the Kyoto environmental accords, his focus on intelligent design, his attempts to privatize social security, his corruption in the awarding of no-bid war contracts and Katrina cleanup contracts, and his desire to have the government intrude on all aspects of our personal lives, Bush has proven himself to be as far apart from Clinton as possible, with deadly results. Clinton was a compromiser who worked with people., Bush never compromises, and listens to no one. Douthat further cuts on the "liberal" Harvardians who protested for a living wage for janitors on the campus, then after poking fun at their hair and presumed bathing habits, admits that they were correct to fight the good fight. He goes through college largely consumed with partying, booze, girls, frats (Harvard equivalent), and avoiding classwork, then rails against those who go to college to party, drink, chase girls (or boys) and join frats. IN SUMMARY, Douthat gets angry with the world that he eagerly embraces, blaming everyone but himself for the world condition and the condition at Harvard. He can dish it out, but he takes no personal responsibility for helping anyone else. "Me First" should have been the title of the book. In that sense, the book is a perfect reflection of his stated political views. Funny thing is, he writes wonderful articles in  The Atlantic, to which I have subscribed for many years
