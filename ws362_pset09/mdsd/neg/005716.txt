I've never seen so many pages devoted to pure text.  Man oh man, is there a lot of talk--yak yak yak.  All technical issues are detoured, inviting the reader to check out the references listed at the end of the book (all I have to buy is 1,643 references--gee, thanks).  I find it disheartening that a 700 page book on cryptography doesn't give out a lick of information on the actual subject.  If you like a bunch of talk and some hand waving explanations, then this book is definitely for you.  Engineers and computer programmers may not be satisfied.
