After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:

1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.

2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.  

3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.

The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.

Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.
