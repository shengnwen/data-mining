King of run-on sentences, that is.

The problem with Benford's books isn't the story.  This book, along with the first in the series, In the Ocean of Night, presents an absolutely fabulous story.  Benford has come up with a really excellent idea for a series of books.  The problem is Benford's writing.

For some reason, Benford forgets that "science fiction" consists of two words.  He places much emphasis on the first word, but doesn't realize that it's fiction.  Mr. Benford, this is not a science textbook!!!!!!!  Getting the science right in a fictional book is all well and good, but if one can use the book to teach a physics class, then the writer's priorities are a wee bit skewed.  If you wish to write a textbook, then write a textbook, and leave the fiction to fiction authors.

In addition to putting waaaaaaaaaaay too much emphasis on the science, the structure of his writing leaves much to be desired.  As previously mentioned, he seems to have an ongoing love affair with the run-on sentence.  There are literally whole paragraphs in the book which are nothing but one huge sentence.  And you can forget trying to follow a conversation via the use of properly placed quotation marks.  A quotation mark is to Benford what holy water and crosses are to vampires.

I give this book 2 stars simply because the writing is so horribly bad.  The idea behind the story rates a stellar 5 stars, but I had to subtract at least 3 for Benford's pitiful excuse for prose.  I actually feel that giving it 2 stars is a generous showing on my part, as I was sorely tempted to give it 1.

A word of advice to the prospective reader of this series:  Read it after having a couple of glasses of wine.  It helps.  (Seriously.
