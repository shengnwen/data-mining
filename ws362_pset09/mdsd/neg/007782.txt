While the author rehashes some basic business writing theory, she consistently fails to follow her own rules:
- The text is full of fluff
- The style is flippant instead of useful
- The lecture style puts you to sleep
 
There are much better books on the subject. A textbook approach is necessary for this subject. Not this dopey-run-on-crap.
