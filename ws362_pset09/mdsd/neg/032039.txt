This slim volume might be worth the price at 18 dollars, but the $45 students are forced to pay for this book, used as a textbook, is outrageous. The book's vocabulary and its assumptions about the level of knowledge of the reader lumps it in with juvenile literature. For example, it tells the reader that ancient Greeks and Romans had a democratic form of government, and that democracy means the citizens vote, just like in the United States. 

The book appears an attempt to "candy-coat" (almost literally!) history for cooking students who are assumed to know nothing of it. It has long sections of history at a 9th-grader's level, with only minimal coverage of foodstuffs at some points. 

Worse, it is riddled with errors and inaccuracies. For example, the last section I read before returning it for a refund covered sourdough bread. Civitello said that San Francisco sourdough really is different, as San Franciscans claim, because "the yeast in the air of San Francisco is a different variety, lactobacillus sanfrancisco." This is blatantly wrong, as lactobacillus is a bacterium and yeast is a mold. It was delightful to learn, after some online research, that the bacterium lactobacillus sanfrancisco does contribute to the unique taste of San Francisco sourdough. But the statement in the book was clearly wrong, and typical of the level of accuracy throughout
