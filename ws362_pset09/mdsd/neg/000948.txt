I bought this book out of curiosity rather than as a teaching guide as I already play the piano to grade 8 (ABRSM).

I wish I had not bothered and kept my 14.99. The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons. The incessant attempt at humour is offputting from the start and the content is disjointed and lacks any conceptual ideas of what music and the piano is really about.

The CD accompanying the book is a joke, and if this is an example of the author's musical skill I shudder to think what else he has produced. The irritating keyboard rhythms and styles are a throw back to the Bontempi school of music.

IMO  this book is pants and is not worthy to carry the name Piano in its title. Save your money and don't buy it, there are lots of other very good "easy books" on teaching beginners the piano
