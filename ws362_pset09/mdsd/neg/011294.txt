I quite liked Alan Lakein's book, and got a lot of mileage out of it. However, I found his systems a little too simple to deal with the reality of my daily life. I'm in the middle of *Getting Things Done" by David Allen, and I find that it's much more real world. It also holds your hand a little more (e.g., step-by-step instructions on how to quickly get to the bottom of your inbox). If you (like me) are out of time and need to get organized, skip straight past Lakein and go directly to Allen
