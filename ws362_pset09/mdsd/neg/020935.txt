Some good stuff, but lacks structure and suspense. It's like wading through a lake of warmed-over oatmeal. (SPOILER ALERT) Certain moments are fascinating. The story that the famous gangster tells the cop, while he's sitting outside the thug's bunker, works well, but then the guy is dead, supposedly, and the air goes out of the story. I didn't believe the gangster killed himself. Doesn't make sense. But he goes on telling the story anyway, and now there is nothing at stake. Even a literary novel has suspense. "As I Lay Dying" is a page-turner compared to "Sacred Games." I lasted exactly 50 pages. Some of the writing is good, but some of it is clunky, too. I got tired of looking up the Indian words, flipping to the back of the book. I'd rather have them translated right there, in italics or in parentheses. Soon I just read over them and didn't care. There is something compelling about a more-or-less stock gangster story set in an exotic culture, but I needed interlocking story questions to hold me there.
