I felt the sample of this book was not a good indication of it's contents.  Most of the built-ins shown in the book are from a Room-View with the built in partially obstructed and with little detail shown.  I wasn't looking for plans to build, but I would have expected more.  If you like the details level shown on the cover of the book, then this will be right up your alley, other wise, the book will probably fall short of your expectations
