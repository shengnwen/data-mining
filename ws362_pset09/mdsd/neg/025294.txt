This book is a quick, fast, read that will take no time to finish.  It is light and fluffy and it is an insult to any reader's intelligence, especially if they are from the South. The plot is the same old thing with words of stupid wisdom handed out by all of her characters. Oh, and let's not forget that they all grow and change from the one experience. This author is about telling stories to make money.  She adds in anything about the Southern culture she can think of.  The problem with that is she does not always know the culture, even if she grew up there.  The character details she threw at the reader towards the end made me just shake my head and say, "please give me a break!"  Anyone from the South would tell you that the matriarch of the family would never, ever disolve her membership to her church and say "I don't need a minister to help me speak to God".  The church is the social institution of the South.  If she was from such fine lines of Southern society, she would have been at church every Sunday in her very own, paid for pew.  
  The feeling that you get when you get towards the end is the author is trying to desperately end the story so she can meet her deadline and make her money.  I certainly am sorry I gave her mine.
