This is my first C.J. Box book and it certainly won't be my last. It was great to read about a hero who had a normal family life and makes a mistake now and then. Other reviews have given the plot line, so I don't think it's necessary for me to do so. However, I would like to say that the author has created believable characters and situations and kept up the suspense all the way through the novel. I liked reading about a wilderness area that I knew nothing about. Great job!
