A great musician but a man desperate for intellectual respect.  The book is virtually 400+ pages of an application for membership into some haughty Paris salon.  Caetano should have stuck to what he knows best-music.  The endless and mind-numbing name-dropping and references to obscure books, artists and philosophers are the written equivalent of a 5 minute arena drum solo.  OK, we know you are smart, that you have ecletic and fine taste, etc. Now tell us about your music. How did you write it, how did you record it?  There is sadly too little information about music and too much dismissal of others for perceived intellectual deficiencies, musical or otherwise.

Speaking of his music, I recently saw Caetano in concert and was shocked by the syrupy shmaltz--he actually performed "Feelings" in English and in total sincerity. He virtually refused to perform anything in Portuguese, perhaps it is not a cerebral enough a language...nothing more than feelings.

UPDATE:

Another reviewer found my review above to be in error, because Caetano is "30 years ahead of his time" in singing one of history's most painfully bad songs, Feelings. The reviewer found the whole thing very funny. I am sure that the reviewer has the famous Teutonic sense of humor to appreciate the joke.  I for one, heard a corny song in accented English.  Forgive me for missing the joke while I tried to cover my ears
