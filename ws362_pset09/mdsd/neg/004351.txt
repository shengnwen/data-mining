Sometimes she raves and sometimes she rants, the really interesting parts are when she tries to do both at the same time.  

This book is better then "Treason" because it stays away from a topic that Ann knows nothing about (the history of the Cold War) and stays more towards current events.  

And that's fine everyone is entitled to an a point of view the problem with Ann's arguments in all of her books are threefold 

1.  I'm right and you're wrong
2.  I don't have to listen to you 
3.  I don't even have to acknowledge that you exist (look at the title) 

So what it all boils down to are examples that are as idiotic as the premise. Maybe in Ann's world of rich people we can all ignore each other if we have differing political views but in the real world where we have to work for a living it isn't like that.   

Overall-Don't waste the energy or the time.
