I don't know what restrictions the various authors work under in cranking out these tales, but they must have been created by someone who neither saw the show nor has any idea just who the majority of the fans are. Most of us are ADULTS, and we would really like to have our age group recognised. Look at the origonal episodes and the subject material they contained. These were stories written for and enjoyed by an audience considerably more mature than the "young adult" market the books cater to. Many of us have passed our fifth decade, for cryng out loud. Surely, somewhere, there must be a writer who is both familiar with the show's characters and capable of writing a mature entertaining book about this wonderful show.
