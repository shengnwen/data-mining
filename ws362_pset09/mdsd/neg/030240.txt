i received this cookbook as a gift recently and was eager to
test it out....i wasn't impressed really.
there are very few directions as to the timing of each step in
the recipes, and the recipes themselves aren't very fresh or
mouthwatering...most are very "classic" items that seem quite
dated, as well as heavy and unhealthful...some directions to
recipes are overlooked completely, very confusing for a novice..
(which i am not....) 
i use JOY OF COOKING all the time and will continue to do so, also MADELEINE KAMMAN'S MAKING OF A COOK (an absolute bible!)
i do not recommend the NEW YORK TIMES COOKBOOK for any level of
home cook.
