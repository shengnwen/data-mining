I know this is going to make me unpopular, but it must be said: It seems to me that this book has become famous for being famous. I can't account for the overwhelming popularity in any other way.

It isn't particularly well written, although others who disliked it gave it credit for technical proficiency. It is essentially a story about bullies, video games and cookie cutter characters bought for half price at the Stereotype Barn and jazzed up with reflective neon tape applied to their fender flares. The misery of plodding through page after page of what amounts to the Lazer Tag Semi-Galactic Finals is made incalculably worse by the glacially slow pace at which these less-than-riveting events unfold. It's like enduring a root canal in slow motion. Without benefit of anesthesia. While the dental assissant reads aloud the latest celebrity gossip congealing around Paris Hilton. Ok, to be fair, it's not QUITE that bad, but lord! it sure ain't good. I can suspend belief with the best of 'em, but I have limits, and nothing these children do or say strikes me as being authentic. The problem with so many novels that feature young children or teens as their protaganists is that the author is writing through a filter; he is attempting to reconstruct the thoughts, feelings and dialogue of childhood from the perspective of adulthood. Please read 'Tom Sawyer' again and compare it with 'Ender's Game'. The disparity is glaring.

Comparing this to the genuine classics of the genre does not improve Ender's overall credibility. Both Frank Herbert's 'Dune' and Joe Haldeman's 'Forever War' are so much more compelling and thought-provoking. If you rated this book 5 stars do yourself a favor and give the titles mentioned a shot--you'll be rating them at 10 stars or beyond. :-)
