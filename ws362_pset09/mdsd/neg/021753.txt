This author actually believes that she can tell you all about your life just by what age you are and she can predict what kind of story you will write, just by knowing your age.  Wrong!  There is also an entire section telling to basically quit your job, ignore your loved ones and devote yourself fully to becoming a millionare writing in Hollywood (which in reality, most of you will never make a penny doing).  This book is entirely unrealistic, but not because of the premise of the title.  
What I do like about this book is she pushes you to quit procrastinating, gives good writing exercises, and gives you your basic outline without being too specific.  Not really the book I was looking for
