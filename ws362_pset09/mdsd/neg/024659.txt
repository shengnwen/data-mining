  Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.
  The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.
