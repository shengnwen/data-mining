The perfect example of critics falling in love with excessive writing. Supposedly, the sentences Whitehead constructs are beautiful works of art, but I was always taught to keep things concise and precise so the reader could follow the story. Not so here. Whitehead tries to impress with his ability to use a thesaurus. I could forgive it if the characters or story itself were compelling, which they aren't. Whitehead is talented with good intentions, it's too bad critics don't try to steer him in the right direction
