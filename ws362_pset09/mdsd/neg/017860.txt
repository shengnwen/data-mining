I could not finish the book because I felt as if I could not relate to her snobbery. Her life of privilege. I was only able to seriously read the first fifty pages then skimmed through it to be enlightened as many others  seem to have been.  I was not able to feel any of the emotions she  professed to have, smell or taste any of her food and ultimately, was not  moved by her writing. Could I have just been in a bad mood
