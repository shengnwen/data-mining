Probably the most creative part of this book is it's title and jacket. This is not a mystery story, and the search for the lady in the paintings is just a minor journey, interspersed with dozens of peripheral characters that come and go in a flash. Some funny moments halfway through the book in events that probably didn't really happen (his grandmother getting sucked up a garbage chute into the kitchen from the basement during a tornado)are much welcome after his meandering into unrelated asides from classical literature. It's a short book that should have been much shorter
