This book started out well, although the disfigured model theme has been done already, and done much better by other authors.  The thing that killed this book for me was the overuse of the word "egregious" which became such a nuisance to me that I couldn't finish the book.  The author uses the word in places where it shouldn't be used, as if she doesn't know the meaning of it but liked the sound.  Teenagers who wouldn't have this kind of vocabulary use this word constantly in this book.  I'm also displeased by her depiction of both women and men as sexual objects and nothing else.  All in all, disappointing
