This book has good intentions, but they are not carried through in the text. The writing is rather flowery and general and by the end of the authors call *research*, you don't really find out what that research was. I was looking for a book to recommend to cancer patients who want to use self expression as part of their healing, but this was not the book, I ended up returning it
