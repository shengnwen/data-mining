The underlying plot is good. Mr Feist brings likeable characters that develop over time in credible ways. If this were a stand-alone book in another setting it would be better.

This story fails when it starts foreshadowing the upcoming serpentwar. The biggest flaws are Pug and Tomas, the major characters from the prior series.  Both are incredibly powerful. Both have very strong ties to characters in this story. Both inexplicably do not involve themselves in the events of this story. Of course we know why. They are far too powerful and would trivialize the entire "adventure". But it is ludicrous that either Pug or Tomas would allow events to unfold without interfering directly. Pug's adopted family is involved. Tomas's parents are involved. Their birthplace is involved. The excuses that are given are paper-thin. The idea that neither of them keeps an eye on the town in question stretches credulity past breaking.

If this story were consistent with the prior series, it would be 3 pages long. There would be the attack by the bad guys foiled by Pug and Tomas, followed by a thorough retaliation by Pug and Tomas on dragonback. The end. Obviously not a good story, but when you have god-like characters, you have to explain their absence, especially if you start blowing up their home town and killing their family
