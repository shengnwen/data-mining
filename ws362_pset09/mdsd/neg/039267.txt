I would NOT recommend new writers to read this UNTIL they have finished writing their book.  While it has great advice on the publishing business, it practically discourages any one from writing at all.  It's very "left-winged" and biased.  If you don't live in New York, forget it.  The book makes you feel like you don't have any chance of ever getting published!!  Not good reference material for first time writers
