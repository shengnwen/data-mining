Andelin is apparently terrified of men becoming overly submissive and letting their families push them around, because his book is full of advice on how men can overcome pressure and really be men. When it comes to his advice on how to treat women, however, I think he needs to overlook his own masculine issues and take a few therapy classes to fix his definition of what a woman really is. If you have read the statement in this book that "a woman loves her master", you may be wondering what a woman would think of this. Well, I'll tell you: she'd think it was sexist bull and would demand that you throw this book in the trash! I'm a Christian woman and God, not man, is my Lord. I don't want a "lilly-livered" man, but I also don't want a master! Women are people, not dogs, and we don't need leashes. This book is one of the most harmful things you could give a young man; all too often I've seen guys in school push people around, so why make the problem worse? Andelin deserves a good whipping for some of his advice and I suggest he read the Bible before giving any more. God's roles for His children are far different than what the Andelins say. I hope you heed my words, gentlemen; this isn't a threat but a simple matter of respect. Would you like a book telling women that a man always loves the woman who masters him? Respect works both ways and women need it too! I'm sure I know far more than Andelin does of my sex and I can safely promise you that if you tried to apply Andelin's advice to the average woman, all you'd gain was a kick in the pants. Stay far away from this if you truly value your God-given manhood
