it seems that as long as reguritate the dominate social narrative of an oppressed/underpresented group the work is considered a "masterpiece" and "touching". Well this left me cold. How many times does this novel need to be written? there are many ways to create unforgettable characters and working the hell out of tired stereotypes is not one of them.

Also, read something by Julius Lester if you want to see this kind of thing done well
