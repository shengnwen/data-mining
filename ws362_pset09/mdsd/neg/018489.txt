I am a fan of Ron Rash's fiction too.  I did not think that this book was as good as the first two.  The characters were not as compelling, the language not as lyrical, and the plot not as exciting.  There were too many loose ends--Travis's future college plans, reconcilation with his family, etc.  The whole book moved slowly
