This is the type of book that I have interest in reading but this one in particular was really bad. Trying to establish a connection between the order and Germany is all that this book tries to do. It has some reprinted documents that are very boring to read and its memorandum format kills the interest of any reader. Maybe the only memorandum that is worth reading is the one that talks about education. I wanted to find out more about the media control, banks, etc. and there's nothing. The true meaning of this order remains a mistery. Complete waste of money
