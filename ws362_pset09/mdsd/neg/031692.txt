This is junk. Since the end of the Soviet Union, it appears that "swarthy" Arabs are the new evil which the - guess what? - handsome, dedicated, sensitive-because-his-true love-died, intelligent, military-minded white guy has to single-handedly defeat and, of course, save Western Civilization from the narrow, evil-yes, "evil" again-tentacles of Islamic terrorism. And, as is the case these days in this whole genre of trashy spy novels, "Islamic" MEANS "terrorist."  And our Golden Boy does what we expect him to. This is so trashy and predictable, I feel Ludlum ought to pay us all back. Don't waste your time.
