I am a big figure skating fan.  I have read every skating book out there.

I thought Katarina's story would be interesting. While not my favorite skater, her background would certainly be worth the read.

I was wrong. For one thing, this book seems to be set up in a way where Katarina is giving advice to a fictious up and coming skating star.  Never quite sure if this girl actually exists or not.

Also, this book is preachy and....boring, boring, boring.

Where are the great skating stories, the background info on skating in Germany?

What about Katarina's fears and thoughts on life in general.

None of this in this book.

Skate right by this one
