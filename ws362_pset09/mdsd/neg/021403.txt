If you pick up a mystery at the grocery store, you don't expect Hemingway.  Or even Russ Francis.  But this is really just like a bad novelization of a middling episode of "Law and Order CI".  The good men are all craggy and strong and sensitive to women.  The women are all good unless they're hookers or junkies.  All of them, at some point, beat up or kill a man.  The bad men had bad experiences with their mothers. Wives are more successful than their husbands, who are as petulant as a teenager with a used Chevrolet.

In all fairness, there is a decent plot, but it has petechial hemorrhage from the ligature of Dr-Phil-level psychology and daytime-drama characters.

The least you expect from a cheap mystery is that it will be better than the average police-procedural tv show.  This one fails the test.  Save your $5 and watch reruns of Bones or NCIS
