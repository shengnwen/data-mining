RIIIIING!!!!!  Not only boring, but poorly organized, executed and written (and, did I mention, boring??)  After struggling through a few chapters, I tried skimming ahead just to see what was going to happen.  Unfortunately, I couldn't even do that because not much actually happens in the first 150 pages, and that which does is so convoluted and unclear, and written in such awful prose, that it is hard to follow.  Additionally, although the world is about to come to an end in the story (maybe), I did not really care about the characters, who are more wooden than Billy Baldwin's acting.

Can I be any more clear?   This book is terrible. 

As far as the writing goes, I'll give you a few choice gems to whet your appetite in case you still want to give this mess a shot:

"Some of the outfits attracted her.   Others were positively puritanical--- in a slinky sort of way."    (Hmmm... those slinky, puritanical outfits.  Can't you just imagine them?!?)

"Men's clothing was no less flamboyant, or somber..." (Looks like men's clothing is also flamboyantly somber.  Wish Versace could take a hint from those futuristic, flamboyantly somber humans!)

"Many of the spellings had been simplified or-paradoxically--made more complex." (Gosh!  Both simplified AND more complex?  How paradoxical!  Guess we've covered all the bases there!)

So, if you'd like to read a spectacularly bad, though paradoxically un-good, science fiction disaster, with unexpectedly trite, though inconceivably wooden, prose about astoundingly boring, though unexpectedly laconic, characters, I would highly recommend this disturbingly terrible, though hopelessly awful, book
