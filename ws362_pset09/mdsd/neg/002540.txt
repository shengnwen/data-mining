I agree with the earlier review that said this book is just plain badly written, no matter who wrote it.  I doubt it would have been published in the first place without the hoax factor.  I finished the book because it was short and I was hoping it would get better, but I was never engaged by the story and never cared about the characters.  I don't plan to read anything else by "JT.
