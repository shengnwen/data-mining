I am an avid reader, but I barely wanted to even finish this book.    I was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, and I don't think this book gives him enough credit.  I don't like the writer's style: his logic is difficult to follow sometimes, and he goes off on tangents instead of focusing on Reagan.  He describes Reagan as a President that no one liked; this is NOT true!!  
Furthermore, I don't care for some of his (the author's) biased viewpoints that he threw in, like about the Vietnam War; they have no place in a book that is discussing the Life of Reagan.
