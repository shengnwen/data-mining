The book may be suitable for some people but I found the explanations excessively long-winded. I frequently found myself crossing out an entire paragraph and a writing summary sentence in the margin. I do not think it will make a good reference because it is very easy to get lost in its verbosity. This is problematic in the real world when you need to refresh your memory of a small detail under time pressure. This book is useful for learning new concepts for the first time but you will quickly outgrow it
