I had a pattern for a while of reading one really great, original Layman book and then reading one generic, vapid, and unrealistic one. This pattern continued through the reading of about ten books as I explored his work and sadly, Blood Games, falls firmly into the second category. While it's not as stupidly infuriating as "Come out Tonight," the author takes a sheer thin premise and does exactly nothing with it, as though taking the camping trip from hell, (done quite well in "Darkness, tell us,)" and throwing it into purgatory. If you didn't mind the lack of supernatural and somewhat slow pace of "Among the missing," then you might like this one, but I found it too long by half, with characters that grew paper thin instead of taking on greater substance as every other chapter flashed back to their previous life together. Do yourself a favor and put this one low on the list, after you've done all the great standby's: "Traveling Vampire Show," Island, In the Dark, and Body Rides."
