   I'd rate this book zero if I could.  The author obviously hates white Christian males and puts down the Christian religion vehemently in this tabloid rag book.  She has had one birth, and that was an experience which was bad, yet claims to be some sort of expert on the perfect birth experience.  When it comes to birth experiences and trying to change the world when it comes to these experiences, one shouldn't just rant and rave theories after just one try, but should know what she's talking about and have some serious experience "under her belt" (i.e. more than one experience).  
   
   This lady's a Christian hater/basher who doesn't really know what she's talking about.  Furthermore, it's absolutely no wonder that she titled this book as she did: "Immaculate Deception" - as it is very fitting given her hatred of Christianity that she would refer to the Holy and Immaculate Conception of Christ and change the word "Conception" to "deception" (since she thinks Christians have decieved women and destroyed childbirth).  Shame on this author.  If you are a Christian it's best not to even waste your time and money on this offensive, tasteless trash unless you need fire starting material for your fireplace or woodstove
