I liked the idea of this, the concept, so much more than the book itself. The life story of a famous villain sounds intriguing, but this falls short in Maguire's hands. He is good with language and turns of phrase; almost Byzantine at times, his writing is appropriately other-worldy, but it becomes distracting and too obvious for the most part.  He is not good at telling an absorbing story, even given some wonderful stuff that is already established. This book is slow going, and not at all similiar in whimsy or wildness to its original material by L. Frank Baum. 

This could have been such a fun and fascinating story, but it is not. It is about prejudice and politics, and it paints an Oz that I wouldn't want to visit. Baum's Oz was colorful and dangerous and strange. 
Maguire has taken a children's classic and made a very adult prequel/parallel novel, and he twists the Baum work and the 1939 film to fit into his vision. It reminded me at times of fan fiction.

The Witch I know could not have been a sympathetic and misunderstood person; she wasn't a crusader for animal rights. I like my villains bad, not in some gray area. 

And now the sequels will keep churning out. Son of a Witch, The Cowardly Wars, and so on. I can just imagine future titles like The Quadling Child, The Fall of the Monkey Kingdom, blah blah blah...    
I'll pass
