One big problem for me is that the story commences with Elena and Clayton already pregnant. That was a big disappointment. I've put in lots of time getting to know these characters and coming to care about them and to have all the uncertainty and excitement of deciding to get pregnant happen off-story seemed unfair. When the story opens, the pregnancy is already far along, and you get precious few pregnancy moments beyond Elena lamenting that she can't run and jump like she used to and Clayton chiding her to be careful because she's pregnant. Clayton's voice in particular was off, or wrong somehow, especially in this regard. He wanted to have children so badly, and I just didn't hear any real joy coming through. There were other troubles though. The story felt like it was running in place and getting nowhere. Every action taken was wrong or a dead end and, as a result, the story had real trouble moving forward. It was plodding and slow. It certainly did not hold my interest, and that's saying something because I am very fond of these characters. The author also completely wasted her setting in my view. She did nothing to convey any real sense of Toronto at all. The story was specifically set there, but this tale did nothing to really convey a sense of the place. There was no real atmosphere whatsoever. I am astonished by all the very positive reviews this book has received. I'd definitely recommend checking it out from your local library before buying it. This is the first "Women of the Otherworld" books I know I will never want to read again, there's no need, nothing much really happened and no new characters were introduced. I hope this is not a trend. It's a poor effort and really deserves zero stars
