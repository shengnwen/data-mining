You've got to be kidding me, right?  So, he writes the SAME BOOK ABOUT WICCA as everyone else does, substitutes "night" for "day," uses a spooky font and peddles it to the goth market?

There's little, if anything of value in here.  It's the same rehashed stuff that you see in every other Llewellyn book, only with the "goth" label on it.  Don't waste your time
