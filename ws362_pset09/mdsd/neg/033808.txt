I did not like this book much.The story line failed to intrigue me - didnt like the characters either and could not connect with them.

Usually i read Ms Adairs' books avidly...having loved Kiss & Tell and Hide & Seek but this series for me lacks interest. The 'Curse' storyline in my opinion could have been developed much better & the final resolution of it seemed so trite and convenient. I also did not feel  that special  spark between the two main characters. 

I was bored reading this book before coming to half of it and found mself skimming through the pages to quickly end it up. My opinion is that the formula about tough T-Flac men should be changed  now for something new and original, and this does not merely entail the idea of turning them into wizards! (such a silly word to be found in such a book) Whats up nowadays anway with writers all of them writing about terrorists and antiterrorism campagins etc? A couple of years ago this story line was novel and therefore intriguing...but i can frankly say that im fed up now of always reading about this lately in romantic suspence books (particularly by Cherry Adair & Cristina Skye)I feel like having read one its like having read them all. I  feel disapointed with this newest series by Ms Adair. I have bought the 3 books from amazon at once & was disapointed by all three. Hope that in the future Ms Adairs tries to come up with something new and novel
