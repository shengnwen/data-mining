This book is predicated on the false Christian belief that we are, when all is said and done, the ones who allow God to save us.  The final "savior" in the book is not Christ or his substitutionary sacrifice but the power of human prayer.  This novel perpetuates the false teaching that fallen people have the ability to decide for God and ultimately save their society.  It is a feel good novel that puts the spotlight on the unbiblical notion that if we manufacture good works for God, then he will bless us.  This "Christian" novel contributed to the silly notion after 9/11 that our prayers create a wall of defense around our nation.  The novel is misleading at best.  Go read Romans or Galatians again for the real way salvation works in the Christian faith
