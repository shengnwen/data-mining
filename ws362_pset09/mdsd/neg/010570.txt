Finally a book with the courage to stand up and tell people with their heads stuck in the 1950 that theyre abslutely right about everything! Glory to the author who finally proves that women in fact should not be paid equal to men who do the same work, and in truth should not be working at all, because totally a whole bunch of science shows how women with professional ambitions and successes in the private sector are just plain stupid and doting housewives whose lives consist entirely of ovens and vacuums are totally where its at! After all it is a true fact that most women who are in a relationship with a domineering husband with religious convictions and a family who puts pressure on them to behave like their idealized mental image of women and who have learned a long time ago that its just better for them not to resist any longer and to do what theyre told report in surveys run by organizations with a political, to say nothing of sociological axe to grind are PERFECTLY HAPPY with their lives, so that proves everything! And furthermore this book was written by a woman! And even though that means she is violating the basic premise of the book by having professional ambitions of her own as far as being a writer (lets not forget, every day spent writing this book is a day you could've spent cranking out more babies like youre supposed to, woman) its still 100% true! No wait, its 200% true because it contradicts itself! Hooray for the 1950s regressive conservitive oppresively religious and slightly sexist mindset!
No, actually I dont know what sarcasm is. Why
