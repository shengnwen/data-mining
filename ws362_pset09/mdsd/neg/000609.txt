If you like a book with friends who steal, and one friend changes, then read this book! This book is called The Library Card by Jerry Spinelli. Mongoose and Weasel are best friends. There's only one problem: Mongoose steals.
	Mongoose and Weasel spray paint all over walls, tires, and dumpsters. They never get caught. Weasel starts to adore school and he even goes to the library on a daily basis just to read books all day!
	When Mongoose goes into stores he stuffs his pockets with candy to sell at school to get money. Then he runs out without the cashier even noticing him. Weasel is a bystander when this happens.
	This book should only be read by people who are fine with fighting and stealing. My opinion about is book is that the author doesn't interest me at all. This book is not the type of books I would read.
	These two friends are friends the first second then they aren't. What will happen to Weasel and Mongoose? Will they stay friends? Are there other main characters? Find out when you read The Library Card by Jerry Spinelli.
