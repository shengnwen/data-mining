There ~are~ reasons to commend this book, like the bountiful illustrations, the charts showing the evolution of Chinese characters, etc.  What I fault is that at many points the author departs from accuracy and injects over-Europeanized interpretations of Chinese mythology and symbols (for instance, characterizing Tibetan Lamas as &quot;devil-worshippers&quot; and calling the Chinese place of the dead and its god, &quot;Hades&quot; - repeatedly).  To be truthful, some of the illustrations are so poorly drawn that you cannot really make out what they are.  The text is easy to read and the topics covered numerous.  I would use this book with caution, however, checking Williams' interpretations against other, more recent sources.  For the record, I am giving this book a two because the only other reviewer to write about it gave it a five and that is far too high for it.  I think this should yield an average of three, which is about right for this book
