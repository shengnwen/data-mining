The beginning of this book was well written and made me think I was going to follow two young girls through their experience growing up in an Italian family.  Pretty soon, I realized I was wrong.  The girls are highly disrespectful of their mother, who seems to have no redeeming qualities.  They have nothing good to say about their father and although they take care of both later in their lives (well, they put them in nursing homes), there is no love, tenderness, conflicts about their anger with their parents (and why are they SO mad?!) versus their loyalty to them!  The sister is a basket case whom the younger sister can never get past admiring.  And one of the most irritating parts of this book is the time factor.  While the girls seem to be growing up, the sister has 2 kids, has an affair, and ultimately both parents die, but the sister's kids NEVER GET OLDER!  They are always little so it makes you wonder how insightful the author really is if she can't even keep up with the time.  In the end, I felt sorry for the parents for having two children who were so self-absorbed and selfish that, even as youngsters, they never even tried to relate to their elders-- also something that seemed unrealistic
