Ok, granted, there ARE a FEW things in here that deserve a chuckle, but for the most part, this stuff is pure drivel.  Definitely not a &quot;sit-down-and-read-it-all-in-one-go&quot; book, but even when broken up into small chunks, you'll spend forever and a day looking for something that's truly funny
