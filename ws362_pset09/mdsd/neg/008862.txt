I'm a CIW instructor.  I've been using Prosoft courseware in my classes for two years, and have never been pleased with it -- especially the Foundations courseware.  This book is written by the same people and it's just as bad.  Dry as a bone and full of inane information that none of my students have ever been asked on an exam.  This biggest challenge on the Foundations exam for most of my students is the Networking Fundamentals portion and while this book does cover the needed material, it doesn't do a very good job of breaking down some of the most complicated concepts -- such as the OSI model.  I encourage my students to get supplemental materials that enhance the material covered in the courseware -- not rehash it
