When I saw this book, I thought that it was going to be another book along the lines of &quot;Girlfriend Guide&quot;  or &quot;Hip Momma's&quot;.  I was so utterly wrong!  The book takes excerpts from many other pregnancy books which I have read, and in most all instances they are taken wildly out of context from the original.  I guess my biggest dissapointment is that the book is heavily religious...  While most other pregnancy books written &quot;on the level&quot; have small blurbs, this one is chalked full of christianized jargon.  While the back cover does say &quot;spiritual encouragement&quot; the rest of the description made it seem like it would be for the yoga going, jucie bar hitting types.  Although the book does give month to month checklists and a few really great websites to check out, it is really lacking in good, original information.  I would strongly suggest not purchasing this book, and going for &quot;Girlfriends Guide&quot; instead.  It does have &quot;Expert panel&quot; sections, that make you feel not so alone. However, this information would be best gotten out of one of the many pregnancy magazines, which offer the same thing.  All in all I was really dissapointed by this book, especially after reading many other pregnancy books.  I guess that this book would have been alot better if it were the very first book that I read, and if I did not know anything at all about pregnancy
