Interesting book if interested in author. His claim to have Hepburn at his beck and call until he found someone "better" sounds a bit self serving in light of the fact Hepburn never mentioned the supposed affair to any of her friends according to Barry Paris' book on Audrey. Could it be that Ben is a legend in his own mind
