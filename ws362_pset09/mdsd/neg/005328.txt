I'm only on page 76 and I'm bored. I thought this book was going to be full of stories from college students but I'm seeing essay from parent after parent after parent (even though the one about hugging was very cute!)  I'm disappointed and I'm glad I didn't pay much for it, because I'm selling it right now
