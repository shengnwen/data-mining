I have loved this series from the beginning - great characters, fun stories, thrills and romance.  Very light, quick reads that are great entertainment.  This story was awful.  There were two mysteries.  One was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding, and the other was so convoluted I didn't even get it.  

A comment was made that one person, when convicted, wouldn't be around to hurt anyone any more. But this person wasn't even the perp for the big mystery.  And the epilogue? WHO was that person?  And how did they figure it out?  Too many holes for an otherwise easy read.  

Finally, the characterization was off.  The normal comraderie between the girls was missing.  I felt no love from the original three for Yuki, in spite of her storyline.  If there's a sixth story, I hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books.  I'm giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends.  If I had just picked up the series with this book, it would be a one.  Sorry James
