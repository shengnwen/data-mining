 If this book was being given away for nothing it would still be expensive for what it is.
 
 All you'll find in this book is yet another introduction to NLP, and not a very useful one at that. It has its moments, to be sure, but they are VERY few and far between and far outweighed by the misinformation and pure waffle that make up most of the book. Almost any book on NLP would be more use than this, and why it claims to be about Brief NLP Therapy is anybodies guess. Apart from quoting Steve de Shazar's &quot;miracle question&quot; there's really nothing here to tell you its about &quot;brief therapy&quot; rather than any other kind.
 
 Save your money - this is a real non-starter, especially at this way over the top price
