I managed to read The Breaker in one sitting, so it can't have been all that bad. But it was a pretty unremarkable story. There wasn't really much of a mystery to uncover. I had a major problem with the character of Maggie. What was she even doing in this story? Easily the most annoying character I have ever encountered in a book. Making it worse was the fact she practically had nothing to do with the plot.

I have also read The Dark Room by Minette Walters, and found that one to be fairly average as well. She needs to work on her character development. Her writing style has more of a presence than her characters do. I doubt I will be picking up anymore by this author.
