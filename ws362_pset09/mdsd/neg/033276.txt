Discursive and digressive, David Thomson's `The Whole Equation' is less a history of Hollywood than a meditation on the business of making pictures.  The book's title comes from a line in F. Scott Fitzgerald's `The Last Tycoon' and refers, I believe, to the multi-faceted quality of picture making.  Motion pictures are products, widgets produced by a place called Hollywood; they are also art, as well as a mirror to our culture, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
 
 I wanted to like this book.  Thomson seems to be a well-respected film critic and I'm not averse to jumping on a passing bandwagon, but I also wanted to learn a little of the history of Hollywood.  You know, facts piled upon facts?  Thomson is more inclined to impression and analyses, some of it a bit off the board.  The chapter "Divorce, America Style" examines the connection between the rise of the divorce rate in America with what was happening in motion pictures.  It isn't the first, or the last, time Thomson strays to pursue such things.  

 If you have the patience for it there are some amusing moments, but if you're like me, looking for a just-the-facts history of Hollywood `The Whole Equation' isn't it.
