This was my first Deaver book...and my last.

The suspense factor was "ok", but the sections on scuba were ridiculous.  A diver (with only 25 logged Caribbean clear-water dives) goes into a new NY/NJ wreck, alone (no dive buddy), on a single tank.  And the Coast Guard approves this dive...laughable.  Then once in the wreck, the diver goes down a dumbwaiter passageway measuring 2' by 2', without taking off any gear!!!  

You might ask why I point this out...The above was 2 chapters, not just some passing reference, a very material piece of the story.  If this one section [which I know something about] is that outlandish, what does that say for the other sections that I'm not as informed about.

Complete Science Fiction!!!  You are better off reading tea leaves than this book.
