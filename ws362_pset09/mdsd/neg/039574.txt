 As with most other kids I thought this book was not worth writing. While reading the description it sounded fantasticly exciting. In the beginning it actually sounded like an interesting piece of history. By the end it was one of the most boring books I've ever read. Now I have come to realize that just because a book wins the Newbery Medal does not mean that it is a good book. With 1,000 good books one book can be published because it is pollitically correct or is spewed out by a good author. I have no doubts about Elizabeth Yates but I think that Amos Fortune is a book about a man that had a good life, but one that was not nessicarily worth writing about
