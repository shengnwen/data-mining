I thought that the first couple of chapters were enticing at first.  Then I realized that this book was really all fluff.  Basically, a pep talk to get you to do what you want.  He fails to address so many issues and has a very simplistic attitude towards them.
He starts off saying that doctors who want to go off on their own do, so that they can rid themselves of a boss who is controlling and runs everything.  However, he then explains how later on, you have to hire doctors and basically train them to be a replica of yourself.  I see a problem there.  Because unless you hire followers, doctors want to have their own autonomy.  How does he address this problem that made the doctor go off on his own in the first place?
Basically a fluff book. read it in the book store
