I am not sure why my school chose this book/ Author. I have yet to meet anyone who enjoys using this book. I give it 2 stars only because it has all the NANDA dx in it (if you can find them!)I find it very time consuming. If you enjoy flipping back and forth to several pages without much help in finding what you are looking for, then this is the book for you. Index aside, this book needs to be more user friendly. I simply do not like the way it is organized. Risk Factors are seperate from Nursing DX, but stuck in the middle of the book, good luck following from one section to another! There is no friendly flow in this book to use it efficiently. Sorry, but I can't recommend this book. There has got to be a better way to write this book
