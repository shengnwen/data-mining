The only star I give this book is for the interesting comments from the collection of chefs presented in the book. Which, by the way, were the only pages printed large enough to read without scrutiny. I have returned this book and cannot recommend it for anyone to purchase without first picking up a copy and opening it. An eagle would need a magnigying glass to read the fine print of every recipe. Using such a tiny font for directions is an unkind joke on those who purchased this book with the intent of actually using it. I wonder if the Food Network "favorites" had an opportunity to see how their work was presented; I doubt even they would purchase such a useless cookbook.
