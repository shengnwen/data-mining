In the right hands this novel could be translated into an exciting movie.  The premise is interesting, but falls completely flat with the sewn up ending.  A true happily ever after, that begs for a more smartly written sequel in which everything unravels would be delicious.  The hardest aspect to swallow was that this super extra terrestrial life form could divide out of control then just be neatly killed and carried to a lab in the desert for benevolent study.  Sheesh!  I really thought it was going to get scary at some point! The major antagonist of the story is a tattoed up ex inmate who fancies himself a master mind killer-when in reality he is just a sharpshooting (except when it really counts) boob!  And boy does he meet his match in a simple pair of desert folk, who happen to be expert gunslingers and survivalists to boot!  This is all very funny, but to me the funniest part of the entire book is the description of the male tyrannasaur mounting the female and trumpeting loudly in the wild prehistoric world he inhabits!!!!
