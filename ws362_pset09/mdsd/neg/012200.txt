Sir, not only have I knowledge of Scotland, I am Scottish, have lived there for 4 decades and I have a great deal of insight into the machinations of societies within the conurbations that create the cities of Scotland. These are not kernals of truth in my review - but factually accurate statements reflecting a book. Go check the pages yourself and you will see that no where have I made this up! I challenge to tell us all, have you even BEEN to Scotland yourself? If indeed you knew Scotsmen, you would have a full and complete undertanding of my review!! Apparantly you do not!! And therefore you are in no position to discuss the factual relevence of my review
