I am a fan of Jonathan Kellerman - have read all of his books and enjoyed most of them.  This was the last one I read.  It was too long - so many diversions that did not advance the story.  It seemed that JK was caught between writing a mystery/crime novel and writing a history of the conflict between the Palestinians and Israels.  This books was about 300 pages too long and very boring in many places.  This was JK fourth novel and I am glad that he got his sights back on target
