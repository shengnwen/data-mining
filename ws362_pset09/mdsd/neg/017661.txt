I bought and used this book for a probability class and for preparation for the Society of Actuaries (SOA) exam course 1.  I had never had a probability or statistics class and this book did a very poor job of helping me to understand the topics.  I had to resort to using other books not required for the class in order to understand anything.  I did not pass the the SOA exam and I blame that, in part, on this stupid book.  I also had about 50 class mates, all of which had just as much disgust for the book as I did.  Not disgust for the class but for the book
