I got this book for my birthday this year after reading all the stellar reviews.  I was disappointed as soon as I began paging through, and my disappointment has only increased with time.  I live in a decently sized metropolitan area, yet I had a hard time finding the required ingredients at any of the three Asian and Indian grocers in town--even ethnicgrocer did not have many of the needed items.  After several trips and a lot of searching, I finally scraped up enough ingredients to make Khatte Channe--it's one of my favorite dishes to get at the Indian restaurants around town, but this one turned out terribly sour and not a bit appetizing, though I followed the instructions to the letter (I will say that the instructions are fairly clear).  After spending well over an hour preparing this dish, it was crushing not to want to eat more than the first bite.  I don't know if I'll ever bother trying another recipe from this book--they are all incredibly long and involved.  There is also very little variety.  I was shocked to see one reviewer call this book "comprehensive."  There are not very many dishes in here at all, and many of the staples that I see at the Indian restaurants around town.  Over all, it's disappointing in virtually every way
