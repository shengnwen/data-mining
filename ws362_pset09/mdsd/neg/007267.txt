This book isn't worthless, but it's not very good either.  Cabot encourages women to be positive, specific and proactive in their approach to men, which I appreciate.  She devotes a good portion of the book to the "love languages"--auditory, visual, and feeling.  This information, so long as it's not pushed to the extreme or used by a manipulator, is interesting and could help people in any sort of relationship.  However, ultimately, this is still a "man-hunting" book, with all that that phrase implies.  I think that Cabot's approach requires a bit of tunnel vision, a bit of obsession about men, and a lot of manipulation.  Take what you can from it, but I think that Sherry Argov's Why Men Love [...]is a better investment
