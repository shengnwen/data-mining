The book is a very quick read.  If your looking to just pass the time away I would definetly read this book.  If your interested in learning something and taking it to the workplace I would choose another book.  When I read a book I like to transfer the learning from the book to the workplace and with this book when I was finished I was unable to transfer my learning.  Most of the skills I read about were common sense.  I was hoping for something a little more &quot;meaty&quot;
