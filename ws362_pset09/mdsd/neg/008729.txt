I'm an American, and I spent a few months living in Japan on my own a few years ago.  I'm going back for a month-long trip soon.  I picked up this book, thinking it would be helpful.  Well, it does have some helpful information that you don't get from the usual Japan guides (such as the difference between uchi and soto), which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star.  My complaint is that the author (P. Sean Bramble) doesn't seem to like Japan very much.  The book is extremely negative about the Japanese.  Yes, every culture has some downsides and Japan is no exception, but I found most of the book to be focused on the negative with very little written on the positive.  I didn't realize it until I was 75% through the book and thought, "Why am I going to this awful place again?"  Then it hit me, what a downer this book has been!  I flipped back through what I had read and was surprised to see how much the author focused solely on negative aspects of Japan.  So the problem is that I don't think he presents a realistic view of Japan and the Japanese culture - by overemphasizing the negative, he doesn't present a balanced view.  For example, after you read the health care section (which says doctors suck and pharmacists are a joke and the dentists are awful), you would think Japan would be the worst place in the world for health care.  That's simply not true - Japanese health care is excellent despite its flaws. Perhaps he was trying to injecting a little reality into the normally too-sunny descriptions of Japanese culture, but he goes too far the other way and in the process loses his ability to describe Japan accurately.  I also question his ability to appreciate the nuances and beauty of Japanese culture -- this quote tells it all:  "When people ask me to explain the real reason I've stayed here all these years, I shrug, scratch my head, and say 'Beer.'
