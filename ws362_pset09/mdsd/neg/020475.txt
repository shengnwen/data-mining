But 1 Star is the lowest one can choose.  I have never read a book with so much promise the first half, and so little delivery the second half.  It is hard to understand how a reader new to the Jury series could put up with the constant references to the plot of the previous Jury book.  Having read the previous book (heads above this one), I knew what was being referenced, but didn't really care.  Specific complaints: Cyril the cat in Racer's office is getting OLD OLD OLD. (Cyril disappeared "lickety-split" behind the desk--sounds like Dr. Seuss.) The intelligent, thinking, almost talking dog Mungo belongs in a Children's book, not in a mystery that started off so well.  ...  But finally, the worst part--the "plot", or lack of it. "The whole wild plot simply to get rid of a woman," Gault said (p. 275).  Sounded preposterous to him, does to me, too.  And the "plot", if there WAS one, is never explained, resolved, completed.  The book simply ends...Ms. Grimes had to go to the grocery store or something, so just quit "composing", and sent it off to the publishers.  I agree with other posters--no more actually buying any of her novels.  I'll check the next one out at the library to see if she recovers or not, but no more Cash to Grimes
