First let me state that the terms "technotrash pseudo-fiction" are not intended to be negative in the sense that this book is trash to be ignored or thrown away. What is significant here is the genre of technotrash pseudo-fiction. See the other reviews to get a feel for what I am talking about. The book reads like a story, which it is. It offers up that comfort food satisfaction for the mind that many crave--just like pulp fiction! So, if you are looking for any sort of depth or a cut-to-the-chase analysis, this book is a waste of time--in fact, just browse the book here at Amazon and read the reviews. I use the descriptor pseudo-fiction because the book is not fiction, it is just layman science served up that way.

Two stars for being well-written, two stars for lack of depth and far too much fluff
