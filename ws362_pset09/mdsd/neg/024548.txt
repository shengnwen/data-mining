If you bother to parse the author's execrable writing, you find that he has very little to say about whatever it is French people do to avoid obesity. 

Instead, he goes off on tangents. He tells cutesy anecdotes about family members that probably aren't even interesting to his other family members. Having established the the French are more inclined to eat organic produce and natural-sourced food than Americans, he then fills PAGES with irrelevant (and dumbed-down) factoids about chemicals in food.  If (as he says) the French aren't big on surgical solutions to obesity (e.g., stomach stapling and liposuction), why has he included an entire rambling chapter on them?

In fact, you might wonder how how someone as apparently incapable of getting to the freaking point as Clower got a PhD.  

But if he just stuck to the point, he wouldn't have a book--he'd have a short, not-well-supported essay suitable for peddling to one of the less-renumerative ladies' mags.

Unsurprisingly, he sticks to the hard-to-quantify, touchy-feely (and generally useless) explanations for how the French stay thin and avoids mentioning the one contributing factor that most epidemiologists agree on: The French smoke like chimneys
