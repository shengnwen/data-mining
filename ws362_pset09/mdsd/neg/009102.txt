Deborah Tannen claims that men's conversational style is based principally on a fixation of status- every conversation either puts you "one-up" or "one-down". For women, communication is about connection, forming emotional rapports- they don't see it as a status battle. Example after example, Tannen showcases men who apparently view every suggestion or protective gesture as a constraint on their independence or a belittling of some sort(some of these examples are absolutely infuriating) and women as temperate saints who only want to form connections and a sort of hierarchical symmetry with the people around them. For example, Tannen describes a scenario in which a male colleague of her's complains that his editor is like a parole officer because she wrote him in a letter that he should inform her of any long-distance trips he would be taking during his book's production. First off, this man obviously has abnormal control issues and doesn't understand the employer-employee relationship. Secondly, Deborah showcases her sexism when she points out that she, a woman, would feel comforted that she was important enough that someone would care about her whereabouts. The bottom line is that Deborah Tannen is overly fixated on pigeon holing men as singled-tracked beings who are obsessed with status and singing the praises of women, depicting them as such considerate people with nothing but understanding. I suggest you borrow the book first before you purchase this material as I was rather frustrated by the inaccuracy in which Deborah Tannen portrays the "conversational rituals" of men and women and by her thinly veiled sexism.
