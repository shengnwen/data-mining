Blum's style is horrendous.  She traipses from one anecdote about her son to the findings of scientists she has interviewed without the blink of an eye.  She does not so much advance arguments or conclusions as much as merely advance dumbed-down versions of scientific studies.  Matters such as which questions underlie the research and what the research reveals are interspersed with bad puns and Blum's own opinion as to whether something is insulting or disgusting.  Her attempts to lighten the fare are patronizing and distracting.

She wrote way too much about non-humans.  This or that primate species is simply not the human species.  The differences between them are so great that their relevance for the human species does not seem to be established.  

Most of the research she chose was physiological, behavioral, and anthropological.  Evolutionary biology (a.k.a. sociobiology) gets only occasional treatment, despite its recent progress in explaining male and female differences.  

Note also that the book was published in 1997.  I write in 2005, so the book is eight years old.  Try to find something more up to date on the subject.

Overall, the book's faults can most easily be attributed to the fact that the author is a journalist and not a scientist.  She sarificed too much to appealing to the general readership and is not well-schooled in the science of human sex differences herself
