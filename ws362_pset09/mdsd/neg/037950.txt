This is a work of polemic; I understand that. As lowly as I rate the author's religious stance, I give him his right to defend his (albeit extreme) opinion.

What irks me about this book is its complete lack of accuracy. Equating witchcraft with devil-worship, calling transcendentalism a cult and Marxism and Existentialism "religions" is only the start of it. I'm fairly convinced that Mr. McDowell did not do any research at *all* for this book.

If one is going to write books stating how horrible various religions are, one should at least learn the facts about those religions first
