My boss ordered this book in hopes that it would be helpful in preparing for &quot;fun&quot; improv activities at a summer camp he will be teaching at. Unfortunately, this book was dry and boring... the scenes suggested  were not something that would keep any child of any age interested... they  were simply rehashes of situations that pop up in every day life. If you're  looking for fun and games, this book isn't for you
