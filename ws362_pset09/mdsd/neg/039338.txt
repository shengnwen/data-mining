If you walk into B&N and flip through (not even buy!) the other "well known/recommended" pregnancy books you'll get much more information than what Douglas offers. 

If you're lazy/want a quick read, this book is for you.
If you're looking for a comprehensive tell-all (which the title and reviews lead you to believe), this is *not* the book for you.

This was a total waste of money! If I had know it was this bad I would have just used my money to buy diapers instead.
