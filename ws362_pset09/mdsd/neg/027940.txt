Sorry for not being as enthusiastic as the other readers but I have many doubts about the reliability of this book. I agree there are many interesting and funny anecdotes, that the story of the English language described is captivating and so on. But as a native French speaker, I noticed that almost each time he writes about the French language that's absolute rubbish !
Let's have an overview :
p3 : '[...]The French for instance, cannot distinguish between house and home, between mind and brain, between man and gentleman [...]'.
Hey Bill, if it's too hard for you to check in a dictionary I can tell you the difference between 'une maison, une residence, un btiment' and 'un foyer, un chez-soi' or between 'esprit' and 'cerveau' or between 'un homme' and 'monsieur, or even gentleman'.

p5/6 : '[...]French must manage with 'je chante', we can say 'I sing', or 'I do sing', or 'I am singing'.
Even if I prefer the English way of saying that I can also say 'je chante vraiment', 'je suis en train de chanter'...

p7 : [...] while the French call lice 'Spaniards [...]'.
Where have you found this stupidity ? I've never heard that before !
p7 : [...] To be bored to death in French is 'tre de Birmingham' literally 'to be from Birmingham' [...]
Once again where have you found this idiocy ?! I've asked to all the Frenchmen around me and no one knew it. Perhaps you got it from the only Frenchman you know who has been bored to death in Birmingham for 10 years.... 

p67 : [...] For instance , the French do not use [...] or R.S.V.P. for rpondez s'il vous plat. (Instead they write :'Prire de rpondre.').
Hum, let me check my paperwork R.S.V.P, R.S.V.P., R.S.V.P.,... Damn I cannot find any 'Prire de rpondre'. Did you invent that one also ?

p179 : [...] in France [...] an alloman is a switchboard operator [...]
Hang on man, you're on the wrong line. I can invent a new one for you if you want : 'fantasyman'.
p179 : [...] so that in France a jerk is an accomplished dancer.
I've been dancing for years now and never used or heard that one ! 

p210 : In French it is a grave insult to call someone a cow or a camel and the effect is considerably intensified if you precede it with espce de ('kind of') [...]
I wouldn't say it's a GRAVE insult ! Even less preceded by 'espce de'. Espce de menteur !


So here are the examples I picked up, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same for the other languages and even for the English language. Imagine now my feeling as I was reading this book. Each time I learnt a point of history, grammar or vocabulary or I was amused by an anecdote I thought "hang on, is it again something Bill invented to sell his book, is it again a non-verified piece of information ?".  Despite all the books he wrote I think this guy should go (back ?) to a school of journalism...
