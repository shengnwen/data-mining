What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha!
Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer
