this book is interesting, don't get me wrong... but the author really went overboard with the length... it's too long... it's divided into two parts: power and pleasure. Power is interesting, but i was looking forward to the second part. I thought it would concentrate on the social aspects that make Bombay the city that it is... religion, food, tradition, etc. All I got was 200 more pages that centered on several characters who are not special at all...It ended up bothering me, how he dedicates such a long part of the book to this dancer that he calls "Monalisa", when there is nothing extraordinary or remotely interesting about her... complete waste of time...I don't understand his infatuation with her. 
The endless stories about his experiences in Bollywood are boring as well. Very disappointed... 
It would have been a good book had it been only 200 pages long. 
Sorry Suketu!
