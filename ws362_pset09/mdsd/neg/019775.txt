There are some tidbits of info in this book that are educational, but it in no way focuses on S-corps (the subtitle is deceptive). It is more an incomplete overview with some brief stops to go in depth on select topics, with examples and discussion biased mostly towards C-corps. I was surprised that the chapter on which state to incorporate in only discussed Delware (and not even well). There should definitely be a discussion on Nevada as it has become a highly considerable candidate for the honor. As I completed the book it became apparent to me that this was largely written pre-2001 (this is an opinion), although it is copyright 2003. The author's preable in which it is introduced that the tax rates have changed, but that the reader should just keep that in mind instead of the author going back and revising the numbers, is emblematic of the off-the-cuff manner in which this book was written and proofed.
