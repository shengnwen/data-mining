This was a major disappointment.  I am a great fan of any "Vatican"  novel and will read some mediocre stuff to get my fix.  This, however, did not reach that standard!  It is the first novel I have been tempted to give up when only half-way through.  As for the suggestion that a bunch of feminist-minded nuns are trying to change the church, this compliments the book too much.  There is a dream story that keeps appearing throughout the story but adds nothing.  Page after page of some medieval drivel.  Comparisons to Morris West  -  kidding?  You might say I didn't like this one
