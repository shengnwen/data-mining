Do not buy this book unless you are being retested on the old PMP or CAPM exam.   This book is based on the 2nd edition (2000) of the PMBOK and is therefore obsolete.  The current exams use the 3rd edition (2004) of the PMBOK.  Much has changed so this book will mislead you and you will answer exams questions incorrectly.  The processes, process groups, some definition have changed.  As a result, many of his test questions will be wrong also. I am a PMP and I teach PMP and CAPM test prep sessions
