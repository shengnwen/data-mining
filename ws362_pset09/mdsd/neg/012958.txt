I read to be entertained.  As most American males I've always had some interest in Playboy Playmates so I thought this might be an interesting read.  What was interesting was hearing of Hef's Wednesday/Friday orgies that end up with multiple girls and him.  Nice life Hef. Unfortunately, the author, who begged to live the Playboy lifestyle and pursued a photo shoot layout and invitation to the mansion, suddenly gets morals and is shocked and appalled by what she discovers.  What was she thinking?  Her only point is she thought Hef was so old (and physically gross) she couldn't believe the girls actually had to sexually perform with him.  DID SHE ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING OF HIS LIFESTYLE? 

So if you want to know what goes on with Hef and his girlfriends, it's here.  Unfortunately, everything else in this book is pathetic.  She's 30 but continues to tell us how beautiful she is as she aggressively pursues her dream with boyfriend in tow.  What a klutz he must be to fall for this!  Then when she somewhat achieves her dream, she's shocked by the degradation and jealousy among the girls.  Come on!  When you're living with a guy with lots of money and multiple girlfriends there is destined to be jealousy amongst the girls.  

Overall, this is a very bad book written by someone who wants her 15 minutes in the spotlight.  There is not enough material for a book and the writer clearly is in love with herself which comes off pathetic in the book.  If you want to see what Hef's up to maybe you'll like the book.  Other than that the only positive comment I can relay is that it is a short book.
