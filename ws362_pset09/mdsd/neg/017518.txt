Having a photographic story of a girl and a bunny living together sounds like a good idea, but I'm not sure that the actual outcome serves any particular purpose. 

This book documents the adventures of a girl named Sarah and her pet rabbit, Buttercup. Buttercup wanders off one day when Sarah falls asleep in the field near their home, and gets into some trouble. Then, later in the book, Buttercup has babies of her own, and Sarah gives them away to her friends. 

The narrative is kind of rambling to me; there's no big plot that moves the book from beginning to end. Rather, it seems like words have been chosen to take advantage of a bunch of (admittedly very cute) pictures of bunnies. Also, since it's grounded in reality, the book lacks any whimsy or magical element to inspire wonder in a child. 

On the other hand, the book doesn't really do a very good job of portraying what it takes to be a good pet owner. It is true that Sarah feeds and waters her bunny every day, but other than that, there are more bad lessons than good ones about bunny ownership. Sarah receives the bunny in her Easter basket, and most animal car groups will tell you that bunny-giving around Easter-time is a big problem for the little critters. Then, Sarah falls asleep when she's supposed to be supervising Buttercup, and there aren't any consequences to this action. In real life, that would probably be the end of Buttercup, sad to say. Finally, Sarah allows Buttercup to breed and have more babies, which she gives away to all of her friends. This is another common irresponsible action that is shown to work out just fine for all involved. 

It's not that I think that this book is evil or is going to irredeemably corrupt the children who read it. I just think that it fails to entertain, and then it fails to educate. Great books seem to do both, but this book does neither. In the end, we're left with some cute bunny pictures and not much else.
