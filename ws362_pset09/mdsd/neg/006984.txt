This short novel started off ok, but it was not long before my brain was awash in confusion. This is a highly abstract experimental novel that makes little if any sense. Without question the author has a wonderful vocabulary and on occasion really knows how to turn a phrase, but she doesn't seem to know how to put her natural talents to their best use.
The reader never gets to know the characters (and quite frankly doesn't want to get to know them) because they are so flat--less than flat. Furthermore, the narrator does anything but narrate the story because he is always too busy calling attention to himself and the fact that he is narrating a story that no one gives a s**t about. There is no plot and the overall idea is as hopeless as they come--TRULY HOPELESS.
I really wanted to like this work and I pushed on, almost against my will to finish, but all I was left with was a disappointment that bordered on downright despair. For such a slim book, this may have been one of the most cumbersome ordeals I have put myself through as of late.
Simply put, there are millions of better things out there to read and I should probably note that this is the only book I have ever awarded a one star rating--this is because zero stars is not an option
