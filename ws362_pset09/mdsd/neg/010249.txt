Neither beginners nor practitioners should ever buy this book, this is one of the books from a bunch of books that Fabozzi has edited on ABS and almost all of them are not worth looking into, it is neither a plesant reading nor mathematically adequate. This book like other Fabozzi's books on fixed income bypasses serious issues related to investment, risk and analysis
