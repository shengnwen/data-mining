I don't regret having read this book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't already into Henry James.  The style is hard to understand, apparently because it was dictated, and the subject matter is even more obscure.  I don't think Henry James had much experience with children: even assuming that Maisie is twisted by her strange situation, she doesn't talk like any child I know or can imagine.  Weird moral undercurrents and jealousy take up most, if not all, of the novel.  I wouldn't take claims of this book's modernity too seriously - it's more on the byzantine side.  Read The Europeans instead: so much more fun
