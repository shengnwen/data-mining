I can't believe how wild, petty, and such a brood Marcus is.  The new earl is such a child in character that I got bored after a hundred pages and threw the book away.  This obviously was not thought out by the author.  This is not a romance,  but a calamity.
Boo! Boo! on the author.  This is terrible writing.  I do not recommend this book
