This book is as jaded and contrived as Dr Peirce's class.  There is only one chapter worth reading #7, the rest of the book serves absolutely no value.  Furthermore, I agree with the previous reviewer that Dr. Peirce  makes some very strong statements in his class.  However, why didn't the  put them in his book?   I guess other professors in the field would have  laughed at him.  Do not buy this book..........and save yourself 15 weeks of  torture by not taking his class at Nova............MBA9
