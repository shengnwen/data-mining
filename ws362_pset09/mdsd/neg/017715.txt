There are 2 articles by Mexican authors. They lack serious scholarship and are highly emotional tyrades that ignore Mexican responsibility (ie, the abolition of the constitution of 1824, etc) for the unrest in Texas that led to revolution. They also ignore the facts that Mexico was the first to attack and the first to declare war against the U.S.. They blame everything on greedy "North Americans" while ignoring the theft of Indian land by Mexico and Mexican brutality against Indians, Zacatecans, Mexican federalists, etc. The American authors offer a couple of good articles but for the most part they seem to be afraid of seeming to defend American expanionism. It's hard to find an American history professor who acts like his country's ever done anything right. Santa Ana had boasted that after he dealt with the rebellion in Texas he might just keep going on to DC. If he had defeated the US, I can easily imagine Mexico's border might be at the Mississippi River today. The ugly tendency of people to take what isn't theirs is a human problem, not a evil white or American problem. The reason for the resentment today is that America is on top. Americans encourage this PC nonsense by having a national guilt-trip. Our great-grandparents did what they did. Get over it. Let a few Mexicans think their people were all sitting around singing kum bah ya, loving everybody when the white devils snuck up on them. If that takes away the embarrassment of having lost a war, fine. It's healthier though to look inward. If Mexico had had a good leader (like a Washington or Lincoln), the war probably would never have happened, and my house would be in Mexico today
