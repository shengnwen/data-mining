This book does not describe the evolution of consciousness but rather the evolution of unconsciousness.  It describes the work scientists have done in determining the limitations and inaccuracies in consciousness thought.  This is useful in helping frame something as poorly defined as consciousness.  However, mostly you can get this from your Psyc101 text.  The worst is at the end where Ornstein introduces a sort of Sufi mysticism as a substitute for the reason he believes is so flawed.  This is a poor substitute that falls apart at the first rational question, why should I believe this new system which has no evidence for it, as opposed to any other?  You know the book is flawed when a single paragraph he quotes from William James "Varieties of the Religious Experience" has more insight than the rest of the book.  Readers who are interested in what Ornstein is trying to commmunicate are better served by reading William James
