This book is beautifully illustrated and I enjoy looking at the pictures again and again with my son.  Unfortunately, the text is cumbersome for younger readers and while I am not typically sensitive to type-casting and stereotyping, it seems as though this book is over-compensating for the male-orientation of past literature and society.

The happy little train in the beginning of the book is female.  Next comes the mean-spirited, high-browed Passenger Engine who is male, followed by the overly-important, too-busy-to-help Freight Train who is also male.  Next comes the too-old, too-tired Rusty Old Engine who is male.  Finally, the "little engine that could" arrives on the scene and she is female.

The message my son comes away with is that he should seek women for help because men are too important or too busy to help and elderly can't help.  The book continues to be one of his favorites so we look at the pictures and make-up the story.
