I love the book it has been a very useful tool through my studies in horticulture. Dirr is brilliant in his abundance of knowledge. Amazon however is extremely overpriced! I ordered a brand new book that had worn edges when I recieved it, paperback and you can get this book hardback from [...] for [...] cheaper! I would suggest going that route
