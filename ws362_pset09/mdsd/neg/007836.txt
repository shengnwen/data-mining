I am passionate about my career and very interested in the particular challenges faced by women in a male-dominated workplace.  I did not find what I needed here -- the book is rather aimless and unnecessarily chatty, rather than providing the kind of focus that I expected from a book with such a direct title!  Lewis's best advice is to be happy where you are and "find joy" while "waiting for that promotion".

I don't have time to wait for a promotion!  If I have a job in my sites, I'm not going to let a day go by just waiting and appreciating where I am.  If I was willing to do that, I wouldn't have bought a book called "Climbing the Ladder . . .".

Some will find Lewis's religious sentiments comforting and inspiring, but I found that it gave the wrong tone to the book.  She is outspoken about her beliefs that things happen for a higher purpose and everything is planned out for us.  Her strategies deal mainly with how to bolster yourself until your big chance finally falls into your lap. If these are not your beliefs, and you need real help to get up and moving, take warning before you invest your time in this book.

As a self-help book for women who need comfort, this is a good choice. If you need practical career advice, look elsewhere.  And I can't resist one small rant here. I got tired of her continual plaint:  "Poor me!  Stuck with this high-power career and all I ever really wanted was to be a stay-at-home mom!!
