Well, I just had to try another Dr. Phil book, since it has been a number of years since I read Life Strategies. To be honest, even though he can be a polarizing figure, I have nothing against him. I think his TV is a source of help and inspiration for thousands of people.

This book however, was a real struggle to complete. It was not coherently structured, and the author kept saying things like "This book will show you...." all the way through the book. It felt like I never left the "Introduction" and he was continually trying to convince me (or himself) that this book really would eventually get to the point and that the point would be profound. Instead it really couldn't ever get moving and instead often relied on crass language as a weak attempt to get the reader's attention.

Fret not! There are other books out there that tackle the same general issue, but are far better reads. I recommend:

1. Failing Forward, by John C. Maxwell
2. Today Matters, by John C. Maxwell

Again, I have no issue with the author, and applaud his efforts. However, in writing a review to my fellow Amazon customers, I must strongly recommend that you spend your time on more impactful literature within this genre. Best of success to you in reaching your goals
