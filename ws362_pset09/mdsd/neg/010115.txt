This book is egregiously superfluous.  Sternhell, who has written good monographs on integral nationalism and the birth of fascism in Europe, suddenly finds that the Zionism which underpins his native land, Israel, is nationalist socialist -- hence a form of integral nationalism and perhaps proto-fascist if not actually fascist.  Is this a revelation?  Hardly.  It has been clear from the work some forty years ago by Carl Schorske that Zionism had the same roots as Viennese anti-semitism, that Zionism was the Jews' finally adoption of a nationalism that every other European people had already adopted.  It was defensive and a recognition that only Jewish nationalism could protest Jews from the nationalisms of their host peoples.  Herzl wanted to make Jews like everyone else:  a people with a land; and Zionism succeeded in giving the Jews a form of militant nationalism.  Sternhell has suddenly discovered that all other isms in Israel -- socialism, Marxism, liberalism, Judaism -- have been fronts for nationalism.  Well, where other peoples have had to invent integral nationalism -- a modern religion of nationalism -- the Jews actually invented integral nationalism in the Old Testament before anyone else.  What Europe contributed to this was 1) rejection of Jewish emancipation and 2) Rousseau, who invented the religion of the modern world, what Sternhell calls nationalist socialism but might as well call National Socialism (pace, Hitler) which is more or less the same thing.  Thus with his untimely revelations Sternhell feeds Arab and black paranoia about Zionism being racist, when all nationalisms are racist or ethno-centric.  This book serves no purpose
