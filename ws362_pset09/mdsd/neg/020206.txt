My first book by this author and I will try to avoid her in the future.   I found the sisters just too dumb to be believed. The hapless victim left to fend for herself is getting to be an old over used scene in a lot of so called mysteries.   They always think the case is solved and go galloping off leaving the intended defenseless and unprotected.    Mediocre story at best.  Don't know where the title came from
