Republicans lose an election, and what do they do? They go right back to the stupid practices that got them kicked  out of office.  Yes, Republicans have gone back to talking about God, taking the moral high ground against the "secular, evil left." Never mind illegal immigration, the trade policies which forfeit our national sovereignty.  Never mind America's loss of credibility and allies in the world. 

My Republican party has abondoned its core principles espoused by Barry Goldwater, which focused on a smaller role for government,   national sovereignty, and fiscal responsibility.  Speaking as a Republican, it looks like my party is bound  and determined to stay the minority party forever, and to become a willing accompliss in putting Hillary in the White House. .
