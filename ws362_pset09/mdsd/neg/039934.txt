The first book I bought was the paperback edition - the print was too small for me to read.  I then purchased the hardback edition - the print was fine on this one.  The overall material is good for a reference since this book is referred to often in the field of evolution.  However, Darwinism is just a theory with no credibility, in light of recent findings in astrophysics and microbiology.  As Darwin says in his own book - if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.  The Big Bang in cosmology, irreducible complexity and DNA information coding in microbiology make Darwin's theroy break down.  I recommend the DVDs Unlocking the Mystery of Life and Journey toward Creation as supplemental material.  Also the book by Michael Denton - Evolution: a Theory in Crisis
