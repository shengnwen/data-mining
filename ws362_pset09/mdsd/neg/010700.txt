As a practicing L.A., I have bought several McGraw-Hill Construction Books.  I get a similar result each time:  They seem on first look to fulfill the promise, but I found they don't well serve the need in real life.  I get far better use out of Architectural Graphic Standards, and I'm looking forward to Wiley's Landscape Architectural Graphic Standards
