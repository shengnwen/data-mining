I enjoy his radio show. I agree with much of what he says. Yet, it all doesn't seem to jibe. You often do get the feeling that he is an oppurtunist. 
Also, a question:
How can someone call him/herself a "cultural crusader" and build a radio show around politics and "culture" when he/she doesn't own a TV set? Whether we like it or not television has become one of the most powerful influences on Western culture. How is one going to comment on cable news, reality shows, risque comedy/dramas, the pull of MTV, BET, etc. on youth fashion, speech and morality if one never watches any of it?
