I was hoping for a reference that would help me in occasional events where I don't feel comfortable with the &quot;social rules&quot;. I've had this book for over a year and, way too often, it doesn't answer the questions that come up. The dining guide is good. Otherwise, it's pretty incomplete. If you're new to the American culture and are looking for basics, this is probably ok.  Otherwise, find something with much better breadth
