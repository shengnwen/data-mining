This bible as far as the commentary goes should be considered heretical. For instance the commentator of the book of Esther considers the book three seperate tales combined to make historical points but cannot be proved to be historically true. So far this has made me uncomfortable with this Bible being one of my main sources of study. Although this Bible seems to be very scholarly in its content reaserched seemingly thoroghly, giving good information. It seems that the contributors are attempting to undermine divine inspiration of the Bible. This study Bible must be used always with other study Bibles sound in its doctrine.
