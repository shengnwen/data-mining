Apart from the section on Shannon, who is not covered well by others, I found very little to recommend this book. Much of the material is popularized elsewhere and Seife is not a compelling writer who can clarify concepts. I remain to be convinced that conceits equating the universe with a giant quantum computer really enhance our understanding of the universe, or its contents. Particularly as we still have no idea what 96% of the universe is made of (dark matter)!!! In essence, saying that information explains everything is rather like saying language is made up of words that have to be in specific patterns to make sense...a worthless tautology that sounds great but whose information content is zero.
