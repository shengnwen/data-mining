I am agog at the praise heaped upon this piece of unpunctuated garbage. I was assigned this for my book club and I truly hate books where the author refuses (or maybe doesn't know how to) use punctuation. For me, it is confusing to read a conversation between many people where no punctuation is used. (I also hated Plainsong for this reason~~but at least in that book new paragraphs happened along once in a while) I wanted to love this book, but I could not. Finally, around page 150 I grew so weary of trying to understand who was speaking to who that I gave up. So I am the first to say that I did not finish it. But I got muddy and bloody in the process of trying to enjoy it. Maybe it reads better in Portuguese
