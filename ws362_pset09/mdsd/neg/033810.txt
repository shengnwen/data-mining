The book is great, and the thing to get if you want to improve at chess and/or enjoy solving chess puzzles.  However, be warned that the pages of the book came out fairly soon after I started working through the puzzles.  The book binding and print quality was very poor.  I don't know if this is a general problem with the publishing company or not, but it was the case with both 1001 chess puzzle books I got by the great Mr. Reinfeld.
