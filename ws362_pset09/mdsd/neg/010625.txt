This book did not match my expectations. It is fun to flip through and look at some of the images, but most of the photos are not very well done, too cluttered with everything, but the cats. The layout of the book is too cluttered, confusing too. That said, there are a few very nice shots and overall it's a fun book, but i still put it down with a bad taste in my mouth. If you're looking for cool pictures of animals in nice pet-friendly surroundings, but &quot;Animal House Style&quot; by Julia Szabo. It's a so much better book
