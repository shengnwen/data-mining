From time to time I read a book and dislike the heroine so much that I don't even care what happens to her.  In this book, I didn't particularly dislike Susanna but I just flat didn't "get" her.  A man is stalking her so instead of telling Jack, her husband who just happens to be a Texas Ranger, she packs up and moves from Texas to Boston.  Then, even though she proclaims her deep love for her husband she just can't bring herself to return home to him and instead puts down strong roots in Boston at her grandmother's house and even purchases an isolated cabin several hours north of Boston.  

Her husband learns of the danger she is in and goes to Boston to be with her and once again she sneaks off from him...this time running to the cabin.  THEN, the woods around the cabin are crawling with bad guys, one of whom is a murderer and is also after her so instead of staying in the cabin where another Texas Ranger is there to keep her safe she decides to go cross-country skiing and surprise, surprise runs into the bad guy who, duh, tries to kill her.  Now there's a surprise!  

Okay, call me stupid, but if my husband were a CPA and I had an accounting problem, I probably would ask for his help.  If my husband were a doctor and I had some sort of mystery ailment, I think I would ask for his opinion.  And if my husband were a cop and I had some really bad guys after me, I believe I would see if my husband could help keep me safe!  

Like I said, I just didn't GET Susanna. I think Ms. Neggers intended to portray Susanna as being so strong that she didn't need her husband.  Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to understand that being strong sometimes means realizing when you need to turn to someone else for help.  If Jack had been a brain surgeon and Susanna had learned she had a brain tumor, I wonder if she would have insisted on showing how strong she was by operating on herself.

Guess this is a book I won't be keeping.
