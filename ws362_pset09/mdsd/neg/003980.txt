When I saw this book, i thought it was a good book for me.  but when  i began to read it (after i bought it), i noticed something that i hadn't before: this was a woman's book.  and not only a womens book, but a businesss  womens book.  i am not a woman, nor am i a business person, so i couldn't relate to the author AT ALL.  So, I wouldn't recomend this book to boys, guys, or men; nor would i recomend it to women that can't relate to business-type stuff (which i can't).  i feel bad that i wasted my money on a book written for the oppisite sex, but oh well... it was bargain price! My ratings is innaccurate for the appropiate adience of this book, though...
