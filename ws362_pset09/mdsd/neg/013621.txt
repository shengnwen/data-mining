Hannah Foster Webster uses letters to tell a story of Eliza and her lovers. Although this is an ingenious method, it makes the reading so complex.Webster also explores the power that women have in Revolutionary  America. It is a good portrayal of the exception. In a time when most women  are ruled by their father or husband, Eliza and her mother are both  independent. The most striking detail of the book is that Eliza is actually  &quot;past her prime&quot; in terms of that era. She is 37 years old; many  women would have been married at 16. Altogether this book was a good and  quick read and I would recommend it to those who like history or women's  studies
