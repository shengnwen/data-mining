The author is well qualified to write this book, but I feel she is writing only for code jockeys. I work in this field and found the book incomprehensible. Clearly some people find the codes very useful, but my one star reflects the books overall value. It is basically uneditied set of personal notes written in a highly esoteric manner. There appears to be no professional editing or formatting. I bought the book because the title makes it look like anyone can create an army of webbots after reading it. If you're not a gifted programmer with specialized knowledge in this field, forget it. I feel bad writing this because I know the author who is a truly fine and brillian person.
