A number of my fellow college students and I have found this book to excrutiatingly slow, heavy reading. The average student will spend several hours reading Roberts, only to note with dismay that he/she has only covered one or two chapters. This book contains a wealth of information, but this does not redeem its wet-cement reading consistency. My rating of one star is too generous for Roberts' History of Europe
