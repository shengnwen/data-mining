The concept of this book is intriguing:  an insider's view of an Antarctic research facility.  Unfortunately the author seems more interested in ridiculing his former employers than providing anything insightful on how the place actually operates.  The gist of his story is that menial laborers are not well paid and accommodations are sparse. Right - were you expecting to make $250K a year hauling garbage and mopping kitchens?  The blue collar workers viewed as heroes by the narrator come across as losers.  The author continually boasts about getting drunk, getting laid and fighting against The Man.  Their dorm room hijinks are no more wacky than your typical state university student housing.  Who cares..
