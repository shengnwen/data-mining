I've been reading a lot of business books to get information on how to grow my business. Of all those books, this one is mostly fluff. Many of the statements are vague and ambigious. There isn't much for solid advice. Buzzwords are used everywhere (Do you want a "value-added investor" funding your business?) Numbers and statistics are nonexistant other than a few graphs that look like they were sketched by hand. The author tends to throw lots of questions at you to think about, but doesn't give any advice on the topics.

There were a few bits of useful information on how other people will look at your business and value it, but it's not worth reading through the whole book for them. They could have been summarized in a bulleted list on a few sheets of paper.
