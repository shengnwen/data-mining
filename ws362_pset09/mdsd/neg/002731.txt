This book teaches almost nothing about sound processing. The writing style is bad, actually this is a monolog of a DSP expert showing off what he knows. There's no one subject that he explains well. He assumes that the reader has technical knowledge in many subjects that are outside the scope of the book. for example, in one section were he describes quadrature sampling, he just throws that it's better then using wavelets. Wavelets are not explain anywhere in the book though... The book is filled with senteces like the above. Even worse, most of the time the autor talks about programming for windows, MFC, code optimizations and GUI - Subjects not very related to Audio DSP. The author seems to be a very talented guy, but he doesn't know how to write books. Don't buy it
