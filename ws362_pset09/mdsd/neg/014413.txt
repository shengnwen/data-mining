The author is completely wrong when it comes to her statements about breastfeeding.  She also is in favor of a 9-month-old crying it out, and claiming that babies who cry at that age are manipulative (even Dr. Ferber softened his view!)  Again, what disturbed me the most was her inaccurate information about breastfeeding.  Obviously, she chose to wean her babies at a very young age, and wanted to justify her decision.  Instead, I recommend Dr. Sears's, "The Breastfeeding Book", "So That's What They're For" (Janet Tamaro), or "The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding" for accurate, medically-sound information with regards to breastfeeding.
