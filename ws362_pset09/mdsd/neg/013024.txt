A mediocre book on a great topic.  Rather than providing any specific  insights (original concepts, tools, and techniques) on how to achieve  customer intimacy, the book is hardly more than a 200-page repository of  truisms.  Nothing is elaborated upon; everything is surface and words. One  is left with the impression that the author is more interested in promoting  his consultancy practice than in conveying anything deep or useful.  For a  more thorough treatment of the same subject, readers may want to turn to  &quot;Customer Connections&quot; by Wayland and Cole
