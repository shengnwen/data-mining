I read about half of this book. There was a lot detailed information about Hume's positioning in English and French Societies and Rousseau's many problems, but nothing that engaged me with these characters. It was not very novelistic and there was not much discussion of their ideas or of the broad social and intelectual contexts that made them interesting. Maybe things picked up in the second half
