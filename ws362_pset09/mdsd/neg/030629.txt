A quick run-down for the lazy:
- The overview of philosophical thinkers is absurdly short.
- The history of ethics is also woefully abrubt.
+ it's fairly easy to read.
- lacks depth of analysis, contains strawman argument, circular logic, and other logical flaws.
- author insists on existance absolutes
- author frequently mixes up the meanings of ethics and morality.

Ruggiero focuses on pro-western attitudes, Christians, and christian apologists in the formation of his theories. He quotes studies out of context and uses rediculous extremes to underline 'grey areas' of argument.  Often times the 'challenges' or questions in his text are flatly one sided or all too easy to answer.

I view this as a high school level text, wholly inadequate for college use, and decidedly biased.

Nevertheless, it's a good starting point for someone young and curious about ethics.  I don't think it ever hurts to consider viewpoints, even faulty ones. Though I agree with much of the thrust of ethical position/slant of the text, I bridle at the abuse of logic and the strained conclusions.

Always be on the lookout for strawman argument, argument by anecdote, and appeal to emotions. These are huge logical flaws which destroy any argument no matter how well intended
