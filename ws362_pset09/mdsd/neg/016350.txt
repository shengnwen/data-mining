I wanted a cute & funny desk calendar for my office at work.  I decided to break my tradition of Get Fuzzy calendars, and picked this one up instead.  Big Mistake.  Not only are the photos and captions Not Funny, but some of them are inappropriate for the workplace as well.  

I just want to know how you can screw up a cat calendar
