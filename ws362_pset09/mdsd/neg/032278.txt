I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.

Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.

The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.

By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one
