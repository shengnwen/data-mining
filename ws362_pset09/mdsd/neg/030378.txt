Every five years or so, I treat myself to reading all seven of Isaac Asimov's Foundation books back-to-back, beginning with "Prelude" and continuing through the entire chronology, except that I like to read "Forward the Foundation" last. Having just finished my 2004 reading, I am not going to continue with the Second Trilogy books, nor do I think I will ever crack their covers again.

Though the books by Benford, Bear and Brin describe the Foundation universe with more color and texture than ever, the greater detail brings more disappointment than fascination.  Hari Seldon and other characters we've come to know act much differently and often seem like strangers. 

Most disappointing is the treatment of Dors Venabili, recharacterized with a misspelled name in Foundation's Fear.  Her appearance in Foundation and Chaos  tampers unforgivably with the happy ending Asimov gave us in the Epilogue of Forward the Foundation, his last novel in a long career.  Given Asimov/Seldon's affection for this character, the parallels between Dors and Asimov's wife Janet, and between "Forward" and the latter years of Asimov's own life, this development alone was enough to ruin the entire second trilogy experience for me.

Taking over another writer or artist's franchise is never easy.  Benford, Bear and Brin had supreme guts for trying and their books are not uninteresting. They do however, show us Asimov's universe without Asimov's warmth, and familiar characters as portrayed could be from any garden-variety science fiction book.  Hari Seldon, Daneel Olivaw and the rest of the cast were special because of the way Asimov drew them and the voices he gave them. I will always prefer to conclude the Foundation series with one word: Dors!
