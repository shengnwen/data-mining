When I get a landscaping book I like to see plenty of examples in full color pictures. Maybe get a few ideas and see what others have come up with that I can mix and integrate into my own water garden. This book is 95% wording and 5% pictures. I thought the book was a little dry and uninteresting. I'm glad I got it on E-Bay for $2.50 because I would never pay full price for it
