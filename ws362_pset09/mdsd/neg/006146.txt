This is the third installment in the Mitch Rapp series and the author's fourth book overall. (I'd suggest reading the previous books both for chronology reasons and that they're better reads.) Mitch is America's #1 "go to" guy when it comes to fighting terrorism. In "Separation of Power" he is faced with cleaning up some open issues from his last mission (someone tried to kill him), the political "in-fighting" surrounding the naming of a new CIA chief, rogue Mossad agents, Iraq gaining nuclear weapons and falling in love. One could be forgiven in thinking this last issue would make for a pleasant diversion while our hero prevents WW III. Not so. Mitch's romance takes a front and center position and in a word is well ... comedic. The "action" threads of the plot - which this author has worked so well in his previous books - is hinted at in the first 100 pages, doesn't really begin until after 200 pages - and then proceeds in fits and starts. There is an inordinate amount of "character development" - self-serving, amoral, scheming politicans & our world weary, battle scarred reluctant hero Mitch, who must once again pick up the sword to do what no other man can do - which like the "romance" impedes the plot. The book hastily concludes, (20+ pages), in an unsatisfying and simplistic finale. Hopefully this book is an anomaly in the series because the author's previous books were great roller coaster rides and provided entertaining reading at the beach and in airports. Unfortunately the much rushed conclusion and Mitch's "new" situation doesn't guarantee that.
