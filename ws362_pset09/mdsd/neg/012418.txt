I unfortunaely am not like every other person who has read this book . I too am one of those "Hippie" moms (not the worst thing in the world to be called, but I am insulted nonetheless)- although there are a few cute anectdotes in this book that make me smile I can only say that is why I gave this book two stars instead of one.
 
The front cover lists this book as a "survival manual". As a mom of a two year old boy who has yet to sleep for a period of four hours or longer at night am at times desperate for a "survival manual". 

Directly quoted from this book I read ...
"Can't we do somethng to make their own bed or crib more appealing (like fill it with gummy bears and boxes of fruit punch)? Why must the entire family end up in tears? The answer to that is: I don't know. I have spent ten years of my life wrestling with very mixed success, with the different approaches to teaching my children to stay and sleep in their own beds, and it only seems to work when disappointment and tears are involved. But here's some good news: I have also discovered that crying never killed anyone." 
----I'm not joking page 183 it is in there.----

AGHHH! What?? What century is this woman livng in? Who cares about being "groovy mommy"?

To note also do not get this book for any factual informational whatsoever, you will be extremely disappointed. This book may I repeat "may" if your bored and have some free-time(ha!ha! cause as mommies with toddlers you have tons of that) give you a couple of giggles. Perosonally, I'd rather run after my screaching bare bottom toddler with a diaper.

If you are looking for a means to help your child through the most important years of his or her life, ideas on parenting techniques or for sound advice, find a book that was written based on concise factual information which involved some sort of research, not just on one mother's memory and experience.
