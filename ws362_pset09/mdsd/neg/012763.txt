Rita Mae Brown needs to get an opinion column or a role as a political pundit and quit imposing her political views on her mystery readers.  Pages of sermonizing on various topics as noted by other reviewers padded out this poorly written and skimpily plotted book.  Both the murderer and the method of murder were telegraphed well before the end.  Even Harry isn't as fun as she used to be.  I've read the whole series and agree that it is definitely going down hill.  If I read the next book, I'll get it from the library rather than wasting money buying it.  Sneaky Pie needs a better co-author and editor
