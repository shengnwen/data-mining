I agree with the reader(s) who said this book totally contradicts itself and seems thrown-together, as if no one proofread it.  In one chapter she'll recommend something; then later on she'll tell you it's ineffective and/or dangerous!  She gives a long, long list of herbal supplements that are supposed to aid weight loss -- but she just repeats all the advertisers' claims without any comments, recommendations or opinions of her own.  Personally I think most natural/ herbal supplements are a ripoff, but if she had given any testimonials by people who've found them to work, I might consider trying them. On the whole, this book is a waste of money
