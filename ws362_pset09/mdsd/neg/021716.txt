This book has some great common-sense advice on the behaviour-management aspect of parenting.  It emphasizes the use of routine to help your child understand boundaries (which in turn are set from your beliefs and goals in parenting), which I've found very helpful.

For me there were three disappointing aspects to this book:

1. No bibliography.  A lot of statements were made about research findings, but then not backed up because they were not quoted and referenced.  I had to take the authors' word for both the research and interpretation of findings.

2. Contradictory in parts.  I kept feeling as if the authors were making explicit statements that were later implicitly contradicted by the advice given.  But that could be my faulty understanding of the text.

3. It's very short, which makes for easy reading.  However I would have preferred more and in-depth discussions on the many facets of parenting toddlers.  E.g, parenting children according to their different natures (mentioned but not gone into).  I have a child who is naturally shy and observant, rather than a participator - how do I best encourage her (if at all) to come out of her shell?

In my present stage of parenting (mother of a single 18-month-old child! :-) ) I would highly recommend this as a great book on toddler behaviour management.  However I have given it two stars as it is touted as a book on parenting, but imho it covers only one aspect of that - albeit an important one
