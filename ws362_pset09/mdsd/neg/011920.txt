Barnes reduces the complexities of developing a career as a fine artist to short, opinionated paragraphs under multiple headings.  It sounds condescending and dictorial.  Some of the bad advice she gives includes  suggesting you move to New York; courting gallery owners like her with  flowers, limos, lunch, or buying art from her shows.  If you are looking  for a quick overview of the artist-gallery relationship from this  particular dealer's perspective, you'll find that information here, but I  suggest you try a worthy publication like Cay Lang's Taking The Leap or  Carol Michels' How to Survive and Prosper as an Artist
