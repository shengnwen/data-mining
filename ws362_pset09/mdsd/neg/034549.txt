  Creationists like Dembski would like to drag us back into the dark ages.  Back to times of the "inquision" when they burned the unfaithful and locked Galileo under house arrest for daring to challenge church athority with new views of the universe.  Galileo and Darwin were pioneers in modern science, not the end all.  The world is not flat and evolution is a fact.  Get used to it
