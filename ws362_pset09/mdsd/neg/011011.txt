Why would anyone buy a biography of Jim Morrison by authors who write on page 465 (bottom of page):

"Maybe what destroyed him was their refusal to let him set them free, or more likely, his realization that he had wasted the best years of his life on a few pages of misguided philosophy."

The authors are making reference to the period of time when Jim Morrison was down and facing the thought of having to return to the Florida court system to once again face the trumped up charges that he faced in the Florida crimminal case launched against him.
 Jim Morrison "wasted the best years of his life on a few pages of misguided philosophy"? I think not. I think the authors "wasted their time writing this book, and it is a waste of time to read this book". Aloha. Peace.
