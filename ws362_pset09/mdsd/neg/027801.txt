This book is utter tripe.  If you're interested in BDSM relationships, find another and don't waste your money.  It has nothing to do with a realistic m/s relationship, and frankly, the woman, Misassa, is not a slave, she's arrogant, narcissitic and as pompous as they come.  The "slave rules" she quotes were ripped right out of a piece I read on the net 12 years ago.

Unless you're a complete masochist, leave this book alone.  It's painful to your mind.
