The title of this book compelled me to try it as it sounded fascinating. However, I found it to be very difficult to understand for the average reader. Dewdney frequently introduces terms that he assumes the average person will understand. In most cases that is true, however there are a few times when it isn't. Furthermore, rather than relying on simple examples or other illustrations, he uses very difficult and elaborate examples. His writing clearly shows that he is a scientist and writing for an audience who has a significant background in science. I tried reading each of the 8 problems and came to the same conclusion. Writers like Bryson or even Hawking are much better at taking complex science and math and making them understandable to the layperson
