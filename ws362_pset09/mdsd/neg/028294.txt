Although the trails are well described and a fair amount of geological and historical background is presented, the trail maps make this book almost worthless.  For instance, Hike No. 22 is shown on Map No. 18.  The trail is described on page 70 and the map is on page 180.  Does this sound confusing?  It is.  Also, the overview maps for each park show campgrounds and ranger stations, but they don't show where the individual trails are located.  These desert parks are enormous, and the lack of good overview maps makes it nearly impossible to determine, for instance, what hikes are near the south entrance to Joshua Tree.  Pass on this book
