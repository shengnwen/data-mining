I was shocked by the poor quality of the writing from such a well-known author.  Though published in 1995, the reader is expected to ignore the then-well-known realities of DNA testing -- for instance, that shared parentage can be proved by comparing the DNA of siblings, not just from putative sibling to parent.

We're also asked to ignore the realities of fingerprint identification when it would have been immediately helpful in revealing an imposter's criminal record and actual identity.  

Adding insult to injury, after ignoring the technique when it logically would have come into play, Sheldon brings in fingerprinting at the very tail of the book, in a complicated scenario involving latent prints to identify not the missing heiress, but rather, a private detective!  

Every plot development was telegraphed in advance, and the decedent went from being rather interesting in the first few pages to a one-dimensional (and repetitive) demon throughout the rest of the too-long tome.  Even the vocabulary and sentence structure were overly simplistic.

If you want to read the identical plot but done WELL, try "Amanda" by Kay Hooper, also published in 1995.  Hooper has her character do some marvelously stupid things (again, failing to exploit DNA to the fullest in a timely way), but Hooper's vocabulary, syntax, character development and settings are vastly better than the careless work Sheldon provides in "Morning, Noon, & Night."  I read the books only a week apart.  Hooper's work was engaging, though somewhat predictable; Sheldon's was irritating, and ENTIRELY predictable.
