I bought this book to get some ideas on how to use my new serger in sewing.  I was taken in by the subtitle of this book.  

I was disappointed to find that this book is almost entirely about embellishments.  The embellishments are also things that I remember from years ago and aren't done much now.

I returned this book within days of receiving it as it was basically useless to me
