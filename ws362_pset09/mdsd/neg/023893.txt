Although Carol Dweck is a women, I feel this book would do well in a college "women studies" class. Good stuff, but a little tuff on guys and pity for women. Maybe I am stuck in a "Mindset", but harps a little too much on women issues for me. I will be alble to utilize some material from the book, but would suggest it as a good read for women.
