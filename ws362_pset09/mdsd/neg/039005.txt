I did not find this book to be very inspirational.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead 1 is because this book would be beneficial to some people.  If you like traditional style, like the other reviewers of this book obviously do, this book is probably for you.  Everyone else can find other books that give the same level of technical instructions with more range of styles and better photos.  The book has a lot of sketches instead of actual photos
