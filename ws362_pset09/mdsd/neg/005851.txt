I have read all of Kingsolver's fiction and am a big fan; however, I found these essays preachy and even irritating. Her voice is just a little too pious and seems to assume her audience is made up of clueless shopaholic shell-collecting fast food-chomping dimwits. In attempting to create parables out of "State of the World 2001" issues, she made broad and compelling problems seem almost pedantic. Her usual originality, insightfulness, and clever wit does not come through. I was disappointed
