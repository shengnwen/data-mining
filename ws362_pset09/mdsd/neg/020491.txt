Richard Dawkins has been the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University for quite a few years now.  And he regularly lectures on evolution in the USA.
Yet that same period of time has seen a decline in the number of UK students wanting to study the sciences at university, and a significant rise in various forms of opposition to evolutionist ideas, particularly so-called Intelligent Design.

Whilst I DON'T want to make a direct link between these two facts it does appear that we can learn a lesson here - and one which both Dawkins and Shanks have noticeably failed to grasp:

However good the case for evolution may be, and however flawed the opposing arguments may be, the "war of words" is NOT being won by the defenders of evolution theory.

Hey, guys, wake up and smell the coffee - YOU AREN'T MAKING CONTACT!  And this book, written in a manner that is virtually guaranteed to re-inforce every reader's existing viewpoint, be it pro or anti, is nothing but a waste of perfectly good trees.

As in so many other books on the subject, the author depends on allegedly "rational/factual" arguments to make his case.  But what he overlooks is a simple fact known to every psychologist - people don't make decisions based on reason, they make them on the basis of "gut instinct", for want of a better expression, then they rationalize their choice later - if necessary.

So, if you already believe what Shanks and Dawkins believe, then you'll believe what's in this book.  If you don't, you won't.  And like it or hate it, THAT is a genuine "fact"
