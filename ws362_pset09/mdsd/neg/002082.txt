An extremely informative series (Biology of plants versions) well written and in depth.  They ruined it with the 7th edition however, by putting two chapters( the ones on ecology) on the internet.  So the book, even though it says it's 800 and some pages, actually is thinner than the old 6th version.  Our teacher couldn't believe they had done this, as this was part of the curriculum.  So, not only would we have to pay about $120 for this book, but also have to print about 100 pages.... That's a sick way to make more money out of books, i'm tired of book companies screwing students just to make some more money.  I returned the 7th edition and got the 6th edition, which has basically the same information and ALL the chapters included in the book!

I don't like being this harsh, because i absolutely love the information this book has.  Reading it has added another dimension to my understanding of plants.  The Ecology chapters missing in the 7th edition are awesome reads, however and probably contain the best real world information that students should have.  As such, i have to praise the 6th edition for it has changed my life for the better!!! :
