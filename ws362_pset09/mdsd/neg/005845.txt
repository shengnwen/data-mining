Episode two of the hunt for the bumbling master spy(Peacemaker) is an improvement over the unfortunate initial episode, No Graves as Yet. There are some good scenes: the beaches at Gallipoli, the amusing downfall of Judy's competitor for the General's wheel, the encounter with the German sub, etc. 
But we still have the preposterous underlying theme that George V would trade continental Europe for German help in retaking the United States for the British Empire. That task made more difficult as Miss Perry has Mexican armies pouring over the Southwestern border to conquer the U.S. Even Zimmerman didn't expect that much. 
Then there is Private Corliss who dominates the opening chapters by suffering a crushed hand, a suspected Self Inflicted Wound(SIW), for which he is court martialed and sentenced to death. 
In WWI, the test for an SIW was whether the injury was caused by British ammunition, not the case here. There were 3,894 recorded SIWs in the British Army during the war; the penalty was a prison sentence. No one was subject to the death penalty for an SIW.
We have Chaplain Joseph who spends half the book playing police detective; a general in command of substantial forces at Ypres who spends most of his time with his attractive driver and seems to have no contact with his regimental commanders or the battles; a reporter for a small newspaper chain whose accurate depiction from Gallipoli would cause millions of Britons to abandon the war, even though the millions had already heard the truth from their sons, daughters, and husbands; etc.
On the bright side, there is a new Pitt mystery, Long Spoon Lane, where Miss Perry makes us feel right at home in both the drawing rooms and the slums of Victorian London.  IMO her reach toward World War I is a war too far.
