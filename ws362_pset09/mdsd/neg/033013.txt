I can't say enough good things about "The Corrections."  Because of that, I had really high hopes for "The Twenty-Seventh City."  I couldn't have been more disappointed in a book.  

Complicated, ambitious characters and plot-lines and themes don't scare me; I prefer those types of stories.  But I could not follow this thing at all.  Many times, I found my mind wandering on other exciting subjects such as what I'm gonna cook for dinner or when am I gonna sort the socks.

S Jammu was a corrupt person with an agenda and that was the only thing that was obvious.  The other sub-plots and characters had no connection as far as I could tell.  The business themes and story lines were boring for me.  The in-depth descriptions of the real estate business held nothing of interest.  

I give this book two stars because in Franzen style the descriptions were outstanding.  

I wouldn't tell anyone NOT to read this book.  I just didn't happen to get it.  I do think there are plenty of people out there who would have an appreciation for this bizarre story
