I purchased this book specifically because of the "North Carolina" in the title.  However, except for six pages about N. C. frost dates, rain fall and hardiness zones, I've found nothing in this book that is specific to gardening in North Carolina (not to say that it isn't good, basic advice about southern gardening).  I feel cheated
