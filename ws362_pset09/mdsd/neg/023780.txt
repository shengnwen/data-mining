This is the first book I've picked from the ChangeThis "Personal MBA" list (http://www.changethis.com/17.PersonalMBA) and boy am I disappointed.

I thought this primer-level introduction to business would give me the tools I needed to understand the nuts & bolts of Collins and Lazier's *Running the Small to Mid-Sized Business* but no such luck.

He gives us a taste of the math that is required to understand business, but I guess he's afraid of scaring people off with too much math, because it's glossed over in such a way as to be unusable.  It's like sex without penetration.

And right now I'm reading a section where he says, "Obviously, the higher the P-E multiple, the more wealth is created."

By that logic, all those overvalued internet stocks during the dot com bubble created a lot of wealth.  And so did Enron.

I hope the other books on the "Personal MBA" list are better than this
