Granted, instructional design is not easy! But this book (and the Dick & Carey model in general) go so far into minute details that the bigger picture is lost! 

I liked the outlay of the chapters. Each chapter represents a step in the instructional design process. This is the best feature of the book. But then the model/book goes into minutia and makes for heavy & confusing reading. In fact, several times I found myself saying "I think I understood what they meant the first time they said it, but after they said it 10 different ways, including 3 charts & diagrams, now I'm not so sure!"

The use of the examples in the book, particularly the charts & diagrams add to the confusion rather than making things more clear! A further example of this, is that often page 113, for example, will reference a chart on page 118. So amist the confusion, you have to turn the page and look back and forth between the text and the chart. 

I also don't care for the size of the book. It's irregular and adds to the cumbersome feel of the text.

While it's true that with instructional design, you have to get down to the nitty gritty detail, this textbook seems to wallow in it much, much too long!
