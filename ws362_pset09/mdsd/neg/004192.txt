The first 70 pages of the book are nothing more than the author trying to convince the reader this is an effective method towards releasing weight.  But, even after the author gets to the point, the convincing continues, ad nauseum.  

I became so bored reading the same statements over and over again that I started skimming through the book to find relevant information.  Unfortunately, the relevant information is so scattered that its very tedious to put it all together.  For example, the author says most Westerners expect a list of foods to eat right off the bat.  After trying to convince the reader  this is an unhealthy approach to eating, a food list is given (about 20 pages later).  Yet, its another 50 pages before the author explains why those specific foods were chosen.  

This book is supposed to be written for Western minds to understand Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in order to bring their bodies into balance.  Yet, very little explanation is given about the priciples of TCM.  The author only glosses over the divisions TCM practitioners use (hot/cold, dry/damp, internal/external, etc.), making it difficult to know how to use them correctly.

This may be an effective method for reducing weight, but the poor presentation makes this book practically worthless
