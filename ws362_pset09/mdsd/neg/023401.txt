What a disappointment to get into this "true story" and discover it is a fictionalized account written on young adult level, with some graphic human and elephant sex thrown in towards the latter part of the book. It is a childish and silly piece of writing. Don't bother with it. It is below standard. However, I did learn that this female Indian elephant had "long glorious tusks" that are (for some reason) totally invisible in her photos
