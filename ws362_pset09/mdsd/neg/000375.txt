I find this book unreadable. I read the first half and scanned the rest. I found it rather like a joke played on the reader rather than a novel. If this was a parody of style, it would work better if the reader was very  familiar with the styles being parodied. I felt betrayed for having bought  it. No character, if any could be called that, appeared to be remotely  likeable
