This was the WORST rendition of Rumi poetry reading I have ever suffered through-it was painful to listen to what sounded like a Native American Hick read in a monotone unemotional manner this beautiful poetry.   I even shared it with three other very enlightened spiritual people because I thought it might just be my personal opinion, but they asked me to turn it off!  It was Like drinking sour milk
