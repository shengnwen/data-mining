I am disappointed with this book.  I was really looking forward to reading it since I own Baby Bargains and recommend it to anyone I know.  This is a huge disappointment compared to Baby Bargains.  Most of the reviews are pretty general, and as one reviewer stated, the information can be found on-line.  I thought it would cover a lot more product than it does.  I purchased the book looking for information on 2 separate items (umbrella/travel strollers and bike trailers) and was unsatisfied with the information.  Umbrella strollers aren't even mentioned, and bike trailers consist of one page with only one review.  Not at all what I had expected.  Had I flipped thru the pages before buying I could have saved myself a few dollars
