Yes, free enterprise capitalism brings more economic benefits than socialism.  Reagan's tax cuts worked.  There is a great moral truth that people should retain their earnings rather than fork them over to the state bureaucracy.  Yet, the Reagan boom did not lift all boats.  The mediocre and the inept slipped backward in the 80s just as they have during the Clinton boom of the 90s.  The rise of the two wage-earner family, much of it forced on mothers due to economic circumstances (continued high taxes, the collapse of high wage, semi-skilled jobs) is a shame which neither Republican or Democrat or liberal or conservative have really attempted to tackle.  The press release, prevelant during the Clinton and Reagan booms, of &quot;We've created ___ million jobs in __ years&quot; is a lazy, stupid, dishonest sort of boast. The families of America would be better off with fewer but better paid jobs rather than a bunch of $8/hr. jobs. The New Class, either conservative or liberal, does not seem to understand it.
