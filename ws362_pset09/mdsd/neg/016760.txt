This book was/has been a major dissapointment, I have relied on every source imaginable for preparation for 70-210 and this one was particulary bad in that it ignores many items while putting emphasis on items you may not encounter. This book is ok if you just want to learn windows 2000 pro and be able to work with it, but not if you want to get certified. It completely neglects the novell/w2k enviroment and does not cover RIS/SYSPREP/unattended installations in enough detail. It's pretty crummy when the company who makes the software and the tests cant get it together
