I will preface the review that I believe most of the tenets of "Peak Oil" and related arguments.  I picked up this book after seeing it in a side-bar banner add on a popular peak oil forum.  I was disappointed as soon as I started reading.  my main comments on the book are
1)  The book doesn't offer any new data on the topic, but instead gives a rehash of peak oil along with some alarmist consequences
2)  The book doesn't offer any tenable strategies to survive the author's "power down" scenario.  Kunstler in his book "Long Emergency" gives more meat here (though still not too much).
3)  The author gets sidetracked in a conspiracy theory discussion on Bush, the Iraq war, and various other ills of the military-industrial complex.  Generally I think these types of theories don't add a lot to the discourse, and was annoyed to see "Bush is Bad" references sprinkled throughout.

Bottom line is: not terrible, but not worth $10
