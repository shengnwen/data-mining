I was very disappointed in this book, and not just because it is difficult.  I was mainly disappointed because rather than explaining religion, Boyer explained the "transmission" of religious beliefs.  He explains the influence of "memes" (cultural archetypes)on people's beliefs, but he doesn't explain why some people reject them and believe something else
