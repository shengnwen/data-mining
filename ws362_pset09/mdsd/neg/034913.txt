This book should have been marketed more for casual readers or non-biologists. I bought it after only reading the dust-cover info. and the table of contents. My mistake. If you need a book for a biochemistry class related to abiogenesis, this is not your book. Besides the lack of detail in the processes of life formation, Hazen mentions way too many names. It's nice to know the names of the major players but he throws out so many that I'm tempted to think the honorably mentioned paid him or he wrote this to pay off a debt to them. Read it and you'll even get to learn the names of some of the grads and undergrads that worked in various labs. Boring! Hazen creates too much drama with the details of setting up an experiment when he should be dealing with the results. He tries too hard to make science sound fun and cool, when realisticaly those reading this book will already have a passion for science. The only biology educated folks that should buy this are undergrads that want to know what research is like.
