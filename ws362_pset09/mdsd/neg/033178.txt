I'm almost half-way through this book now, and find it's increasingly becoming more of a struggle for me to keep going back and reading more.  Most of the book is a blow-by-blow (sometimes literally) account of the author's swinging experiences, with some comments about how he and his partner felt about the experiences thrown in.

Anytime I read I find myself quickly becoming bored due to the sameness of the descriptions of their experiences, and getting really irritated with the author's habit of ending every other sentence with an exclamation mark!  There is a serious need for a skilled editor here!  See what I mean!

I'm no psychologist, and maybe I'm just envious, but the author also seems to spend a lot of time and effort describing in repetitious detail his own (and his partner's) insatiable sexual appetites.  How many times do I need a description of how much she squirts, how many times he humps in an evening, how big and hard he gets, and how often they make love when by themselves, including seemingly mandatory descriptions of their yells upon cumming and of course more exclamation marks!?  I can enjoy and get off on good written porn, but this is not it.

I've had a lot of swinging experiences myself, so I do know what it is like, and can identify with most of the author's experiences.  On the other hand, I think they could be communicated in a much more skilled manner by another author.

The more I read, the more I feel ripped off by the(...)price.  All in all, I'm sorry I bought the book.  There are other books and DVDs that do a much better job describing swinging experiences and emotions
