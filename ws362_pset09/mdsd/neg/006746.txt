I have read all three books in this trilogy. I started with Earth Song not knowing that it was a trilogy. Earth Song is #2 and it is very enjoyable. It is funny and it held my interest. Then I went to #1 and finally to #3 which is Fire Song. The main male characters..Roland in Secret Song and I can't remember the guys name in Fire Song...border on insane! They are so jealous and suspicious through the entire book. Well, to be fair, the last 10 pages they find they really love the lady...too late for me I guess. At one point Daria got so mad at Roland she knocked him down some stairs. I enjoyed reading that part because he deserved it. I love Catherine Coulter's writing but found myself getting mad reading this after the guys had called their ladies lying and deceitful one too many times!
