Even though there is no image of this product available, people should be told that it is a Cram 101 textbook OUTLINE and not the entire text like it portrays in the title.  I needed the textbook for a class and according to the info on the web this book was the one I needed.  When it arrived I was very upset to see it was basically a book of definitions and not what was advertised at all.  If that had been disclosed to begin with, it would have saved alot of irritation.
