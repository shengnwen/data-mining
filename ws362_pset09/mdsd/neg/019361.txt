This book is a an easy read that provides a few points and snickers on the topic. However, Eva Shaw provides way too much common sense instructions, which are redundant, boring and pretty much pointless to the topic of the book. Here is one of many examples: "Every writer needs to take several breaks. Go for a short walk, right now, if only for five minutes. Get out of the office during your writing day. When you're walking, straighten your posture, breathe deeply and swing your arms. Go once around the garden, up and down a flight of stairs or to the end of the block and back. If you're absolutely, positively not the type to walk, stretching is also great to get the brain cells functioning again." 
I guess I'm just not a writer, because I think this paragraph was a rather pointless filler
