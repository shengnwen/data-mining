It was just a little over 13 months ago that Americans flushed this john and voted for leadership. We didn't buy into the lies or false claims of heroism perpetrated by Kerry and writers like Brinkley who rely on their subject for facts (fat chance)

The economy is moving well. Iraq is moving well regardless what Kerry says. This Kerry promotional piece did not work and thank God for that.

HAPPY ANNIVERSARY AMERICANS! WE ALL "FLUSHED THE JOHNS IN 2004!
