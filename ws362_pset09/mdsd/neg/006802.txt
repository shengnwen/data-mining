My husband suffered a severe Traumatic Brain Injury on 4/16/02.  After every TBI, no matter how mild or severe, personalities are changed.  That means losing your original loved one and grieving him, yet knowing he is still here, but very different physically, cognitively and emotionally

I was hoping to get some help with this book on accepting my grief and moving on with whatever is left of our lives together. However, I found that it was mostly about congenital disabilities and those where the loved ones' personality basically stays the same. I was disappointed that still no one seems to acknowledge how difficult it is to be a spouse and caregiver to a loved one who has sustained a Traumatic Brain Injury.  I am hoping to see more written about it in the future.  It is a unique phenomena that only those of us who live with it seem to know about.
