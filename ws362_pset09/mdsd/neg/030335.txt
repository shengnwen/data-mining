After reading the Oprah Pick, "What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, I was very disappointed in "Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do."  It took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and I lost interest after about the first fifty pages.  I don't think Pearl Cleage is a paticularly talented novelist; I think she can write realistic,sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters, but the story is lacking.  

I loved the very first part of the book where Regina Burns has just gotten out of rehab, is losing her anscestral home, so she goes to her aunt Abbie for help and comfort and Abbie introduces Regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause--that is the story I wanted to read.  Instead, what I got is a very political story infused with the author's belief that black men especially need positive role models.  I believe we ALL need to be and have positive role models, that it is not just a black thing.  

I wanted to read more about Regina and Blue.  I felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed.  I hope that Pearl Cleage's next novel is better than this one, but I'm sorry to say I don't hold out much hope
