I purchased "Wisdom From The Monastery". WFTM covers a lot compared to this book. Reading WFTM, one could start a program for himself. This books is like use and throw product. WFTM is like reading a book, keeping it in the shelf. Reading again and again. 

Only the cover of this book looks good. On seeing the cover, i thought this book will be equal to the quality of WFTM

If i had a rating below 1, i would rate it 0.7
