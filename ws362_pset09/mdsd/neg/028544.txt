Ms Moore undoubtedly knows how to write a clever turn of phrase.  But she seems far too consciously self conscious and wears her jaded view of life like a personal crown of thorns.  Some of the stories were passably entertaining, but strangely forgettable.  Most of them, however were numbingly cynical and self absorbed.  I tried to read this book (based on wildly enthusiastic reviews at the time) back when it was published in 1998.  I never finished it.  This year I ran into it on my bookshelf again, and wondered if I'd read it; and if so, why didn't I remember it?  There was a bookmark still in it...about three or four stories in.  So...why couldn't I remember anything about it?  I started reading it again...and nothing came to mind.  I had absolutely no recollection of any of the stories I'd apparently read in 1998.  I made it to the 10th story this time, and once again...I put the book back on the shelf.  This time I enclosed a note to not bother with it again.  I sincerely hope that most people do not view life as presented in this book, and I ardently hope most people aren't as flawed and unbalanced as Ms Moore seems to view them. While there are moments of humor, I fail to see goose genocide as amusing. That is just one example of what I saw as cynicism run amok. I attempted to re-read this book only two weeks ago.  I just went and got it back down to write this review...and to my surprise...once AGAIN..I'd already forgotten most of every story.  What a waste.
