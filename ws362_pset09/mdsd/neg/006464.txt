I felt it was very scientific and difficult reading.  I wasn't able to get past 20 minutes with this book although I am sure by the title it has great information in it.  I don't feel it's for the average person more medical / scentific minds.   Truthfully, I feel my money was wasted and wish I would of took the time to return it.
