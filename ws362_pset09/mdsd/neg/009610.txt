I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there.

I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage. That will leave room in the suitecase for her next book... A JD Robb I believe.
I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did
