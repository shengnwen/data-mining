I have enjoyed reading true crime for some time now including Whoever Fights Monsters, But this book is self serving and does not introduce any new information you have not already read.  It seems Mr. Ressler is angry at John Douglas and others for not aknowledging his effort while an active profiler and he is trying to show them he was first or best or something.  The message was lost on me.  The interviews are something to read however the bulk of the book is simply a retread of his previous works.  My advice.  Skip it
