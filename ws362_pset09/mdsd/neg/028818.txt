Well The Time Machine was an ok book. It could have been better. Wells does a great job at describing the future from his view point. High points in the book were chapters 4 through 9 thats where the Time Traveller goes to the year 802701 and meet carnivorous creatures called Morlocks. One thing I did like about the book is the epilouge after chapter 12 saying that the Time Traveller never came back, it was a great cliffhanger. All in all, The Time Machine is an ok book. I strongly recommend this book to H.G. wells fans
