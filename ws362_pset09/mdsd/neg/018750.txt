For a story that closely follows the events of a single day, it's ironic that the only interesting parts of this narrative take place in the past. From the teaser on the back cover and the first hundred pages, you'd think the meatiest aspect of this story is the race to prevent a crazed killer from claiming another victim before the end of day. Instead, this aspect of the story is surprisingly mundane. The identity of the killer is revealed early in the story, and it's at this point that the story begins to lag. The revelation, by itself, isn't necessarily a mistake. Detective shows on TV do it all the time, and the story then focuses on figuring out how the murder was committed and the investigative work involved. This story, however, offers none of that. The killer is the only suspect, his actions will inevitably lead the police to arrest him, and the only reason the police don't arrest him is the fear they won't be able to find where he's hidden his next victim. The real meat of the story focuses on the relationships between the primary characters and why the killer is driven to murder. As the story unfolds, the motivations of the characters are slowly revealed, primarily through flashbacks and other revelations of the characters' past. The final revelations at the end of the story are well done and fully explain the motivations of the killer, but at that point it's not enough to have made the read worthwhile
