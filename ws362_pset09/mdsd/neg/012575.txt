I heard good things about this author, enjoy supernatural thrillers, and the storyline seemed interesting.  Unfortunately the back of the book was better than the contents themselves.  I plodded through the first quarter of the book and had to put it away.  The characters weren't engaging and the dialogue dry and dull.  I waited and waited for the pace to pick up, for something to happen to make me care about what happened to the characters.  No dice.

I tried to pick it back up not too long ago, thinking maybe I just hadn't read far enough to get to the good parts.  Well, I plodded along until I was about two-thirds of the way through before I gave up entirely.  The idea was interesting, but in my opinion the author was sleepwriting when she wrote this.  Not worth the cost, even in a discount store
