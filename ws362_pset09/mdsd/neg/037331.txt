This book focuses too much on Sun's application server, and not enough on the concepts behind the standardized J2EE.  At the same time it has a very long chapter on XML which could have been left out since there are plenty of good books and Web sites that already cover the topic.  The XML chapter does not even mention XML Schema, which are replacing DTDs as the standard way to describe the layout of an XML document.  Also, the book lacks a sufficient amount of code examples.  There are also numerous errors in the page references in the book's index.  Avoid this book if you are really wanting to learn J2EE
