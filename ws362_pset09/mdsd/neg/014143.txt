I tried to read this book, I really did but please Daffyd you could really do more with this book. I have had trouble reading other books before but I am a pretty open person and usually manage to finish them. However I  couldn't even get halfway through this book, it was that terrible. Still,  everyone is different, don't let my silly ramblings, dissuade you from  buying this book you may like it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained
