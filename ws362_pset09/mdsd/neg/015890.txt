This book does a great job of paralleling basic business concepts with Monopoly game play.  This would work perfectly if business was conducted by four persons in your living room.  

The book covers concepts including aggressiion, opportunity, maximizing odds and negotiation.  If you find these concepts new or intriguing then this is a great book for you.  I found it somewhat humorous and witty but not enough to recommend to friends. 

I do find myself oddly excited about my next game of Monopoly as I now have some insights on game strategy that I never knew or cared about before
