I am doing my own hair for my wedding.  This book has a wedding section so I thought it would work.  It did not.

Unless you like the kind of hairstyles that are impossible to maintain and that you only see on a runway model, do not buy this book.  The majority of the styles are odd and not for every day life.  If you are the kind of woman who doesn't believe in spending more than 25 minutes on your hair, Do Not buy this book.  These styles take at least an hour to complete and are very hard to do at all.

There is one good thing about this book.  It does give good advise on coloring and conditioning.  So, if that is what you are looking for, do buy it.

This book led me to believe I was purchasing a hairstyle book.  In reality it is only good for hair treatment, because of the unrealistic quality of the styles that they offer
