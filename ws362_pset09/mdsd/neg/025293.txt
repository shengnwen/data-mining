There's no real prediction system here.  This book uses technical analysis to try to determine when to short stocks.  However, if you look closely you'll see that the analysis was done selectively, after the fact.  Also, there are no charts where something unexpected happened - and no stock prediction system I'm aware of is 100% accurate.  So this book doesn't have much credibility to me.  

Except for the note on moving averages below, it's worthless.

Let me give you some examples picked by opening the book to hte middle:  
Page 83 - says the first break of the neckline is a fakeout - do not short.  That's only obvious AFTER the fact.

Page 88 - read from left to right.  You'll see that an actual, more distinct head and shoulders formation started two peaks to the left.

Page 91, after continually discussing head and shoulders formations, neglects it here, but it's there starting in March.  There's no reason for not using it in this chart, except it wouldn't have worked.

There's more, of course.

For the most part, the recommendation is to sell short when the stock falls through its 50 day moving average on higher than normal volume.  The problem is, half the time when this happens, the volume spike happens the same time the stock makes a huge drop.  So it doesn't necessarily give you a chance to short at the top.  However, despite this drawback, it does seem to hold true a lot, which is why this book gets 2 stars instead of one.

Use your own intelligence.  Look at the charts, reading from left to right, and imagine trying to follow his charting techniques as the charts unfolded.  It will soon be obvious how often the charting was done AFTER the fact.
