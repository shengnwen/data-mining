Having left my studies of analytical philosophy many years ago - a fervent Wittgensteinian and ardent admirer of J.L. Austin - I had been looking for a way to learn what has happened since I left. It's the kind information that doesn't get into the newspapers and magazines. Soames' book fills the bill nicely, tracing the large patterns of development and at the same time working through key arguments and controversies in some decent detail. It's no replacement for a series of courses and careful reading of original texts, of course, but neither is it glib or patchy. It serves an important purpose to provide perspective on a subject that has developed to a great degree within academic journals. I haven't yet discussed it with Eccles, Bluebottle or Major Bloodnok.
