My husband and I did not bother finishing this book. We skipped around to different chapters, as the editors suggest, in hopes of finding something erotic. The editors clearly had lofty aspirations for this book, but their  intentions fell short of what they managed to achieve. Unfortunately, most  of the stories were poorly written and laughably ridiculous; a bad  combination. You can get mediocre erotica on the 'net for free. Don't waste  your money
