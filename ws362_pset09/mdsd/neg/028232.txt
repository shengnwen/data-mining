When I started reading this book, I was excited.  After all his first book was a laugh-a-minute.  The reviews of this book were upbeat and funny, however, I didn't think it was at all.  The plot jumped around a bit, and the whole animal rights point of view was pushed a little to far.  I don't disagree with the notion, but I fell it killed the story.  And the ending wasn't that great either.  It felt like at about 80% through the book, the ending happened, and then the last 20% was either to bring the word count up, or just to give a 'readers digest' version of the rest of the main characters lives
