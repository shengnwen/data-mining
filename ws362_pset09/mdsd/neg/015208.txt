I bought this book and was looking for some insight of what one can do to help with my dog's behavior due to trauma from her past owner and dog walking issues and social issues. This book was so boring to begin with.  The Other End of the Leash, this book didn't even go into any training techniques, Patricia Connell just was so into her own dogs, that I felt like I was reading a expose' on her dog's lives.  Did I gain any insight on remedies to help me along with my dog I rescued who has trauma and is an alpha female dog and can't walk on a leash or socialize with other dogs/people.  No, I ended up giving the book away before even finishing the last chapter.  Enough of Ms. McConnell's writings, my time was wasted and I could not use any of what I read in her book to my situation.  
I would not recommend this book for anyone's reading if it is to solve your dog's issues.
