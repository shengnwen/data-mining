After reading this book's description I really looked forward to sitting down with it . . . and was terribly disappointed when I did. Unfortunately this tale runs out of gas in less than 100 pages, which is doubly unfortunate as the book goes for over 200 pages. There really isn't much of a mystery, the plot is contrived and simple, the characters are wooden and one dimensional and the flavor of Ireland advertised on the cover is no more than a few scenes in a few pubs. To me this read more like a made for TV movie script, (How to Write a Mystery in 3 East Steps), rather than a novel. This one didn't work for me.
