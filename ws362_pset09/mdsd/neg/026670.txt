As a youngster I read this book so often the school librarian would chuckle each time I checked it out.  Then, for years, I completely forgot about it.  During that time I lived and worked in the Orinoco and Amazon Basin as a field biologist.  When I re-discovered this title I had been working in Amazonian Peru for over a decade.  Happy to find the book, I purchased a copy and read it again.  Only this time I found myself laughing out loud.  Clark did in fact get around while he was in Peru, but he clearly had little understanding of either Spanish or Quechua, and he had a vivid imagination.  His facts are such an unreliable mishmash that I could tell immediately where he spent the majority of his time down there: in the bar of the hotel.  Perhaps the most telling thing is that, with experience in the region, one can discern the kernel of truth at the heart of each of Clark's fabrications.  It is far more instructive to read the journals of great scientist-explorers like Alfred Russel Wallace, Richard Spruce, or Bates...all of whom traversed the Amazon under much more grueling conditions.  Their accounts reveal all the wonders and hardships of the area but with none of the silly exaggerations
