This book had lots of potential.  Unfortunately the author could not get past his training to use language and an approach which is more accessible and more concise.

Example:  "It may be significant that Geb and Nut are separated by Shu, for X and Y ultimately separate into a discrepant state because of the deviation-amplifying tendency of the 'Shu-Tefnut' reaction loop.

The author is attempting to correlate recent findings in physics with classical mystical systems from Egypt, and with Astrology, and the Tarot.  But the writing style is methodical and cold and unnecessarily wordy and redundant.  It is encouraging that science is attempting to make connections back to reality expressed in mythology.  However science is lost in that it continues to attempt to make the reconnection using on the brain and missing the activity of the heart and body.

What is largely unforgivable is that the author is stumbling around  primary concepts of his thesis without clearly stating it.  The largest blarring omission is an emphasis on archetypes.  There are indeed archetypal connections between physics and myth but the author has failed to inspire insights and remains brain-bound to his training and equations.

If you are looking for deeper insights between science and Egypt then 'Serpent in the Sky' by John Anthony West remains one of the best books on the subject.  'Temple of the Cosmos' by Jeremy Naydler is also a good book on Egyptian mythology.
