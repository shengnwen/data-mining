You know, I've been an environmentalist all my life and I never understood the purpose of some of these special interests.  This book is nothing more than election-year rhetoric.  Why not write a book about how Americans in general can be better environmentalists themselves rather than pick on politicians?   Wouldn't that be more constructive? This is just one-sided political nonsense.  I didn't see anything of value - no good debate.  Rise above politics
