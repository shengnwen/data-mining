It's good to know how an editor think about the scientific writing, but practically the book is not helpful if you want to learn writing rather than editing. The author has never written scientific papers by himself. He has no idea how to orgnize the data and make a convincing story. 

I have read many beautiful scientific papers in prestigeous journals. How come those authors have not written a book??

Also Day's book is too old. Now day nobody would like to draw graphs if there is software available.
