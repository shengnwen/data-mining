This book is a revision of a German edition first published in 1971. If that were not enough to put the book out-of-date, the author's writing style certainly would. Her prose is "romantic"  English:  "She offers him [a man who changes her flat] 'tyre' an embroidered handkerchief, which he politely refuses. He makes no reply and, as she gets back into the car, gallantly shuts the door for her." (p. 4). To the extent that the author received death threats, one may have come from a paperback writer whose books sell best in drugstores.
