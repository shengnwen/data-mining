I was really looking forward to this one.  Man, was I disappointed.

I like psionics in the DnD game.  I enjoyed the PH, and really enjoyed the XPH.  This, however, was a waste of money and I'm really glad I got it on sale.  

Feats:  Most of the feats were class and/or race specific.  I'm not sure what the problem was here, tbh.  It seemed to me that the CP was an attempt to get folks to actually play some of those races?  Really, it's the only explanation I could think of.  Otherwise, why wasn't this material contained in the XPH?

Classes/PrCs:  *sigh*  I was unimpressed.  Nothing that screamed "play me".  The Ardent and Divine Minds are just psionic clerics, and the Lurker is just a psionic rogue.  Wow.  The PrC were even worse, IMO.  Nothing that justified the price of the book, really.  Most of them were utterly unmemorable and really boring.  And I'm a PrC freak; I love the concept.

Powers:    Again, nothing that really did anything for me.  It seemed to be extremes; the powers seem really broken.

The rest of the book was just unmemorable.  I've used that word a lot, and it's a theme for this book.  "Unmemorable" is the best word I can think of for the Complete Psionic.

I thought the Complete Arcane, Warrior, Divine, and Adventurer were all good books.  They all had their problems, to be sure, but they have really added to my groups roleplaying experience.  We've added a Scout (Adventurer), a Dervish PrC (Warrior), Divine Contemplative PrC (Divine), and a boatload of feats have been excellent additions to the game.  But myselof and my DM are both huge psionic fans, and most of the material contained in the Complete Psionic will never see the light of day in our game.  

There are better ways to get folks to play psionic characters than releasing a bad book
