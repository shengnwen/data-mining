I read this book and tried the diet for three weeks. Although I didn't feel hungry and thought the shakes were okay, I found myself suffering from headaches and just not feeling very well in general. If you're looking for a crash diet, this might work, but I don't think it is a very healthy overall eating strategy for the long term. It does, however, force you to get more than enough fruits in your diet, which I enjoyed. Another thing: you need a good blender and enough time to clean it out a couple of times a day. Sounds silly, but it was expensive and time consuming for me
