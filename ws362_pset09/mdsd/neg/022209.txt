I read this after enjoying Iles' "Footprints of God" quite a bit.  This is his first work and thank goodness he has since learned to be more concise.  The book is lengthy, and repeats itself quite a bit (due, I assume to the length and complexity of the plot and characters).  Several characters could've been cut out entirely - they were in long enough to kill and be killed, but didn't add anything to the story.  Intriguing characters, too - he could've saved them for their own stories.

After wanting to get to the end for the last 200 pages, I found the ending itself rushed.  All loose ends were wrapped up very conveniently and in ways that didn't pay off for the investment of time required to get that far.

There were some aggravating teases, too.  When the Israeli finally gets to confront the Nazi for the question of "why?" (regarding the anti-semitism), I was really hoping that Iles would've ventured a reply - anything to try and give the Nazi character some depth or plausibility other than just pure hate for the sake of hate.  Nope - he put the question out there and didn't try to answer it.  That's what I was hoping for - replace some of the graphic violence with real explorations of the underlying themes and how this fanaticism really survives - not just giving example after example of how it's manifested.

All that being said, the last page of the epilogue is brilliant, and in it, I found a simple yet profound statement that struck a chord.
