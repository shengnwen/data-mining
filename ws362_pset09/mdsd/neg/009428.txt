 This book was entirely disappointing for me. I read it in hopes of finding a better understanding and instead found 2 people who sound very bitter and are trying to sell a book through humor and not real facts. Some of their advice include using sex as the "ultimate bargaining too" and ways to "realisticaly rate yourself in a scale of 1-10" and stay in your own playing field(like don't aim for a 8 if you're really only a 5). Scary stuff. This book really depressed me until my (Married) friends pointed out how utterly ridiculous it was. If you are single and searching, stay away from this book
