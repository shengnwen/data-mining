Like I've said I really like Chicken Soup Books.I love the storys.So when this book came out I could'nt wait to read it.
Yet this book was a real dissapiontment.Their were'nt enough stories.There was to much commentary by the author,little tidbits and addons.The only story I can say I liked was Chain Reaction.It's a story about not judging people to quickly.Other than that nothing esle
