If I could burn this book, I would.  It is that bad.  For an &quot;Introduction&quot; book used in an intro MBA class where most accounting types have already tested out of the class it is overly complex and confusing to the layman.  Wordy beyond belief.  The only redeeming feature is its ability to put you to sleep.  Keep it on the bed stand
