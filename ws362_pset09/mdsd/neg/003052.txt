Numbers 3 and 4 of this series were updates of specific topics, much like the &quot;current veterinary therapy&quot; series.  This, like Editions 1 and 2, attempts to cover all of zoo medicine in one volume.  As this is a rapidly expanding body of knowledge, it is no longer really possible to fit into a single volume.  There are very brief overviews of each species without enough depth present- this is not due to the authors, but the format.  Especially disappointing is the apparent limitation on the number of references for each section.  Providing references on where to look for further information would have made this book much more useful.  Hopefully future editions will either show a return to the topic oriented format of 3 and 4, be a multi-volume set containing enough information to be useful, or at least contain sufficient references to be useful as a good bibliography
