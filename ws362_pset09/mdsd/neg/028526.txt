The diagrams in the book where nice, but man this guy isn't an author. You can tell he knows what he is talking about but he just uses a lot of lingo. Thankfully, there is a glossary, but it takes too long to look up every word. He just tells you the different parts in mechanisms. He doesn't really explain how anything works. By the way, he has like 5 nicknames for every part. If you are a beginner too complex, if your an expert you probably know this stuff. If you have the money and your an amateur go ahead. If none of the above I wouldn't suggest this book
