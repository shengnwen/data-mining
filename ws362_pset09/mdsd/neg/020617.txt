As a resident, This book clearly gives a wrong account of the lifes/thoughts of most residents/intrens.Very little of the screaming sexuality/irreverence is true especially in this day and age.Patients health are not taken this lightly and profesionalism is key and indeed emphasized.We now know why there was so many successful lawsuits in the 70's and 80's.
However I am not surprised knowing the Author is a Psychiatrist and not in the aspect of medicine most people will ever get to see/experience.
Psychiatrists tend to think a little bit off the curve.
VERY FEW OF THE STORIES, SCENARIOS AND STATEMENTS AS TRUE OR EVEN POSSIBLE IN THIS DAY AND AGE.
RECOMMENDATION: Not recommended reading.
