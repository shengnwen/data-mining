I saw this book while browsing Amazon. I'm a big fan of autumn craft and holiday books, so I ordered a copy used. First, be warned this is one of those SMALL books (perhaps 6.5 inches) with LARGE text, there is a craft per page with a photo of a suggestion on how the craft should look. The instructions are general and not detailed and contain no patterns. The photos are mostly cute, but the crafts really are only so-so. The tail end of the book contains a few recipes written in paragraph form. The recipes are simple and unchallenging. Overall verdict? 2. stars. I doubt I will make anything from the book, and anticipate donating it to the library in the near future. Disappointing.
