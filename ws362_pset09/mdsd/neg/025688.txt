This book has nothing to do with demonic possession. This is a book about a woman suffering from a personality disorder. It leads the reader on a detailed, longwinded, rambling journey of the woman's self-discovery on the root source of her disorder with the help of a psychologist.    

This book is more aptly titled: "cholecimla: a study of multiple personality disorder." 

Numerous typo errors were encountered in this book.
