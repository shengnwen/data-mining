I purchased this book because I'm a big fan of near future science fiction stories and this book does not disappoint on the technology front.  It is certainly a realistic extrapolation of current technology twenty years into the future but the story is, well, downright boring.

The main plot character is Robert Gu, a recovering Alzheimer's patient thanks to 21st century medical technology.  Even after recovery though, you still have to be re-trained to fit into the modern world and so Robert has to attend the local High School with his granddaughter Miri.  The fact that the study topics at the school make almost no sense is a nice touch because current educational standards seem to be heading that way today.

Robert somehow gets involved at the periphery of a barely comprehensible conspiracy involving the great powers centred on the University of California at San Diego but the vast majority of the book is just about how he learns to interact with the real world using the wearable computer technology available then.  None of the characters are particularly interesting either.

The whole thing is very slow moving, never gripping and I could never get terribly interested in the story.  It was difficult to finish and quite disappointing overall.  Vernor Vinge can do much better than this and it's to be hoped that future books of his set in the near future are more interesting
