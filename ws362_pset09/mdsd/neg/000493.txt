it is confounding and remarkable that an esteemed (at least by the aw shucks public) institution like harvard could have dershowitz and cornel west as their poster boys. i must agree with president summers; calling west's academic 'output' lacking is an understatement. but then again this is harvard, a shadow of its former self with its self-imposed hiring and admission quotas (or as harvard calls them 'goals').  yes harvard dumped 50 million dollars down the drain after the summers-west flap, which is absolutely ludicrous.  who really thinks a racist, unfair system of affirmative action is really the right course for any hiring or admission purposes?  it fosters only a 'good as i/we can be' mentality, which is more dangerous in the long run to those who benefit from it than it does those who are penalized by it.  merit and achievement should be the only factors for jobs and admissions.
