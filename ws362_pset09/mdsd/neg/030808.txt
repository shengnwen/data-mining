I thought this book would be an all-in-one lighting wonder book. I mean, it covers hotlights, flashes, strobes, shooting on location, shooting in a studio, and more! But I was sorely disappointed.

While it does discuss a lot of different equipment and techniques, it isn't really very helpful. Why?

* Structure: It doesn't follow a logical sequence, which means you can be jumping around a lot to find 'related' information. This, in turn, means you haven't learnt much because it's too hard to 'file' what you're reading mentally.

* Equipment vs. technique: These two things are mixed in together when they really ought to be separate. I mean, the lighting setups you use when using hotlights are roughly the same as when using strobes. The way you handle the equipment is different, but the same principles apply. So why go into the details of setting up a portrait when discussing the different equipment types?

* No diagrams: How hard can it be to draw a lighting diagram for each shot? There is not one diagram for any photo in the book (though Susan McCartney does start by saying how important diagrams are!!), which makes it hard to visualise the setups.

* No colour: Probably to save money, the only colour photograph in the book is on the cover. Fair enough, but a little effort could have been put into making the black and whites a little less 'flat'.

* Digital falsehoods: Though McCartney apparently shoots digital occasionally, she really doesn't get it, and this comes up in some obviously wrong statements throughout the book, like this one:
"Do be aware that each time you play back a digital image in the camera, it may degrade the final result..." Since when have digital images degraded when previewed on the camera? Statements like this really don't help her professional credibility.

To summarise, while the book does cover a lot of ground and contains some useful information for beginners, you will need to read something more thorough before you actually start shooting with serious lighting gear. It doesn't even tell you how to control lighting ratios
