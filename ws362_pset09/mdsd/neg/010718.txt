A real eye-opener: with all sincerity, I cannot believe Simon and Schuster has published this under the aegis of "Simon and Schuster Children Publishing." The language is execrable, the text jammed with f--- and sh-- and d---. In the early pages the seventeen-year-old protagonist walks in on her boyfriend's amorous dealings with the girl's own mother. And after she hooks up with street youth we are treated to a thorough detailing of  the materials and the methods of intravenous drug use (only this girl isn't really sure exactly what she's cheerily pumping into her veins), dumpster diving, vandalism, breaking and entering, theft, the tale of a man trying to blind a boy by crushing his eyeball with his thumb, scavenging leftovers from deserted restaurant tables and other like diversions.
According to the publisher's website, Ms. Black is a favorite among kids. What I hate most is that these demeaning elements in the story are gratuitous: without them, the book might just be a worthwhile read because of its ingenious world of trolls, tree women, and "faeries." I can see how teenagers would agree that the "world would be cooler with something so unreal in it." As it is, I cannot imagine recommending it to a teen--or anyone else-- to read
