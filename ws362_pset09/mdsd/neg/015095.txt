This book should have been titled, &quot;Tokyo for Kids&quot;.  I was extremely excited to get this book but my excitement faded to disappointment when I opened it's cover to only find mostly things that realated to the Tokyo area.  I am currently living in Japan with my husband and daughter and was hoping for more of an insiders view of things to do in Japan.  However, I live quite a distance from the Tokyo area and had hoped to find out about things more locally, or even within a more resonable distance then Tokyo.  It would have been nice to see more comprensive coverage of Japan.  Not everyone who lives here, flocks to the Tokyo area.  Although I do plan to visit there at least once while living here, it is not close enough to be the focus of weekend or even monthly outings. There were a few other areas mentioned, but it seemed to me that the authors of this book did not take enough time to throughly reasearch all areas of Japan. There is some useful information in here as far as contacts and ordering, but if you live anywhere outside Tokyo, I can not reccomend this book to you. It is a well written and informative book for what it is, but it should not have been titled, &quot;Japan for Kids&quot;, nor claimed to be the ultimate guide..
