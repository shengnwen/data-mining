The main benefit of working through this meandering novel, as I now look back on it, was to gain a glimpse of pre-revolutionary America.  What attracted me to the book was the author's credentials as an historian.  If  the story's tensions, moods, and conlicts are historically accurate than  the perspective it generates is intriguing.  The search for a national and  cultural identity among the changing political landscapes must have been  most demanding upon the citizens of the colonies.  The author describes how  the various influences of the Dutch, British, French, African, and native  American Indians converged in a cultural boiling pot. The plot and  characters were tolerable.  Although, there were times when I thought of  putting the book aside to find a more rewarding read.  Yet, the sense that  finally emerged for me was one of appreciation for the gradual and  difficult movement it must have been for the colonists to make from a  European to an American conception of themselves. The book raised a  question- &quot;How did a new sense of an American identity develop for a  people governed by Britian?&quot;- and sought to provide a plausible  answer.  I would have enjoyed more historical identification of the events  depicted either as footnotes or end notes.  Yet, the author provided  helpful definitions of terms as footnotes
