Clearly pretentious (read the introduction and you'll discover that the author writes that the "academy members are primarily craftspeople who don't possess the critical faculties and scholarly approach of cinephiles ..." hummmm), this guy -who pretends to be a cinephile- has preferred to write here a total personal statement, mainly leftist (but sometimes you wonder...), and clearly mean, against the Oscar ceremony,and the people who vote for them and, those who receive the little golden boy(see in example how he prefers to quote only the bad reviews and not one good concerning Braveheart, which made, by the way, a confortable $210,409,945) rather than giving the reader an objective work, written with distance and elegance. Maybe he has never been able to enter the industry he seems to hate so much, and instead of getting an Oscar, prefers to spend time criticizing it with his typing machine, forgetting how much it's easier than... winning an Oscar or doing a movie.
