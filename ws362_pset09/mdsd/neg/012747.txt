I admit, the claims that this book was the actual (and unacknowledged) basis for Rent may have colored my perceptions; the book certainly suffered by the comparison.  Taken on its own merits it's an acceptable novel.  However, it is nothing at all like Rent.

I only purchased this after reading all the Amazon reviews of the Rent book.  Every negative review mentioned this novel. Strangely, all of the reviews were anonymous, or from "readers" who had reviewed nothing else, which does not lend them much credibility.  This always makes me picture one angry author, or one desperate fan, entering review after review.

People in Trouble is the story of a married couple, Peter and Kate, and Kate's affair with a woman named Molly.  The background is the birth of AIDS activism in NYC, and Peter and Kate's successful careers in the arts.  It takes place in the summer.

Rent is the story of a group of friends who are kicked out of their homes by a former roommate, who has since become wealthy.  In the background is the struggle to live with HIV, homelessness, and questioning the validity of bohemianism.  It takes place at Christmas.

There are some similarities:  both have riots and tent cities.  Both make passing mention of people wearing watches with alarms to remind them to take their AZT.  Both have "Robin Hood" subplots- in Rent the ATM is reprogrammed to furnish a "stipend" to anyone who puts in the right code.  In People in Trouble, activists steal credit card numbers from restaurant carbons and from eavesdropping at pay phones, which they then use to help those in need.  There the similarities end.

The mood of Rent is upbeat and hopeful.  The characters are warm, humorous and vaguely mocking, and the music unsurpassed. 
The characters of People in Trouble are self involved, pretentious and moody, and the overall tone, while not ironic enough to be called "dark" is certainly gray.
