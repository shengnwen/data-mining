When I started to read this book, I thought to myself that it would be a good book. 5 Hours later, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to dump the book. The plot is horrible and there are a number of errors in the science. First, the first three dimensions define matter. The fouth one defines TIME! Second: 1 Billion Years from now, Humankind would have settled atleast a 1,000 star stystems and achived travel from Galaxy to Galaxy. Third, how would a lifeform like the Malign survive in space? It needs oxygen or some kind of Gas to survive (Newton - Energy cannot be destroyed, only simply converted). By the way, ANYTHING bigger then a stellar mass (size of our sun), would collapse and Nuclear Fusion would occur. This does not fit with the fact that some creatures out there that are as big as solar systems... 

   Although the author got the some science right, Humankind would NEVER create different species of itself and then destroy/extinctize (New Word I created there) the previous type of species. Its just tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo   idiotic. So do youself a favor, get another book to read.
