This is probalby one of the worst text book I have ever read. The concepts are extremely difficult to follow most of time there are no consistancy between the concept introduced in the chapter and the the problems presented to you. As one of my friend said: it won't make any difference if they just give us a book full with problems and not teaching us hard to do it. THAT is how bad this book is. Or another suggestion will be buy the book and MAKE SURE you buy the solution manual. Don't worry about reading the book since it won't help you at all, just do the problems with the solution manual and you'll be fine for the semester. At the end of the semester if you are rich enough....bring the book and burn it during one of your camping trip. In case anybody is thinking that I probably failed the class so i hate this book so much, Im actually getting an A and I never read a single page out of this book....again what a useless book
