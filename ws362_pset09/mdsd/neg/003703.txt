This was my first -- and last -- Cat Who book.  I bought it because I needed something to read at the beach, but found it so inane that I went for another swim instead.  Having spent money on the book, I felt obligated to eventually finish it.  I kept wondering when I would discover the plot, but alas, the book ended without one.  I had hoped to read a mystery story, but the only mystery -- the body found on Qwilleran's property -- was never developed.  Another reviewer called this book a pastiche -- a quite appropriate word.  
Want to write a book like this?  Here's how...  Take a small town newspaper, cut out stories at random, then stick them together.  Throw in a rather silly single male journalist who spends his days wandering in and out of other people's lives, writing corny sayings and then attributing them to his cat (I thought Koko was supposed to be smart!), eating in restaurants, and traveling between his various properties
