I bought the book because the reviews were good.  When I received the book and started to read, I realized I've been duped!  It's another one of those trading books with some trade examples and analyses by Elder on those trades.  Everything looks perfect after the fact. 

I personally didn't get much from reading it so I returned it for refund.  This is the first book I returned a book to Amazon.  At least I now know how to return a book back to Amazon.  They paid for the return shipping
