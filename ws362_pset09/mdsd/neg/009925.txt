Some 34 years after the publication of the Clement letter and the gospel fragments it preserves and 16 years after Smith's death, his work continues to be attacked.

Although The Secret Gospel of Mark Unveiled pretends to eschew "armchair psychoanalysis dressed up as objective scholarship," the book fairly oozes it. Smith's recollection of his discovery is described with terms like "extreme mood swings and bouts of amnesia" and "dissociative episodes." In fact, the book is largely a bashing of Smith, not a discussion of the text he discovered. 

Smith, like most homosexuals of his generation, was conflicted. So what? The evidence that must be addressed is not Smith's sexual orientation, but the text of the New Testament. A particular flaw of Jeffrey's argument is that Jesus, a rural Palestinian Jew, must have known of the classical Greek "model" of pederasty. From this unsupportable assumption flows an entire line of specious reasoning.

Those interested in the "Secret Gospel" will find little to detain them here. The author knows of, but largely ignores, the work of Meyer and Brown on this subject, and passes over the work of Crossan, Koester and Dart. Writers who have expressed negative opinions of Smith and his work are briefly cited, but their conclusions never examined in any depth. This book is as riddled with special pleading and omission as Swiss cheese is with holes. Let the buyer beware.
