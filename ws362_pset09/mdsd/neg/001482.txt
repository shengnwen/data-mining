Schiff and Ya'ari are two "house broken" Israeli journalists, i.e. they are partisan supporters of the Labor Party and the Left.  This must be kept in mind when reading this book.  While they clearly show the reckless policies Sharon carried out, much of their ire towards him is political.  For example, while they decry Sharon's alliance with the Gemayal's Falangist Party, correctly pointing out its Fascist tendencies and pontificate about Sharon sullying's Israel's reputation by making an alliance with what is essentially a corrupt, mafia-like organization, suddenly,  10 years later, when Peres and Rabin (whose Labor Party they support) made the Oslo
agreements with the even more murderous and corrupt Arafat and the so-called "Palestine Liberation Organization", Shiff and Ya'ari were praising the "pragmatism" of Peres and Rabin saying "you can't choose your peace partners".  Thus, we see that their primary agenda is political and not "truth seeking". (Incidentally when Arafat started his war with Israel in September 2000 Ya'ari went on television and said "I always knew the Oslo agreeements were a mistake").  Similarly, they (correctly) denounce Sharon's underhanded activities during the war, keeping the government in the dark about his activities, but then in 2004 when Sharon used undemocratic, dishonest procedures to betray his promises about not destroying the Jewish communities in the Gaza district, they suddenly claim he is a great, far-sighted leader.
