What moment of quiet desperation leads authors to turn to the Historical Novel? True, you'd never confuse Amis for say, Will Self, he of the Great Apes, How the Dead Live, The Book of Dave. Still, I enjoyed his irreverent, blithely entertaining works such as Money, London Fields, Yellow Dog. And so, unthinkingly - he was one of my authors - without even scanning the dust jacket, I picked up a copy of House of Meetings. What a mistake.

Turow had his Ordinary Heroes, Mailer his Castle in the Forest. Stephenson produced an entire trilogy of unreadable boat anchors in his Baroque Cycle. Does this urge to emulate Michener naturally arise later in life or is it simply the loss of fresh ideas and a desire to trade on one's name to fatten the bank account?

AWOL is that dry, uniquely British perspective... I don't think there's a single mention of a 'wanker' in the entire volume. Just recycled, derivative gulag drivel. Better to get the story straight from the Russian horse's mouth. Fortunately, half-way through this soporific tale I procured a copy of Dorsey's Hurricane Punch and was able to take a break from the tedium.

Are we ever going to put WW2 and the Cold War behind us? Isn't there a novelistic statute of limitations? Since we apparently are too dumb to avoid history, we're doomed to read about it. Endlessly.

Oh well. Only 3 months until the new Murakami
