Yisrayl Hawkins is the leader of a cult based out of Abilene, Texas called The House of Yahweh. While "he" (meaning all of his wives and people he has hired) has done very good studying, I would recommend this book only to people that are part of this religion. It is full of things that are otherwise hard to swallow unless you are a member and have it explained (brainwashed) to you. Yisrayl Hawkins makes many attempts to show that his religion is the only true religion and everyone else is wrong. He makes many references and cites names that are actually fictional characters from television shows. If you'd like a good laugh buy this book and check up on what he's saying in the book. Google the names that he cites in the book. The book is also poorly written and very very redundant! I was very annoyed after having gotten a particular point and he decided to repeat the same thing for the next 50 pages. This book is only recommended if you're looking for a laugh, or if you study world religions (even though this one is merely a blip on the map)
