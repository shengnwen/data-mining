I heard this author on a financial radio talk show (Bob Brinker) and the few things he had to say were interesting, to the point and powerful enough to make me buy the book. Should have quit with the talk show.  If this guy is still building a new and successful business with flyers and Magic Marker posters he should read a little Ries & Trout or Seth Goodin (Purple Cow).  We ARE in the 21st Century.  We have the internet along with carefully focused radio and myriad other ways to reach people and mold thinking.  There was nothing in the book that was not merely a stone cold rehash of old, old thinking.  I was very disapointed.  B. McDonal
