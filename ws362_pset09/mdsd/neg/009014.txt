Picking up the autobiography of legendary baseball announcer Jack Buck, you'd think you're in for a light summer read full of good-natured homilies, humorous anecdotes, and "I was there" accounts of great games and players.  That doesn't set the bar very high but would make for a good baseball book.  "That's A Winner" doesn't deliver on even these modest expectations.  First, Buck himself doesn't come across as a very likeable guy.  Free with his back-handed criticisms, judgmental of others, once slamming the door in the face of a desperate pregnant woman, and generally keeping his head down as the inveterate corporate guy trying to keep his job.  Second, he doesn't really have much to offer.  Less than half the book is about baseball, so the reader has to wade through chapters on Buck's youth aboard a boat, in World War II, going to school, reciting names of family and friends as though reading a phone book.  There are futile discussions of Castro and the death penalty and Vietnam, issues to which Buck brings no insight and that merely serve to distract the reader looking for some sports.  Third, when the baseball finally comes, it's feeble and fleeting.  A few thoughts on drugs use in the late 1970s, praise for Whitey Herzog and Ozzie Smith, and that's about it.  For a guy who's been around some of the greatest players in the history of the game and become famous for his steady deep-voiced announcing, Buck has written a book that manages to suck the life out of the games and players.  No stories, no funny anecdotes, nothing to interest a fan.  If you're researching Buck's life and need to know about his military service, this is the book for you.  If you want to pass a weekend with a good baseball book, pick up Roger Angell instead
