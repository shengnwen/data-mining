As someone who has been a Paulo Coelho fan, this book is a disappointment. If you do like Paulo's books, please avoid this particular one. 

Once you read the book, you get the feeling that the story is quite pointless. Yeah, sure it illuminates the life of a prostitute and circumstances surrounding the same (with some restraint I might add) but fails to deliver any insight into life or its meaning. 

Paulo's strength - his ability to take the 'helicopter' view into all things in life is tested and does not stand up. While he does make an effort to look for "sacred sex" and introduces S&M, it is quite apparent that he is not convinced himself. 

In a sense, you are left with the sensation of seeing a very expensive car grind to a halt at a cheap motel where the protagonists step out for their eleven minutes.

Avoid this novel - it is a series of disconnected events which don't really mean much
