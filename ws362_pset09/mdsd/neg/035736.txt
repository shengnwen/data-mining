The encyclopedia is poorly organized, and too many outdated sources for many entries.  Extremely bad for Art Historians!  If you want a particular site, one must search for it under its location.  Not theme or era. There even isn't an entry for the Romanesque era!!  And there isn't any for San Isidoro de León - Panteon de los Reyes.  While the writer of &quot;Historia Silense&quot; might have known King Ferdinand; the writer wasn't a monk at Sahagun!!  He was either at Silos or at Leon.  Once again Routledge has proven itself unable in doing a great encyclopedia of the era
