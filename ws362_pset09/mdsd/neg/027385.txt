While this can be helpful for the average person looking to improve their health a little by eating healthier, it isn't a great book for those looking to get more serious about their health and for more details about coverting to a raw diet. It's not a bad book, but there is a lot of information missing and it seems to encourage you to still eat a lot of unhealthy foods. The recipes are okay, not great and not all raw. There is some useful information, but might be confusing to most. There are better books out there regarding the raw diet.
