The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out
