I admit that I'm addicted - despite the s.l.o.w. progress, constant female bickering, and frequent fashion details.  I want to see how this dang series ends...will it?  

This particular installment of the Dragon et. al. left me feeling underwhelmed.  The ending was a disappointment, but I'll press on and order book 8.
