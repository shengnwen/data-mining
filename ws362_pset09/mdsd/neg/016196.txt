This book has an interesting take on how the mind interprets the slightest events between two people such as body language, facial expression and more. The facts laid out are informative. The prose though has much to be desired. Thu author uses "tacit" far too frequently, and clutters his points with obscure and infrequently used words. Commas and em-dashes are not in expected places, leaving you to read many sentences over again to get the meaning. I felt I had to stall way too often and not glide smoothly along. Good scientific work, but bad read
