Sonny Barger's tales are Slurs of Confabulations, False Recollections, Fuzzy Logics, basics of "FMS" (False Memory Syndrome). Sonny Barger demonstrates a "Limitless Capacity for Denail" therefore Distorting His Own Statements from Yesteryear. Mr. Barger was evidently under the impression, by placing his name upon a book that the reading public would be sensationalized into the Illusion Barger's some sort of an American Hero, Hardly. Mr. Barger speaks of Brotherhood & Freedom; Never Defining either. (Brotherhood was betrayal of silence after the RICO Trial. Freedom was before Barger's First Conviction, since he has never known real freedom.) All too-much in Barger's Book can be refuted by its mere statements. This book was obviously just put together for money and cover-ups. Publisher should have included an airsickness bag with each book. 10% of a book that covers over 40-years of Hells Angels History was spent taking cheap shots at the Government, over the RICO Trail 1979/1980. This was a Gamble by the Publisher, too-many have known otherwise. Publisher changing the title would help. (Hell's Angel: The Lies and Crimes of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club)
