I think that this book carried on longer than it should. A good chuknk could've been cut out of this, and one sex scene was a little over the top and completely unrealistic. A lot of the scenes in this book seem to drag pointlessly on and on and on, like the descriptions for example. It would go from someone's hair, to their eyes, how the color of their eyes or hair contrasted with other colors. The it would go to another person's eyes and hair and how those contrasted with other colors. This book started off really well with the press conference, and finding out about the murders...but then the murders kinda get dropped for the rest of the book until the last chapter they get brought up again. I seriously think this book could've been written better. I almost considered not finishing it because the chapters carried on way too long. I did like, however how the different little things ths sithen did for Meredith helped with the story later as the book drug on and on
