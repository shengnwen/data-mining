I believe you are referring to Deu 18:10 - 12.  I make more typos than most..lol.  Anyway, this chapter is addressing the Levites (Tribe of Levi) only.  We should not pick and choose phrases and use them out of context.  

Also, if you really want to understand the "Old Testament", read some good research books from the Jewish Publication Society or the Jewish Lights Publishers.

Her books are good, not great.  Nothing new inside but it is a good way to bring Gnosticism and Spiritism to lay people.  Allan Kardec stated most of what is contained in her books in his works.  

This particular little book is good mainly for the CDRom
