Telling me how to find ghost, nothing in this book was any different then what you could see in a horror movie. There was nothing backing up anything, its like taking advise from a blind man on driving. Can you at least try to prove something, this isn't the bible, we don't have to believe just because. Facts! Facts! Let see some real science on this subject. Not just speculation
