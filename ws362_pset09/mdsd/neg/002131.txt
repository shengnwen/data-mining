I debated whether or not I should write a review.  After all, I only read the first 70 pages or so, after which I decided to stop slogging through this tedious novel.  However, since I assume most people who would buy and read this book are doing it for their own enjoyment, I felt complelled to chime in, although I'm clearly in the minority.  However, I must add in my defense that this book was initially criticized by his contemporaries as a short story that just kept rambling on with no apparent purpose, a criticism I find valid.

The premise sounds fascinating - the journey of a young seaman who attempts to reconcile his dishonorable past.  It sounded like it would be an interesting tale about the conflict between heroics and harsh reality.  However, in the delivery of the story, I lost all interest shortly.  The main problem I see is in the vivid descriptions and imagery.  This, or course, is usually a good thing.  However, Conrad seems to go into such great description of every little detail that it distracts from the main story.  It seems that Conrad could have been just as effective by using half of the words.  The non-sequitur narrative also makes it a bit more difficult to follow, although I think this could have been effective if the narrative would have been more concise and to the point.

However, rather than merely blasting away at "Lord Jim," I will at least give one alternative - "Heart of Darkness", also by Joseph Conrad.  Read my take of this in my other reviews.  This is a much more interesting and more enjoyable read than "Lord Jim", and about half its length.  Plus, it offers a more poignant picture of Imperialism and its ideals (or lack thereof).

Perhaps I will give it another go in the future, but until then I would recommend you give "Lord Jim" a pass and spend your money and time on another novel, perhaps "Heart of Darkness.
