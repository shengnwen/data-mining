True that Suzanne White is very concerned with bragging about who she  knows and generally talking about herself.  Very egocentric.  As for the  astrology it may not be the most accurate scientifically but as far as  entertaining, I found it so.  Suzanne's greatest strength may be her  intuition about the people in her surroundings.  I believe the book is not  geared to accuracy but more for entertainment and it should be taken as  such
