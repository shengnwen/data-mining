There are several problems that I had with this book.  First, it is basically an audio book with charts.  In some ways, it is nice to hear an explanation while seeing it on a chart, but if you are used to learning  from textbooks, then this book/CD is a nightmare.  The written text offers  nothing additional to the audio, and the CD has problems (sometimes it  would lose audio for spans of time, and these gaps were not filled in by  the text).  It is also extremely basic, to the point that all the  information is found easily and presented just as clearly on the internet,  for example on about.com.  Also, due to the audio nature of the book, you  can't really control the pace or skip through basic pages like you can with  a regular book.  The book was OK, considering that it was an overview; but  considering that you can get the same information for free, I would not  bother with it and would just skip to a more comprehensive text, such as  Technical Analysis of Financial Markets by Murphy
