I have Tried studying DSP using this book , and failed. There are not enough examples. all questions seem to have no answers , and when one of my collegues wrote the author about this , he revceived nothing back. The questions assume a prior knowledge , yet , the chapters begin with beginners teaching and immediatly jump to a hight level. NO MOTIVATION for usage with fourier transforms is introduced. The algorythems for all programs are quite amateur. In short. after studying DSP using this book , i hardly know a thing, And had to take a special course at my local working place. I am sorry for the bad review, however , it was written so that the author of this book may improve his future books. thank you
