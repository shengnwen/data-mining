The whole point of buying casebooks like this is to have handy a collection of the most pertinent points of relevant cases presented in an effective manner that makes sense.  That said, Sullivan (who FAILED the CA bar exam) does a horrible job editing, and fails to make a decent casebook.

Many of the cases in this book are either significantly under-edited, leaving you to wallow through the entirety of all or almost all of the opinions, with no focus whatsoever.  

The rest are merely noted in brief paragraphs, oversimplified and summarized beyond recognition, glossing over major Constitutional turning points (especially so in the sections on the incorporation doctrine and reproductive rights).  Sullivan especially oversummarizes and oversimplifies Rehnquist and Scalia's opinions in an unhelpful manner (displaying her extreme left-leaning).

The most telling sign of the poor editing is the very size of the text.  It is massive.  It is no surprise that inside Sullivan utterly fails to make her points succinctly or directly.

Chances are, if you are reading this, you HAVE to buy this book for a class.  Woe be to you.  Settle for a cheaper, used, old edition of this texgt, and go buy yourself a decent outline
