Folks, being Celtic is a matter of genes and heritage.  You cannot become a &quot;Celtic Woman&quot; simply by performing the rites offered in this book.  Sure, there's a paradigm associated with the Celts (which is such a broad term anyway since you're talking about various different peoples), and I suppose anyone could adapt them.  But being Celtic is a question of having Celtic blood, and neither this book nor any other can give you that.  I really feel like this book cheapens my own Celtic heritage at the same time it insults other heritages by somehow implying there's something more to being Celtic.  I would love to see a book extolling a heritage other than Celtic just to run against the pop Celtic interest grain.  Shame
