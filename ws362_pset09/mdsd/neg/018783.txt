The idea of being able to spy on people, and history, via wormholes is an interesting idea. Seeing how people would deal with such an extreme loss of privacy is dealt with somewhat well.

As a whole, however, the book is little more than an interesting idea. The problem is the human element. The authors paid more attention to the way that the technology in the story is portrayed than the characters. As a result, none of the characters really pop out at you or seem very textured.

Also, with the various wormhole excursions into the past, I agree with an earlier reviewer that the authors would've been better off showing us these excursions rather than telling us about them. Those scenes come off with all the charm of a lab report.

If this book were a movie, I would say wait till it's broadcast on network television
