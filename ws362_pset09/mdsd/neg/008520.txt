I just got this edition from Amazon a couple of weeks ago. For starters, I've been looking up favorite movies that I know extremely well. It seems like every 3rd or 4th review in this guide flat-out gives away either the film's ending or a crucial plot twist! Very strange, and completely bogus IMO. It leaves me confused and disgruntled. 

I thought I understood the English national character pretty well, but what's up with these London reviewers? Do their British readers really tolerate, much less appreciate, having the thrill of mystery and discovery just stolen away? 

As we all know, here in the US it's taboo to ruin the narrative surprise in any kind of review, unless one explicitly puts a "warning-- spoilers below!" comment in first. Obviously, I support this taboo, and for whatever reason, the Time Out film guide editors have decided to flout it. Their bizarre lack of sympathy for the reader's feelings is simply inappropriate IMO for a film guide, so I rate this work only 2 stars
