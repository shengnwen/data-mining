Thirrin is a warrior princess. Now we know what will happen next, in any book where there is a warrior princess there is a war, AND the princess is always pretty green., this book is no exception. Her father dies leaves the country in her hands, it attacked, there is fighting, there is a desperate search for allies to aid the small country. The same old "Young Princess has to Fight Enemy" scheme.  Nothing new to rave about, just major flaws, like them hating the werewolves, them the next day loving them, it entirely consisting of renamed history and mythology. Oh yeah, unless you are writing a story that takes place IN Rome or a part of the world that used Latin in history, YOU DON'T USE LATIN. Parts were also dull, predictable, and just plain boring. Only the main characters had real personality, and even that was lacking. Maybe if it was more original, maybe if it was excuted better, maybe if Hill took some sort of writing class. Don't waste your time, read somthing like Prydain or Narnia instead.
