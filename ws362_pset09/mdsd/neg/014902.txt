The cover of mine was decorated with the actress from the movie so I expected it to be the tragic romance with a happy ending on the DVD. Instead I got a description of a couple of college proffessors who cash in their investments to buy a million dollar run down house in Cortona Italy in which they only planned to live in 3 months out of the year. 

It doesn't tell a story so much as it describes one, like an outline with too much external detail. It has no dialouge whatsoever so it's very one dimensional. The only thing I got out of it was a strong desire to go buy a lemon tree and see the landscapes of Italy.
