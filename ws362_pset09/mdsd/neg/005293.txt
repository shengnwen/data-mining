This book had a great idea, that never turned into something wonderful. I think if the author would have left out some of the dukes, earls and other so not important people and let the reader draw on thier own imagination, this book would have been much better. I cuouldn't keep track of who was who and, I really stopped caring. The characters were good, but they left alot lacking. It was something I read and almost had to force myself through it. Alot of the extra fluff should have been concentrated on the main characters. There was no real emotion. I like to expirience a book not just read whats infront of me
