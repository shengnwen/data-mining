I was required to use ALWD's Citation System in law school, in part because one of the professors is a member. However, as I do not work around any of the Courts that use it (e.g. 11th Cir., Montana, the Marshall Islands), then it is absolutely useless.

Everybody else uses Blue Book, and that system is not that hard to learn. Look, if a law student can't learn Blue Book and needs a dumbed down system like ALWD, then they should reconsider their career choice.

However, I assume that the reason why you're buying this is because you have to. Good luck. I found it to be of marginal assistance when I had to use it
