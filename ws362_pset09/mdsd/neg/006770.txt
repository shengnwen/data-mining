I know all Buffy novels take dialogue from the show, but this one goes WAY overboard.  It relies almost completely on the dialogue and plots of Buffy, without adding anything new.  In addition, the story jumps all over the place moving back and forth through time in a confusing jumble (even for a fan that knows the show and the episodes like the back of my hand).  Finally, the line that really got my goat is a direct quote from season seven, where the first evil is talking through Warren and says, "sugar and spice and everything...useless unless you're bacon."  Bacon?  Try BAKING!  This author needs to go back to the drawing board
