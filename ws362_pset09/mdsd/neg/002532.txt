The book makes a great argument, albeit unintented, on the ill effects of immigration on second and third generation ethnic Americans (yes, some insist on this "ethnic" fantasy). If your field is Sociology or Anthropology, you may find this book informative with respect to the self-mutilatory social 
practices of those Americans who do not feel fully accepted.
