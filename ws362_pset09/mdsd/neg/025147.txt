Like Mr. Lee I hold a top secret clearance and I'm an Asian-American. What I don't understand is why Mr. Lee kept some contacts with foreign nationals by attending unclassified seminars/ meetings. These kinds of contacts are frown upon. Even though the information in his papers was deemed unclassified by LANL, he should have known the mere act of these exchanges raises red flags. Was he showing off his knowledge by presenting his technical papers? He should have been less naive about the whole business of working in a top secret environment. Was he naive or stupid? It's people like him that give Asian-Amricans like me a bad name and puts us under severe scrutiny.
