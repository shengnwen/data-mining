The Cobra Event is a jarring book, not because of the
plausibility of the plot nor because it goes into
excruciating pains to describe dead boies and their
subsequent autopsies, but because there are so many
errors on its pages. Worse, there are whole chapters
devoted to nothing that advances the plot or helps me
undersatand the story better; pages and pages of
filler - it was like reading a doughnut.

Among the worst are:

--Changing verb tenses in the middle of a paragraph. I
have no idea why a paragraph that starts with the past
perfect tense suddenly switches to the present tense
in the second sentence. And it didn't happen just
once.

--Using "you" all the time. The book has this very
condescending, accusatory tone when it directly
addresses me, as though it knows what I know and don't
know.

--Maxing out the filler potential. I know that detail
helps to make stories seem authentic, but really,
taking a paragraph to explain the history of Katz's
Delicatessan is superfluous.

Argh
