Dr. Gullo has quite a few good ideas here.  My problem is, #1, most of them are already in "Thin Tastes Better"; and #2, the book is blatantly padded, which drives me nuts. The useful material could be condensed down to about 30 pages -- so, to make the book long enough, he repeats every idea about 30 times.  He mentions the GG Bran Crispbread on literally every page... which brings me to annoyance #3:  as other reviewers have suggested, most of his recommended foods are nearly impossible to find.  Absolutely NO ONE in my area carries the bran crispbread; I finally mail-ordered some, only to discover that it's barely edible -- it tastes like thin sheets of wood.  It's bearable if topped with something, but really awful eaten plain.  Take my advice and forget about it -- just get yourself some Ry-Krisp, Finn Crisp or even reduced-fat Triscuits (my staple!).  I finally found Fage yogurt, and it's very expensive ($1.99 for an individual 7-8 oz. cup) -- AND it's only available in either fat-free (which I don't like) or very high fat (250 calories per 8 oz).  I did find Walden Farms salad dressings, but when I saw that they're labeled "Calorie Free," I decided they would probably be vile-tasting and put them back on the shelf.  I also found Vitamuffins, but if you read the ingredient lists, they are NOT particularly healthy:  the top three ingredients in their "Cran-Bran Muffins" are water, sugar, and white flour!  Bran is way down the list, and the fiber content is not high.  So I didn't buy those either.  I was glad to know that Alba shakes are still being made, although again, you have to mail-order them.
   Dr. G. does have good behavior modification suggestions.  I think he's absolutely on the money about "trigger foods" and always carrying a snack pack with you.  But again, I believe all of that is in "Thin Tastes Better."
