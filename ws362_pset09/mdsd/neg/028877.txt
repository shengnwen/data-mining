This is a horrible failure of a book. It depends totally on its ending, and at the end, delivers nothing. It is the sort of book you throw at the wall. 

It starts well. Fraught with potential, it captures your imagination,leads you along an interwoven tale full of incidents and detail. Little of substance happens, no characters develop, and no real story is built. But it carries you because it promises, again and again, that all that transpires is a part of the mystery that will be resolved at the end. 

Surprise ! There is no resolution at the end. A character annouces that everything was made up (for reasons that make no sense). The tale descends into farce. There is a deluge, flooding, drowning. I could only think of the Poseidon Adventure. Everything is washed away except the bad taste left in your mouth.

The book does not offer enough to survive such a nonsensical ending. There are a score of books in this genre (Eco, Peares).
Your time would be much better spent with one of those.
