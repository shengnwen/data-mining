After reading this book and seeing the incredible price tag for so little useful information, surely this must be a Russian plot to bilk hard-working Americans out of their money and send them on a mission of useless training programs?

As so many other reviewers have stated, it appears that Pavel's books are written in serial fashion to either 1) get you to buy more expensive books or 2)get you to buy expensive DVD's.

"Take down that wall Gorby"...so those wacky Russians can experience the American dream by selling over-hyped books supposedly containing valuable Russian training "secrets".

Comrades - save your money and your time!  Search Amazon for some of the common sense, practical weight-training books, preferably by Stuart McRobert, Bill Starr and some of the old-timers who built massive physiques and strength without Russian "secrets", steroids, or other nonsense
