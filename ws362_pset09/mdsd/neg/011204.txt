I usually have good judgement when getting technical books.  I was wrong with this one.  This book will not help an existing programmer get familiar with X-Code, and won't help a novice get started.  The main reason?  It is full of garbage anecdote's that just distract the user and interrupt the flow of trying to learn something.  The book is horrible on explaining the X-Code IDE and in explaining any Objective C or Cocoa references.  Do Not waster your money
