I am stunned that a book like &quot;Lightning&quot; would sell even one copy.  Mine was given to me, but should have been tossed in the trash instead.  I cannot begin to talk about what is wrong with this book because there is nothing right. Worthless!!!!and pathetic and beyond.  For heaven sake if you are really of fan of Steel's (I find that hard to believe) than check it out of the library, do not waste a dime on this trash. &quot;Lightning&quot; discredits all women and is a sham.  It does not deserve even one star
