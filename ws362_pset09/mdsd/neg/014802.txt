Jung is loopy. Jungian psychology is loopy. Jungian psychologists are  loopy. It surprises me that people take this stuff as seriously as they do.  Maybe there's a good Jungian explanation for that too. That said, Jung was,  in my opinion, the Wagner of early psychology, and, like Wagnerian opera,  there's a lot to be learned by mulling over some of the ideas presented  therein. But remember, Jung was more of a Romantic philosopher than a  psychologist. Colorful stuff. Just don't take it too seriously
