This is an addendum to my review of two years ago.  

First off, I mentioned that the book is written on a grade-school level.  Why not produce another edition, with the title "The Depression Workbook for Smart People" or "The Depression Workbook for the College-Educated"?  This may help some of us to feel less put off and alienated.

Additionally, the book is also written from a highly feminine point of view.  The profession expresses concern that more men are not coming forward and seeking help for depression, but I believe many men are not comfortable with many of the suggestions put forward in this book (and many others).  Men are not inclined to take up painting, or knitting, or flower arranging.  We like skeet shooting, NASCAR, and cage fighting. In other words, expecting men to become more like women in order to get well is unreaslistic.  Another suggested edition: "The Depression Workbook for Men."
