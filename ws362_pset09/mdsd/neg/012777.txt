Unlike some reviewers here, I haven't read the other (apparently better) books in this series. The larger premise--a special wing of the FBI staffed by psychics--completely hooked me, but this novel quickly devolved into standard genre schlock with all its weaknesses: "Characters" who interchangeably spout exposition, contrived romance, and so on.

Here's hoping other books in the series are more satisfying.
