Suzanne Somers is partial scam artist. She claims that if you follow the advice in her books, prepare her recipes, use her skin products, etc. you can look as good as she does for her age. She never mentions all the cosmetic surgery and lipo suction she has had done. I know a number of Plastic Surgeons and Dermatologists, and they all claim that there is no way that her face and body can look as good as it does for her age without Cosmetic Surgery on her face and body and touch-ups along the way. However, her books with their beautiful pictures of her and her recipes are lovely to look at but she is giving women who are in their 50's and beyond false hope. She should really write a book about all the work she has had done, what it was like, the cost (which the average woman cannot afford), etc
