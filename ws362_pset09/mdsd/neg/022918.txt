I read this book, had to look hard to find all that is advertised. 4 ingredients to cook up a business idea, 4 commandents for running a solid, profitable company. Well, three stories about his business experience would have been sufficient to explain his business idea. It was a tiresome read about all his business disasters. I tried the no money down route to buying a house. Never found a guillable person to agree to this. I tried to purchase a business this way as well. If a business is for sale,everyone that is selling wants their money. Even if the business is not worth what they are asking, some fool will come along pay the price. Its the American dream being a business owner. I tend to think now all these books on how to do it with no cash are full of nonsense. If i find out the secret to making money, why would I tell anything else?? If I make it, i dont need to boast. Save your money. Read good books on business and try to form relationships with people that are successful so you can learn from real life successful people who did it the first time around because they had sound business experience
