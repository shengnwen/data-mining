Take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily.  The advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong.

If you want to do really well.  Do what others that are doing well are doing.  Adopt the beliefs, mannerisms, attitude,  techniques, ideas  of who you wish to be like  and you'll get the same results.

in other words.  Don't copy John Gray.
