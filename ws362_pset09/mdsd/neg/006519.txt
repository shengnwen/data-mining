I expected more, and better, from the ASPCA. This book is so basic, much too elementary for anyone who already owns a cat.  Really.  In two years I've learned more from my cats than this book could tell me.  The  information level is cursory, and in some cases, spotty.  It was published  in 1992, so there's NOTHING here about breakthrough medications for flea  and heartworm prophylaxis.  The only good thing to say about this book is  that the photographs are beautiful.  Wish I could send it back and buy  something more informative
