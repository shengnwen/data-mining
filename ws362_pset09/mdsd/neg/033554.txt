The title - "A Deficit of Decency" - is more than a bit ironic, given Miller's obnoxious performance at the 2004 Republican Convention and subsequent "Hardball" interview, and his long record of political back-stabbing.  

Miller's non-stop misrepresentations of Sen. Kerry and other Democrats at the 2004 Convention were deliberate and inappropriate.  Further, one wonders how Sen. Kerry "got to be so bad" after Miller's 2001 speech praising him as an American hero, or why Miller didn't step up to defend his fellow Georgia Sen. Max Cleland when Cleland was being viciously and inappropriately attacked while running for re-election, or why has he now forsaken former President Carter - with whom he worked for many years?

I do agree with Miller about the need to improve immigration control, the general lack of decent sports and music role models
