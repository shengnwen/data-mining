After reading Donald Spoto's biography on Marilyn Monroe, I found out that everything in this book is completely false.  Slatzer only met Monroe once, during the filming of Niagra, asked to have his picture taken with her, and that was the end of it.  His claims that they were married, among other things, only surfaced after her death, in fact more than a decade later.  All personal records of Marilyn do not show anything about her having any other contact with the author.  Slatzer has made a fortune off of this book that has all false information in it.  I do not recommend supporting him by buying it
