The only way anyone would give this book more than 1 star is if they are a close friend of Snepp. The rest of the world wouldn't read it. How can a book be about so important a topic, get banned, taken to the Supreme Court, and remain so forgotten? Because the book sucks, it is pedantic, overwritten, and all about what a superspy Frank is. Most controversial books sell, even if they are crappy. This book is so crappy that it doesn't even sell, and thus it will remain a footnote to history
