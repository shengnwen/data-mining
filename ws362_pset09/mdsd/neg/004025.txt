Some of the medical information is very helpful.  My recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35, it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy, nor is it for someone who has young children at home.  Her hormonal theory, that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families, and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed.  Many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age.  Do I think that my total hysterectomy at 34 (and the obvious onset of menopause) changed my ability or desire to nurture my children?  Of course not.  That's ridiculous, and if I think about it too much, it's actually offensive.

Her comments about marriage are questionable, as well.  Marriages sustain many changes, and menopause is just one of them.  Open lines of communication, deep love and commitment are certainly enough to weather the "hormonal storm."  How sad that it seems as if one point of the book is that menopause is the time to assess your marriage.  Shouldn't we be doing that every day, and re-committing ourselves to growing together?  

Many reviewers have commented on some of her more non-traditional methods.  I am not a fan of tarot cards, and I'm not sure how I feel about taking medical advice from someone who diagnosed herself on several occassions, by using them.  That's just my own opinion.  I tried to look beyond that.

I just think this is another book written for people older than I am.  That's okay, but it still leaves me looking for something I can truly relate to
