I'd give it one star if it wasn't for the fact that I like JPI and value whatever real info I might have found here.  Unfortunately, you can't tell what is real and what isn't.  This is apparently a self-published rant that is poorly researched, horribly written, and excruciatingly edited.  And I am a faithful, liberal daughter of the church.  I would like nothing more than a great scholarly biography of JPI.  I read Yallop's "In God's Name" and wanted to learn more about JPI's life, teachings and his suspicious death.  You certainly can find good info in Gregoire's book, but you can't trust it, which is too bad.  This is no better than a lot of those tantrum websites you can find all day long for free, only without the animated graphics.  

NOTE: It's important to note that I read the "black cover" edition, and have not read the newly revised 2006 edition (white cover).  I intend to do so
