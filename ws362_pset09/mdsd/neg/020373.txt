I place this book on the same level as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Yes, this is a book of fiction, but its entire portrayal of the goddess Kali--widely worshipped today in India, and elsewhere around the world--and Her worshippers is not only slanderous but dishonest.  I don't for a moment believe that the author actually thinks those who worship Kali are all child-murderers, sadists, and psychopaths...but those he fictionally portrays are.  

Worse, he portrays Kali as a demon.  This is comparable to writing a fiction book portraying Mohammed as a child molester or Jehovah as a sadistic voyeur.  Kali is the obvious choice, the easy one, as She combines the famous Western combination of Occidental prurience and horror at Oriental depravity.  Kali superbly fills this bill, as She is naked, black, and rules the dimension of death.  

Kali is unknown to the TV-watching West save through movies like "Gunga Din" and "Indiana Jones" (the one that has the hidden temple in it).  Both of these films are based on the myth of thuggee--the Thugs--a creation of the British colonial racist imagination.  Sleeman (the Brit responsible for this bit of slander) cobbled up "evidence" with no basis other than his own hearsay and considerable store of contempt for the "wogs," and presto--you have Kali the goddess of murder. 

Simmons's book is simply another thuggee story, albeit set in a modern context.  I will not dignify this trash by writing more about it
