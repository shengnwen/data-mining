I bought this book to learn some interisting new facts that I have not heard about before. Well this book didn't do that. Most of the stuff in this book I have read in other places and it was written better. Like The "Red Queen" by Matt Ridley & "Why is Sex Fun" by Jarod Diamond. 
This book relies to heavely on statistical data to come up with anything very interisting. I found myself skipping complete pages and chapters because of the boredom for having to read to many statistics.
If you are looking to use this book as a resource to quote statistics about sex then you are in good shape, this book will give you plenty of that. Other wise i recomend that you stir clear of this book.
