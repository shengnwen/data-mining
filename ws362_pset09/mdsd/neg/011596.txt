I was disappointed in this one. The characters were uninteresting and disappointing; the story was flat; but the writing.... well, this was the first book I read by Mr. Russell and it will probably be my last. While I can appreciate stream-of-consciousness writing (when it is done well), it can also be very annoying and confusing. There were times Mr. Russell went on and on about something that happens in the past, and then suddenly--without any clue or warning--he comes back to the present. Very confusing, hard to follow and hard to read. He's lucky he got one star out of me! Skip this one. Seriously
