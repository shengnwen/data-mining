This is the only one of Iris Murdoch's books that I've ever read. And I got the very strong impression that she had never met anyone who wasn't, for want of a better word, posh. All the characters in this book, even the non-Oxford non-theatre types, talk the same way, which makes the whole thing extremely unconvincing.
