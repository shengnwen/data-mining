This is the only one of Myers' book that I read.  I disliked it early on - but I was determined to see it through.  The novel has some wit, some mystery, some cleverness - but oh what an unsatisfying mish-mash.

The writing style is skittish - from page one to the finish - so nothing is developed to any extent that you start caring about anything.  I just yearned for release at the last page.  The lack of focus was grating - but I appreciated the author's gumption of sticking to her style.

This is a light distraction - all froth and little substance
