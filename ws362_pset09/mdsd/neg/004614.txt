I checked this book out from the library hoping it would provide pointers and support for weaning my 12-month-old daughter. After reading it, I left feeling guilty and selfish. This book is NOT about weaning. In fact, it is about why you shouldn't wean. This title is a diatribe listing every reason you should not wean your child and all the reasons you should feel like a terrible parent for wanting to. It even has the gall to suggest the desire to wean is simply a sign of other stress in one's life, a contention I find particularly condescending as an intelligent, concerned parent. It's too bad La Leche League, from whom I found wonderful support when establishing breastfeeding, can't get past its political motivation to help women move on to another stage in the mother-child relationship
