This books claims to be an objective pursuit of the facts that support the notion of intelligent design or creationism is valid. (Note I did not say "theory"--that is an attempt to put intelligent design at the same level as the theory of evolution--creationism doesn't even rate the term "hypothesis".) Instead of finding and interviewing real scientists, Strobel simply went and talked to a group of philosopher scientists who all work for or are connected in some way with the Discovery Institute (discovery.org). Their entire reason for existence is injecting faith based reasoning into the discussion of scientific discovery and attacking evolution. Strobel, as a former journalist, should have stated this was the case up front instead of making it appear as if he was engaged in an honest search for answers. That said, the arguments presented are pure sophistry and any point of disagreement or perceived discrepancy within the theory of evolution is treated as support for creationism.

Read this for laughs, but don't expect a serious discussion based on verifiable fact
