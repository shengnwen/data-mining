I have a problem with Bakke's idea of "fun."  Fun, by his definition is a free-for-all.  For example, he feels that an organization's "amount of fun" is determined by "the number of individuals allowed to make decisions" (99).  I agree that sharing information "reinforces the feeling of community" (98), but I don't agree with his suggestion that leaders should "ask for as much advice as possible before making a decision" (88).  "Sharing information" and "seeking advice" are two different things.  

Bakke misuses the analogy of a child jumping into the arms of a parent by stating that the same is required of leaders to jump into the arms of the subordinate (103).  It is the subordinate who should trust the leader.  In one section of the book, he stresses the importance of "asking for as much advice as possible before making a decision."  But in another section he shares the story of his administrative assistant who "routinely checks with the office accountant to see how her decisions would affect the budget, but no higher approval is necessary" (apparently no other advice is needed as well) (79).  His idea of leadership lacks strength by decentralizing decision-making to others. 

In his postscript, Bakke discusses Biblical leadership.  At first glance, what he writes sounds Biblical-"serve the people they lead," and "allow followers to use their talents effectively" (261), but his overall idea of leadership is not Biblical.  For instance, he says, "The Creation story does not assign people, even leaders, the responsibility of `managing' other people" (261)- I wonder what he thought God meant in Genesis 3:16 when He told Eve, "he will be your master."  The Bible doesn't use the word, "manage," but God entrusted leaders to people throughout the Bible-that's why there were judges in the OT.  I don't think the Israelites would've left the wilderness if Moses asked "as many as possible" before making a decision
