If you think on starting to coach co-workers, family, friends, team, thumb around and look for another book. The authors start mentioning you can read the book from cover to cover (what I did). I would recommend reading it upside down.

Writing is not clear enough, and, unless you are an experienced and  enthusiastic coach, nothing will make sense for you.

On their defense I have to say the version I read was translated into Portuguese and some of the essence may have been lost in the process
