After reading Brian Green's "The Elegant Universe", I wanted to learn more on the possibility of a world made of more than 4 dimensions, time included. L. Krauss seemed to offer the opportunity not only to learn more about these extra dimensions based on scientific knowledge but also to melt it with an insightful adventure into the history of human creativity which has already imagined such world. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Both the scientific and artistic parts are poor and shallow, a shame when the explanation of a multidimension world is at stake. The rhetoric has nothing of the passion and the doors-opening of Brian Green's book. Too bad
