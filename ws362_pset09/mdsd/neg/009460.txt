I've read a lot of 'chick lit' in my time, but this is my first Christian themed novel. I bought it on a whim the other day and settled down to read it with high hopes. However, soon I was mumbling and getting frustrated. 
Emily Ever After is clearly not the usual chick lit. It's much more... reserved than what I've read. Emily, the main character, seemed bland and weak. I wanted to push her, as she always seemed to hold back. Also, I found the plot to be very predictable, and even guessed the "twist" ending while still in the first few chapters of the novel. I doubt I'll be reading this again. Instead, I'll probably pass it on to a friend who might enjoy it more than I did
