I'm not sure why all the other reviews seem to be so positive of the designs when my opinion is the complete opposite. I felt it important that I include my viewpoint. I requested this book from the library just so I could look it over first. The front cover looked cute, but it turns out I should have returned it immediately. Most of the designs (all clothing items) look to me like they should be draped over a table or be a lampshade. Other items would be fine if they were scaled down to about 1/4th the size they are presented in. The models look like they've shrunk under the enormous designs. One outfit looks like a giant doily took over the model's entire back. Basically what I'm saying is, I would never wear the items in this book. They look fun to crochet, but they're just not practical.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not normally one to give a negative review, so I feel kind of bad about this. I can see the positive in most things, but in this case I felt even the slightly so-so designs were tainted by being around the others
