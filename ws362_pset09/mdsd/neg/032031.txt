This book's premise is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75 pages.  We meet the two main characters and learn interesting things about their lives.  Arlette is the 'book doctor,' and the query letters that are interspersed with the action are very entertaining.  I loved reading about this side of publishing...

Then I hit the wall.  Too much discussion in the text about feelings, nothing more than feelings...I started skimming.  The dialogue started disappearing.  The query letters sent to Arlette all started sounding the same, as though the author had lost her ability to change voice.

I gave up at page 130, regretfully.  I stopped caring about the characters, but I wanted to like the book more and couldn't
