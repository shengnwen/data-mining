The protagonist of this mystery could be an interesting person.  She has an antique shop, runs a tavern, all in a nice rural setting in New Hampshire.  But she does one stupid thing right after the other.  She gets rammed on a snowy road, meets a bad guy alone at night, follows another one and rescues him from drowning when he wrecks his car, gets shot at, buried in snow, etc.  Even after each of these things happens to her, she does the next dumb thing.  She has a cop/friend, goes off to a dance with him without even telling him about her horrendous adventure of that day.  Her dog is the best thing in her life, mostly because he's smarter than she is.  This is the first (and last) in this series that I will read
