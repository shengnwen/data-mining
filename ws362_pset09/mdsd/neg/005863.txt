If one was prone to purchase Cliff Notes in college to avoid reading the whole book, then this book may have been written for you.  It lacks detail and covers a purported 19-year history in 96 pages (which is more like 86).  I am still reading the book, but am very disappointed in its overall content and depth.  It appears to be slanted towards a one-sided view from the author's perspective and opinions.  Parts are poorly written and several misspellings.  If you are not of the Vietnam generation and want to get a full understanding of the Vietnam era, then I recommend that your money be spent on a more thoroughly written history.  However, it is published on quality paper, and the photos and maps are of excellent quality.
