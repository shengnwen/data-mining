This reprint of &quot;The 1930 Olmsted-Bartholemew Plan for the Los Angeles Region&quot; is more exactly a low-quality copy.  The maps are so dark they are very difficult to read, and the way they are bound into the  book, much of the details are lost into the seams.  The original maps were  color, so any references to colors in the legends are lost, and the gray  scales blended together make the maps even less articulate. It's important  that a document such as this is reprinted for all to see, but it seems as  if this volume has missed an opportunity of becoming a library keepsake
