I was hoping for a book with practical thoughts and techniques to help the reader navigate through the darker parts of life.  Instead this is a rambling essay that quotes pagan God's and assumes a level of knowledge that leaves the average reader wondering what the heck he is talking about.  I got tired of hearing about how we should embrace our dark side; and found the opinions that it's okay to invoke total lack of responsibilty for one's actions in pursuit of this darkness downright dangerous; (especially the chapter discussing women who wake up one day and no longer want to parent their children). It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters.  His book is obviously meant to appeal to a very particular audience and is not for someone who wants to get out of a depression and longs to live in the light.  It's not at all what I expected from the book jacket and knowing that he is a former Catholic Monk!  I also found his writing style difficult to follow and more in the mode of a scholarly paper than a book meant to convey knowledge to a wide range of readers.  Only for those already into the occult and previously inoculated to this genre
