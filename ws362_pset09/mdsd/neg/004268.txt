This is the worst guide ever.

Want to know why?

First, it says "Paper Rock Scissors." Do people say that?
I think it should be "Rock Paper Scissors."
That is a good way to say it.

On "Catch 'Em All!" You CAN'T catch em' all. What about TRADING?

There are some RS Pokemon out there. Why didn't they list them?
I believe that there was no editor to this guide.
Probably the guide was golden,
then the editor was lazy and put the guide in Mistakeland.

Well, I have the Nintendo guide and Prima's How To Catch Em All, and those arer the guides you need to catch 'em all.

And where are the other 4 islands? Your rival is the champion.
There IS a champion; your rival. You don't just battle your rival at the end.

It says you get 20 Safari Balls. They might have got into "Park Balls" on Gold, Silver, And Crystal. Well, you get 30 balls, not 20.

It's the worst guide ever. Never buy it. Also, I saw that the book said, "All 40 berries listed." Well, there's more than just 40 berries. What if you don't know the berry's number?

There is no breeding tips. There isn't anything about Ruby And Sapphire nor Pokemon Colosseum: such as how to get Houndoor, Pineco, Marreep, Teddiursa, Chikorta, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Snubbul, Sunkern, and all the others where you breed a full-purified Shadow Pokemon.


You should've put just "Later" instead of Spoilers Unfinished Business. By the way, LATER takes up less space.
Well, Emerald hadn't came out yet, and you can catch Pineco, Mareep, Teddiursa, Snubbul, and Sunkern
