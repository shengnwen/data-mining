I grew up reading the Chip Hilton books and loved every one of them.  A few years back, Claire Bee's daughter and her husband decided to bring them back, which was a great idea.  Unfortunately, they also decided to update the books.

If you want a great sports book for kids, find the original versions of these books and read them, instead of these updated versions.  You can tell the originals from the fakes by looking at the author's name on each book.  The originals were written by Claire Bee, the fakes are by him, his daughter and others.

One of the things I always enjoyed about the books was that they were written at a time when the rules in sports were quite a bit different than they are today.  In football, for example, if the other team scored you had a choice between having them kick off to you, or you kicking off to them.  The strategies and formations were a lot different too, and of course back in those days people still talked about good sportsmanship and it was important.

The updated books don't make much sense, since they are still using the old strategies and rules, but the books are set in modern times
