After experiencing some of the frustrations described by previous reviewers, I noticed that the front of this book has a letter addressed "To Our Valued Readers" which solicits editorial feedback from customers.  

The text says "If you believe you've identified an error in the text, please send a detailed e-mail."

I followed these instructions, and just ended up with a very beligerent e-mail from a Sybex editor, which stated that Sybex had no present intention of correcting errors and actually challenged me to find more (which I gladly did)

Do yourself a favor...buy a different study guide.
