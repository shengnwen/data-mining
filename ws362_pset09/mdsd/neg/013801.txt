I have to say that I was very disappointed with this book. As a card player, gambler, and English major I found this book to be bland and poorly written. The author David Kushner fails to "show" you how this young man became a success, instead he "tells" you about the growth of the lead character. The anecdotes about how a young Jonny is abused by both "Nerd" and "Cool Kid" lack emotion, at no point during these retellings do you feel any sort of pain that he was dealing with at the time or become enveloped in his struggle. If you cannot develop an emotional attachment with a character than, "Who cares?"
Kushner fails once again to develop any tension or drama in the book in Jonny's later life. Any and all adversity/ conflicts faced by our hero are dealt with and resolved with no real consequences, they are told in the same bland mundane style. 
Take the example of the "Clash of the Geek Titans", Jonny's role as Magic the Gathering's greatest player is threatened by a young rival. Kushner's account of this duel is as exciting as a Baseball pre-season box score to a Basketball fan. The same level of tension is developed when a casino will not pay him his Blackjack winnings. He hires a lawyer. That's it!! No chase, no fight, no threat, no nothing.
That best sums up this book, No drama, no emotion, don't waste your time or money.
