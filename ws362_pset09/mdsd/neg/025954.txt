I purchased this book to augment Baby Bargains - what a waste.
When the majority of the information is not in the handy ratings methodology their magazine uses - What's the point??

It appears that they cobbled together a list of products and put in the manufacturers' descriptions in paragraph form along with the statement that they didn't review items in this category.

I was deceived by the publisher - this was not a report by consumers or even their own people - this was just an advertisement for a bunch of baby products that was SOLD to me based on their "trusted" name.

The truly disgusting part is that I paid them for this and they probably made money on the back-end from the manufacturers by charging them to be included in the book. 

Not only should you save your money, but you should question the impartiality of Consumer Reports
