A disappointing purchase, this cannot be the last word on the subject.  The book is a pretty dry read. Bill James has printed similar types of essays in various books in a much more lively and entertaining style.  Also, some of the methods used and assumptions made are very questionable. (I am an MBA with over 20 years experience in compiling and using statistical data.)  Felber's book can only be recommended to the really hardcore fan who is willing to wade through a lot of really boring prose
