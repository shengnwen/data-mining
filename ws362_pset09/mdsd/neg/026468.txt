Admittedly I do have a fair amount of programming skills. Albeit not specifically in SQL server, but enough to understand most programming syntax and business logic. By page 83 where the author finally begins his first programming lesson he has his first typographical error. A typo in a line of program code is like a surgeon saying, "oh darn" during open-heart surgery.  A typo present in an example line of program code for a student is disastrous. As I said I do have prior programming language experience so it might be a bit easier for me than most who purchase this "piece of work" book to correct the authors mistakes. I can only imagine the frustration a novice will have when they type in WORD FOR WORD the example program and receive nothing but error messages. 

In all fairness I have not finished the book. In fact I gave up on his book half way though. I did go back and count the corrections I penciled in over his program errors, both in Syntax and Logic, to discover 16 blatant errors by page 132. 

One thing ever programmer knows is that we test and retest our code before release into a production environment. I would expect the same of an author of technical manuals. Like I said, "Hope this author never works on my Database".
