The textbook is just poorly organized and doesn't begin to prepare you to solve the problems that are given at the end of each chapter.  While it defines terms well it also leaves out explanations for most practical applications that are tested for in the problems.  There is no way to check your actual work, since even the homework manager only provides solutions and not a detailed methodology as to how the answers were arrived at.  It is amazing that this has survived to 7 editions without someone organizing the chapters and the material in some more organized fashion.  Unrelated concepts are thrown in at the end of chapters with little explanation.  If you want to learn accounting terminology this book is okay.  If you want to learn how journal entries are actually recorded line by line look somewhere else.  The explanation of debits and credits is perfunctory.  This is not written as an entry level accounting text for non accountants.
