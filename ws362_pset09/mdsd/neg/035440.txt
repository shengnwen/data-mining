I bought this book in hopes that I would get some information on raising my gifted son. With the book still in my mind, I find it hard to even type the word "gifted" because I don't want to be seen as an elitist. I do agree with much of what she writes regarding the harmfulness of products such as Baby Einstein DVD's and the like, and I can vouch from personal experience that you cannot cause a child to be gifted intellectually. My oldest son is gifted, and when he was born I was only 20 and could not afford expensive educational toys and videos. I also didn't breastfeed him and he went to daycare part-time. I basically did everything wrong but he turned out gifted somehow. 

Now that he is 9, he is starting to get the "nerd" comments, so I bought the book thinking that it may help him deal with that. The book makes me feel that I should hide my son from society, teach him that it is not o.k. to be different than the rest, and only speak the work "gifted" with my head hung down in shame.
