The Web Design department of the career college I am an instructor and program coordinator at have used this text for several years now as the primary text for a web project management class. The problem with this book is that it sets the bar too high from the beginning and only applies if one finds themseleves a project manager handling huge corporate website accounts. It is impossible to scale the tone of the book down to explain the process when dealing with individuals and small businesses when the book has you only "wearing one hat" when sometimes you have to wear them all. It's also terribly boring to read, which makes it impossible to gain any understanding from it.This is an old book, in great need of an update. There are much more current and interesting books out there now that handle the same topic, and do it well. This may have been the first book of its kind, but it's certainly not the greatest
