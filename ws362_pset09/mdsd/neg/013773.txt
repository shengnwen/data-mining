When Annie Duke dies, what are people going to say about her?  "She had a messed up family life and neglected her four children, but she played a pretty good game of poker."  Big deal. She's wasting her life, and this book is proof.  

And the book is flawed.  She describes a hand where she has a king-high strait, but claims to have an ace-high straight.  Even amateur poker players like me immediately noticed that error.  It's simply unacceptable in a book like this.  The equivalent would be Michael Jordan mentioning the NBA's 35-second shot clock in his biography, when in reality it's a 24-second clock.  It's laughable.  When a professional poker player can't get the rules straight, I have to seriously doubt her credibility.  Don't waste your time with this unless you want to be bored and become confused with the rules of poker
