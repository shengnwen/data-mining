Chesler's tone is so patronizing here. Third wave feminists did not just step out of a cave, the older amongst us (those now in our later 30's to early 40's like myself)  saw these events unfold as children and it's throughly seared in our minds. Ms. Chesler ignores the fact that in the 1987 March for Reproductive Rights on Washington DC, in which 500,000 women marched, 2/3 were then under 30 years old (the third wave feminists, this was our first major- in numbers present, activist appearence) This book tempted me to write a letter FROM a young feminist. But I decided not to, because if Ms. Chesler was determined to ignore third wave feminists, despite much activism by us, a letter refuting her claims of our ignorance wasn't going to open her eyes. Readers are better to choose books by second wave feminists that are better written and informed, like Gloria Steinem's. I'd also recommend books by older third wavers like Naomi Wolf and Susan Faludi.
