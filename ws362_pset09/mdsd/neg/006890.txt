With "Japanese the Manga Way," Lammers continues the Mangajin-style method of introducing a manga selection, analyzing the individual elements of all sentences appearing in that  selection, and then providing a final translation for each line of dialogue. It's a great and engaging system and a good way to learn the mechanics of the language ... so why am I only giving it two stars? Because when you read "Japanese the Manga Way," two things are going to stick with you -- the grammatical explanations and the final translations ... and while Lammers excels at the grammatical explanations, his final translations are far too analytical, often falling short of the feel of the original Japanese. Translating Japanese "kotoba-doori," the words as they are, is easy -- the real trick comes in taking those words and converting them into English that keeps their feeling and original intention intact. 

Studying Japanese through this book is a good way to teach yourself about the structure of the language, but if you internalize the finished translations as accurate representations of the Japanese, you'll have to do some serious unlearning further down the line as you continue your language studies. I say this with 16 years experience with the language and as a former Mangajin reader.

Again, this book definitely has its good points, so I'm not trying to dissuade the casual learner from purchasing it ... but that being said, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out what I thought was its most serious shortcoming.
