This is the most misleading of books. The title would have you believe Gouverneur Morris wrote the Constitution. A few more founding Fathers naturally participated. However, Morris was Chairman of the Committee on Style which means Morris was primarily responsible for making printed sense out of the legal mumbo jumbo. He did this and did it well to include the Preamble, no mean feat. But he certainly did not write the Constitution as Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. Nor did Morris himself ever claim to. If Morris did write the Constitution, as Richard Brookheiser claims in the title, why did Brookheiser spend less that 10% of the book reporting on what this work is purportedly all about, the Constitution and Morris' participation therein?

Aside from being misleading, this book just also happens to be very poorly written. It is cluttered and confusing. It is a shame the author does not give the reader a better opportunity to know Morris. Morris lived and participated in some of the Nation's most formative times. If the author had given his subject more attention, if he had said more about who Morris was and how he interacted with the events of his time, then this could have been a slam bang winner, a blockbuster of a fine work. Instead, the best thing that can be said is that it is a very cursory survey of the times in which Morris lived. 

Mercifully, it is short.
