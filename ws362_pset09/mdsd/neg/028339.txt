I took over a month to finish reading this BORING BOOK because everytime I started a page I would fall asleep in the middle of that same page.It is such a shame that I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO READ THIS [STUFF] because I had to do this book for one of my most important exams.Mrs.Lessing must have been going through some sort of madness or sickness I assume while she was writing this sorry excuse for a novel.God help us all who must read this book
