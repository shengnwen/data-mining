Dee Brown's The American West is the poor consolidation of three distinct books. The resulting consolidation reflects differing types of organization and style. 

It is a series of disjointed, non sequential often unrelated vignettes that ramble across the Western American landscape. Focusing primarily on the West that occurred after the Civil War, it addresses a period of continual evolution, of transition between Native Peoples and their non native counterparts, between law and lawlessness and from one ecological state, wilderness, to farming, ranching and settlement.

But for all its lack of organization, continuity and sometimes poor writing quality, it is a book that manages to entertain and inform. Be prepared for some serious Native American bias. It appears the Mr. Brown feels the West should have never been developed to become the amazing part of America that it has become, but rather should have been left to Stone Age peoples in perpetuity. 

It is a very quick read with lots of simple sentences and even simpler logic that in a very direct way can evoke a reasonable amount of sympathy for the author's agenda. This bias can and does effectively cloud what really happened.
