While I generally enjoy Jane Feather's books, I was deeply disturbed by the premise of the novel.  The "hero" facilitates the sexual assault of the heroine, and while it is supposedly distasteful to him, his discomfort did not stop him from repeatedly aiding rape.  That is NOT romantic.  The heroine forgives him fairly easily, and after two other books featuring this character I had truly wanted better for her.  NOT well done, Ms. Feather. Not well done at all
