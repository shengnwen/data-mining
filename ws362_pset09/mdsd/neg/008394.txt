In all fairness to the author, I did not read the entire book.  I couldn't bare to go on.  However, if the second half of the book was as poorly written, sporadic in thought, and self-promoting as the first half...I couldn't have endured the frustration.

Chapter after chapter, I waited with anticipation for some meat, some well researched point that I could sink my teeth into, and apply to my busy life.  I was disappointed!  This book was more of a "tooting of the author's horn" about his world travels, and how he has help his client's succeed... than it was about helping the reader to actually use leverage as a tool of success in business and in life.

You would think that a book written on leverage would, at the very least, provide more value than its purchase price.  In my opinion...it didn't!
