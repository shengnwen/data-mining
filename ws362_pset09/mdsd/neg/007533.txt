I usually enjoy M.C. Beaton's books on Hamish.  But not this time. It seemed that the author simply slapped words down to get the plot on the page with perfunctory words. No excitement. Even the characters sounded bored with their words. Same old story line -- women for some reason find this man enchanting, but I especially couldn't stir up any interest in him, nor the other characters. M.C. Beaton must have had a deadline to complete a book this year and this was the effort. I'm assuming it's a 'one-book-per-year' arrangement so I will anticipate that the next books will be equally boring.  I'll have to find another author to keep me challenged. Read if you have nothing else on hand, but even the dictionary would be more exciting.
