As a debut, this novel is noteworthy, and the author paints a highly visual picture of the Africa she knows.  To me, the disappointment with the novel was the author's inability to go deeper.  It stayed very "surface level" with me, reads almost like a "young adult" novel.  Also deals with the subject of physical abuse, so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it.
