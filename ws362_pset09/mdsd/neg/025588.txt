Lots and lots and lots of, often meaningless, opinion, but little substantive evidence to support the topic at hand.  Very sloppy translation (original German terms translated two, sometimes three, different ways).  A better choice regarding the "Ideology of Art" in the Third Reich is Frederick Spotts' Hitler & the Power of Aesthetics
