I saw the hyped-reviews of this book, and thought it might be a fun read since I like scary stuff.  Unfortunately, it is very poorly written.  The author never describes this "world" adequately to his readers.  Fantastic facts of this underworld are brought up only when needed for the plotline.  For example, when one character needs to speak to one of the "gods," she steps into a portal, which gives her access to this god.  Before then, we never heard anything about "portals" inside the house, and I don't think they were mentioned again.  Poor, poor, writing.  The publishing house employees must be the ones writing the rave reviews.  Skip this one, or suffer
