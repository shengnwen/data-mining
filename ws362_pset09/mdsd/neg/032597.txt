Usually I like fantasy, comic fantasy, parodies of all sorts etc... but I simply was not able to move beyond first ten pages -and believe me, I tried!
After all those good reviews...  being not able to read even half a book - this almost does not happen to me (usually I feel obliged to author to read more, before passing judgement).
BORING
