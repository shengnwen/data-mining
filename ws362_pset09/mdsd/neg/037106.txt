I really think that this book spends entirely too much time on stories.  The stories were boring and I related to none of them.
This book just made me feel more organized than ever and that I was totally wasting my time. 

You have to weed through a lot of useless stories about unorganized people to get to any solutions.  Totally wouldn't buy again.  I'm taking it to my local half price book store.  Look for it there
