This book is a crock.  It is full of fallacies that the author presents as "truth" to those who don't know any better.  Granted, the "master cleanser diet" might very well work (I've decided against it) and the author is fairly up-front of the negative effects one will likely experience.  But the explanations and claims this book makes are ridiculous.  The author claims that there are no such thing as disease-causing bacteria and viruses.  Also, he claims that the lack of protein in this diet is not a problem because your body will assimilate nitrogen and carbon from the air you breathe into the components of protein.  Take an introductory biology class, Stanley Burroughs, before you make such laughable claims.
