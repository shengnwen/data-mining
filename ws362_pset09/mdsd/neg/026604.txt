This is an easy-to-read, secondary source on &quot;attachment&quot; style parenting.  The major drawback of the book is that the author is so caught up telling the story of her own flawed childhood and the emotional scars it left, and comparing her early years to the similarly sad childhoods other people experienced, it begins to sound like yet another &quot;co-dependency&quot; type book.  No wonder the author captured the attention of Sally Jesse Raphael and other popular talk show hosts!  I wished I could just slap her and say, &quot;Life is hard, lady.  Deal with it!&quot;  Actually, this books seems to be just that--a culmination of the author's struggle to deal with her past.  There are a number of more informative and less syrupy secondary sources on mother-infant attachment which I would recommend over this one, such as The Baby Book by William and Martha Sears.  I think there are better books on becoming and being a stay-at-home mother as well, such as What's a Smart Woman Like You Doing at Home? by Linda Burton and Staying Home Instead by Christine Davidson.
