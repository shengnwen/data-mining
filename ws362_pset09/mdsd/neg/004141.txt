A beautifully complicated plot gets shortchanged by characterization that made me grit my teeth, especially that of the main character, Joe, who seems too much of a pale imitation of Robert Crais's Joe Pike character. The pacing is also a little uneven, and I found I couldn't suspend my disbelief for the action scenes.
