Being a new real estate agent I brought this book with the hope that it would help me build my new business.  I was wrong.  This book mainly talks about looking at your past few years of realestate sales and changing your program using your past data into a better program.  Utterly useless for the beginning agent.  Carla Cross has a very good title writer for her books, since i brought her another one of her books in vain
