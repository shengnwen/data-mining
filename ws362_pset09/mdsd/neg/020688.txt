This book is just like the last 10 books by Stephanie Laurens. Domineering nobleman who can't bring himself to say "I love you." Insipid lady who is willing to have hot sex every night but won't marry until said domineering nobleman says he loves her. Endless descriptions of really boring sex, with something faintly resembling a plot stuck in between the sex scenes.

This book is a waste of perfectly good trees. At least I got it from the library..
