I read to Repel Ghosts and thought it was okay. It is a bit phony for someone like Kevin Young who comes from such a privileged life to write about street life as if he had ever experienced it. I sure did and this book felt like it totally romanticized Basquiat. I found little in Kevin Youngs own words. This book simply gives you a safe and untrue moment that is in a way enough for many, but not sincere enough for me
