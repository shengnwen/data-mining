Where did they get the reviews on the cover of this book? The resemble nothing I found in reading this.  

One of the first rules of writing is "show- don't tell" Danielle Steel took the low road in writing this simple tale. The plot is extremely weak and the way it is told... is well "told".  The feelings and inner thoughts of the characters are told to us, not shown. The character are told to the reader to be lonely, sad, etc. Instead of being in positions that relect that state and therefore allow the reader to conclude that. It is very amateurishly written. I am afraid she was simply trying to pump out another book, and rest on her laurels from the past. tsk tsk tsk..... lazy
