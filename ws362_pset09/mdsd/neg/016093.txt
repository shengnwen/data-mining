I heard about this book through a women's book club and noted the 5-star ranking on these reviews.  Once I got into the book, I was surprised by the very graphic account of an assault against one of the female characters.  Though the event itself was crucial to the plot, I thought the horrific detail was gratuitous, as well as highly upsetting, and I would think twice before recommending this book to another woman.  The story was engaging and kept me reading, but I was disappointed by the lack of depth in the two main female characters.  They "rise above" profoundly disturbing experiences rather than confronting them head on, and the ending of the novel is too "neat."
