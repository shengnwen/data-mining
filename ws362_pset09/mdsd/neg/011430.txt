There is no reason to read The Cloud in translation. It is written in simple prose and in one of the easiest Middle English dialects for Modern English speakers to read. This edition of the book is an unnecessary  translation into Modern English in which a great deal of the original works subtleties and nuances are lost. Because the text was written with such close attention to language it is truly inexcusable for any one to read it in translation when then original is completely accessible to the Modern English speaker. I therefore recommend the edition the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series, edited by Patrick J. Gallacher and available for roughly the same price, instead of this version
