Yes, unfortunately, this is just Central Eastern Europe Historical Atlas. The real Historical Atlas of Eastern Europe should include history of such countries as Russia and Ukraine as well as a lot of small countries (Belarus, Moldova, Baltic States, etc.). History of the mentioned countries are very interesting. For example, if we take a part of Ukraine - Crimea. History of Crimea is very rich: from Scythians and Greeks through Byzantines, Tatars and Osmans to Russians and Ukrainians. The authors have cut biggest part of Eastern Europe and I am affraid it is too much..
