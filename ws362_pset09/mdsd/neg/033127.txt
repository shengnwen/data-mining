This book is a mixture of interviews (that are quite interesting) and insight (that is too thinly explained and mostly concerns IT companies). The book IS of small size and easily portable, which seems to be the main promise, and it says it includes quick tips (it delivers, some), but also speedy solutions (doesn't deliver, because they don't exist, and most of the explanations and case studies are too short and superficial for anything to be learned from them) and cutting-edge ideas (for one business only). Suffices as a series of facts and listing of interesting company names, but not much help for a practitioner, and for a MBA degree a student would need many many many more books.
