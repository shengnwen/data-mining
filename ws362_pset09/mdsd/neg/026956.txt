Don't waste your time or money.   Should have been a little more romance than cat and mouse.  And, too many characters in this first book.  Setting the stage for the next two books in the series.   It would have been super if it just focus on Cass and Rick Cisco!!  There were alot of depth in the main characters that left you hanging.  Instead of bounceing around with other characters for her second and third book.  The book was a mess and poorly written. I 've never given a author a 1 rating.  Their are others who don't agree.  That is why we can write our own review.   Judge for yourself.   Thank you
