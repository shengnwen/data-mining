Its all fine to give players every option ever thought of to create characters but it makes no sense in not balancing the game for playability when it comes to being a gamemaster.  Like a good producer/director/screenwrite all n one, the gamemaster must create a world , an adventure, all the villains, npcs and monsters and make the game fun for the players.  In order to do that the GM must know all the rules and be up on ever character type put in front of him.  that's not to say it is impossible just very tedious for the gamemaster who must make the game enjoyable for ALL the players.  There are many more problems, Bad presentation...the background noise and artwork are not that good on the eyes so those of us that have to get out magnifying glasses to try and read the gm guide an player's handbook will have a harder time of it.  IN any event, I think it is poorer quality than ALL the previous versions of the game.  I have gm'd for 17 years and I am truly disappointed
