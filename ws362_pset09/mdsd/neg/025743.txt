I thought this book was incredibly slow. It never once peaked, nor did I find it all that engaging. Normally there is usually some big finale, or event that grabs you - not here. 
The premise of the novel was pretty lame, and the "bad guys" were not exactly hard to figure out right away.
All in all very disappointing
