This book really is an insult.  It's "lesson" and "assignments" are HORRIBLE.  They ask you to research in magazines different lighting effects that you think were used in his book.  In a field where doing is truly the best learning experience this book is not worth the paper it was printed on.  Check it out from a library if you must but you will shortly find it is an insulting read
