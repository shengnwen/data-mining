This book is poorly written, disgustingly inappropriate, and crass.  The characters are rude to each other.  It references periods, maxi pads, virgins, groupies... it clearly shows the problems in today's society including lack of respect for each other, lack of dignity, forget grace, that's long gone...  Do anything with your money other than buying this book.
