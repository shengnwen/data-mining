Yo!

I would think that someone who was writing a book about Women who have dedicated themselves to lives based on their faith should have more respect for her subject than to refer to an icon of that faith (the Communion wafer) as a cracker.

Starting in 1955, I was taught by Nuns for 12 years, the vast majority of them loving, intelligent and caring Women.  I freely admit to having those Women as my ideal Nuns.

Reeds' book was a treasure trove of the personal stories of Nuns...and ruined for me by having those stories flavored by Reeds' distaste mixed with what seemed to be her dilettante flirtation with a subject much too foreign and complex for her to understand.

Reed was emotionally involved enough to keep this from being an investigative book and, I feel, misunderstood her subject at a basic level, making it a difficult book for this 1950's Catholic School Girl to read.
