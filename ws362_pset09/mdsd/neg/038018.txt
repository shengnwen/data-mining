I have many problems with this book.  I am indeed a fan of Celine Dion's, yet, I feel too many meaningless boring books have been written about her life.  I am not a huge Dion fan yet I have read most of the English texts on her life.  

I am not farmilar with who this author is  and I do not understand why he goes on and on about his education, his affiliation with Dion, and the work he put into his self proclaimed "Best website ever on the singer".  This indeed does not sell the book, it only builds up to what I have found to be a pointless factual boring book.  This book is great if you are interested in chart performance and album sales. 

 If you are looking for a great read on Dion's life stick with the Authorized Biography or the book that Dion wrote herself, much more entertaining.  This book is much hype and leaves the reader totally dissapointed and confused about why they purchased it.  Please don't waste your money!  I feel this book is a product of some type of twisted obsession and it's almost like this person thinks Dion owes him something because he simply created a website for her????  Did that make her the global superstar she is today?? I think not!  Yet, he has used her name and image to further his own projects and has made money off Dion's name.  This book is no better than the other trash that has been written about the singer.  Please, don't waste your money
