I must say that I was deeply dissatisfied with this book. It appears that the editor was involved in organizing a conference on the subject and the chapters of the book are in fact contributions from the meeting. The title of the book does not reflect its contents; my estimate is that far less than half of the book is indeed about nanoparticles assemblies and superstructures. Even though this book contains contributions from some respected researchers, the writing style of some chapters is poor, not to mention numerous typos accros the entire book and even poor grammar (contributions from Asian authors). When I read books like this, I ask myself what is the point publishing collections of chapters which are rather weakly related to one another -- original reports as well as reviews published in nano journals are far better in every respect
