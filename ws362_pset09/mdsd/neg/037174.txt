This book is all tired re-hash from the first edition. Very incorrect mechanical drawings, most of the circuits don't work, poorly researched with many error! This book will frustrate you so much, you'd be better off buying a book on origami :-) Some of the newer authors have got it right - try books by Myke Predko, John Iovine or Karl Williams - way better
