I don't usually do book reviews, but this book irritated me so much I decided to add my one star rating to the mix in hopes of dissuading anyone else from wasting their money. One reviewer stated that the book suffered its own Black Death in the last two chapters. Indeed. I was completely engrossed until the story abruptly stopped and the rhetorical clap trap began when the characters found themselves reincarnated in Nsara. I suspect Nsara is really one of the lower levels of the Bardo, reserved for evil academics (and perhaps grad students) with really bad Karma. Hard to tell, but I for one definitely wanted out of there and I promise to be kind to everyone so I never find myself there again. I can't bring myself to even finish the book
