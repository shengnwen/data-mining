This is a problem solver book with few diagrams and a lot of newspaper-type pages.  The text is blochy heavy seriffed and is difficult to read.  I have opened it once, maybe twice.  Like your typical problem solvers, you can now find a lot of solutions (even to your specific problem) on the web...for free.  There are a lot of equations and theories, but not enough useful stuff for applying these equations to conditions in the real world. The equations are not numbered well and it is impossilbe to tell between interemediate derivations and the final useful equations. Unless your deep into this stuff, it is not for the typical engineer
