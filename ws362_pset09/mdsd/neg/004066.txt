After watching one of their performances, I wanted to read this book to find out more about Cirque du Soleil but this book left me frustrated. 

I was lead to believe that this was a first person account of "Frank"'s life-changing experience with the Cirque du Soleil. The more you get into the book, the more it feels like a manuel of all the departments with a narrative to ease the transitions. It turns out that this is a fictional book. 

This book would have worked as a behind-the-scenes special on how all the departments come together to make a performance or as a completely fictional story of  someone reconnecting with their passion through getting a job at the Cirque du Soleil because it didn't work a faux nonfictional book.

I feel that the strength of Cirque du Soleil is visuals and this narrative didn't go justice to what they have actually accomplished. It would have been nice to see photos of the costumes, make-up, characters, training lessons and especially see a photo of a "German Wheel"? The book is less than 150 pages and can be read in less than an hour so written descriptions don't do them justice. 

If you want to know more about the Cirque du Soliel, see a performance and skip this book.
