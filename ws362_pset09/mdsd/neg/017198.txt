McCammon's characters begin fairly well developed, although they all seem mostly defined by their various maladies/deformities.  Once the protaganist is surrounded by the other characters, any meaningful inner dialogue seems to diappear, and the story plays itself out to a predictable, redemptive ending.  The bounty hunters sailing off together is a bit trite
