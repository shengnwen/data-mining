I'm not sure what to say to help you decide if this book is for you or not. For me, the answer is NOT! At first glance, The Dragon Legacy appears as a book of non-fiction, but in reality it is FICTION. Being that it is fiction, I would expect some drama or adventure, something to sustain a person while they read through it. But alas, that is not the case. I also don't see what anything in this book has to do with the Holy Grail OR the Dragon Bloodlines; which are the reasons I purchased this book in the first place. I feel like I wasted my money because I didn't get any answers I was looking for.

Nicholas de Vere or Prince Nicholas de Vere as he claims is his real name, writes this story in college thesis format. On that point, it is written very well. However, this isn't a story to me. 

This whole book was very disappointing for me. As I have heard stories of the dragon bloodlines since I was a little child and as an adult have been eagerly looking for evidence that relates to the stories. What I do know is that there is definately more than one blood line! Mr. Vere claims there is but one bloodline... and spends the book trying to prove that the bloodline is related to Jesus, the M Kings, the Eygptians, the Druids, the Elves, the Fairies, and of course himself... It's all just a little to off the wall for me.

Well, that's my 2 Cents... it's only my opinion, I'm the first to admit that it doesn't make me right..
