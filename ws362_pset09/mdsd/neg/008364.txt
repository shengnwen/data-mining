Numerous occasions of poor writing and some wrong statements of fact combine to disappoint me. Some of the more egregious examples are these. On page 37 we read &quot;astronomically small&quot;, which is an oxymoron. On page 68 we read &quot;billions of chemical compounds that were known to exist.&quot; There are only about 20 million known at this time. On page 82 we read &quot;...literally picking one's self up by one's bootstraps...&quot; The bootstrap business is a figure of speech, not a literal statement of fact. (It is also a cliché). On page 136 we read &quot;The vice-like grip of the black hole's gravitational field is so great that nuclei are ripped apart...&quot; I believe it is the high temperature, not the pressure, that dissociates the nucleons. On page 185 the aliens are said to reply &quot;We understand what cobalt-60 is. We know which element has sixty protons in its nucleus.&quot; Cobalt still has only 27 protons. It's hard to trust a book that has such obvious mistakes
