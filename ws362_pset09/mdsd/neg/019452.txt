At last count, I have travelled to 48 countries, and I have bought guides for most of them from either Rough Guide, Lonely Planet or Footprint.  I thought I'd try a new brand of travel guide for the USA as from reading the other reviews here, most people are not particularly happy with either the coverage or accuracy for the USA.  However, this has to be the worst guide I have ever bought for content.  Yes, it has lots of nice pictures and yes, it has some cross-section cut-throughs of major buildings, but to be honest most of these places have more thorough guides when you actually get to the building if you want more information of, say, the different rooms in a Church.  The number of hotels, bars and restuarants recommended is truly worthless for the weight of the book.  For example, I just returned from 5 days in San Francisco.  I took this guide.  I read all of the 6 pages it has to offer on the city center on the flight over, and from that point onwards it was just a dead weight to have to carry.  In the end I left it in my hotel room.  For one of the cities in the USA that prides itself in the number and diversity of eateries, the coverage of San Francisco gave me no insight whatsoever.  Similarly, I looked at the coverage of New York (where I live) and this is nothng special either.  The only use for these books is looking at the nice pictures of the places you could go if you choose to travel somewhere, but don't bother taking it with you.  This is absolutely NOT a backpackers or true travellers guide
