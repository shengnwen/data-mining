I am not any kind of sanskrit scholar but I have enjoyed reading mythological literature for about ten years and I found Buck's Mahabharata to be a bore. I found it incomprehensible and disjointed. It was as if the author was trying really hard to create such an air of enchantment that he gave us something that sounded downright obscure and pretentious. At first I thought that maybe the original is this way, but then I came across R.K.Narayan's crystal clear version. After that I read Rajagopalachari's, which was beautiful. I recommend these versions much more
