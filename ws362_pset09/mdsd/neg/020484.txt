I first tried to read this book while I was pregnant with my twins. I often had to put the book down in tears because it was so negative and made life with twins seem unbearable. Thinking maybe I was overly emotional while pregnant, I have since tried to read it again now that my twins are 10 months old. I found the book to be the same(no more tears though, because I know the reality). Twins are hard, but not as hard as this book makes them seem. Also, a lot of the material is terribly outdated - birth options; dr's office not able to accomodate twin appts or being annoyed when you bring a double stroller into the office - please! That has never happened to me once! You get lots of attention pushing around a double stroller with twins, but it is all positive! The book made me feel like I'd be treated as some kind of freak with my twins, and that my days would be horrible. The reality is that you work very hard, but twins are a joy, they are manageable, and nobody treats you like a freak
