I loved Omar Tyree when I read Flyy Girl, For the Love of Money, A Do Right Man, and Single Mom. But he must have been on something when he wrote Sweet St Louis. I love to read and have read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books, and I love every one of them. But Sweet St. Louis was boring, did not catch my attention at all, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I feel that Tyree has much more potential than this book and hope that his other novels are better than this one.
