This book would have been better if it focused on creating smart playlist rather than just playlists, which is impossible ipod users are so diverse in the kind of music they listen to. Why purchase a book of suggested playlists when you can find on the internet so many focused on the kind of music you like to listen to.

It also could have been a better book if it focused on tips for deciding how to put together a good playlist.
