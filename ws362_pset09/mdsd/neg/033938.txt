This is a review of the audio tape edition, not the book.  The audio tape is not an abridgement of the book.  The audio tape is a collection of radio appearances by the authors.  If you read the box, you'd see that.  But the description on-line does not make that clear.  I think giving the radio show transcripts the same title as the book is deceptive.  The presentation is rambling because they just respond to caller questions.  They emphasize the relation between depression and a chemical called ceratonen (seratonen?).   This tape is not worth getting
