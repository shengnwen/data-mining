Being that I am new to motion this book was not an easy read.  It actually does not give the novice a leg to stand on nor does it provide the detailed information needed to create the projects that you want.  What it does do, however, is provide additional knowlege almost a part 3 of a 5 part series to motion.  If you are new to motion I would suggest you look elsewhere for your instruction but if you are already familiar with motion and its intricacies then by all means put your money down.  Even if I were well schooled in motion this still would not grace my shelves.  The direction and applications that I have in mind for motion just does not correlate with the provided instruction
