This book is way too long for the substance it provides. I expected to read a book that would help me work with smart executives. Instead, as another reviewer noted, this book focuses on high profile company disasters that were a result of bad strategic decisions by one or a few senior executives.  The book provided little insight into how this applied to other smart executives in organizations.  In fact, there are many smart executives who have made good strategic decisions (perhaps through the same process in this book) yet their outcome was different. I constantly was asking myself in this book, what can I apply to other smart executives and I never got an answer. The only good takeaway in this book is the importance of executives to create an environment where people are able to share different views and challenge the executive team.  I certainly knew this and expect most readers know this as well.  Now you can provide a few examples of when this wasn't done and the dramatic ramifications. I think this book tried to be the opposite of Good to Great yet didn't have nearly the analysis to back it up, despite the length of the book
