It is certainly a beautiful book, with its illustrations, thick and smooth pages, some tips from famous writers. However, as for the ideas-for-writing part, it is certainly not what I've expected. 
The content is pretty much the same thing the author has on her web page. I felt like I paid for something that I had already read online. The ideas are fine if you are going to teach a beginners writing workshop and need some ideas for exercises, but nothing else. 
It's probably better as a gift than as a tool for a writer.
I guess the lesson here is: nobody, but your own brain and experience, can provide you with ideas. Inspiration does not exist and you are your own muse
