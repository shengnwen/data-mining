Aesop's fables are interesting, but I wouldn't try to read too many of them at once.  I am currently reading this edition of Aesop's fables.  If I have to read any more animal stories, I may have to pick up a copy of  &quot;Final Exit.&quot;  The author's notes, however, make this edition  almost worth the time
