After a friend highly recommended the Dark Tower series to me, I trudged through The Gunslinger promising myself to keep my expectations low in accordance with the author's plea to look beyond the first book.  Unfortunately, I found The Drawing of the Three to be one of the weakest stories I've ever read.  I think the best description has already been stated elsewhere in these reviews...dull.  

I guess this must be one of those series that you either love or hate.  For those who enjoy a good fantasy series of the likes of Goodkind, Jordan, Brooks, Feist, Donaldson, and Herbert, I strongly suggest that you look elsewhere.  Unlike Roland, the span of time that I wasted reading this book means a lot to me.
