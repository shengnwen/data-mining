Like many other reviewers here, I've been a Piercy fan for years and years.    I've read nearly all of her considerable ouvre.  I therefore eagerly greeted this novel, being further excited by the prospect of a main character who would appear to be a bit of stretch for Piercy.  Piercy's shtick of the last 20 years  --  Jewish, artsy female character struggles with sex (but never her sacred identity)  -- has gotten just a little tiresome and I was looking forward to seeing one of my favorite authors tackle a new kind of protagonist, this time a neglected, wealthy daughter of WASP political family.   

For many chapters, I found the characters interesting if not always compelling and found the increase in dramatic tension very assured, something that Piercy has not always pulled off in her earlier work.  The plot truly thickens.    

And the characters are truly credible.  Our heroine, Melissa,  is blinded by passion and the thrill of having a clever, handsome young man choose her for his life partner.  When Melissa fails to consider that her partner's, Blake's, agendas are themselves ambivalent  --  does he want her, or just revenge on her powerful, hideously right-wing father?  --  we can fully believe in her internal war between love and doubt.   (And I found it touching to see how many reviewers think a high SAT score should indicate political awareness and emotional wisdom  --  fat chance!).  

But if this novel shows anything, it shows that merely believable ambivalence is not enough.  Although Blake does something at the end of the novel that the reader can see coming but which Melissa is plausibly unaware of, the meaning of his act doesn't resolve into anything.  Is he a flawed hero?  A manipulative criminal?  Piercy doesn't let us in on the secret nor has she built the unfolding of this vital secret into the very structure of the story, something she would have achieved in the past.  So, ex-ghetto kid gets his revenge at a terrible price.  So what
