I bought this book a few years ago before taking formal lessons. My idea was to gain some basics on reading music and piano-playing before engaging a tutor. The book started out o.k. and rather helpful but went totally downhill after something like Chapter 3. When I reached page 80, I couldn't continue reading because the chapters become totally disorganized, the lessons difficult to grasp and not suited for a beginner (especially if you have no one to guide you). The author explains something, presents a short music sheet exercise for you to play and then moves on to another lesson. If you're totally new, you won't be able to tell if you're playing the exercise given correctly (e.g. how to ensure smooth/non-"chopping" playing, observing the correct tempo, counting correctly, etc.). Not having a teacher means there's no one to correct your mistakes. The accompanying CD is not of much help if you have an untrained ear.

I was glad I "dumped" this book because it isn't worth the bother to finish. My advice if you are serious about wanting to learn the piano is to get a good and dedicated piano teacher IMMEDIATELY. No amount of reading could substitute having a real teacher. And your teacher will be able to recommend suitable reading materials. I'm into Grade 4 now (and my 2nd piano tutor whom I find a real gem) and when I think back to Blake Neely's "Piano for Dummies", I realize what a waste of time reading this book had been. What annoyed me most was that Neely tried so hard to be funny... peppering (and wasting) the pages with jokes... when the space could have been used for more useful lessons on playing the instrument.

Overall, I do not recommend this book. There are certainly better guide books in the market as I have discovered. If you're a beginner, it's perhaps useful to start with the trusted Alfred Library/Bastian/John Thompson book-series on piano theory and practice. Good luck
