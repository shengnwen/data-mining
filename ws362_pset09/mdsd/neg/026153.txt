At first, I thought that I would enjoy this textbook. All of the sections are concise and direct.

However, spending hours each day with this textbook failed to give me a clear, intuitive picture of some of calculus' fundamental ideas. It was only afterwards, after I had long forgotten this curse of a book, that I finally began to understand calculus...

The problem with this text is that it is not written with the perspective of the neophyte in mind. It is dense and doesn't alert the reader to common conceptual pitfalls. It ties the reader to details before the larger ideas (such as "what is a derivative" and "what is an integral") are understood. It also doesn't prepare the reader well for many of the problem sets. Dealing with this book was a really inefficient, time-consuming, and frustrating experience. I believe that students deserve better. 
 
Also, this book is really expensive for a paperback!
