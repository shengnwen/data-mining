I recently found these authors and have been devouring the Pendergast series with great enthusiasm. Having worked my way down the list to "Brimstone", I opened the book with great excitement. Unfortunately I closed it with great disappointment. The book started off with a bang, fizzled in the next 400 pages, and a good 1/3 of the book could have been left out entirely. Much as I want to give the book three stars, the ridiculous plot just won't let me. The plot started off interesting and spooky but when the motive for the murder was introduced, it was so mundane and silly, I put down the book and laughed out loud. After that I had to force myself to finish it. 

I didn't like Hayward in "Reliquary" because she came across as a tired, clich�d feminist (act tough and swear like a man to get accepted).  The subplot involving her and the equally tired, clich�d "Christian nut cases" was so dull it should be bottled and sold as Valium. Eventually I skipped over all those chapters as they lent nothing to the main plot. The abrupt, exceedingly premature office sex scene between Hayward and D'Agosta was unbelievable from numerous viewpoints: 1) no sexual tension had been allowed to build between them. The sex simply came out of nowhere and was thrown into our faces with all the subtlety of a gorilla at the dinner table. 2) the idea that a "by the book" female police captain would risk her career by having sex in her own office while on duty with a co-worker just didn't ring true. Oddly, the relationship was then dropped until the final pages. 

Agent Pendergast, whom I have adored previously, was the only thing that kept me reading, and even he was allowed to go so far off the deep end (he deduces the entire murder motive from a piece of horsehair - Come on!) that he lost the endearing characteristics present in the earlier books. Even the attempt to introduce Viola as a love interest for Pendergast failed (they looked into each others eyes for a breathless minute - PUH-lease!). Please guys, no more romance. Stick with what you do best and leave the romance to Danielle Steele.
