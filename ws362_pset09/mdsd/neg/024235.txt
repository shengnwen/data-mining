This is an example of what happens when a writer gets too famous for an editor to touch him. It's repetitive, with too many coincidences, too little explanation, which would have been difficult to do, so, better left out, I guess. Every time they are starving, they find a store of food. The woman conveniently dead because McCarthy doesn't like to write about women. He writes convincingly of the relationship between father and son, but if the landscape is as completely dead as he makes it out to be, there is no explanation of how they survived this long -- must be seven or eight years, minimum, on what? Leftover canned goods somehow overlooked by other starving people? Like a previous reviewer, I also wondered what the people in the cellar were eating.  Also, the one good person appears at the exact right time, or perhaps a day late or too late, but in time for a rescue. Too many haircuts, perhaps the author lost track, but starving people do not need to have their hair cut twice in 100 pages. And he indicates they had been on the road over a year, again without explaining how they managed that. It wasn't hard to read, but it just wasn't that skillfully done. It has a fairytale quality that I found frustrating--poof, that's how it was.  I need details.  The whole point is to construct a believable world, even if devastated, not just to write whatever you feel like writing and let the reader try to patch in the rest. Nice to be famous enough to get away with it, though.
