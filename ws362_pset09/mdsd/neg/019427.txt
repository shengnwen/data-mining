Breathnach's Simple Abundance and gratitude journal changed my life. I am in a temporary apartment awaiting closing on a home in a new state when I cam across Moving On. I couldn't wait to delve in. It seems quite stream of consciousness and more self help for Sarah - if readers find it useful that may be a bonus rather than the objective. You will find pearls of wisdom. But you have to dig through Sarah's written clutter to find them, all while she hopes to motivate us to rid ourselves of home clutter.I am on pg 157 of 269 and what is helpful could be distilled down to a magazine article. However, if you wish to commiserate with disappointment and unhappiness, you will find Sarah good company, despite her success and recent marriage.
