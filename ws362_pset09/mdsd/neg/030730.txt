Didn't meet my needs at all. Badly written and a bit outdated.
Actually, I just gave it one star to balance out the so obviously fake reviews given in 2000. What, each reviewer has never reviewed anything else before or since writing a review for this book? Hmmm, I wonder if maybe the author or publisher had something to do with that.
