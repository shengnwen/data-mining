This book was not in the same league of Frazier's first effort.  I found myself not caring about the characters and basically wanting the book to end.  The lack of a plot would be fine if you could get caught up in the character or lost in the beauty of the language but the writing is so overblown and tedious the fact that nothing much is happening stands out.  I really wanted to like this book and I was trying hard to like it as I read it but the fact of the matter is, this is a bad book
