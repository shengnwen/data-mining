I did not like this book what-so-ever.  I didn't care for any of receipes because has it has already been stated, they are not user, family friendly for those with a lifestyle that includes cub scout meetings and baseball games.  The entries regarding her financial lifestyle certainly didn't help either. If you want to read this book either pre or post op I would suggest borrowing a copy, not purchasing.  However I will give the author a point for stressing the importance of protein.
