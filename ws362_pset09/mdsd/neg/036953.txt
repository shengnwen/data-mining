This book advertises that it contains information about embedded Visual Basic.  Like, only 1% of the book is about eVB.  All the examples and code is for embedded C++, which is fine if that's what you are looking for.  The author even acknowledges in the text of the book that discussion about eVB will not be covered, so why does the book say that it talks about eVB?  I bought this book and wasted my money.  Buyer Beware
