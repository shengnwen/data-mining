Advice is ok, but the photographed kitchens easily cost $200,000 or more.  Not everyone has 25 foot vaulted ceilings with views or $15k Viking stoves. 

If your planning on designing a masterpiece and live in Malibu or Manhatten, then this is your book.  If your like me, and will end up at Lowes, you may find "Kitchens That Work" by Edic more interesting
