I am so disappointed i cried!  i know most of the players in this book and not only was the storyline awful there are a great many untruths!  save your money and borrow one if you must read it.....ugggggggggggggg please my 5 year old son could do a better job!  I love reading true crime books and no i don't think i ever want to read another, by this author at least....j
