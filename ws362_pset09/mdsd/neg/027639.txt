This book is beyond boring - it is quite simply the worst guide to literature and education around.Clumsy writing, Noddy-level intellect, endless waffle - this book has it all. Only buy for use as a literary sleeping pill or if you want to encounter and experience the work of dull, simple-minded academics who live under the delusion that they are interesting and profound. The world would be a better place without this monstrosity. Avoid unless very very stupid
