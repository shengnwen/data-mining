Behan's book is currently out of print. Maybe I should say &quot;mercifully.&quot; I found a copy on eBay. I enjoyed the first explanation of the central thesis (use the prey instinct to train you dog)  for the first chapter. Then the second chapter was the same, and the third  and so on. I desperately wanted to find out something PRACTICAL. Gentle  reader.., go ahead and jump to page 100 when you open this book. You won't  miss a thing. And Behan will tell you what you missed. How many times can  you say &quot;harmony&quot; and &quot;prey instinct?&quot
