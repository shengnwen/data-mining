This was one of the boringest books i've ever read.... Unless you want to kill serious time, and you love all types of science-fiction... then this is the book for you. If not, then don't try reading this book. I don't like books that don't get you hooked in, and this DEFINITELY doesn't get you hooked. That's all i have to say about it.
