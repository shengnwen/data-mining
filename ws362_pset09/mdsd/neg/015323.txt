I just wanted to give an update on my progress.  I cannot, with good conscience, support Diane's program any longer.  I am currently weight training, doing cardio, and eating healthy.  Eating healthy is not eating whatever you want.  In 12 weeks, I brought my risk factor for heart disease down from 5.9:1 (which is horrible) to around 3 (which is nonexistent risk).  I did it with exercise and eating right.  I also lost two sizes with just a 12 pound scale loss because I was gaining muscle, too.  To be healthy, you have to work at it!  Sure, you can lose weight eating whatever you want if you eat less - at least up to a point.  But who wants to be a skinny fat woman or a skinny fat man?  Wouldn't you rather be healthy and have a fabulous physique?  Try Body for Life by Bill Phillips.  Also check out the www.bodybuilding.com website for inspiration, education, and good products
