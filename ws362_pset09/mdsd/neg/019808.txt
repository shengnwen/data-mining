I could not get into this book at all.  The method of writing was very hard to follow.  I couldn't tell who was talking most of the time.  If there were more than two people in a conversation, forget it.  I often had to go back to the begin of the conversation and try to figure it out.  There also seemed to be more detail about the &quot;politics&quot; of South Africa than I cared to know or be able to understand.  Granted there may be some that would enjoy this, but it lost me.  The only thing that kept me from rating this with 1 star is that I did like the ultimate message of the book.  I just would have preferred that the message be given it a bit more understandable fashion
