Kaniut repeats the same story 200-300 times. A man or woman bumps  into a bear. The bear tears the man or woman to pieces. You get all the gross details about their injuries. They speculate about what went wrong. To me, this is like reading a book about 300 car accidents. There's an accident. You get to read clinical descriptions about the injuries people suffer. The survivors speculate about what went wrong. Just as people in auto accidents tend to blame the other driver, the people in Kaniut's bear tales tend to blame the bear for the accident. As a rule, the people injured by bears in Alaska Bear Tales don't know the first thing about bears, so you, the reader, get bombarded with inaccurate, biased information about bears. All the negative comments about bears add up; this book portrays bears as monsters or demons.
