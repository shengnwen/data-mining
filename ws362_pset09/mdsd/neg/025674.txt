I should have examined this book more closely before purchasing. It's not a learning tool, most of the chapters focus on following directions with no real explanation why. Needless to say this will leave people out to sea when it comes time to fly solo.
That situation is exacerbated by the fact that the book doesn't match the cd contents, so it's impossible sometimes to follow even the step-by-step procedures... not that they would teach you much anyway.
Unfortunately for the publisher, the code given is also buggy... adding the final nail in the coffin for this book.
Stay away, don't waste your money, there are better resources to learn from.
