Koch is the author of one of the most interesting books of modern criticism, STARGAZER, one of the first books to take Andy Warhol seriously, so in my book he may be forgiven many sins, but THE BREAKING POINT is pretty bad.

As history, who knows?  I can't believe all the things he dishes out about the power of the Politburo to enforce the Popular Front and its supposed hegemony of US culture.  And his condemnation of the filmmakers who made THE SPANISH EARTH is just unpleasant.  Ivens was no Soviet agent, he was a committed documentarian.  (That's not to say that THE SPANISH EARTH isn't a boring piece of schlock.)  What sets Koch apart from other writers, however, is his incessant banality as a writer, as a stylist.  He is incapable of writing a single sentence without committing some go for broke solecism.  He will set your teeth on edge from page one, right from the moment you discover that he plans to refer to his two protagonists as "Hem" and "Dos" all through the text, thus stripping them even of the dignity of their names.  (Martha Gellhorn becomes "the Girl.")

His rib poking gets painful around page 9 or 10.  Yes, Dos Passos is great, but not for the reasons Koch cites.  And despite what Koch asserts, without argument, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT and THE FIFTH COLUMN are not bad books.  They are indeed among the most interesting US novels and plays of the last century.  Koch is like a novelist attempting to enliven history with a novelist's little tricks, gleaned from the WRITERS DIGEST.  Get right in there, focus on your characters, make them quirky, show what they're drinking and wearing.  Imagine their thoughts.  Tell us what they're thinking.  Make one an angel, the other a devil, that way the reader will be able to distinguish them.  Well, I loved STARGAZER but this one's for the birds
