This book was a real disappointment to me.  I own and like several of this author's other books, but I plan to resell this one.  Most of the cards used photos, which I am just not interested in.  I don't think the designs are pretty, either.  Even the cards without photos weren't to my taste.  Might be OK for a beginner, although I'm not sure there would be enough directions for a first-time project
