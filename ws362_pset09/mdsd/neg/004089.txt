overhyped.  the recipe was sound, the execution poor.  enjoyable premises, hence, the generous two stars.  Nou Occitan, with its troubador bravura and artifice is a winner.  alas, the choppy writing quality, narrative gaps and descriptive flatness are tiresome.  an overlong novella fit for speedreading at best.  nebula nominee?  in future, i won't be suckered by that line again
