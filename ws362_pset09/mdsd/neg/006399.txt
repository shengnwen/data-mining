This liberal tirade recounts the slow and insidious inroads made by radical feminism into our nation's military.  As someone who has served in the military, I can personally testify to the damage women have caused by serving in combat-related positions.  Unprecedented levels of divorce and adultery are two sad results of women working in a close environment with men under intense conditions.  The author clearly has an immoral value system that places no regard for the families that have been ruined by mothers sent overseas, emasculated husbands, and the adultery/divorce that skyrocketed after women entered the service.  Conservatives should save their money and read the much better book on the subject by Stephanie Gutmann, "A Kinder, Gentler, Military"
