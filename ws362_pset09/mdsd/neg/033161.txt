i have read a number of dylan books. i found this one the most difficult to get into and appreciate. i tried to read it a couple of times but gave up. it seemed too complex and high-falluten [?sp].  maybe it's me. anyway, for what it's worth i truly loved CHIMES OF FREEDOM, DYLAN AND PHILOSOPHY AND CHRONICLES 1. GOD BLESS
