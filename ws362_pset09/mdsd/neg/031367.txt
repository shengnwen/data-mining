I am a devout romance reader, and I read everything usually in one sitting whether I enjoy it or not. However there are a few exceptions. This book is one. I could not force myself to finish this book, no matter how hungry I was for a book. To me the characters are tedious, the plot is bland, and the entire book is predictable. Of course, I had read a book previous to this one that was similar, but with vibrant characters and a great, funny, sweet plotline. If you want this book done right and without divine intervention, read Bet Me by Jennifer Crusie. You won't regret it
