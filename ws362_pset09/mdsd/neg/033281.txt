This novel in Dunning's series about Cliff Janeway, bookseller sleuth, reads quite rough. It is an EASY read because of the unusually large print for a trade paperback, but the plot is disjointed and leaves huge loose ends (and no sign of a sequel). The central section is largely irrelevant to this story and unrequited (but contains a commercial warning to be seriously heeded by booklovers). The good guys and bad guys are caricatures and too easy to spot (with one VERY key exception), while Cliff now is almost bad with simply too hostile a personality. Finally, the ending is more hilariously awkward, quick, and sketchy than it is scary or satisfying. "In a word," this novel is rough, unfinished, hasty, indulgent, a discourtesy by author and editor. 

Dunnings first two Janeway mysteries (Booked to Die & The Bookman's Wake) were stunningly different, fresh, and invited me into a world of books, while his Two O'Clock Eastern Wartime was a fascinating radio/love story. The Bookman's Promise was strange and now Sign of the Book is shockingly disappointing. If I happened to read this one first I doubt I would read anothe
