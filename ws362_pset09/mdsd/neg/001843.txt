As a biographer, Simon Louvish is a great novelist.  I mean, how else would you draw a conclusion that someone is gay because they never married and took care of their mother until they died?  Of course (dopey me!)-they must be gay!

Horse puckey.

Louvish's main claim in this extremely derivative and clunky biography is that Mack Sennett was either closeted or a very quiet gay man.  What is his proof?  The answer is below:



Zilch.  Nada.  Nothing.  Zero.  Big bagel.



There is no proof given in this book for this hypothesis, and except for some veiled clues, there is nothing anecdotal, nothing supported by documents published or unpublished, and nothing that appears in some musty forgotten legal file.  Louvish just throws this out there with nothing to back it up-the worst form of research and writing.  For that alone, this book deserves to perpetually be in thrift store shelves and yard sales.  Added to that, the things he does have correct have been presented in better books in better ways.  Even Sennett's own autobiography (KING OF COMEDY) for all its faults of accuracy and syntax does a better job than this thing, and you can get more entertainment (and primary sources) from Gene Fowler's FATHER GOOSE than this claptrap.  

Check out Kalton C. LaHue's KOPS AND KUSTARDS, Walter Kerr's THE SILENT CLOWNS and any books by Kevin Brownlow or William K. Everson and you will get better writing and more facts in one paragraph than you get in this entire tome.

Forget it.  Feh
