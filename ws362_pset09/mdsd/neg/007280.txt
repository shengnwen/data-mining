The Catholic Information Center of Washington DC recommends "Triumph" on its impressive Lifetime Reading Plan list so when I saw it at the bookstore I had no reservations about it being reliable "history."  For the sake of its own credibility, the CIC should remove this book immediately.  I should've paid more attention to the back cover which touts Crocker as being a former political speech writer and that explains much. Crocker's history is fast-paced, exciting and pure hyperbolic nonsense!  In the first half of the book, he blames everything on the Eastern Orthodox Church and the second half on those schismatic reformers who had nothing better to do than challenge the glorious authority those noble Romans. This book should be an embarrassment to the CIC, or anyone else who claims to seek the truth.  The only thing that prevents me from giving this one star is that Crocker should be given credit for spinning a good yarn.
