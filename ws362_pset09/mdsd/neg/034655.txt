A proper assortment of vacuities, false academisms, and funny logic (e.g., you are offered a choice of direct (sic) advertising, which simply states the advantages of a product, or &quot;an interesting creative idea&quot;, thus suggesting that these two notions are incompatible.) It goes without saying, that the book (like all ivory-tower books, Cannes, etc.) mostly talks about Coca-Cola and other products that could fare perfectly all right with just some reminding advertising. No murmur of launch ads, high technologies, cross-cultural marketing and other &quot;dangerous" topics. Perfect reading for insomnia cases
