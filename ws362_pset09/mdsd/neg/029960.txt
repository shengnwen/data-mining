I bought this book since I went to Lehigh and thought it would be extra interesting because of my background and because I played soccer and ice hockey at college.  What a let-down!
I found the game by game annayasis drawn out and boring.  About the only thing I can recommend to you from the book is the "amaterism" ( if there is such a word) of college sports at Lehigh and the great majority of other colleges in the US that we do not read or hear about on a daily basis.

I see you can purchase a used copy on Amazon for $0.99 - so what the hell - for a buck it's worth it I guess
