What a great idea for a book. Three runners from different backgrounds and countries each competing to be the first man to run a four minute mile.  I really wanted to like this book more than I did.  After many, many pages detailing training, training, adn more training I began to skim in ernest.
By the time the featured race was run, I was all out of steam.  I cannot put my finger on just what is wrong with the book other than it is really dry and boring.  Maybe if the author had gotten more into the personalities and less into the training regimens.  Anyway, somewhere they say it is "soon to be a major motion picture".  Mabye the movie will be better.
