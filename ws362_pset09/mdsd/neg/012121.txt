With the amount of time Card spends on the reprodutive abilities of aliens, I seriously begin to doubt him. This book had potential, up unto the point where the girl started lusting after bugs. EW! EW! EW! This book was incredibly horrible, especially towards the end and just plain wrong. I suppose if someone having sex with bugs appeals to you then you should read this book but otherwise, STAY FAR FAR AWAY
