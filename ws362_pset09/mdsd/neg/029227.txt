This book should be titled "My Argument in Favor of Open Adoption."  It offered NO help in writing a birthmother letter.  Did I misunderstand the subject of this book when I purchased it or is it advertised as a great source for adoptive parents on how to reach out to birthmothers?  
I tried hard to get through it, but found it useless in guiding me through the process of writing this letter.  
There must be books out there that will help the adoptive parent through the process of private adoption, but this is not the one.  Keep looking.
