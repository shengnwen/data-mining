The title is misleading. It should have been "You are not responsible! A guide for all you poor victimized women who wants to set that bastard husband strait (and lets face it, it's ALL his fault anyway). And lets not forget those horrible parents either, AND your siblings, AND everyone else.."

I guess that title would not have fit on the cover :-) At least it would have been more telling...

Codependency IS a real issue, and it deserves better coverage that this. It really is just a collage of texts taken from other, and better, books.
