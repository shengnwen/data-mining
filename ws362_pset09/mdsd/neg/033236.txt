Of course I recognize that a sense of the erotic is a very individual taste. However, when an anthology self asserts that it is the "best" American erotica then delivers like this, I find myself longing to shop in Europe.

I'll acknowledge these short vignettes are masterfully written...murals of metaphor and simile. But one expects that erotica would appeal to more than one's appreciation of literature. One expects that erotica would stir regions a bit farther below one's cerebral cortex.

I find little of that here. Many of the stories are poignant clips of human interaction with precious little erotica to be found. Generally good short stories with a bit more nudity and profanity than one might encounter at the public library.

These stories often succeed in stirring emotion if not the libido. I find I am repulsed by the celebration of just how base human nature can be portrayed. It's as if Ms Bright's idea of the erotic is directly linked to the degree of perversity, pain, and meanness illustrated. For example, there is one story that illustrates the destruction of a man and his family at the hands of a narcissistic drug addict. Please explain how this sad story is considered erotica?

At first, I believed my disappointment was rooted in my "maleness"...that perhaps these stories were written to appeal to  women. My wife has also read them. She thinks it's more like watching the freak show at the circus...plenty to gawk at, but nothing you'd want to touch.

I've seen this general trend in erotica in other anthologies as well. If this is the direction it is headed, then perhaps we just need to start renaming the series "The Best Short Stories with Naked Bodies and Profanity
