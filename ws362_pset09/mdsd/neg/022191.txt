I had really looked forward to reading this book, as it has been built up as such a classic of the genre. And the premise seemed exremely intriguing. But once I started reading, I found that I had to force myself to trudge through it. I did not identify with the main character. Seems like Pohl was trying really hard to create a deep character, but it seemed contrived and phony to me. And it was just boring. I didn't care about the protagonist, and just kept wanting it to get to the parts where they would go on missions. Then when they went on missions, it was still boring and disappointing.
I really wanted to enjoy this book, but maybe that was part of the problem. Perhaps it was too hyped up in my mind before I started.
