This book is good for those who prefer to use the "modern" way to make soap, which is cold-processing.  Why make soap in the first place if you are going to do it the simple way?

True soapmaking is done by cooking soap, and this book has no information on that process.  The book does give helpful hints about specifics on oils and herbs to use, as well as other soapmaking knowledge - but don't get it if you want specific information on making soap the traditional way.  James Herschberger is the soap GURU when it comes to classic soapmaking
