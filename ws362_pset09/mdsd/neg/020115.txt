This should have been a great book -- I know of none other that attempts to cover this territory.  Sadly, its coverage of bridge literature is amateurish.  It's also ten years old, so cannot cover recent developments, such as software and the internet.  If you're looking for a book that gives you specifics of which aspects of bridge to study and how best to do so, given your busy life, to help you progress from novice to intermediate, that book has not been written yet
