Stephen Mitchell is no Assyriologist - and he's not much of a poet either. His "new English version" of Gilgamesh is rightly not billed as a translation - it is, in fact, something closer to a retelling, and this rendering of one of humanity's oldest and most profound poems is a shameful attempt to Homerize Gilgamesh into a rollicking Western sword-and-sandal saga. Mitchell dispenses with the incantatory rhythms of the original, opting instead for self-conscious postmodernism, devoid of metaphor and, often, sense. His work makes for a text far more remote than the four thousand-year-old Akkadian original. He even divides Gigamesh into an apostrophe and eleven "books", as if it's the Iliad rather than a bunch of broken, worm-eaten clay tablets he's offering up.

The accompanying notes and essays are full of guesswork and shoddy or superannuated scholarship. Worst of all, Mitchell presents a Gilgamesh tale complete and without blemish, even though we have only about two-thirds of it and much of the epic still remains to be deciphered. 

Andrew George's $8 synoptic edition on Penguin is a much better buy. George, a scholar not a poet, adheres slavishly to the original clay tablets and ends up with something that - heavens! - actually reads like poetry. Bless him! And damn Stephen Mitchell for having the crust to think he had something to bring to the table of the great and all-too-mortal King of Uruk
