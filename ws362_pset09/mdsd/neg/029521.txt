Gloria Ladson-Billings needs to read No Excuses, Closing the Racial Gap in Learning by Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom. Ladson-Billings' book, Dreamkeepers, is lacking profound impact to the way we think about education and the problems faced in meeting the problems of the minority population of African-Ameican students. It is missing sufficient, current research to support causes and solutions to the achievement gap between African-American students and all other students. Frank, honest dialogue is needed to change the outcomes of the black population. Her book is just more lip service to examples of good teaching that are obvious to most educators. It is neither helpful nor thought-provoking
