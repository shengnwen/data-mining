I found this book at the library, tucked in between a Dr. Sears book and a book on weaning.  It looked like intriguing, and I expected it to be a book that helped to "normalize" the view of breastfeeding, showing simple vignettes of the realities (both good and bad).  Something more enjoyable to read than a "how to" manual.
There is some of that.  In fact some of the short stories are priceless.  However, there are also many disturbing images which definately are not going to help to encourage breastfeeding or enlighten anyone about the reality of breastfeeding.  
In fact, some of the more controversial stories (the ones about adult lactational fetishes or porn) only play off societies misguided beliefs that breastfeeding is or should be taboo.  The author mistakingly uses the term "breastfeed" to apply to a variety of uses for the breast, including non nutritive.  If the authors intent was to stir up thought and meaningful discussion about the subject of breastfeeding in our society, these stories detract from any of the positive messages included.  
In my opinion the subjects of milk men, induced lactation, extended nursing and cooking with breastmilk are controversial enough for society.  The pornographic issues belong in a seperate book.  
I would not reccomend this for anyone who is looking for more information on nursing in general, or who is considering breastfeeding but hasn't made up their mind yet.  
Its a nice try, the idea of a book of vignettes that reveal the many different facets of lactation is definately something that I'd like to see on the market.  But this one goes too far.
