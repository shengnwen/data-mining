In this self-aggrandizing attempt to position the Braves as the most successful franchise of the past 100 years of baseball, Schuerholz offers very little insight on how to run a successful franchise and instead focuses on stories that leave you saying in the end, "who cares."  

The book at times feels like it is being written on a 4th-grade reading level and I could not in good conscious recommend it to any baseball fan.
