This collection of articles attempts to discuss some of the issues of distance learning today.  It's a hit and miss collection, though.  Perhaps the most useful are the articles on providing learner support, but these are offset by some severely out-of-date technology issues.  The technology recommendations are museum relics (enjoy screenshots from Windows 3.1), and the reality of technology in education is a bit different than is described here.  To add to the irritation, you have to read pre-tech-bubble type articles in which the coming "information superhighway" will solve most of the problems in distance education.  That sort of pollyannaism has proven to be a little overly-optimistic.  Skip this book and find a more up-to-date one
