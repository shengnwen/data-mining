I read more than half the book and still nothing much had happened. I found not a whole lot to really like and cheer for in Nick. She seems flat and one dimensional.It seems the characters were used to advance a cause. I  felt as though I was being preached to. The women in Six of One were gay  and they lived their robust, colorful lives in the book with out any  comentary on what we should feel about them. I loved them because they were  real and and reachable. They just were what they were. They were a part of  the beautiful woven fabric of Six of One. I felt like I was supposed to  feel sorry for Nick in Bingo because she is gay. Why
