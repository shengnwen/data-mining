At first glance in the store, this book fueled my interest in the Orthodox Church.  Further, the easy style of writing made me feel very comfortable.  However, upon purchsing the book and diving-in, I was soon put-off my the author's frequent caustic remarks about the Episcopal Church, my own denomination.  Not only did these remarks add nothing to the book, but simply showed that the author still has unresolved issues of her own concerning the denomination she left to join the Orthodox Church.  These put-downs simply took away from her work and credability.

While her account of falling in love with the Orthdox liturgy and the "truth" she found in this denomination, nothing is said about ortho-praxis, or the "right-practice" of the faith.  I hear about a lovely liturgy with an actient tradition behind it, but nothing about what her church is doing to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, visit the sick and imprisoned.  In other words, I was left with the sense that the Orthodox church was a lovely museum piece with little active engagement of the Gospel in the broken world in which we live.  "Faith without works is dead," and I'm left with an impression that the Orthodox church is lovely and old, but dead.  While it is my hope that this is not the case, one would not know it from simply reading this book.

Further, while the author uses a very reader-friendly style, there are times you think she wishes she had the talent of Anne Lamott to convey her faith at a no-bones heart-level.  The author can't quite pull that off. 

While an enjoyable read about a woman's story of coming to the Orthodox church, it has a few serious flaws which detracts from the picture she would like to paint.
