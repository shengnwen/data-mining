I love Bill James. His best books (the 1980s and Historical Abstracts) can be read again and again, although James himself would probably yell at you if you did so, telling you to stop reading and start thinking for yourself. Rob Neyer is a talented writer but basically interchangeable with 1,000 other journalists.  This book features too little of James' wit and wisdom and too much of Neyer's modestly-interesting-but-not-worth-paying-$15.00-for essays and commentary.  And although the book is almost 500 pages long, more than 60 percent of the text consists of thumbnail sketches of pitchers from 1870 to the present.  These sketches provide the pitchers' height, weight, record, selected statistics, years active, key pitches, and (sometimes) a contemporaneous quote or two regarding the pitcher or an explanatory note.  In short, precious little that's not in other books like Total Baseball or already available online.  Of course, if you REALLY want to know whether Sig Jakucki threw a curve, then you'll find that here and perhaps nowhere else.  For good reason.

Keeping to form, James' essays are all entertaining riffs finding new ways to study pitches, pitchers, pitching and our perception of same using quantitative tools. With the exception of an essay challenging conventional opinions on pitcher "abuse," however, there are few of the myth-debunking studies for which James is deservedly respected.
