I admit I am not an actor or an Olympia Dukakis fan but I was curious about this book. She drew me in by going for what most of us know her by--her Oscar for Moonstruck.  But the book was too vague in so many places she brushed over her family life with generalities like I was so busy.  She just says I got a role in this play but didn't say how she went about it, who she called, who she knew or who helped her.  I was disappointed in the ending and her experiences with the ashrams. Those experiences were the ones she really wanted to share to attempt to inspire other women. I enjoyed reading about her Greek heritage in the beginning of the book, much much more
