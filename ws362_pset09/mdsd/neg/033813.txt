Richard Rothstein is no more qualified to advise on education than the new governor of California  (who is a body-builder).  The  objective of education is economic self-sufficiency.  Getting ahead in life requires connections, not "knowledge."  American blacks are denied connections.  We all  know why and how.  The black-white gap which Rothstein writes about  is not  information but access. 

 Valuable  knowledge is learned on the job, not in school. Teachers do not control access, employers do.  Blacks who are told otherwise are being cheated. 

 Centuries ago schools were for the elite, whose privileged  positiion in life was predestined.  This was not changed by free public schools.  America's political leaders never learned this fundamental lesson.   US Grant  - who in fact  liberated blacks - imagined blacks would quickly join mainstream   America.  KKK put an end to that dream.  Just saying again and again that there is a gap does not  acknowledge the reality.  Ask a bona fide teacher.

When black youth knows  schooling will be rewarded, education will command respect.
