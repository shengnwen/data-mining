i wish i had seen that guy from swedens review before i bought that book.. i must agree with him.. from the first page i was reading incorrect information.. i will be returning this book for sure. i was all excited to get the book and when i saw incorrect information in first page, i went to the part about dahmer (about whom i have read a lot of books) and the info there was not consistant w/other books on him. i would like to know where they got some of their information for this book. it reminds me of another bad book 'cannibal killers' by moira martingale. if you want to read a really decent, accurate book... read a book by john douglas or robert ressler!!
