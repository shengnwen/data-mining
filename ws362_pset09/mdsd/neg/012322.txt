We have a home inspection business and I read many books on real estate topics. This book was OK but certainly not worth recommending to our inspection clients. Some of the topics discussed are irrelevant to home inspections - such as mold! There were many topics lacking in the amount of information the author provided. Maybe if you don't know anything about houses or construction you might learn a little bit from this book. If you have a novice level of knowledge about house inspections then you should buy a different book since this book won't teach you anything new
