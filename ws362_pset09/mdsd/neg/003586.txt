I should have known from the title that this book is Oscar Wilde meets the National Enquirer.  Here's the long and short of it: Oscar Wilde had a *LOT* of gay sex.  Does McKenna have delicious, juicy stories about it?  No.  Is there evidence to base this on?  Hey, the National Enquirer doesn't need footnotes, so why should McKenna?  

This isn't history, and it isn't juicy dish.  Why bother?
