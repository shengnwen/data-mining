The book perpetuates harmful stereotypes about aging.  Cohen chastises  older people who try to take care of their health.  He claims that they are  searching in vain for a &quot;magic bullet&quot; to regain their youth.   Cohen then advocates a false mind/body dualism.  Through this dualism, one  gives up taking care of their body in order to follow their creativity.  I  honor the author's belief in the importance of creativity; however, I  believe that the approach presented is self-defeating
