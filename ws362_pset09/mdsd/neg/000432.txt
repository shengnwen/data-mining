Warning: if you are a Blackstock fan, please don't blast me for this review; I am too! But this book made me so frustrated I had to force myself to finish it. Blair has not become any more likeable since the first book, and that's a problem considering she's the main character. Truth be told: there are no likeable characters in this book. This book seems to be so plot driven that the characters are forced to commit every action whether it seems in their nature or not. I don't understand why the Owen sisters even live in Cape Refuge, everyone in town is mean and stuck-up. Every cop or agent in the book is an imbecile. Morgan is so passive she spends most of her time either oblivious to what's going on around her or sobbing. Blair is so aggressive, she truly is a woman only God could love (hey, I have days like that too, but Blair seems to be stuck in a rut). She runs roughshod over everyone and they give in to her, even when it doesn't make sense. I love the idea of Hanover House and Cape Refuge, but I won't be finishing this series. I can't. Too many implausibilities and the power of the message of Jesus was lost. That said, I loved Newpointe 911, Sun Coast Chronicles, and many other books by Blackstock, but this series just isn't worth your time
