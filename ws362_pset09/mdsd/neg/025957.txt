Okay.  If you're a historian, you might enjoy this book.  If you're not, beware!  This book is so incredibly dry and flavorless.  I was astounded, I mean, how can you make a book about the Renaissance BORING?  I guess it's possible.  Wilcox gives you a lot of information and it's organized very nicely, but still, this book has no soul.  It's just......dull
