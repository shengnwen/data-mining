I much anticipated this book as the author's book on tropical ecology is a good one.  Disappointment is what I found.  Authors usually thank an editor.  But such acknowledgement is lacking from this book and for obvious reason: there doesn't appear to have been one.  It's frustrating reading a book that appears to be a draft.  Once the chatty fat is trimmed, it will be worthwhile.  Until then, get what everyone else (including the Galapagos guides) reads - Galapagos: A Natural History
