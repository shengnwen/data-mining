While the information Ms. Drescher gives on her symptoms and warning signs are eye-openers, the book itself is a disappointing waste of paper. Her whining and pettiness has turned what was once a devoted fan of hers to someone who is so glad I don't have to live with someone so selfish and self-absorbed in my life. Wish I could get my money back from Ms. Drescher, no wonder she's not on TV anymore
