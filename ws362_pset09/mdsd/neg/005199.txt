The 1 star is for the historical aspect of this book. Some very interesting info, especially on the early history of gold many thousands of years ago. But the recent history (late 1800's up to late 1990's) is so skewed that I almost could not finish it. It's ironic that Mr. Bernstein refers to gold on so many occasions as basically a useless piece of metal while extoling the virtues of paper currencies (mainly the Dollar) as the savior of the civilized world. To put it into perspective, that useless yellow metal, in the 6 years since the printing of this book has increased in value (measured by dollars) almost 140% (gold = $620/oz recently) while the greenbacks in my wallet have LOST 15% of their value in the same time. Gold doesn't pay any dividends but it holds its value a whole lot better than the constantly inflated dollar.
    It's also interesting how the move to confiscate U.S. citizens gold in 1933 by FDR is glossed over and made to look almost as if it were a good thing. Yet no where is it mentioned that since that day the U.S dollar has decreased in value by 97% !!!! AND that the average income tax rate for the American worker has exploded in order to fund mushrooming government programs, U.S. public debt is well over 10 trillion dollars, the government debt is close to 15 trillion dollars and our trade deficit is approaching a trillion dollars! Meanwhile while China, India and Russia continue to add to their gold holdings, we continue to add to our debt, a debt that our childrens' children will not even be able to pay off. Gold kept us disciplined. Now, we are awash in debt and dollars. The dollar continues to fall while gold continues to hold it's value relative to it.
    Remember that no fiat currency has ever lasted. Gold has and always will. I would like to see a follow up book with possibly a new chapter entitled "Got Gold?".
