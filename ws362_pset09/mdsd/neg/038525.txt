The general feeling I had left after reading through this graphic novel was, That was it? Costing anywhere between 17 and 25 bucks this title hardly pays for itself. The book overall has a couple of different stories split up, all set in the Halo Universe. A good way to describe this book is, it's like the Animatrix, short stories based in a specific fictional landscape that are at best, cool and at worst mediocre. The art in every one of these short stories in this book were all top notch but, the shortness of the short stories just left me with again, the feeling of: That's it? My suggestion to Halo fans out there? Wait till this comes out in trade paperback form when it'll be about 10 bucks, then it might be worth buying.
