Gardner's book is a mixture of a little history mixed with huge doses of fantasy, along with a vitriolic anti-Catholic screed that is pushed continually and relentlessly throughout.  I am not a Catholic, but found Garner's position to be very offensive and completely one-sided.

His theories on Christ, the apostles, the canon of the Bible, Mary Magdalene, etc. are so poorly done and so out of touch that they are laughable.  He does have some interesting historical connections, and the genealogies are nice.  But it is based on a foundation that is so speculative and poorly constructed that you wonder if anything from his book is worth considering
