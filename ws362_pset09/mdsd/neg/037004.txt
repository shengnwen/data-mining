I picked up this book expecting to gain some new insights about the bleeding edge of scientific research, string theory, and model-building, but found it unbelievably tedious, self-congratulatory, and self-absorbed. There may be little doubt that author Lisa Randall is a brilliant physicist, but her explanations of the last 100 years of science and her theories are muddled and poorly written. I found myself longing for a writer such as Bill Bryson to explain half of these theories. In addition, one of most annoying features of this book is the way Randall tries to disguise her inability to explain advanced physics in straightforward terms that would appeal to the lay reader by starting each chapter with a pop culture reference, usually a lyric from a band such as Metallica, as if such a reference will be enough to goose the reader awake and take interest in the next muddled exposition. She even has footnotes that explain the American term "runway" is translated as "catwalk" in the United Kingdom -- oh, thank you, Ms. Randall, for such elucidation! Why not make this book more interesting and readable with a more engaging style that explains these fascinating theories in a clearer manner? Not to give away the ending, but many of these theories about extra dimensions cannot even be proven unless the universe demonstrates another massive outburst of energy almost equivalent to the Big Bang
