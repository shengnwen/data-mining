Because it did acknowledge that Christianity's roles for women are limiting for some people and those religions do not currently meet their needs, this book does have some merit. 

However, Sanders quickly undercuts herself by then assuming that Wiccans and Pagans just have not given the Church a chance to show how 'good' it really is. Pretending that their spiritual convictions are a 'phase' deftly removes whatever facade of neutrality she was trying to maintain.  

Unable to acknowledge these traditions for what they are, she appears threatened by their presence in America. She cannot bring herself to recognize the sincerity of these religious convictions. Whether she chooses to admit it or not, Wicca is a recognized religion in America.  

Then, I don't see how misrepresenting theology is supposed to foster a greater interfaith understanding. For a project she allegedly feels so strongly about, Sanders couldn't be bothered with fact-checking essential to making this case. How can she talk about something if she doesn't even know what she has referenced? What do the distortions do to the people whom she interviewed for this project (presumably lying about her ultimate intentions)?  

I'm not going to touch her `sex and drugs' stereotype just because they are in nearly every other fundie book about Wicca.
