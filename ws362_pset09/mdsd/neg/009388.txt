I am a big fan of many of Harlan Coben's books, but "Promise Me" was a real disappointment. It's hard to believe that the same author who crafted the inventive "Gone For Good" and "Tell No One" could write this kind of bland story. The characters are flat, some of the dialogue is downright soapy, and the mystery isn't compelling. I tried to get through it twice before giving up somewhere around page 200. The story really hadn't moved significantly by that point.

I highly recommend Coben's "Gone For Good" "Tell No One" and "The Innocent." The Myron Bolivar novels (if this one is any indication) can be skipped
