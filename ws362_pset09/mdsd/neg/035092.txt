While some readers may feel inclined to write a positive review of this book merely because of a sympathy felt for the author and/or narrator, or a shared sense of moralistic triumph, the book truly lacks any kind of literary craft or merit. While the narrator's ability to always be the victim, her punishment of the book's rather flat characters and a lack of providing any kind of tactful or subtle plot movement or meaningful emotional exposition--really, anything insightful--makes it difficult to even complete the book.

Plenty of people have been addicted to drugs and have gone what Heather has gone through. I just hope that those who are able to clean up have enough sobriety to tell whether or not they can write a decent book about it.
