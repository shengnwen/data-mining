Joann T. Hackos's book offers some interesting concepts, such as information plan, project plan, and content specifications, to name a few. Her concepts are well hidden under mountains of text that the unfortunate reader has a difficult time finding or understanding her intentions. Her book is information technology-centered, and technical communication has so much to offer other industries, such as oil and gas, healthcare, and financial, regarding project and documentation management.  This book is not a good choice for college-level courses.
