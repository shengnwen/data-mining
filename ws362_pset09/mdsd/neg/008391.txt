As I was dozing off lightly while reading this book, I thought I sensed a fleeting glimpse of Richard Bach's editor. &quot;Richard&quot;, I thought I heard her say, &quot;We haven't had a book from you in five years and your contract says you owe us one more by the end of 2000.&quot;  What happened next I truly must have dreamed, but I almost thought I heard Richard respond that he had something in the attic he had started, maybe they could just publish the first few chapters and call it a book..
