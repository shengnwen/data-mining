I picked up this book based on the recommendations of several friends in order to use it as a source for a lecture on women's history for a historical methodology class, and I cannot begin to describe how disappointed I was upon reading it.  The title of the book is a provocative question, one that asks us to explore the limits of what we know about history, and, indeed, a question that I would love to have answered.  However, while Miles produced a fireworks-filled book, it fell far short of constructively contributing to the understanding of history.  There are nuggets of good information, information that is worthy of reflection; however, they are few and far between.  Much of the rest of the information cited by Miles is extremely biased or simply misinterpreted, and there is very little treatment of anything that does not fit squarely within her view of history. Yes, it is true that Miles acknowledges in her introduction that she is biased, but this is not an excuse to write history books of dubious quality.  After all, aren't all historians biased in some way?

Recapturing the role of women throughout the history of the world is essential for a fuller understanding of the past.  There are more than enough other authors that accomplish this much more successfully than Miles (Joan Wallach Scott is an excellent example) that it is simply not worth either your time or money to read this book
