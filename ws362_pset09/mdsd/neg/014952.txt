Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him
