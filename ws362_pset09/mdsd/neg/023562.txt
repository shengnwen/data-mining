For the life of me, I can't figure out why so many readers give this book glowing reviews.  I found it boring in the extreme.  I guess you need to be a real "neural network" fan to enjoy this type of writing. For me this tome is overworked and overly pedantic.  

The basic premise is a good one (and could have been wrapped in a much better story), but the plot fails to get going at a pace that would keep even the most jaded "computer drama" fan entertained or interested. Characters are not fully fleshed out and the story arc self-terminates in many places.

I really had a hard time getting through this, not because I'm dull-witted but because I found it far too overcooked and "clever" for my tastes. Even though it was written in first person, I've never read a novel where the writer is so clearly self-involved.  As well, the devisive over-use of initials instead of proper names was irritating in the extreme and somewhat juvenile. OK, so the "author within the author" doesn't want to use names.  Make up something to at least give the character a face! 

All in all:  a very tedious read. Save your money
