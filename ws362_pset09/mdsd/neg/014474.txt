I had trouble concentrating while reading this book. Although I usually like to finish the books I start, I couldn't finish this one, and got While I was reading, I kept thinking, is there a point to all of this? It took me 400 pages before I realized that there wasn't really a point to al of Ackroyd's ramblings.

Ackroyd takes you on a tour of London in this mammoth book. The subtitle is "a biography," but it should read "a biography of London's poor in the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries." What bothered me the most was the fact that Ackroyd didn't do things chronologically. He'd talk about, for example, the coffee houses that proliferated in London in the eighteenth century, then go backward in time and talk about the Great Fire of 1666. He also gives the reader little bits and pieces of history--ie, the history of a particular area of London, or the history of the Cockney accent. 

Absolutely no attention was paid to the bigger picture. Who were the major historical figures of London? What about the buildings themselves? In addition, Ackroyd pays scant attention to everything that happened before the Civil War. Sure, there's a chapter at the beginning, but its not much, considering the size and heft of this book. 

I was disappointed in this book because I'd expected so much more. I'd really enjoyed his biographies on Dickens and Shakespeare and had thought that I'd like London: A Biography as well. Oh, well. You can't have everything.
