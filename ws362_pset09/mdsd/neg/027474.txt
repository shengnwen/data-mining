I was specifically looking for a book to help me choose and use installation and test equipment.  Disappointed, I can learn more from equipment vendor web sites.  As the author is British, so too is the  terminology (&quot;socket&quot; versus &quot;jack&quot;) and pricing of  equipment (Pounds circa December 1996).  At 156 pages, the book is also  quite thin for the price
