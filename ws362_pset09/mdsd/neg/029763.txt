This book is interesting if you are just looking for name that sound different, but don't believe in what the author wrote. 
As a French person, I had to have a look at the french section. I was really surprise to find names that were either not french at all or don't exist at all (like "beau", which is the french term for pretty or nice, but is not a name... please don't call your child "beau", it would make any French or french speaking person laugh!) 
I have no way to know whether the rest of the book was writen the same way, but how could I trust it now
