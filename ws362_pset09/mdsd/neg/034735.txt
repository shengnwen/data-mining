Having read all of Sedaris's books, I think it's fair to say that this is easily his weakest. I suppose it should be expected since it was written before the others, but if you read the reviews on the book you'd think it was world class literature. The only stories I enjoyed in it are "My Manuscript" and "Glen's Homophobia Newsletter Vol.3, No. 2." The essays "Diary of a Smoker" and "Santaland Diaries" are good as well. Ultimately his essays are still better than his stories which accounts for their making up all his other books. The stories are agonizingly over-the-top; that style work well on tv shows like Strangers with Candy but is painful in print. Do yourself a favor and skip this for one of his other MUCH better books (i.e. Me Talk Pretty One Day or Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim)
