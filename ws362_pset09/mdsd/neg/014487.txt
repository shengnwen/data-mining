A half Wizard, half demon incubus resides in a district called the Den of Iniquity and stalks humans.  He is bored, jaded, drinks coffee.  Pretty interesting, huh?  Then he changes somehow, becoming shy, gauche, and hesitant after encountering a child described "the rabbit".  They are soul mates. They are also bland beyond description.  There is also some sort of predictable battle between good and evil.

The Den of Iniquity, which could have been that memorable exotic "dark carnival" with a little exposition, but turns out to be filled with kindly folk, no more naughty than a weekend in Las Vegas.

Although the concept of a fractured world with irregular connections is very original, development was lacking.  It is unclear how Landscapers (always female) work---they plant small gardens to serve as anchor points to connect non-contiguous areas.  Bridges (always male) can somehow make the connections. Their work and training is left to the reader's imagination, but apparently sincerity and heart's desire and focused wishing has a lot to do with it.  Too much of the book describes unpredictable travel from one section to another.

Many words are written about Light and Dark in a kind of emotional shorthand, as if these concepts were mutually exclusive. Light is prettier and sincere.  Dark is undefined. The dark arch villain is reminiscent of Chthulu.

Anne Bishop has done better. I confess that I plowed through 400+ pages of repetitious verbiage waiting for something dramatic to happen.  Nothing sparkled, nothing resonated. Sigh.
