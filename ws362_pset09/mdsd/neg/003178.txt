I agree with the above review; minimal information, absolutely horrible photos and rather crummy quality paper makes this book not worth buying.  Meadmore selected many chairs that are discussed much more completely in other similar books.

He missed a few key chairs of note; Saarinen's Grasshopper chair and Aalto's Armchair 400 (Zebra or tank) chair.

If you want a good welll rounded selection of Modern Chairs, I'd suggest the 1000 Chairs book instead
