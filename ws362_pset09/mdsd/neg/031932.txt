I haven't read this book in its entirety but have noticed that it is quoted on a website about cults and used as an authority.  On reading excerpts about Jehovah's Witnesses, I wonder if Dr. House didn't really do the research needed to form his opinions.  The opinion that Jehovah's Witnesses are not allowed to read or study any bible but their own is not true.  Having been around JWs my whole life, I know that many have several translations of the bible on their book shelves.  Without having his book right in front of me, I can't pick it apart bit by bit, but this is a pretty basic mistake and makes me wonder if he's formed his opinions independently and through his own personal research and interviews with real members of these cults/sects or relied on others misinformation
