I have read several hundreds of books but somehow with this book failed to impress me. I was in the process of writing my first book, but I could not find this book to be of much practical use to my book writing project. The title of the book to me did not relate to the contents and the flow appeared haphazard. Each chapter in isolation could be readable and make sense but one chapter does not logically lead to the next. I read this book having completed reading another one entitled "Writing Nonfiction- Turning Thoughts into Books by Dan Poynter". The contrast could never be starker. I had hoped that the book would be a natural follow on after reading the delightful little book by Dan Poynter. However, I was very disappointed and the book was a waste of my money.
