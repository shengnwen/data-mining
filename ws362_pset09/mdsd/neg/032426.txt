This book has a few things that maybe of good use. I must admit that the illustrations provided were wonderful for demonstrating the points that Duquette wanted to make. Also the "primer" on Hebrew was nice. This is a very compact book of simple facts for the basic of basics.

What I did not care for in this book was the basic attitude and approach. Now by that I do not mean the humor, which I rather enjoyed. The attitude that motivates the book has the same wreckless approach as Crowley which should come as no surprise since Duquette is so heavily involved with the OTO. Also, the underpinnings of of Duquette's philosophy are 1) tenuous at best and 2) hinged completely on Crowley. This is all well and good if one believes Crowley is the be all/end all of occultism. Not so good if one, like myself, does not. 

The basic line also veers far to close to pantheism. Again, great if you are a pantheist. Not so great if, like myself, you are not. [I am talking about the thought that underlies what is being taught in this book]

The good things about this book is that it is super basic while being short and to the point. What is not so good about it is it hinges far to heavily on Crowley and pantheism. 

Over all I would say that if you like Crowley that much better to just read his works. Better, in my humble opinion, to read works by Fortune, Regardie, Kraig or Greer
