Stienstra seems to think people only go camping to go fishing--it's clearly the reason he goes. A campsite could be a pit, but if there's trout nearby he gives it a high rating. He never lets you know if the water is swimmable (i.e. above 55 degress)--something people in Northern California need to know in the summertime. He also gives something a high rating if the area it is in is nice even if the campsites are horrible. I've been disappointed many times using his book, yet there is no real competition for his book as it's the only really comprehensive one on the market. I wish someone else would tackle (no fishing pun intended there Tom) this subject
