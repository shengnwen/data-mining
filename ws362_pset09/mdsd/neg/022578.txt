I am a fan of Shakespeare, and I have a lot more reading to do until I've completed all his works. However, I have to say out of the plays I have read, Macbeth is one of my least favorite. I feel like you know almost everything that is going to happen after the three witches appear. I understand the themes, but sometimes I feel like they are so blatant, and hardly masked by the characters and the rest of the story. I think people should read Macbeth, but I don't think it's his best work
