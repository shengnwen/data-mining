Have to agree with the reviewer from Melbourne on this one. Herzog says in the introduction that he eschews any overarching methodology, laudable in theory I suppose but not very good in practice. The result is a rather  meandering narrative that lacks the benefit of a clear central argument to  structure it. Probably the main strength of the book is that it draws on a  staggeringly broad set of texts. [To be fair, I have not read the entire  book, so you can take my criticisms with a grain of salt I suppose, though  I do think I have grasped the essentials of his text.
