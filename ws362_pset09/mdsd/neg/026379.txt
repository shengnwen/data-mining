Great! Karen Zelan writes a sensitive book about working with autistic children. Here's my rage and despair about this book. Zelan worked for years with Bruno Bettelheim. She co-authored books with him. And she witnessed his terrible abuse against mentally ill children at the Orthogenic School where she once worked. Many of the autistic children she knew lived at this school. Why did Zelan not report any of this abuse?
Because of her silence and the silence of many others, young children, teens and young adults were constantly beaten and shamed in Bettelheim's "House of Horrors" for over 30 years. And children were beaten with fists and belts, smacked repeatedly in the face and told horrible things. It was all common knowledge if you worked there. So Karen Zelan cannot say she knew nothing of such things. 
Read books like Richard Pollak's, "The Creation of Dr. B." or Stephen Eliot's, "Not the Thing I Was" or Jacqui Sanders' chapter on discipline in "A Greenhouse of the Mind", if you just can't believe it.
Why should Zelan be allowed to benefit from writing this book about love and acceptance of autistic childen when she 1)did nothing to stop the abuse against autistic as well as mentally ill and traumatized children while she witnessed it and 2) has done nothing to make amends for her silence by now speaking out about the abuse and the legacy of silence. 
How can she even live with such hypocrisy in her soul.
Because of her silence and the silence of others, I was beaten and shamed for being confused and terrified. And I resent the hypocrisy of her being the sensitive autism guru when she seems to have had no problem watching disturbed children get beaten
