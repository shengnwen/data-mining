I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however. 

Stay away from this one.
