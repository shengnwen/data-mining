but according to Mary Kay Clark I must not be a true Catholic if I don't spank my kids into submisson and run my home like a dictatorship. 

I plan on educating my son in the Catholic ways and hopefully reviving some of the lost parts of our beautiful religion, but I do not need to hit him or smack him ever. He obeys me without physical violence. And the part of the book that says it is a form of perversion to co-educate girls and boys in the same classroom. What if you homeschool and have a girl and boy. Should they always stay in separate areas of the house. Her expectations are ridiculous in my opinion. The only part of the book I found somewhat applicable was the snippet on telling your in-laws and grandparents you are homeschooling and the chapter on socialization.

Her ways are far too strict and her writng was confusing at times. She may have good intentions but she is too extreme for our household.
