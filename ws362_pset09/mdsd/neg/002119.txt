I was looking for a book to guide me in postponing or avoiding hip replacement surgery.  The title "The Active Person's Guide to Taking Charge"  prompted me to buy this book, but I was disappointed in the book because so little of it was devoted to really taking charge of your physical situation so that you can strengthen your hip and achieve its maximum flexability.  A better choice for those wishing to do everything in their power to avoid or postone surgery would be Dr. Klapper's book, "Heal Your Hips", which is also available from Amazon.co
