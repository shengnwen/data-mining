ERRORS AND OMISSIONS has been promoted as a "gripping legal thriller" but I didn't find it particularly gripping or thrilling. 

I ultimately found this novel to be a rather slow-moving experience.  The main character, middle-aged lawyer Michael Seeley, is not particular likable or well developed.  Despite his enormous financial success, Seeley spends a lot of time in this novel pitying himself and engaging in a variety of self-destructive and unprofessional behavior.   I found him a tough character to root for.

The plot moves slowly and mainly consists of a series of dialogues between Seeley and a host of supporting characters.  Much of this dialogue is stilted and ponderous.  This is the type of book where characters give speeches instead of having real-life conversations.  Some of the subject matter of this novel is interesting, but it is not served well by the dialogue.

I also found the storyline of this novel to be remarkably convoluted and largely rooted in the past.  I was hoping for a more realistic and topical plot, given Goldstein's background as a prominent copyright and IP attorney.  That didn't happen here.  

In short, I found this book rather disappointing.  It's a decently written novel that explores some interesting issues, but the plot and characterization falls short.  I also found the ending rather limp and unsatisfying.

For a debut legal thriller that's much better than this one, I would recommend John Hart's KING OF LIES.
