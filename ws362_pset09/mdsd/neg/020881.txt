I read this book a few years ago, along with another one by the same author, Care of The Soul.  I found his books informative, though difficult to read because of the writing style.  Since, I have read many other books that address the same issues in a much "simpler form."  I noticed that the price for used books is very low, this should tell you most of what you need to know
