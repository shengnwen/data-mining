I usually really like Anne Tyler (and I do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real, but not necessarily likeable) but this was my least favorite book I've read by her.  I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth.  In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing.  To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing.  I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level.  There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one
