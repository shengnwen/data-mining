This can't be Evanovich!  These books stink!  Unfortunately for me, I bought all four of the Full House, Full Tilt, etc.  series all at the same time and have packed them up to give away -- I certainly can't recommend them to anyone I know.  I would like to give this series a "minus" star (negative star?  black hole?), but "1 star" is as low as it goes.  The characters and dialog seem like something a junior high school girl might write for a practice novel and it's something the public should never see.  I LOVE the Stepanie Plum series as well as Evanovich's new book "Metro Girl".  Save yourself some money and time on the Full House series
