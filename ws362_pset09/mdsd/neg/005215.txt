This book is all rant all the time--or maybe book as docudrama is a better description. For somebody who supposedly approaches this with the eye of an investigative reporter, Critser seems surprisingly sloppy at connecting the dots. And though he does a nice job of presenting his more credible material, that's the  very stuff where you feel like saying "I've heard it all before". So it's not like he's breaking any news here.

It's a good read if you check your brains at the door.
