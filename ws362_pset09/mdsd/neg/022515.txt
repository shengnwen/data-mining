The advice offered here will destroy your child's ability to trust you and thus the world around him.  This book is a pitiful excuse for parenting advice.  These methods are for parents who don't want to be bothered with parenting.  Parenting takes work: time, energy, patience, love, and much nurturing.  If you don't want to nurture a baby - then don't have one.  Don't try to make a baby learn to nurture herself - that is your job as a parent.  This book also has terrible views on breastfeeding, parental instincts, working mothers, and natural childbirth.  Please buy instead &quot;Natural Family Living&quot; by Peggy O'Mara. This is a true parenting book
