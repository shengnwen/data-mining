I always buy Lonely Planet guides, but I am returning this one.  I tried to use it to plan my next trip to Paris in two weeks.  It's very frustrating.  The map is difficult to follow, and there is very few hotel information.   It also keeps referring to a map PP396-9 which doesn't exist (Try look up Museum Louve).

It does however has a lot of other cute-but-useless info .. for example .. where a straight guy can get his facial done.  Well, if you are into such things, get this guide.   I am returning mine
