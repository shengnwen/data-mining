In what was billed as a stark challenge to our understanding of Jesus's life and death, as well as the treatment of these subjects by the Church, "The Jesus Papers" falls far short of even the most modest evidentiary standards, relying too much on supposition and speculation.  Thankfully books of this nature need not provide 'lock-solid' proof of their claims to be interesting (or even entertaining) particularly when they are clearly intended to spark debate and confront assumptions which are themselves questionably valid.  While Baigent seemingly writes with this end in mind, he ultimately disappoints providing instead a rambling, meandering summation of his theories that clings (barely) to its narrative structure.  Save yourself the time and money and avoid a book all-too-conveniently produced to coattail off of the release of the blockbuster Da Vinci Code and buy Holy Blood, Holy Grail (by the same author) - a far more persuasive and moving read
