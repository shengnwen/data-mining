I was not impressed with the quality of this book.  The instructions are informative and easy to follow but the headpiece designes are out of date.  The pictures are hand drawn and do not capture the instructions they are depicting.  I have learned about the steps and general techniques of veil making after reading this book. However, I think  color photos and updated designes would be helpful
