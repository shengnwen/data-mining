What I find annoying about Leary's stand-up persona isn't the fact that he  so shamelessly rips  off the work of the late,great Bill Hicks but his  constant use of the term 'Irish Macho Guy' What?I'm Irish and I can say  with some certainty that we are not a nation  of 'macho guys'.At one point  Leary describes his father (an Irish Immigrant) as 'a real World War  II-John Wayne-Ted Williams kinda guy'.Ah, excuse me,Denis,but Ireland was  neutral during World War II.Do you know what that means?That means the  Irish didn't even FIGHT in WWII. Despite this though,there's the odd funny  line but,personally,I preferred Leary's 1997 show 'Lock 'N' Load
