It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book.
This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.

The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.

People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.

I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad
