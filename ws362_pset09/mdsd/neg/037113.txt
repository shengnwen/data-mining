The only positive comment one can make about this sorely disappointing excavation of the Sulzbergers and their newspaper is that it's written in fluid, clear prose.  That's it!  This  is quite surprising given the credentials of these two supposedly fine journalists;  they did a wonderful job excavating another newspaper dynasty -- the Binghams.  But this time, little insight is offered; instead, the reader is loaded down with gratuitious gossip.  Historic and psychological contexts are shabbily rendered.  One can't help but wonder if Mr. Jones, who comes from a newspaper dynasty himself, albeit of a much smaller scale, was not dealing -- negatively dealing -- with his own issues in this book.  The Sulzbergers, particularly, Arthur jr, a brilliant, progressive, and humane publisher, and deserve better
