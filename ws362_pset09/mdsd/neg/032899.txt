Gillon writes with an exciting and entertainly style. I enjoyed reading it, as much as I enjoy someone like Neil Gaiman. Neil writes good fiction and he entertains me. Gillon writes entertaining non-fiction, but it's not representative of most of us.

For someone, like myself, from the boomer generation, the people he selected as examples could not have been more different than me or any of the people my age. One fellow sold a business for $270 million. A woman obtained her PhD. Another woman spearheaded a successful campaign for breast cancer. Another fellow has several successful TV shows. I don't know people like that. I don't drink beer with them. They have success in their lives that only 1 in 10,000 people find, maybe more. They are celebrities.

I couldn't relate to real life people he talked about. Sorry, but I couldn't connect the changes in America with what these 4 people did with their lives either.

The people I know, work, pay their bills, worry about raising their children, and how they will get along after they retire. During the last 30 years, the people Gillon didn't talk about, struggled to get a good education, get a good job, keep the job, and hold their marriage together. They are in debt up to their eyeballs. Gillon's characters were building billion dollar businesses, getting PhD's, meeting the President, or having their TV shows on a national network.

Good for them, I am happy for them, but no one I know has any experience living a charmed life these people have.

I hope Gillon makes lots of money and becomes famous, because that is what he admires.

I hope my family loves me, I set a good example in my neighbor hood, and I can help someone along their way.

Different strokes for different folks, as they say
