Mr. Laqueur fails to adequately distinguish the different types of violence and prefers to lump them all together under the title of terrorism.  Far be  it for me to disagree with the likes of Mr. Cannistraro; but I feel it  necessary to better classify terrorism as being carried out against  individuals or groups not directly associated with the root cause or  disagreement.  The author creates a muddy and very confusing dialog by  placing nearly all violence save that carried out national governments, as  terrorism.  That said, The New Terrorism can provoke serious students to  create and refine their own definitions of terrorism.  I can only recommend  this book to those allready possesing a good grounding in global terrorism,  for it will require the ability to critically analyze what can legitimately  be termed &quot;terrorism&quot;
