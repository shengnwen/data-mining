This was a well written book, and one I might have enjoyed......if I knew I was reading a secular novel.  I thought I was reading christian fiction, and waited thru almost the entire book for the christian message to shine thru.  I realized almost at the end of the book that was not going to happen. I had no reason to expect otherwise, as she has previously written christian fiction and I got it off the christian fiction shelf at the library.  I'm very glad I didn't pay for this book as I wouldn't have received what I thought I was paying for
