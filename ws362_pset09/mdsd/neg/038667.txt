Save yourself the time, money, and paper and simply find a friend who likes to tell their life events in a melodramatic and neurotic way. Listen to that person jab for 5 hours and you've officially read the book! This book asserted my wish to NEVER be a therapist because I would simply tell patients like her as one of her therapist did to kill herself.It's harsh but my goodness after this book I just felt like a leech sucked all the life out of me
