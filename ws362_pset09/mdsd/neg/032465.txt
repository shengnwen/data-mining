If you have read the Hollywood Babylon books, then there is really no need to read this one.  It is a rehash of what was in those books.  

The only reason you might want to read this one is to save yourself reading the other two or maybe you have no clue at all about these scandals and want to catch up.

I found the book hard to follow in general.  Overall I can't tell if this was a repeat by intention or what.  I like John Robert Parish too, so this is no slam on him.  I just don't get the point, but he isn't the first guy to so something over
