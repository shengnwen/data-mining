This is mostly fluff. One hundred and fifty pages of feel good stuff before it gets to a running plan.  I'm really not interested in running while pregnant or choosing the right stroller! Cameo's of runners take up about twenty five percent of the book.  Again there's really no meat on the subject. Maybe it was my mistake thinking there would be more here,it does say BEGINNING, but the book suggests you are an absolute novice to running and maybe life in general.
