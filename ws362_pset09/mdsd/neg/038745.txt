I found the book fairly entertaining to read, and was preparing for adopting a cat myself.  However, once reality set in (i.e., I had a cat living in my house with me), I determined that many of the assumptions he makes about cats and their ability to adapt and respond to human behavior are, at best, only applicable to SOME cats, and, at worst, not really true at all.  Life with cats can be great, but encouraging people to expect them to behave in a more responsive way (like a dog, I guess) is setting people- like me - up for a big disappointment
