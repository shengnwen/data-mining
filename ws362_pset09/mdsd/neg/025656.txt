Please, I beg you, purchase one of her other books!  I have read nearly all of Aiken's works and they are FANTASTIC.  However, this book was very cut-and-dried, dull, and prejudiced.  The characters of the island people were so caricatured that it was borderline offensive.  No child deserves to have to read this book
