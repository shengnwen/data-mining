Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go. 

For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.

It was definitly a waste of money.
