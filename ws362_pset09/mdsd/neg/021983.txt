This is the first time I have written a review.  In this particular case, I felt it was my responsibility to forewarn potential readers of the disturbing contents of this book.  I've read several "self help" books on subjects ranging from introversion to optimistic thinking.  I found this book to be of little help and quite disturbing.  The book is filled with tests and self evaluations.  I do not believe it is necessary to know where one falls on the optimist/pessimist scale.  Often, such tests can only further depress or make anxious an already vulnerable reader.  In Chapter 5, the author uses an extremely horrific and disturbing story to illustrate a five step process to forgiveness.  I was further sickened by the author's list of "bodily pleasures" in Chapter 7.  Rather than feeling uplifted by this book, I found myself feeling upset and outraged by the author's egotism, ignorance, perversion and insensitivity.  I caution anyone seeking advice on optimism
