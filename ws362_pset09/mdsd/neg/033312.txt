The book is set up well with questions to help guide your reading at the beggining of each chapter.  I agree with other posts, that the author doesn;t deal well with the origin of evil. What most concerned me was his compromise of creationism.  He assumes that teh geologic data is correct and therefore wants to make the infallible scripture conform to infallible science, which has changed numerous times over the past several years.  I would not recommend this book at all and would recommend Lectures in Systematic Theology by Theissen instead.  It is an older book but much more reliable.
