The reading was okay, but there wasn't much meat to it. Each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story. Only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located. One of the most interesting pages told about how Disney bought up all of the FL property using fictitious companies. For the price, I was disappointed as most of it is not notable. If you're a Disney buff, get this from the library and save the $$$ - you can read it in a 1/2 hr sitting
