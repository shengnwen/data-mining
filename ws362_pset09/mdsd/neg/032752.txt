The monologues are intended to be delivered to a live audience. A book simply cannot give the same experience of support and shared understanding. The monologues are a series of snippets intended to raise issues of female anatomy, sexuality, and violence against women. Though ranging from humorous to disconcerting, the monologues are ultimately unsatisfying.

The author, previously a lawyer, seems to think that knowledge of vaginas is a suppressed topic, which has wide consequences. To get past inhibitions, the monologues encourage self-examination and considering what a vagina would wear, say, and smell like. She includes several sexual episodes in which attention to vaginas seems to be emphasized. The monologues on female genital mutilation and ethnic rape are disturbing. 

It's really pretty difficult to take this book seriously. One minute one is reading about clothing for a vagina, and the consequences of ethnic rape the next. One topic is silly; the other screams for thorough treatment. It is highly debatable that the topic of vaginal ignorance will lead to understanding social and political systems that permit violence against women.

There is no attempt to address the overall state of sexual knowledge and sexual social conventions in the greater society. If vaginal ignorance is an issue, it can only be the tip of the iceberg. 

A person would have to be awfully suppressed or ignorant to be unaware of the factual information in the book. The humor is insufficient to carry the book. The monologues are so brief that the book is filled by an exaggerated forward which discusses the importance of vaginas in history and by a call for participation on college campuses of V-Day, celebrations based on the monologues. This book will appeal to the faithful, and few others.
