I have the 1995 British edition of this book - same cover, same authors, presumably the same text inside, but with the title "Postmodernism for Beginners". I think that title falls foul of the U.K's Trade Description Act, but so, I think, does the present one. I know a little about Postmodernism from a much better short book (Christopher Butler's "Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction", Oxford 2002), and I found particularly the first half of the Appignanesi book absolutely impenetrable. That first half, unlike Butler's, includes Structuralism in Postmodernism; but on Structuralism you would do much better to read John Sturrock's short "Structuralism" (Paladin), which is much more lucid and accessible, even if it doesn't have pictures in it! The second half of the Appignanesi book does at least have some suggestive ideas about the contemporary world.
