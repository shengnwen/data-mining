This little book is really a "coffee table" book for those who enjoy these kinds of compilations, but don't expect much from this one.   Each page has a very short line about "why a daughter needs a mom..." i.e., "to read to her," "who can play on her level," "to listen closely to what troubles her," etc. etc.   

I found nothing overly moving or memorable here, in fact, the black and white photographs accompanying each of the 100 Reasons do nothing to bring these pages to life.  Most photos are clearly contrived portraits of "everyday-type" models posing to reflect the sentiment on the page.   None of them look spontaneously photographed to capture a feeling or a moment.

I'm assuming that the author, Gregory E. Lang, aimed at tearing at the heartstrings, but I'm not so sure it was accomplished here in that you'll find very little originality and even less to keep you turning the pages to read more.  By the time I got to Reason #100 (...because without her she will have less in her life than she deserves) we are pretty much bored and will think twice before giving this book as a gift.  

I'm both a mom AND a daughter, and I normally love these kinds of books, dedicated to capturing the feelings and sentiments behind family bonds, but this one just doesn't hit the mark.  Save your $
