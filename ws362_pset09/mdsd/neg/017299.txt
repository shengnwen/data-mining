I LOVED The Inferno, so I approached this book with the enthusiasm of a gourmand at an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Sadly, the bread turned out to be stale, the steak overdone and the desserts moldy. Okay. Now that I've run that metaphor into the ground, let's talk about Vita Nuova.  I found it to be pretty darn tedious and highly melodramatic.  The prose is self-indulgent and dry; the poetry, while slightly better, falls into the same camp.  You just want to say to the guy--get a life!  At several points during the book, Dante's fellow townspeople mock him because of his constant waterworks and woe-is-me-ing. I sympathized with them, found myself laughing at this whiny, timid little man.  Dante, as he portrays himself in this book, is a bore, a sniveling, spoiled child.
