I bought this book with the hope to find the 'perfect' plan for every competition need. Actually you can choose among some plans but you must be lucky to find those appropriate for you. It does not provide a way to build your custom plan. If a personalized training plan is your primary need (... as it should), it's better to rely on books as Friel's Triathlon Training Bible
