If I ever make it through the second half I might take one back.  I thought of "Bill Maher" when I read the title.  I thought this would be a funny read not a religious one.  Luckily you are not buying in haste and have the foresight to read reviews.

If you are a Christian and hate Evolution, or any other part of science that contradicts your religion, this will be an enjoyable read.  I just could not find this person nor some of his sources credible.  A lovely twisting of facts.  

Enjoy
