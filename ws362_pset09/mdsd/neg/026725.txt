It is not so much that I did not think the plot plausable, but the characterizations are untrue to the original book.  I feel not enough time and care was taken to move the plot within the parameters of the characters as set by JA.  Miss Darcy, although entertaining, becomes a pale shade of Elizabeth Bennett.  Lady Catherine becomes flaccidly comic (has she become a vicar or even transposed with Mr Collins?)  It pains me also to see the most interesting and engaging characters of Elizabeth and Darcy pushed so far into the background.  I also take issue with the use of Lizzy and Fitzwilliam as the familiar names the couple uses when refering to each other.  I am almost certain that Elizabeth would always be Elizabeth in Darcy's eyes and that none of the characters in P&amp;P would have used anything but Darcy's surname.  All of this censure aside, it was a good attempt.  I thought the phrasing and meter of the work to pay homage to Austen.  I also admire the care taken in research of the subject matter and time period.  I would recommend this book as what it is aptly titled &quot;:An Entertainment&quot;
