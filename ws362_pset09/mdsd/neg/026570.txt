This book was mediocre. The stories are not really atypical for anyone in the medical field. To write a good medical book, someone needs to have had an amazing career, really love medicine, have spent time in an obscure field, have an innovative spin, or be an excellent writer. Unfortunately, Vertosick brought none of these to this book. 

His stories were not really unusual or atypical - they were things you can find in any field of medicine (the pregnant woman who refuses treatment even though she will die, the abandoned baby in the hospital, etc.). The writing was weak - it didn't feel like someone who especially enjoyed writing or had a knack for it. Sometimes it felt like emotional manipulation - bad writing pulling out all the tearjerker stops.

He also seems to have a blind spot to his own ego; all docs have huge egos, and need to be a little bit self-mocking about it, which he is not. (Repeated many times: "If it was easy, anyone would do it.")

The most interesting part might be for someone to see behind the scenes how people are chosen for medical fields - in his case, a fluke landed him in neurosurgery, and how they train. 

That said, there were a few funny stories - like the guy who carved "You suck" to another resident on a skull, which of course later had to be reopened and everyone found out. Funny story, which anyone who has ever worked in a hospital can believe, yet it was hard for me to believe that this didn't result in an expulsion from a program. 

Vertosick probably would have had a much better book by bringing his stories to a ghostwriter. He tried to walk the line between the harsh, sarcastic, yet funny medical memoir and the sensitive, isn't-this-amazing kind, missing both. There's tons of good medical writing out there - skip this one. Try David Delvin's It's a Doc's Life instead - that's where Vertosick was aiming
