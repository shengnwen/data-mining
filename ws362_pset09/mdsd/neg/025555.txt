Big Waste of Time pretty much sums up "The Torn Skirt".  With such a nifty title and comparisons to Blake Nelson's "Girl" I thought I was in for a real treat reading this book. It has nothing to do with a "coming of age" story since it takes place of the course of about, a week.  Sarah goes from sort burn out loser to complete wacko street crack-whore in the space of three days.  She seems to be having a midlife crisis brought about by the guilt of not doing anythng to comfort a friend who was sexually assaulted and the fear of graduating from high school and an official Loser.  
While yes, it's touching that she cares about her father, misses her kooky mother and feels...something for these runaway prostitute street children, the book is too poorly written to ever get a feel for the character's motivations, thoughts or feelings.  It doesn't really feel like it is written by a teenage girl, troubled or otherwise.
I was glad when it ended and while I appreciated that the author didn't give us a neat and tidy ending, I could not have cared less what happened to Sarah, I was just relieved the book had ended.  That's rare for me.  Maybe you just have to be high to get this book.
