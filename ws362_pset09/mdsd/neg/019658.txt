As I am not referenced in the book, do not have the same surname as the author and did not contribute to the work, I am less impressed with 'Crossroads' than the other reviewers.

In complete agreement with the sentiment that there is little quality information on Hecate, I purchased this book before it was reviewed, but would not recommend anyone else to do the same. 

It gave a muddled account of the known history of this dark goddess, confusing speculation with fact and giving no information I had not discovered elsewhere. Confusing witchcraft with wicca and christian concepts, the ceremonial focus of the rituals dedicated to Hecate AND Hermes and the contradictions inherent in the work left me disappointed.

The second chapter on how certain individuals had discovered Hecate was interesting but not enough to justify the cost of the book.

Grammatical errors, sweeping generalisations and narrow referencing did little to improve my opinion. I found the book to be well-intentioned, but at times slightly confused.

There are some great websites out there giving you the same information and additional background (e.g. Hecate's Cauldron) for those with an interest in witchcraft rather than wicca. Unfortunately, instead of expanding my knowledge on the subject, this book left me with nothing but a feeling I had wasted my money
