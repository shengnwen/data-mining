This has got to be the worst autobiography that I have ever read.  He makes excuse after excuse about why he couldn't perform up to his capabilities.  He blames his managers, the front office, and of course his injuries for his lack of production.  What a waste of paper!  He ends the book by acting as if he's going to produce big time for the St. Louis Cardinals after he signs with them to close out the book.  Well, he spent 2 seasons in St. Louis and didn't do much.  I bet he's got an excuse for that also.  Maybe it was Tony LaRussa's fault?  I think he's courageous for battling cancer, but his excuses get old after you read one excuse after another
