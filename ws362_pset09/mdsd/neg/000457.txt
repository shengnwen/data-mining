What a great way to sell books! Tell the people what they want to hear. 

Do not mistake this book for a dispassionate science book. This is a political book, masquerading as science. If you read this and you find yourself agreeing and feeling strongly, ask yourself why. The answer is probably that you are looking for a rationalization of what you already believe.

This is science like prostitution is love. It may be a feel-good facsimile, but it isn't the real thing. And turning to politically motivated science cheapens the politics as well as the science.

I think the most breathtaking aspect of this work is the colossal hypocrisy employed here. Micheals and Balling decry the distortions of the left-wing environmentalist nutballs and play up the limitations of environmental science while using the same tactics. If the premise of this book is accurate, that science is used by idealogues to distort the truth and promote their political philosophy, well, what can we make of this book? Does the politics lead or the science? 

I would suggest that you look into the history of the authors to determine whether they are capable of non-political dispassionate scientific inquiry. I have looked, and guess what? It isn't love, its prostitution
