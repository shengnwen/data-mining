Dr. Canfield's bookcover proclaims that The 7 Secrets of Effective Fathers is "solid scientific research," but as an empirical work it is lacking.  

First, Ken Canfield can hardly be called a rigorous researcher, having been published only twice in peer-reviewed journals.  Both of his published articles were published in the early 1990s.  To his credit, both of his articles were published in reputable, scientific journals (a quick search of EBSCO HOST research databases reveals zero entries for Dr. Phil McGraw).

Second, Dr. Canfield bases his findings in The 7 Secrets of Effective Fathers on the results of data obtained through his measurement scale, the Personal Fathering Profile (PFP).  

The PFP does demonstrate satifactory INTERNAL reliability, meaning that the PFP does not contradict itself.  However there is no indication by Dr. Canfield that the PFP demonstrates external reliability, meaning that test results are consistent over time and setting.  

Also, the PFP is not noted in Dr. Canfield's book as demonstrating validity, a psychometric term connotating the degree to which the questionaire actually measures what it is supposed to measure.  

The PFP uses the opinions of "helping professionals" as a basis for determining which fathers are "effective fathers."  It may have been more accurate to determine fathers' "effectiveness" by measuring the levels of their children's success, health and happiness instead of using subjective opinions.

Finally, the PFP's participant sample consisted of fathers that are 87% white and 73% college educated with an average income of $49,000.00 (in 1994).  Dr. Canfield admits that these numbers are skewed towards a higher than typical socio-economic-status.

With this said, Dr. Canfield's book may be helpful to fathers seeking direction and affirmation in their parenting.  However it is unreasonable to assume that the statements in the book reflect scientific fact as much as Dr. Canfield's opinions and experiences
