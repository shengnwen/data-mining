The book gives you a nice overview of the atmosphere etc. that makes it a fun read as you anticipate the trip.  However the maps that I tried to use in Rome, were off by a few blocks each time - only a problem when you didn't have another source of information. This is a book that I'd suggest as your 3rd or 4th one to get - not the first one
