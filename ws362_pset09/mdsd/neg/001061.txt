I have had this book for many years, and never actually found any useful information, not one time. Granted, there is a lot of material in there, but there isn't enough space to properly cover any individual topic (it doesn't even have enough tables, or quick-reference data), so the user would do well to look for the info elsewhere (in a proper book).
As a general rule, I now stay away from all of Mr. Whitaker's "books", he seems to have better editorial skills than technical ones, and he always manages to get a lot of garbage published (with catchy titles). Speaking of garbage, a couple of weeks ago I took this (heavy) book to its final resting place (the dumpster), I did not even want to sell it. I don't mean to be vicious, I have seen the good reviews, but I don't think they are warranted
