The characters and the story are shallow, totally lacking in depth. The writer seems to free associate and wanders from page to page. It was like reading a comic book plot or worse.I read books for my teens before they read them. This book was a huge disappointment. It is not appropriate in other ways either. I do not recommend it at all.
