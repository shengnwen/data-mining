Joan Grant's historical fantasy novels were based on her personal imaginings, which may have included vague recollections of former lives assuming reincarnation is a fact. Miss Grant apparently believed these mental impressions to be 100% accurate. As such, the books were poorly researched, and presented the cultures of ancient Egypt, pre-Columbian America, and ancient Greece and Rome with an overlay of the mores and ethics of her own middle-class England.

No such period as she describes existed in Ancient Egypt. The primary god was Amen-Ra, the creator of all things. Set was the villain of the Osiris story. Osiris was a fertility god and a relatively minor one at that. He only became important when somebody died. (A search on "Kemetic Orthodoxy" might be helpful for more detail.) If I remember right, Egypt was seriously threatened by civil war only at the end of the reign of Akhenaten, whose obsession with destroying the existing religious system and setting up Aten as the "One God" had more in common with Islamic extremism than it did with any sort of proto-Christianity, although it's constantly mistaken for same. The Egyptians did believe in life after death, with many rituals for ensuring a safe trip to the next world. That reincarnation was also a part of the established religion has not been documented through perusal of the literature available to us currently. Until said literature is discovered, an elaborate, New Age-like Egyptian belief in reincarnation remains a Victorian romantic fantasy.

Save your money. The works of Mary Renault (who also suspected she'd lived previous lifetimes in ancient Greece) are more grounded in reality and better written overall
