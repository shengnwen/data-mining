I started this book the same way I started almost every Marquez book in the past - expecting to be mesmerized and taken away for a while from my world to one of the magical-real worlds of Marquez. The first few tens of pages of this book took off the way those in any other Marquez book do: slowly, but promisingly creating a solid loom to weave a tale on. And then the next tens of pages continued in the same vein, as did the next few chapters, and so on and so forth. 

Actually, to be fair, at least a part of the problem could be with my expectations. I was expecting another stunning piece of writing, even if it was a recount of reality. But then, how many readers of Marquez would hold that against me and expect differently of him? After all, his books have been as much about his writing style as they have been about his vivid imagination, haven't they? So that's primarily what I felt let down about in this book - the book just fails to grip. Marquez's writing seems weak like never before (except for the odd brilliant phrase here and there), and there aren't enough interesting tales to tell anyway. The book never moves beyond the context-setting; there is almost no dramatic arc, and; there is hardly any climatic resolution. 

To summarize quickly then, I would recommend this book to very die-hard Marquez fans only. The only real value of this book lies in helping Marquez's readers undestand how he came to be the writer he did. If you are prepared to go through 500 pages of tedium for that, go for it.
