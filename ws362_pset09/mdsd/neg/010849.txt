As a longtime Patriots fan living outside of New England, I was hoping that this book would provide me with inside information that I was missing out on without the local media focus. It was inspiring reliving the first Super Bowl victory over St. Louis, but overall it was dissapointing. There were a lot of interesting specific antecdotes (most notably the Tom Jackson exchange), but nothing that really surprised me and no real in-depth analysis of their winning ways.

The structure and grammar of the book are also quite poor. Although the book was short, it was not that easy to read as I had to continuously re-read passages to understand who the author was talking about or when the event was occuring
