I started the book with great expectations and it continued to disappoint.  I never got the point - mildly humurous but not really very interesting at all. After reading &quot;A Good Walk Spoiled&quot; and &quot;My Usual Game&quot; I was probably looking for more than Jenkins could deliver with this wandering tale of a year on the tour.  His history of the golf architects and courses was the most interesting part of the book.  I couldn't wait for the season to end
