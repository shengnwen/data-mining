I agree with some other reviewers that this is a book for day dreamers. It does not claim to be a guide to tropical garden design and it certainly is not in that category. It is a nice book with many nice early morning photographs of selected beautiful tropical gardens, mostly in Bali. It is a sharing of Michael White's philosophy of garden design oriented around controlled jungles (with high labor input in maintenance) rather than on "how to do it".It is also a fitting reminder and proof that one does not need a university degree to be successful at one's chosen profession.
