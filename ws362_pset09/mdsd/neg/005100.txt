I've read a lot of Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme novels and like them and I thought The Devil's Teardrop which had a different protagonist was excellent.  So when I saw this one in the bookstore, I snapped it up.  Big waste of money!  I couldn't even finish the book, and that is not something that I do very often.  At the very beginning I didn't like the main character at all because he didn't seem the least bit sympathetic to me, although I realize that's simply a matter of personal taste and not something that you can give a bad review for.  More serious was the total "no thought" stereotyping of "bad cops" and local townspeople.  Still not enough to deep eighty-six it, but it was starting to get there at that point.  No, the thing that made me toss this book is that while it is supposed to take place in upstate rural New York, Deaver tried to write this using colloquial English.  Not a problem if he'd used the colloquial speech for the area.  He didn't.  He used the speech of rural areas of Virginia and other areas to the south of NYS.  As a life long resident of upstate rural NY, I felt it insulting to get something that basic wrong and it opened up the whole suspician that nothing else in the book could be right, either, if that's the amount of research he put into it.  It's incredibly lazy writing, and I don't have time to read poor writing.  Too many other really good books out there to waste on a disaster like this one.  Save your money and pass it by, or at least get it used if you feel you must read it.
