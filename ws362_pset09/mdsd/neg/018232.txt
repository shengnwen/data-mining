I am a stress management instructor looking for some new ideas. I teach quick-fix techniques for people to calm themselves during their busy lives, and so this book attracted me. This book however is a jokey book, with one line per two pages, so you can read the entire thing in 2 minutes. It gives you ideas to distract yourself for a minute from what ever is causing your stressful reactions, like make a paper airplane and send it across the room, or name as many teams you can in a sport. Childish ideas if you want to have a bit of a laugh, but if you are actually looking for something to deal with serious stress overload this is not the book for you
