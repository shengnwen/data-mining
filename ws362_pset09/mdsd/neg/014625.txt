I was hoping for an accessible, easily understood explanation of the Buddhist take on the meaning of life.  Instead I first got a very complex analysis of Buddhism which did not adequately prepare me for the transcibed speeches of the Dalia Lama which followed.  Maybe I'm not smart enough to grasp Buddhism.  It certainly seems like this tape was not produced for the novice but for the more advanced student of Buddhism. If so, the tape cover did not warn me of that
