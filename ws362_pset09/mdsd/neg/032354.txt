First off, let me point out that I have high standards when it comes to pagan books.  I expect for my faith to be presented to the general public as something that should be taken seriously, not poked fun at.  I realize that these may be high expectations, but nonetheless...  The first chapter was funny to me because although I could understand where Dorothy was coming from in her explanation of the history of how Yule came to be I could almost hear the right-wing Christians raging on their pews.  It was the way she explained it that seemed a bit of a stretch.  On the other hand, I liked the way she presented the symbols of the season and where they originated.  There were some good prayers.  Also helpful to me were the recipes for the Yule Log Rolls and how to make a real Yule Log.  Other than that I decided against purchasing this book.  I'm hoping to find a concise book on Yule that digs deeper into the history and gives me a clearer picture of how people practiced Yule.  (A NOTE TO EDITORS:  If you are expecting to sell more pagan themed books of this kind, you need to start including full-color photos.  If I am going to pay money for a book like this I want to see photos that go along with the recipes-what would a typical Yule table from 2006 look like for example?- and photos that go along with the craft projects.  You cannot expect people to try the craft projects without knowing what they will look like.)  This book is helpful for beginner pagans or nonpagans who just want a look at some fun history facts
