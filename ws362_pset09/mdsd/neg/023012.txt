I bought this book after enjoying Chuck Klosterman's Fargo Rock City.  The concept of the book (taking a long road trip to locations of rock and roll deaths) is excellent and if executed correctly would have been great book.  I expected insights into the deaths and the locations that could only be found by exploring them up close and in depth, which is something most of us will not have the opportunity to do.  Instead, Chuck Klosterman has a road trip where he waxes about his many dysfunctional relationships with women in between destinations.  There are a few spots of humor and insight, but not enough to overcome the off subject exposition.  The best analogy I can come up with would be buying a cookbook, and then having the author devote the majority of the book to what kind of car he drives to the grocery store
