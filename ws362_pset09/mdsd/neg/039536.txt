First of all I want everyone to notice that this is only VOLUME 2.  Volume one is no longer available anywhere.  Thus, making this book fairly useless.  The only thing that it's really good at it showing different stiles between professional comic book inkers.  It nice to page through and I don't regret buyin it but it is not necessary for an artist's library
