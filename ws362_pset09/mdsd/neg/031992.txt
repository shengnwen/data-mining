I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots
