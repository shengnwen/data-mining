I was prompted to read this book (and many others by the author) by an Amazon.com reviewer of Norman Mailer's 'The Naked and the Dead.'  The reviewer completely trashed the Mailer World War II book, which I always believed was as good a war novel that had ever been written.  The 'Naked and the Dead' was a groundbreaker in many ways, and set the tone for his great literary career that has ultimately had some ups and admittable downs.  The reviewer said that if I want to see some 'real writing', to read John Dos Passos.

So in a way, this is more for the reviewer than anyone else.  Even with all the interesting bells and whistles (the use of newsreels in the form of verse and even bleeping out his own cursewords, s______t or f________g, gee what are we three years old now!), '1919' is an outright snorefest.  I challenge you to get past the first twnty pages without hitting your head as you fall down in despairing boredom.  Please, do all of yourselves a favor and stick with the real deal, Norman Mailer
