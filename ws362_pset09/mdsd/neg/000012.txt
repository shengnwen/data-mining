Before you claim that you really know about something; make sure that you have "been there; and done that". What do you know about Vietnamese to make such claims like: "Vietnam is very much insignificant in history and to the world". You probably think the same about all other countries except that country of yours. I will make a wild guess now: "Either you are a sore loser Chinese; American; a Vietnamese hater; or all". We have our own language (Try to do some research on that, moron). What do you speak ? Did you really create your own language to look down on other people? Try not to read anything. Because books obviously didn't do you any good. What you need the most right now is dignity . Try to get some of that, uh ? 

You've all come and gone 
We still stay strong 
We are Vietnamese
