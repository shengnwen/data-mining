I tried to look at this book with an open mind, but that was impossible.  If you want to convince someone to believe something, you need better people to quote than notorious liars; michael moore and al franken.  This book spews nothing but hated filled vomit and I don't reccomend it for anyone.  If you accept everything the Looney Left tells you without questioning anything, then by all means waste your money.  If you have a brain and think for yourself and don't buy into all the crap from these incredibly radical communists, keep your money and stay far away from this book.  People should have to do with their time than to just make money off hatred.
