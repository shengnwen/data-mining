Poorly written, numerous typos, and the content wasn't much better. Most of it was irrelevant to today's military spouse.
Written solely from the perspective of an insulated navy spouse, who has not had to deal with a deployment.
Advice was out of date at best, and downright wrong more often than not.
Seemed like a blatant advertisement for her website. 
Do not buy this book, there are many many much better resources out there for the new military spouse
