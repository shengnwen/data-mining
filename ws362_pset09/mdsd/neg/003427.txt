I anticipated more of this book just from the reviews, but I guess I was wrong. I gave it a chance and kept reading thinking it would get better as it progresses but it didn't. i stopped halfway through when I realized that I'm only torturing my self, I could've read about quantum physics and it would've been more entertaining. I did not see the humor or the point of this book
