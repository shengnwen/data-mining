This book is junk. 

Now this is as blanket-ish and opinionated a statement as the content of this book generally is. 

I was looking to learn more about finishing and I thought that a book with that kind of title would be the one for me. Instead, it should be called "my point of view on finishing". The author just spends pages explaining how every other woodworker (people who actually make furniture) is absolutely wrong, going as far as mostly saying that woodworkers who write books have been spreading lies (talk about sawing the plank you're standing on...). 

This book is just a piece of opinion and certainly not what someone looking for an objective guide needs. The author also contradicts himself several times such as saying that woodworkers of old didn't favor linseed oil (offering, as a proof, that it is not mentioned in accounting records.........) to then say, several chapters later, that it is what they often used. I believe that it is at that point that I decided to be done with the whole book, and I''d take it back if I had bought it locally.

Also, it is clear that the author cares only about the finish, and not the crafted piece of furniture that iit is applied to. Read only if you share the author's point of view that the only worthwhile finishes are lackers and such things that woodworking and craftsmen all over the world would say create a plastic and fake looking result, or if your only goal is to make the wood look like a mirror.

There are many other authors that touch on finishing in their woodworking books and speak more of their experience than their opinion or prejudice, and are a much better read. This is so opinionated and biased that is has no credibility in my mind.

Don't waste your money on this
