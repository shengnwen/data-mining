Despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site, this is not a well written book.  I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.

In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.

I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so.  This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined.  Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts.  Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired
