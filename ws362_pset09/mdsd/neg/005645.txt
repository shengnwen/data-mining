Great cover, enticing premise. I couldn't wait to read this book...BUT... Every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly. Let me add a couple more. Frannie grows up, decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she's going to do. What does her mother say? That's nice, dear. I trust you to make the right decision. Oh please!!! This is the 19th century after all! Then for good measure let's throw this one into the mix. After the indomitable Una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person, famous or not, that she comes into contact with...she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole. An oil well! You must be kidding! Of course, she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch.

I could go on and on. I finished every page of this book although I must say I skimmed through the last 100 pages. When I finished and my husband asked how it was, the only way I could think to describe it was SILLY
