Any sound psychologist would want to "shape" the lives of girls
as well as boys,to shape them into adults,but this writer wants
us to see girls and women as eternal children,who need over 
protection,never need to face real challenges,or real life.
He doesn't seem to realize many girls need coraling in not only 
boys.Instead he sets up a system where expectations are low for 
girls,so parents might put less effort into a girl's education,
aspirations and talents.Speaking of talents,he believes females
and males have very distinct differences in the talent pool.
Males analyical,females emotional intellence and verbal.
How can a parent help their girl along if they believe she doesn't or shouldn't excell in hard science and maths.
His obvious mysogamy is only too noticable,he doesn't want girls
to excell or even try their hand in areas he feels are more 
easily understood by boys.
I have never read such a harmful book in my life.This psychobable will only prove how he is determined to work against
females and trap them in small areas of achievement.
Poor book,poorly written,works off of spotty brain research and
sterotypes
