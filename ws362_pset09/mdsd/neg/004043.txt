I am all in favor of a simple, clutter free and low maintenance house, but really!  This book should have a subtitle, &quot;How to build a sterile, ugly house&quot;  or perhaps, &quot;How to make your house even less appealing than a hospital waiting room.&quot;  This book with tell you how to avoid any and all dust traps, like comfy furniture, artwork, or architectural features.  It's great if you want your living room to look like the set of Star Trek, but not so great if you want you home to be . . . well . . .a HOME
