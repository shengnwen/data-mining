I hope no one spends money on this useless rant. Any sane person is left wondering what the hell this author DOES like? I agree that bad sitcoms and People magazine are trashy, but this guy knocks everything! He seems to speak against British pretentiousness, but enjoys sabbaticals in pricey London. He was well-off enough to attend posh universities, all the while knocking the lower-priced ones. He slams the lower and middle classes, while pretending to be &quot;above classism.&quot; Not a page goes by where he doesn't insult Reagan. This snob even hates graduation ceremonies, university logos, the flag, and the bicentennial back in '76. The piece de resistance (he DOES love French snobbery) is when he blames the US Navy for Lockerbie. What DOES this clown like? Oh, check out the photo in back. Aren't ugly toupees and shoes without socks BAD
