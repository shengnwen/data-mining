I would rather not even give this one star.  Forms of Mental illness do exist.  Medications are as helpful as psychotherapy.  There are thousands of independent research papers showing evidence for this.  Is it really that difficult to believe if the human body can be ill regardless of diet, excercise, or living healthy (i.e IDDM, Retinoblastoma in children, rheumatoid arthritis, etc) that the human mind could also be predisposed to illness regardless of our life style.  For instance we have established that individuals with two short alleles for the serotonin transporter gene are much more likely to become depressed under stress than someone who is homozygous for the long allele.  Glasser is old, out there, and misinformed.  Any one who has sit for any time with a schizophrenic or manic patient can tell you that the illness is not by choice.  Individuals like Glasser (add Tom Cruise/ scientologists) use their title and status to undermine scientific evidence, therefore interfering with potential successful treatment of psychiatric illness in people who would maximally benefit.  Because of the reviews and content of this book, I no longer care to read Glasser's book on choice theory--he obviously has discredited psychiatry's utility to pad his own pocket book.  This book is at the expense of patients I see who ARE actually suffering brain damage due to untreated mental illness (schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder), because they read misguided authors such as Dr. Glasser.
