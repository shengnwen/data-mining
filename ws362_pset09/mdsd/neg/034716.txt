I found this book to be quite interesting and insightful. However, I was turned off initially by the assumption by the author that the readers of her book were &quot;European American&quot;, which I am not.  Throughout  the book she wrote about how European American women might relate to and  view Kwan-Yin, seeming to forget that other non-European women are both  literate and spiritual and may have an interest in and reverence for Kwan  Yin
