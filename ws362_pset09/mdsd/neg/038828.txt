I started reading this book and only read about a quarter of it before I finally threw it down in disgust. Be different but not too different, you wouldn't want to stand out. Be sexy, but not to sexy, you wouldn't want people to think your sleeping with the boss. It's ok to carry last season's handbag. Honestly this book drove me nuts. It constantly states things and then takes it back. I ended up giving my copy away to a friend who is going into a business career. This book would probably be great for a Cosmopolitan reading, big city girl. I picture a girl like Jessica Simpson loving this book
