I thought the book would have been more detailed. There are very beautiful pictures in it but as for the theory there's almost nothing. I would have liked more specific information about visual merchandising: for example how to create  good window cases or in store displays. Also a defined visual merchandising strategy could have been mentioned. 

Overall, I'm a quite disappointed with the book.
