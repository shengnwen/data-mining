I was excited to start reading this book when I saw it in the bookstore; however, my excitement quickly turned to boredom as I struggled to finish this tale. One of the comments on the cover of the paperback claimed it was Amazing Race meets Raiders of the Lost Ark or something like that. It was neither. I was hoping for a fast paced, traveling adventure all over the globe, as the descriptions lead me to believe - but it wasn't. I was hoping for exciting tomb adventures with traps and puzzles and such.

Once we take away all the excitement and adventures what do we have left? "The Codex." This story is a tale of stereotypical brothers who are not even well crafted characters for their stereotyped personalities. I guess it can be hard to create original characters from completely unoriginal molds. A failed love story, unbelievable character interactions, and the longest (and most uneventful) jungle adventure ever! I cannot count how many times the characters were turning back and heading for home, or talking endlessly about a panther attack that was going to happen in a few chapters, or the relative lack of adventure throughout this harrowing land of Hondurus. Besides a couple of lame actions sequences randomly thrown in, this book had nothing on the "Raiders of the lost Ark." Didn't even come close.

With a somewhat interesting premise this book had a lot of potential. However, to me it was dissappointing in all aspects because the story was forced along at a insanely slow pace. I could see a book like this being 300 pages or 350, but 400?! I love longer books, but only if they need to be long. I can't even remember what made this book so long, it must have been the endless mumbling about the travel in the swamps and the jungle.

My advice? Skip this one
