I think the hallmark of good design is the ability to maintain that integrity while also moving with some elements of style from the period in which you actually live.  I guess the title really means "CLASSIC interiors;" the book shows how to create interiors that would have looked appropriate in 1763.  Today, a number of the interiors come across as dark, overwhelming and provincial.  The photographs viewable on Amazon are misleading because the interiors pictured are more simple, more modern, and brighter than most of those photographed in the book.  I would take a long look at it in-store before investing if you prefer simple, classic design to stringently historical interiors.  (Also, as an aside, the book seems to utilize an older understanding of acceptable paint colors for colonials-- darker, duller colors.  Others, such as Martha Stewart's books, proclaim that newer research shows that slightly brighter shades were actually used more often than previously believed.
