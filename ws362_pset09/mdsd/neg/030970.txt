I'm still in the middle of this book.  The subject matter is interesting, but it skims over the tales too quickly (e.g., how and when were Rackham et al captured?).  Druett also jumps around too much - mixing the tales of more than one woman who were unrelated in terms of place and time.

In addition, the book really bothered me for its lack of quality research.  The author relied too much upon myths and stereotypes to embellish her story.  In particular, the chapter about the Vikings contained a lot of misinformation, most from romanticized tales from the Victorian era.  A 30-second web search would have told her that the Vikings didn't wear horned helmets, that they ate a lot more than plain, boiled meat (as traders and farmers, they had access to a variety of fruit, vegetables, herbs, and spices), etc.  They were a lot more sophisticated than Druett made out. 

It's fine as light reading and a quick overview of the topic, but the devil's in the details
