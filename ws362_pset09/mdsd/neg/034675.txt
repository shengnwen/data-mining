While this book contains some interesting information about Allen and his pioneering television work, it is mostly a mish-mash of stories that are not written particularly well. And I must admit that when I read one particular anecdote -- about Mrs. Sam Snead's inadvertent double entendre to Allen during a broadcast -- I began to wonder just how inaccurate the book might be. The story has also been told about Mrs. Arnold Palmer and Johnny Carson, and the urban legends web site Snopes.com says that it's not a true story. If the author of this book included urban legends, one wonders just what parts of the book are true and what parts are made up
