Readers with previous experience with Ornstein's books may find The Right Mind the most interesting he's written. The view of brain through psychology offers a different approach about brain functions. For Beginners, this book may be quite useful. Though I read other book from  Ornestein, I was expecting to find deep research on brain assymetry, which  this book is poor, there's nothing you can't find over Internet on related  sites. For intermeddiate readers on brain issue, this book may offer some  interesting approaches, but too hard to get them between 200 pages.  Instead, I would reccomend Carl Sagan's &quot;Dragons of Eden&quot;, a  marvelous and interesting book about brain development. Advanced readers  won't like Ornstein for explaing brain lateralization, and a more  appropriate book would be &quot;Left brain, Right Brain&quot;, the only  serious book written on this subject. Conclusion: Ornstein book is not that  bad at all. If you like Oliver Sacks and psychological views of brain, this  is indeed a good choice. Wrong Title though, coz it doesn't have much about  brain lateralization itself (by the way, the book enphasizes the importance  of both hemispheres working together - which is quite obvious when you want  a scientific approach - but many people forget on daily life)
