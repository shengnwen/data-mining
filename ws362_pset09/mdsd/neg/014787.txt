I had a chance to look this book over, and don't understand what all the fuss is about. There is nothing new here, from cleaning to menu planning, to relationships that hasn't been said better in other books, or even free online, and this book is double-spaced type throughout, so you go through more pages than you should have to finding this out. I hate it when book publishers waste paper like this.

The most annoying part of the book is the constant (every other day's entry) exhortation to go buy the companion workbook to get all the worksheets. If she had printed it in an 8 1/2 by 11" format, AND included the worksheets as templates, it 
would be worth the price new, as it is, in a smaller size, hold off and buy it used
