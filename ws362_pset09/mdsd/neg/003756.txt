This book had quite a number of scholarships listed, but some of them were of no use to 99.9% of the population of college students.  If I was interested in attending Generic College, USA, and I wanted to know what scholarships they offered, I would go to that college and ask them.  I wouldn't look it up in a general college scholarship book.  Thus it was frustrating when college-specific scholarships were listed for some schools, but not all.  Some of the listings were outdated, and I felt like I had to read through the whole book to make sure I didn't miss any scholarships I was eligible for.  I sent out about ten letters to different scholarship opportunities, and not all of them were responded to, and of those that replied and to whom I submitted applications to, no money was won.  Thus I was not very happy with my purchase
