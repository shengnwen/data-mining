don't waste your time let alone your money on this book. The author is so full of it and i seriously doubt he could trade his way out of a wet paper bag. I've been to his "Casino War Games" seminar and he talks the talk but he can't walk the talk or put his money where his mouth is, especially not in the casino or the markets. All he cares about is upselling his snake oil seminars etc...
