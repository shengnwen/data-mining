I also purchased my crockpot in order to make quick meals with a minimum of fuss as I have little to no time to cook during the week.  I assumed that it would follow that crockpot recipies would be relatively simple and quick to complete, but not so with this book.  The recipes required more time and effort that I was prepared to give. I never use this book
