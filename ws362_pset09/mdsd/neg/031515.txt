The general question Banfield is attempting to answer in this book is "what accounts for the political incapacity of the village?"  His approach to answering his research question is the case study, an in-depth study of  the village of Montegrano, Italy.  Within the village, he finds that there  is a complete lack of what most Westerners would call a "civic-" or  "public-spirit."  It is this deficiency that interests Banfield and drives  his research.  His main argument is that Montegranians have developed a  social system of "amoral familism," in which all actions are carried out  for the benefit of the individual and their immediate family.  Others in  the community (including the church, the poor, orphans, etc.) are neglected  as a result.  Interestingly, what Banfield is describing seems to be a  public goods problem.  But instead of using a rational-actor explanation,  he suggests that it is the culture of the Montegranians that leads to their  sub-optimal social conditions.  Yet he explicitly states the free-rider  problem (perhaps without realizing it?):  "In a society of amoral  familists, no one will further the interest of the group or community  except as it is to his private advantage to do so," (pg. 85).  Doesn't this  phenomena bear a more general cultural and social application?  It is  interesting that Banfield would choose to call this a "cultural"  explanation when this seems to be an individual rational calculation, no  matter what culture one inhabits.  All in all, I did not find the arguments  put forth by Banfield to be very convincing.  His "syndrome" of amoral  familism could be much more easily be explained in terms of the rational  behavior of individuals, rather than attributing it to the mystic influence  of culture.  His approach to this study is interesting, but obviously could  bear some updating
