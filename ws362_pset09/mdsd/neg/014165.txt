I came of age during this era and am about as conservative as you can get.  However, this book oversimplifies the way the Cold War was won.  Yes, Ronald Reagan did a great deal and deserves most of the credit for pushing a Soviet Empire over the economic brink upon which it was already standing.  However, O'Sullivan, a Brit and a Catholic, gives far too much credit to Thatcher and John Paul II.  I suppose that being a Brit and a Catholic, you might guess that he would do so.  But, really, he makes some stretches and assumptions about how the Soviets reacted to Thatcher and JP II that are tenuous at best.  Overall, there is nothing new in this book that isn't already known.  Reagan stood up to a U.S.S.R. which was already failing and, thus, caused it to break up more rapidly.  We already knew that - over a decade ago we knew that.  Whatever Thatcher and JP II were doing were mere coincidences to Reagan's actions - coincidences that O'Sullivan vastly overplays, if not invents.
