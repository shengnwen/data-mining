If we are to believe Blair, an ex USN submariner, that the KM was not what it was said to be, that it never came close to strangling trans Atlantic trade, that its sinklings were vastly inflated, that the U boats made hardly an impact in the waters off America and the Carribean, that its officers and sailors were mostly cowardly incompetents,then the question must be asked, why were so much resources put into defeating them? And why was he writing 2 massive books on them? Could he be jealous of the fact that the public is fascinated and mesmerized by the U boats, while the USN submarine service has been accorded much less attention, not to  mention adulation, despite its proven successes against Jap shipping
