This is the third book by Mr. Evening that I have purchased and again I am disappointed by how the author can make a seemingly easy to use product so difficult to understand. I respect his knowledge, but would rather be able to start right in using a program with USEFUL tips rather than a detailed analysis on EVERY aspect. I will  stick with Scott Kelby's sometimes irritating humor because of his simple, yet effective means of explaining a subject
