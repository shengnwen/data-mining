The book begins with a comic tale of how Twain once fell over a cliff in a remote area of Austria, and "broke some arms and legs and one thing or another."  There was no medical doctor around, so someone suggested a Christian Science doctor a few miles away who could cure anything.  Twain sent a messenger to fetch her.  She sent a message back saying she couldn't conveniently come that day, but that there was no hurry since there was nothing the matter with Twain.  

"Did you tell her I walked off a cliff seventy-five feet high?" Twain asked the messenger.
"Yes."
"And struck a boulder at the bottom and bounced?"
"Yes."
"And struck another one and bounced again?"
"Yes."
"And struck another one and bounced yet again?"
"Yes."
"And broke the boulders?"
"Yes."
"That accounts for it; she is thinking of the boulders. Why didn't you tell her I got hurt, too?"
"I did. I told her what you told me to tell her: that you were now but an incoherent series of compound fractures extending from your scalp-lock to your heels, and that the comminuted projections caused you to look like a hat-rack.. . . She said you would have these delusions, but must pay no attention to them. She wants you to particularly remember that there are no such things as hunger and thirst and pain."

OK. That's funny, but the book quickly descends into the ranting and ravings that were a hallmark of much of Twain's writing in his waning years.  

Like Twain, many of the other people who have reviewed this book on Amazon obviously have a bone to pick, so to speak, but other than having a friend who died of Christian Science when I was in college, I have nothing in particular against CS or other forms of wishful thinking. I do have strong feelings about the book, however. I have read all of Twain's books, many of them several times.  I love Twain's writing, but I rate this book, along with What is Man, at the absolute bottom of the heap.  It is not particularly funny and Twain's arguments are often muddled. For example, he spends several paragraphs "proving" that because Mary  Baker Eddy, the founder of CS, once mentions the Virgin Mary, Jesus, and herself in that order in the same sentence that she must rank herself above Jesus since the Virgin Mary obviously ranks below Him. 

I did NOT enjoy this book, and if I ever get to Austria, I shall throw my copy off a cliff, if I can find one with sufficiently jagged boulders.
