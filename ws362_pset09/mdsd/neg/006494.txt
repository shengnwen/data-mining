[Wince.] Noticing that Reilly had been an international bestseller, I bought these audio CDs for a road trip and subsequently found myself embarrassed as I listened to a book that seemed to borrow all its plotlines from G.I. Joe cartoons. Listening to the audio version, I was amazed at Reilly's nerve in magically saving his hero time and again. Reilly even pummels the reader with the same language in the sentences preceding the countless near misses. The hero is about to be squashed, when just at the last second -- his friend uses a magnet to suck him back out of the way. The hero disappears off the cliff, when just before he hits the ground -- he manages to activate a parachute. The hero is about to be decapitated, when just at the last moment -- his friend comes back from the dead to shoot the brains out of his foe.   

While Reilly no doubt did research to write this book, the flatness of his characters uncovers him as a grownup child still obsessed with battle action cartoons, good vs. evil comic books, action figures, and wham! pow! action scenes, but who never learned to relate emotionally on an adult level. The author himself writes in a book interview that it devastated him to have to cut off the life of his hero's girlfriend, an undeveloped character that's about as flat as my niece's stick figure drawings. As I listened to him talk about it, I felt sorry -- not for his character but for myself. After all, if he had wanted the reader to care, even a little, he could have taken the time to create just one conversation between the hero and his girlfriend
