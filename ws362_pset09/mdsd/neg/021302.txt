John Dickson Carr, also known as Carter Dickson, was famous for his locked room or impossible murders.The Peacock Feather Murders, originally published in 1937, is no exception.  Two men are shot at close range, two  years apart, in vacant and sinister houses.  Both murders stump New  Scotland Yard, as these killings have been committed under impossible  circumstances...the Carr/Dickson locked room signature.  When Carr/Dickson  wrote the Sir Henry Merrivale mysteries I had the impression, even as a  teenager, that these novels did not measure up to Carr's very successful  Dr.Gideon Fell mystery series.  After all these years I still have that  impression.  The Peacock Feather Murders, apart from this edition being in  very tiny print, is far-fetched, filled with stock characters, dated if you  are familiar with bowler hats, antiquated if you aren't, and features as  its sleuth, Sir Henry Merrivale, a rotund shadow of the Great Man, Dr.  Gideon Fell. If you enjoy cozying up to an English mystery in the classic  tradition, try a novel under the name, John Dickson Carr.  Heat up some  tomato soup, prepare a grilled cheese sandwich or grab a box of chocolate  chip cookies and enjoy the Master of Crime at his best
