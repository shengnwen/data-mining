There are many reviews of this book that are on target.  I will keep mine short.  The author of the book is hostile to Christianity and hides behind supposed scholarship.  The book is largely biased opinions.  If one strains, one can find some useful information.  For anyone who wants to see the author's bias most clearly, get a copy of the book and look at the last page of the last chapter.  There, the author puts forth such an absurd anti-Christian, anti-Bible, and anti-American vision that the rest of the book is put clearly into the context from which the author writes.  I read the whole book, looking for a few nuggets, but finding few.  My recommendation is that this book is not worth reading and certainly not worth buying
