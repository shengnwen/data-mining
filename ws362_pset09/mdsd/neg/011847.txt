I found the first half of this book to be extremlely interesting and compelling.  The second half; however, is boring and cliched.  It only succeeded in making me angry.  Abbie is the spoiled child of rich parents who engages in acts of terrorism, but never has to face the consequencese. Even when she is throwing tantrums and putting her loved ones in jail, no one ever calls her on it.  I know this is supposed to be fiction, but it felt much too contrived and was very unconvincing
