I had to read this for my Women's Studies class and I was deeply bored by this trite and unengaging collection of essays of past mistakes by feminists of the past. It is filled with typical man-hating that feminists are stereotyped for. Trust me, if I didn't have to read this for class, I would have never read it at all
