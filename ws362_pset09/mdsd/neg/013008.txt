Peter Tremayne's books have interesting plots and the stories are told well.  But beware, if you're looking for a satisfying, historically accurate view of seventh-century Ireland.  Tremayne (a pseudonym of the popular historian Peter Berresford Ellis) certainly knows about Irish law.  But widening circles show more and more ignorance.  The physical environment of a monastery in this period is simply wrong, ranging from construction to scale (the evil monastery of this volume sounds more like a great Benedictine monastery of the twelfth century than anything of the likes of Clonmacnois or Glendalough).  There's extreme oddity in terminology, such as the plural French word "religieux" to describe a single monk, or "noviciate" in place of "novice," both of which suggest he knows little of monastic life.  But most disturbing about this book is the utterly false picture it paints of "Roman" Christianity in the early Middle Ages---stating specifically that ecclesiastical authorities suppported and enforced death penalties, regularly engaged in corporal punishment, etc., through a bizarre law system labeled as "the Penitentials."  This stuff just isn't true
