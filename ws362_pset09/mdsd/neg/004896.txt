Like everybody else, I bought this not because I wanted it, but because it was the class text and thus, required.  In that sense, it did its job (and the instructor's) in that it conveyed the information needed to pass the exams.

The downside:
--Numerous typo's, especially in the practice problems, leaving you to wonder why your answer doesn't jibe with the book's.  Frustrating.

--SEVERAL leaps in logic:  The book will (loosely) explain a concept.  Then it will give an equation with no explanation as to how it was derived from the original concept.  Sure, you can just memorize the equation, but without understanding WHY it works, it's awful hard to apply it to the real world.  VERY frustrating.

--Many concepts are glossed over.  Not too useful to those making a career of this.

I suppose this book is somewhat useful for a refresher course in geometry and basic surveying math, but it's no value.

Get it only if you have to.  And get it used
