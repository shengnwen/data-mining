A disastrous work that perpetuates misinformation bout Confucius' life, strips the numbering off the Analects, loses half of them and throws the rest into a jumbled order presumably meant to read as a flowing narrative.  Includes contemporary language, but many terms and phrases are badly chosen  and clash with the overall tone of the work. Some passages are badly  distorted; most of them read like dubbed dialogue in a martial-arts movie.  Not recommended for anyone or anything, except as an example of what not to  do. Wade-Giles romanization
