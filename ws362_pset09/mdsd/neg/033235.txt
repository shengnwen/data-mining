"Of Nightingales That Weep" was a book that I read purely because I  had to, at school. The plot is weak and at times confusing. The main character is so selfish that it's not even funny, and her selfishness, unlike some bad traits of characters, doesn't help the plot. In the end, she has a baby with her stepfather, which disgusted most of the kids in my English class.

If you really want to read something about Japan, try a piece from Japan. It is much more accurate and the characters are most likely not selfish
