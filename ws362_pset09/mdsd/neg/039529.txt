Blowing my Cover is a young woman's memoir of a short-lived CIA career.  The middle and end of the book were intesting (CIA training and post 9/11).  The rest was boring.  Moran actually writes that she was destined for a CIA spy job because she liked to treasure hunt as a child!  Yawn.  Moran never convinced me that she really wanted to be in the CIA or that she was truly "wired" as a spy.  Her motivations for getting out were believable but that doesn't happen until the last 40 or so pages.  I found myself skimming the middle of the book to find out why she ultimately left.  Moran's book has some interesting tidbits about becoming a spy but it lacks passion and emotion
