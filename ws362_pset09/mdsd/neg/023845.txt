I purchased this book because of the very positive reviews.  After reading the book I was quite disappointed.  The very positive reviews were not accurate.  This is not a four or five star book.  Its marginally adequate, nothing more.  The information is very generic; narrow in scope, with no great insights.

In addition to being informationally weak, I felt the author was subtly pushing several internet poker sites.  Parts of the book read more like an infomercial than an unbiased informational book.  Upon finishing the book, I was left feeling disappointed.  The book did not deliver.

As an alternative selection, I highly recommend "Winning at Internet Poker for Dummies".  Although I find the title "for Dummies" offensive, the book is excellent, offering indepth, thorough discussions of the various topics involved with internet poker.
