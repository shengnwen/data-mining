A book written by an apologist, one whose idealism prevents her recognizing the truth. Perhaps the current "Islamic rage" about the Pope will wake her up.

I suggest anyone interested in the facts read: The Sword of the Prophet by Serge Trifkovic and, Prophet of Doom by Craig Winn. Facts are facts, and both of these books present facts.

If the truth about Muhammad offends Muslims, then part of the problem has been identified. The Koran, and the words and deeds of the Prophet cannot be challenged, criticized or scrutinized. Blind faith in an infallible man is the basis for "Islamic rage.
