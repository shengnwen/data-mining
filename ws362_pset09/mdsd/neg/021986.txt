I bought this book out of my interest in foreign policy. I was very surprised by the stupidity of the title. Well, once you read it it just becomes more stupid. Its amazing that it was published and that this lady ever got a contract and a PHD. This probably shows how useless and pointless current historical debates are. Don't buy it!
