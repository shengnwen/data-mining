This book and every other book on self help topics are endless rephrasings of Jesus statement - " Ask and you shall receive ".
Why we read these books? Because we are in need. And IF WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF OUR NEED IS THIS SAME NEED WE SHALL RECEIVE. We are always what we are conscious of. That's so simple like that. When I AM conscious of being rich, I AM rich in that very moment. In SPIRIT and so, IN TRUTH, I AM rich. That's all. The proof that I am rich is my total joy and gratefulness. Money in my bank account will materialize soon after, but, first, money must be a fact in spirit. The same with health, relationships, etc. Try this: suppose you are feeling depressed and anxious. Be conscious you are the most happiest person in the world. Right now. Feel  happy beyond your wildest dreams. Not that you will be, but that YOU ARE NOW. And you are. That's all. So, feel you are rich right now. And you are. Apparent money will appear soon in your bank. Ask IS receive. But asking in the conscious of the need is receive the... need - the very thing one is conscious of.
Each new book you read about materializing your desires is a proof that you are conscious of your needs and that is your asking and what you receive.
This is so simple that you need to be as a little child to believe
