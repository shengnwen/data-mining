Recipe for Disaster:
Get a dog for every member of the family.
Don't spay or neuter any of them.
Allow them all to run free for a year while you follow along, observing them as they run through traffic, fight, and place themselves in danger of death or injury with regularity.
Don't establish a relationship with any of them, work with them, and train them in any way.
Watch and take copious notes as they withdraw from the family and revert to survival behavior.
Write a book about the experience and make a lot of money. Fool the masses into thinking that this was a fascinating experiment and therefore any irresponsible behvior on the part of the author was somehow justified. 

I threw this book in the garbage, where it belongs.
