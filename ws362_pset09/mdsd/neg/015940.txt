This was a very ordinary spy novel. Nothing outstanding and nothing that suspensful. Way too many coincidences and not enough reality such as a LeCarre or Deigton would have.. If this book were a movie it would be classified as "B".....

This is the first Littel book that I've read. Some reviews stated that Littel was in the genre of the great spy masters. Based on that info I purchased this one and one called The Company... Well, in the lexicon of Howard Cossell; " Fugetaboutit"!! He is a long, long way from the Masters ..
