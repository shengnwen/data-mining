The Gypsy Game continues the adventures of April, Melanie, Elizabeth, Marshall, Toby and Ken first introduced by Snyder in The Egypt Game, which in my opinion was the better of the two books.

The kids feel that they've explored everything in Egypt so April suggests that they now play The Gypsy Game.  As the kids begin their research, Melanie is reluctant to play because of all the negative things she discovers, but the others are very keen especially Toby.  Toby is half gypsy on his father's side and shows his friends his grandmother's jewelry etc.

Toby's mother is deceased but her rich family, who never approved of her marriage, decides that they want to adopt Toby to continue the family name meaning they'd also change his full name.  He thinks that his father is in danger from them so he runs away.

His friends get involved and repair everything.  In the end, instead of playing The Gypsy Game they take up a neighborhood cause.

I wanted a story like The Egypt Game, where I could relive the wonder of childhood make believe; but this story was very different.  I hope Snyder writes more books about these kids on the same level as The Egypt Game.  This book just wasn't as good!
