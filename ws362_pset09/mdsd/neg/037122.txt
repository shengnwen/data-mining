I agree with the other reviewers who cite the authors' numerous contradictions and extraneous information, this book could have been improved with some judicious editing.  

There is one disturbing piece of advice in the book that I would like to draw attention to: the author continually recommends using a microwave to defrost and heat baby food.  This is extremely counterproductive, why spend the time and money making organic baby food only to nuke it in the microwave and degrade the nutritional content?  Microwaving breaks down the molecular structure of foods making them harder for your body to recognize and digest.  

No, microwaving isn't the greatest evil out there, but in a book devoted to nutritiously feeding your baby it seems quite conspicuous!
