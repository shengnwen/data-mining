The story starts out with a lot of promise, which is why it's so disappointing when you get to the preposterously dopey ending. I won't give too much away, but the ending is like something out of a 1930's B-movie. There are so many ways this could have been done that would have been infinitely more plausible (for example, see Richard Morgan's handling of similar issues in a subplot of Broken Angels). I was literally angry as I got to end of the book because it was such a letdown--I was listening to the audiobook version in the car and was actually shouting at the CD player as the ending unfolded.

Hard to believe this is from the same author that gave us The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. Unless you're *really* good at suspending disbelief, avoid this one
