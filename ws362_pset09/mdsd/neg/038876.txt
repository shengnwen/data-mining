Like W.D. I felt that the novel was lengthy with characters that simply cluttered the landscape. Tragedy after tragedy unfolds: a kidnapping of an ellitist; a run on a bank; a near-stock market crash; Hong Kong's world-famous floating restaurant catches fire, burns, and sinks; a mud-slide that destroys a prominent hotel; a chinese-communist espionage plot; a soviet espionage plot; secret-agents, double-agents, triple agents (do I need to go on)! All of this occurring within ten days, but the reader loses sense of the time since the book is so time consuming. I was fascinated with Clavell's Taipan and was further interested in the exploits of the Struan family. This was a disppointment! Dunross, the present Taipan, moves through novel with a killer business instinct and brief instances of compassion and humanity. Why does he do it? He is trying to live up to a legacy. That's it. In one sentence that is as deep as Dunross goes. The novel Taipan was so different in development of its characters. Dunross'one-sentence purpose for living, when contrasted with Dirk Struan's vision of the Noble House helping China become a world power was completely lacking. Clavell's earlier work was very insightful about China especially in its potential influence. However, the parade of characters in Noble House is similar to a chinese all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant: plenty of food, but lacking in authentic taste. Overall the work was very tiring and uninspiring. Nothing noble about it at all.
