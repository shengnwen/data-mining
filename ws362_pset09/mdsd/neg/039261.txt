Yet another fantasy novel where everything is resolved by magic.  Magic is so prevelant that one scene requires a location in a "no-magic" zone - but of course magic is needed there to resolve the conflict of that scene, so the no-magic zone includes a magic zone!

In book two, of course, Anok meets a priest who may as well have stepped out of an episode of Xena: Warrior Princess. It is Kaman Awi Urshé, the high priest of Set who somehow lacks arrogance, but comes across as an old, bumbling, cordial, tinkering busybody intent on learning modern science - like the old guy in The Scorpion King or the old teacher in Young Sherlock Holmes, the guys who can create anachronistic gun powder or airplanes. I have seen this type of character in so many movies/TV shows that he bored me from the get-go.

His descriptions are wonderful, though.  It is easy to read and easy to visualize.  However, I was hoping for a stronger plot and stronger characters (Anok is supposed to be falling into darkness, but he isn't; and the supporting characters do nothing and add nothing to the storyline)
