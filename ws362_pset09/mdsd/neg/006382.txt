 Having just turned 25 and naturally, needing a book to tell me what the hell to do about it, I picked this up. For me, Quarterlife Crisis coasts more on its merits of inherently interesting and familiar subject matter than the contents of the book itself. For all 198 pages it has this anecdotal, unstructured, almost gossipy feel to it where the authors make one point (usually a pretty obvious one), then spend the next 20 pages circumventing the subject instead of really expanding on it or providing a solution. There are pockets of insight here and there, but most of the comfort and usefulness of reading this book ended where it started: knowing that my concerns affected others.

Having been written by women, I have a feeling it will appeal more to female readers. We guys need a stronger dose of logic and insight to be satisfied
