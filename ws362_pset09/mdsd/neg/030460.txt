I believe this is a poorly rendered version of Antony and Cleopatra.  The organization of the notes made it difficult to read. Instead of putting the archaic meanings of words at the bottom as footnotes, it would have been much more helpful to place them in the  margins. The constant going back-and-forth between footnotes and the text made my reading of this play less enjoyable
