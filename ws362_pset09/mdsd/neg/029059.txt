Scientific studies have been unable to provide any compelling evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of shark cartilage as a therapy for either curing or preventing cancer.  

Yet because of the disinformation presented in books like this, cartilage, regardless of the facts, has become a staple among the myriad of phony miracle cancer cures that sick, desperate, and despairing cancer sufferers may be all too willing to try in the impossible hope that it will help them.  Unfortunately, shark cartilage's efficacy as a treatment is rooted solely in the realm of pseudoscience and in the claims of snake oil salesmen like William Lane who sell it.  

Even if sharks do have a natural immunity to cancer - a central premise of the book that has been shown to be false - who is to say that grinding them up and eating them would convey any benefit?  Does eating poultry help us fly?

For those who are suffering from cancer, staking the money that it costs to purchase and ship this book doesn't seem to be any smarter than staking one's life on its claims by forgoing chemotherapy treatment for cartilage as a review below describes.  Who wrote that review anyway?  William Lane?
