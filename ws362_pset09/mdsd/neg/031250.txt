I have to preface this review by saying that I am not a Caroline Myss fan.  This is not based upon my past religious upbringing, but rather on her approach to an attempted synthesis between the Jewish, Christian and Hindu teachings on metaphysics and energy systems.  In short, I think she missed the mark and tried to force fit areas together based more on her assumptions about reality than a natural meshing together of concepts.

I am educated both as a scientist and in the area of psychology, including sacred psychology across world traditions.  It was very difficult for me to even listen to the logic underlying the author's arguments.  However, by synthesizing these disparate traditions in a credible sounding manner, she has tapped into a very large market of people searching for meaning.

I am not saying that this book is completely without merit, but I would take much of it with a grain of salt.  I also think there are better books out there that are better researched, more thorough and less contaminated with a lot of the authors own assumptions about reality.  Two examples to look at while you are evaluating this book are FORGOTTEN TRUTH by Huston Smith and a BRIEF HISTORY OF EVERYTHING by Ken Wilber.

There is a saying that most people would rather be entertained that educated.  I think this basically sums up my experience of this book, except I didn't find it very entertaining either.  I know that many loyal readers of Ms. Myss will disagree with me, but this is my honest opinion of her work.
