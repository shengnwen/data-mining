I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.

The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.  

I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.

Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.

Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.

The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.

The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].
