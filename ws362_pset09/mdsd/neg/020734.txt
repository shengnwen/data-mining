The first set that I got from Amazon had major production problems with the third CD and it couldn't be played.  Amazon replaced the set and the replacement set didn't have problems -- they could all play.  My complaint is not with Amazon.

On a more serious basis, the audio cds refer to things that are not in place.  They refer to a hard-copy list of high glycemic fruits and vegetables that was supposed to be included.  This hard-copy list was not included with either set that I received (in case they just screwed up on one).  Even more interesting, in the audio it refers to the fact that additional information is supposed to be available through the Atkins web site, lists an address (http://www.atkins.com/agr) -- and that's not a valid page.  You get the dreaded error message 404 page.

I sent email to the Atkins' site and got no response.  This could be solved by adding the page mentioned in the cds -- and adding the information that's supposed to be included on a card.

Right now, some of the key information that you need to make this diet work is not available.  You would still need to go buy the book to get that information.  

I am a fan of the Atkins diet and had hoped that this cd set would be helpful for a friend with diabetes.  It is not.  

I would not recommend this cd set.  If you care about the information, then buy the book.  

It is my understanding that this cd was produced by a different company than the people who produced their other CD set.  I'm sorry they didn't do a better quality control.
