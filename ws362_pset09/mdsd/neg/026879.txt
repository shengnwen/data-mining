There were laughs in the book.  Overall I was disappointed that so much of it was recycled from her stand up shows. If she is going to expect people to lay down money for a book, the least she could do is come up with some new material.  As it is, the book is barely 200 pages and a good number of them are blank except for a section number.  Her rants on politics were not funny.
