After hearing the NPR review of this book I raced out to buy it.  How disappointed I was when I read it.  Although easy to read (Mr. Holleran has a lovely style) it was essentually empty of emotion.  I felt nothing.  I wanted to say to all of the primary characters "Get over yourself".  All of the main participants were beautiful, clever, intelligent.  Well, fine.  Just come to grips with your lives.  Stop whining
