I couldn't get past chapter 5, and that was after skipping through some of the earlier chapters. Dull descriptions, and too many of them, dominate the writing. Characters were about as exciting as bricks. Plot development--ha! This is a mystery novel: why isn't the plot going anywhere?

And lest I forget, grammatical errors abound in this novel. Tip for you, Nevada: something is not "comprised of" things, things comprise a larger object. And Yosemite being at the same *longitude* as Mississippi? Pleaaase! Give me a break, it's barely at the same lattitude; Yosemite is 225 miles north of the very northern tip of Mississippi, and Mississippi is 300 miles long N to S. Hey Barr, are you sure you weren't smoking that dope when you wrote this?

Apparently (thank you other reviews), the punchline is that a plane full of dope has crashed in the mountains and people are swarming over each other to get at it. Big whoop. Come out to LA and you can see drug dramas for real--murder, intrigue, corruption and all.
