It's fragmented and feels like it doesn't know whether it wants to be funny or serious, but I could have lived with that if it hadn't been so scarily oblivious and unpleasant. One example: "And I'm secretly thrilled that I might actually be starting a friendship with someone as cool--and as black--as Angie."

Oh, great. Because black people just LOVE that. I mean, how cool is that? Rich white lady wants to be my friend because I'm black! Groovy! I love to be an accessory! She doesn't have to feel like she's a self-centered, useless rich boob anymore, because she's different! She has a black friend! And a gay one! How rebellious! 

And don't get me started on how she fancies herself some wild-and-crazy partier but still thinks oral sex is "taboo" and "antifeminist" and that any guy who wants to do a woman up the butt is necessarily gay. 

Who is this book for? Not for black people, gay people, non-rich people, or any woman who has ever enjoyed any kind of sex beyond the standard missionary type. In other words, it's for Dr. Laura, and that's about it
