This book is utterly worthless. I am fed up with McDowell treating Christians as if they were stupid children. This is the final book of his I shall ever read. The "moral truths" which McDowell presents are either one of two things. First, some of them are so incredibly obvious that no person seriously doubts them, and any fool could have figured them out for himself. Or second, they are outdated and anachronistic relics of a past that is best left behind. Reading this book made me think that McDowell belongs somewhere in the mid-1800s rather than on the verge of the 21st Century. Clearly, if his point of view is followed, Christianity will be pulled backward, rather than moved forward
