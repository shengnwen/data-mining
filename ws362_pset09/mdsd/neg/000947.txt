Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom.
