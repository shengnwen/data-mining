As a fan of Tina McElroy Ansa, I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book for at least 2 1/2 years during which time she changed not only the title of the book (It was originally suppose to be titled &quot;And You Should Know Better&quot;) but also changed publishers. When the book was finally released, I had to have been one of first people in line to buy it and I must say that I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I did not feel the depth from these charachters that was so easily detected in her past 3 novels, and the story itself simply was not at all intriguing. Though it took Mrs. Ansa several years to follow up her last release, this novel was written as though it took only a few weeks, perhaps due to the fact that she and her husband were working on a screenplay for one of her earlier novels. If you've never read any of T.M. Ansa's work before, PLEASE don't let this novel be the gauge by which you judge her writing ability. I just hope that she is able to redeem herself after this
