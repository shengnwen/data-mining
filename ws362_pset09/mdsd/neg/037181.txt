I wanted to give it zero stars, but the program wouldn't let me.  The author used the paltry ploy of borrowing Austen's name to sell a few books.  My husband fell for it an bought it for me.  I could barely get through the first few chapters.  No Jane heroine would behave in such a passive manner as the people in this book.  Not a redeeming quality among the characters, and after several chapters it seemed the plot was non-existent.  You should also be warned that the book contains some disturbing tales of physical abuse
