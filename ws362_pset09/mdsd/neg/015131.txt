I don't know who all these people are giving this book 5 stars; they must be friends of the author from the "old neighborhood."  I'm not from Philadelphia, so all the "name changing" didn't bother me, but I still have to join in with those brave few South West Philadelphians among the reviewers who gave an honest appraisal of this book: this book is terrible.  It's terribly written and it has absolutely no feeling to it.  All the short stories are as bland as can be.  You only get a glimpse inside the author's head, and NEVER get a glimpse inside his heart.  

If you're thinking of reading this book, DON'T, and go buy "Broken Music" by Sting instead.  THAT'S an example of how a memoir about the "old neighborhood" should be written.  It's actually about growing up in Newcastle, England in the 50s and 60s, but it's a town very much like Philadelphia in that era, and the stories are truly heartfelt, unlike the tedious stories in Mr. Meyers' book
