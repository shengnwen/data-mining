As one reads the various customer reviews, it becomes obvious that the commentary in this book is skewed sharply to the right. Conservatives think it's "fair and balanced"; liberals don't. That's a tell tale sign as far as 24 TV news networks are concerned.

I have bought every edition since I turned 18 in 1978, but have decided not to purchase the next release after the 2006 election cycle. The hard factual information is accurate and well-presented. But the partisan slant compromises the book's credibility as an analytical product. With so much tendentious material, how can anyone not desirous of receiving the Fox News party line have  confidence in the soundness of the commentary--the "soft" factual information? Michael Barone made an excellent and original contribution to political political research when he introduced the Almanac back in the '70's. He now generates a product that's "in your face" if you're moderate or liberal. If you like George Bush, you'll love this book
