I started reading the Scarpetta novels in order a couple months ago and finally got to Blow Fly.  Upon starting this book, I immediately felt disconnected from the character of Kay.  All of a sudden Kay is now just 'Scarpetta' and is treated like a background character.  The feelings and thoughts are not there in this book, it is like someone else stepped in to write this one.  What should have been an explosive revalation in the book was barely even a wimper and was casually mentioned like what the author had for breakfast.  The end was awful too.  It was like Cornwell got tired of writing and then just wrapped things up in a few paragraphs.  I hope like heck that the next book in the series is back to the original format, this one was a definite downer
