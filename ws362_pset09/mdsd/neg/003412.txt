A very well written disappointment.  I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us.  I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that.  But that's only half the journey.  I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent.  The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form.  Or maybe not.  But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution.  I love Tyler's work and admire her skill.  But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price.
