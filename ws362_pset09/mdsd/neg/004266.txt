Kiyosaki warns you stright away that this book will not suit 9/10 people.  Still I proceeded to read the book and found the information presented to lack substance and detail.

Some of the infromation contained in this book is indeed useful but it is very hard to asborb what is useful when the book has been written in a non consise and repetitive manner.  Kiyosaki mentions the stock market bear run of 00-03 and investors losing 7-9 trillion dollars in detail so many times that you begin to look for any other information this book has to offer.  No mention is given to the stock market rally after this time and the gains that followed.

For someone that does not seem to like the idea of mutual funds and the stock market in general, Kiyosaki loves to quote Buffet.  He seems to understand the market better then people such as Graham and Buffet in the way he can predict market cycles and is able to time his investments.

Based on Kioysaki's own statement, this book will not suit 9/10 investors
