This could have been a really fabulous book.  But the flaws are so striking, it's really hard to forgive them.  The biggest one being that one of the characters never gets her due.  With all the drama that goes on in this book, the resolution, or lack thereof, is very unbalanced and disappointing. 

Also, it really freaks me out when I see statements like "The best work of fiction yet..." That's ridiculous.  Especially in the case of this good, but again, deeply flawed book.
