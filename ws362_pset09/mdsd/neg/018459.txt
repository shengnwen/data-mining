This volume is a big let down, especially after having read 'Sayings' and 'Lives' of the Desert Fathers, which are both excellent and substantial. 
The primary drawback is the length of the book, clocking in at a mere 47 pages. Not only does it lack just in pages, but some pages contain barely a few sentences!
This could be fine as a gift book as it has some nice examples on central christian themes and the presentation is of a high quality.
But for a serious spiritual study this is book is inadequate.
Spend your money on 'Sayings' instead which is just superb and has enough substance for years of meditation and thought.
'Lives' is also very interesting and epic.

POSTNOTE: This review refers to the hardcover edition. I need to make this distinction as recently I came across the paperback edition(3rd editon, 1981) in a library and discovered it was a radically different book of substantially more quantity. Amazon has overlooked this and simply lumped them together. Even though the paperback is still a relatively short 66 pages it contains 239 sayings or anecdotes ranging in length from single sentences to long paragraphs. The hardcover edition(47 pages) is a small selection of this material but containing illustrations. To add even more confusion the first edition of the paperback(1975) is also available under the title 'The Wisdom of the Desert fathers: The Apophthegmata Patrum'. Buyers should take these distinctions into account before purchasing
