This book is a clear example of a teenager's trying too hard to sound world-wise and blase.  It's a book about detachment and nothing, in which rich kids do nothing but take drugs and sleep together and can't even muster up the effort to drive their clearly especially drunk friend home.  Ellis, however, can't let the theme of detachment be subdued and understated, which might have made the book much better; no, he has to hammer it in constantly (for example, two characters decide to have sex but don't even touch each other).

Even worse, he doesn't write very well.  He seems to be trying to sound like Hemingway quite frequently.  Hemingway's long, unpunctuated run-ons, though, are elegant and hypnotic.  Ellis's are just bad.  He goes through different styles, too, seemingly trying to imitate other great writers and sounding only like a kid who hasn't figured out how to write like himself yet.  Appropriate for an eighteen-year-old writing from the point of view of an eighteen-year-old?  Maybe, but it's terrible writing and not worth the effort it takes to read (which is not much).

I am not criticizing the book based on its disturbing themes (drug use, alcohol abuse, eating disorders, gang rape, violent pornography, and prostitution).  Done properly, this novel could be a fascinating and eerily disturbing book.  The problem is that it isn't well written.  We read this book junior year of high school, and I can honestly say that it's the worst book we read.  There's just nothing to it.  It's not a book; it's words on a page, and even more they're the wrong words awkwardly strung together
