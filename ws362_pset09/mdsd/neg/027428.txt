THE FIRST 60 OR SO PAGES ARE JUST AWFUL. JOHN KEEGAN ARGUES THAT WAR IS NOT THE CONTINUATION OF POLITICS RATHER THE RESULT OF CULTURAL DRIVES. THAT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN SO IN HISTORICAL TIMES, BUT IS HARDLY SO TODAY. HE UNFORTUNATELY TRIES TO EXPLAIN AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE FROM A BIOCHEMICAL PERSPECTIVE AND IS NOT ONLY DATED, HE'S FLAT WRONG. THERE'S OTHER PROBLEMS WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE, I.E., CLAIMING THE U.S. ABANDONED THE DRAFT AFTER WW II AND DIDN'T USE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE 60'S. WRONG AGAIN! WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT KEEGAN'S VERY VIEWS ARE SO MUCH A CONTINUATION OF BRITISH POLITICAL THINKING. NOT A GREAT BOOK AT ALL
