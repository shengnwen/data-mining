no offense to this write but our teacher forced us to read this book... honestly i think most books suck. ive never read one i liked except maybe 2 or 3. i dont care if my teacher sees this because this is my opinion and she cant do a thing about it if she wanted to.. but i hated this book. who wants to read over the summer unless its a text message or letter, etc. from your friends. id rather spend my time with friends than read a book over the summer... especially this one
