I bought this book expecting a long overdue treatment on one of the most dramatic camapigns of the War between the States. Instead what I got was socio-political fluff that quite frankly has been beat over the heads of tens of thousands of college students for over fifty years. Hence the two star rating. It was, however, well written and the battle narrative (the miniscule one provided by Rable) is actually very good, just far too short for a book claiming to be written about the Fredericksburg campaign and battle. Had this not been stocked in the military history section, it would actually pass as great socio-political history. But since many of us have zero interest in that category... well anyway. "New" Military history is quite frankly an attempt to liberalize and propagandize the last bastion of history we have, military history. If all future War between the States and WWII and Napoleonic and Roman military history books turn out this way... just buy the old classics and re-read them. Don't waste your money on New Mil Hist and certainly don't waste your money on this book. It takes the dead horse of Emancipation Proclomation and beats it to past death into carcass mutilation. Again, this book was supposed to be about Fredericksburg Mr. Rable, not the cause of the war to begin with which by the way unfair taxation and import tarrif laws not slavery. Alas, a different subject for a different time.  I repeat... DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Buy O'Reilleys instead.
