Melissa was just an average gossip reporter for a NYC newspaper looking for love in all the wrong places.  Fortunately her elderly next door neighbor was attacked in her home and left for Mel to find unconscious and barely breathing.  Mel, being the kind, neighborly girl she is, took to taking care of the woman's pets and set to getting in contact with her only living relative.  Her heinous, photographer nephew, Max.  After hearing of his aunt's accident, Max decided it was more important to spend a few weeks in Florida with a supermodel.  In his place, he sent an old college friend who owed him a favor.  John Trent, a trust fund millionaire, was called in to stay at Max's house and pretend to be Max.  After spending time together Mel and "Max" begin to fall i love, creating quite a mix up.  All in all it's a cute book, but I hate that the entire book consists of correspondance through emails
