No spoilers included, but this book has a major gimmick in it that's popular now and thus totally overused. The characters are all neurotic. The mystery is not compelling. I liked the other McDermids I read a lot better. I think the author was only partially attentive, or was distracted by something horrible and boring, while writing this tedious slab of overwrought verbiage
