I didn't read, nor review this book, Stand Up Comedy, but apparently LaMott A Jackson blieves that I did, as he/she chose to drag my name into his/her review.  I thought these were reviews, not forums for trashing other reviewers' names.  
I would never mention anyone else by name, but I chose to do so here because LaMott A Jackson chose to berate me personally, singling out my name from other negative reviews.  It sounds like LaMott A Jackson has a personal interest in the selling of the book "Stand Up Comedy". 
The book I did review however was Judy Carter's "Comedy Bible", so if LaMott A Jackson  would like to add credibility to his/her review, he/she should have gotten the review of the correct book.
I have not read "Stand Up" by Judy Carter, nor would I want to after reading the lame "Comedy Bible".   
If you are going to review a book, do that. Most reviewers do refer to other reviews' comments, but without stating names. Please LaMott A Jackson, submit your review of the product as everyone, but leave out the names of other reviewers.
