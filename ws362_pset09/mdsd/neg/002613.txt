This book focuses on a couple driving home from a party. His drunken wife asleep, the man apparently, though NEVER explained, stumbles into a ghostly situation and area. It haunts him and the story was spooky and original - almost like a old legend you've heard with terrifying creatures - when it wasn't being dragged along, or missing pieces. Again, Mr.Golden chooses a weak male as the character; he pieces things together slowly to save his possessed wife and the little girl that haunts him...When the ending comes, you'll be asking yourself "why didn't he do this, or "why did that happen that way"? because it just doesn't make sense! There are too, too many loose ends left untied that will leave you wondering, and even more things that just aren't addressed. Again, great story, but not worth reading with so much missing. Like clues that are never explained.
Why is this house unfindable, and yet located in every country? Why was the main point of the story- the little girl - no longer important near the end?
I'm so annoyed. I'm going to have to re-sell this
