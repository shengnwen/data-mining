I bought this book online & did not get a chance to look through it first. So, if you are interested in pictures of Debra because she is so beautiful - be warned - there are none! The only picture of her is on the cover. The ex husband that wrote this book did not even include a private wedding photo, childhood pictures of her, or any personal pictures of her or them as a couple. I find the lack of pictures a little strange, since he is so forthcoming with so much personal information about her, surely he could include some photos. Anyway, Owen Lafave talks alot about Debra's abusive past relationships with other guys & her upbringing with an emotionally distant father. Owen knows going into the relationship with Debra that she has had alot of personal problems which also include an on going eating disorder & she has had numerous fits of rage & jealousy. He decribes her as very insecure. Because she is so beautiful & smart he overlooks her problems & proceeds to marrying her. There were plenty of red flags that things were not right with Debra from the start!
He even describes problems in their sex life! I do get the impression that Owen is bitter & trying to get his revenge on Debra through this book. Though, I feel it's understandable that he would feel humiliated & betrayed, there is information in this book that he has disclosed about Debra that is very personal and really none of anyone's business. 
If anyone wants to see a good interview of Debra & her side of the story catch Matt Lauer's recent interview with her. She speaks openly & honestly & you get a better sense of her and what happened. She even mentions that she should of been put in jail for what she did. She has been forbidden to write  a book of her own or from profiting in any way from what happened.
 This book is an OK read. I would say get a copy & read it for yourself, just don't expect any pictures
