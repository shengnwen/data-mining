If what the author says is true, I despair of ever really learning about annuities.  He claims that, as of the writing of this book, there have been four books on annuities, and he's written three of them.  Ugh.

First, the positive, because there's almost always something positive.  The green ink they used for the print is very easy on the eyes.  And I did manage to learn a little about the very confusing world of annuities.

But that's about it for the positive.  The book was not very clearly written or organized.  Some sections didn't seem to pertain to the chapter title.  The examples were mostly un-helpful.  So to make up for his lack of clarity, the author resorted to repetition, which only made matters worse.

The other thing that bothered me was how gung-ho the author was about annuities.  I almost felt like I was reading a sales pitch rather than an educational book.

Maybe annuities really are so confusing that no one can make them clear.  If that's the case, then maybe this author shouldn't have even bothered.  (He probably shouldn't have bothered regardless, because he's hopeless as a writer.)  You might get something from this book, but I'd advise against actually buying it
