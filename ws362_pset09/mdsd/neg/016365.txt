As a coach myself, I was interested in Michael Lewis's thoughts and feelings about his former youth baseball coach, Coach Fitz.   Was Fitz a positive impact on his life?  Michael says so, but I struggled to understand why.  Here was a coach who apparently believed in him by putting him in the game to pitch in a crucial situation.  Or maybe the only reason he entered the game was because Fitz accidentally visited the star pitcher twice in the same inning and so was compelled to take the star out and put Michael in.  

Fitz was an intense coach and apparently was able to convince his team (at least back in the 70's) that hard work could pay off.  I guess this was one of the "Lessons on the Game of Life".  Coach Fitz said he cared about the kids but it wasn't clear from any of the stories that any of the kids thought the coach cared about them. 

Maybe the truth is that Coach Fitz was most concerned about winning.  The author remembers most clearly all the things Fitz broke in the locker room after losses.  Coach Fitz would walk home after losses to punish himself for the players sins.  The players were not allowed to wash their jerseys until they won.  I guess they weren't being the best they could be until they scored more runs than their opponent.  Winning was also more important to Coach Fitz than following the rules, as he apparently encouraged the author to throw illegal "spitballs".  

For coaches looking for coaching models, I recommend NFHS Coaches' Quarterly
