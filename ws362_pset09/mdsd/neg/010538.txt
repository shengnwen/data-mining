This book is short and poorly written and I didn't find to be so extremely inspirational as everybody else writing reviews on this site. In Fact I found it to be boring and pointless. This book about a religious nut who thinks he is some sort of modern day jesus didn't impress me at all. I reccomend that anyone thinking of reading this book should reconsider. Altogether, this book was just a steaming pile of garbage
