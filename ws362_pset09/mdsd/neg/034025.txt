This book just basically tells you whats coming up in your future as a teen. That you gonna be confronted with drugs, sex, and other things, but it makes you sort of scared to be a teenager. Like it says you shouldn't hold hands because it leads to sex. Taking everything just out of proportion. Makes it sound like your going to burn in hell for doing the littlest things. I wouldn't recommend giving this to your child, or they might fear growing up
