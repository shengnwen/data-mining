Much of the writing is beautiful and evocative, but it's hard to know what's going on.  The summaries posted here have more "plot" in them than is easily gleaned from the book.  Because the stream of consciousness leaps from character to character, it's hard to know the relationships let alone see who is flirting with whom and why it matters.  You do figure it out but it takes too long to figure out which characters go with which names.

There is a lovely portrait of an English village in 1939, and the heartbreaking innocent pageant of English history portrayed, but really, you can get such atmosphere from the series Mystery-- and there you get a plot as well.  I think this is not a good introduction to Woolf, as it takes certain kinds of experimentation and heightens it.  At least with Mrs. Dalloway you see things for the most part from one point of view and come to care about it.

I enjoyed this, but then I'm in theatre, so I enjoyed all of the description of the pageant.  This is a little bit like reading the equivalent of a home movie, it's pretty, but you don't know the people portrayed well enough to really care
