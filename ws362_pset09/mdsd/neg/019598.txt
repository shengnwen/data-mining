This is almost the Catholic study of Tolkien we've been waiting for.  But not quite.  Though diligently researched, with 800 footnotes, it somehow manages not to engage with its subject very much.  Birzer says occasional odd things like describing "Mythopoeia" as "a poem written to celebrate" Lewis's conversion, surely the wrong word, and claiming that Ilúvatar bypassed the Valar in destroying Númenor.  I found it diffuse and nowhere near as interesting as I'd hoped
