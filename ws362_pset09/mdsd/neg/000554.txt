This pamphlet provides a very good high-level overview of the WBS concept, but the sparse content does justify the $25.00 price tag.  There are 58 half pages of text in this publication and it is a mere 1/4" thick. I was very disappointed when I opened the shipping box.  Before opening the shrinkwrap I surmised that I had received a CD version, but was surprised to find a very thin, very spartan publication.  The content, sans the intro, about the author, and index, would probably equal to ten back-to-back pages of information.  This publication clearly did not meet my expectations.
