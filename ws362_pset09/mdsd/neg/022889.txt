I am an Oil professional - 30 years in drilling and production. This book is very timely - we are running out of oil - All the major oilfields are in decline. New (significant) oilfields are not being found. As this progresses it will be a very big change of life.

The author repeats and repeats the same ideas with few facts. Saudi keeps it technical information private. I was disappointed with this book. :
