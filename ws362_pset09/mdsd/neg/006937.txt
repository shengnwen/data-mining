This book of short vampire stories is BAD, BAD, and BAD. The books feels like it was put together in a matter of hours all in pursuit of the mighty dollar. The stories are meaningless, contrived, and a waste of the paper they were printed on. The ONLY REDEEMABLE story in the whole bunch was Angela Knight's Galahad. If she's smart, she'll turn that into a full story to add to her collection of Mageverse. Galahad's story was quite good. We actually read a plot that developed quickly and had a show-down between good and evil. It also explained how another of the three "unholy" grails was destroyed. I'm glad I bought the book simply for that particular story. Galahad deserves FIVE STARS but the book as a whole should simply be left out in the yard for the sun to destroy
