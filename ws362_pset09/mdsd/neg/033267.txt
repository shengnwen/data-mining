It's sad to say that this is a more a novel than a biography ,far from a history.Basically ,it stressed too much on the history of surgery, and westernized medicine oriented ,over-pessimistic in the &quot;triumph&quot; of of the modern medicine.However ,this book presents terrific narratives,just like the style of Dr. Nuland
