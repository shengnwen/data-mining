This book was good but not terrific. after reading best sellers like Why we want you to be rich by Donald TRump and God Doesn't run a $2 Shop by Sage Saint Francis i found that this book just was not in the same leauge.
i mean those two books changed my life, and actually got me the result and financial freedom i was after but they are not for everyone.
I do not feel this is the authors best work, however i still believe it is a good investment and a descent place to start
