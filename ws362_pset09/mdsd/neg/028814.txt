Let me see if I have got this right? The only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way? That way we all gain? OK the bosses of Nike, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk, but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide?

Sounds good: who would want to be the party pooper?!

Well someone's got to be, and for the simple reason that we don't live on a planet the size of Jupiter. 

The oil's finite: we know that but can't be bothered to act on it. Even the supply of water is turning out to be finite: the south east of England is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water. OK, they could ship it in from the rest of the UK where there's no problem, but for reasons that don't quite add up that's not possible. It's not the corporate solution, if you will forgive the pun.

Has it occurred to anyone, I wonder, if it's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems? Yes, I know Marx and Stalin don't offer any fixes, but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced: growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not.
