The story is quite clunky and contrived, and yet, I still can't help but feel some affection for it, as, despite my opinions of Mr. Roeder's talents, he clearly feels deeply for his characters, and their none-to-realistic world.

The good things are here--while the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the fact that the two couples are essentially dopplegangers, their plight is still quite a bit involving.

My negatives, though, really spring from the way the plot unfolds--far too quickly and far too coincidental.  I know that the chamber of horrors at the "mental hospital" is not far removed from reality, but for a lot of the story, the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear.  And I can't quite parse the way Mr. Roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting, and then throws on paranormal experiences.

As escapist literature, I've read worse, but for something that seems to be striving towards realism, I just don't know
