This is a flaw-full book. I'll only write the flaws at the book's beginning so I won't tell you anything of the plot just in case you want to read this book. For example:

1)  The killer at the beginning was killing persons which names appear on Poe's books. How does he knows the name of one person who went to Vegas for one night just to swindle the casino?

2)  If you go to Vegas for the very first time you'll learn in the first hour or so that for a one-buck-tip you can leave your car at any valet parking any time you want. And if you want to spare the buck you'll park for free in the same place. Now my point. The Vegas scammer was not her/his first time in Vegas, so why he/she parked the car in a gloomy parking lot when it was the valet parking? And within the valet there always is a security detail. So why risk his/her life?

3) How can be that the best profiler in LVPD oozes Scotch at night and at day nobody notices it or pretend not to?

4) Susan was deranged. Why? Because she was literally raped and she liked it. After that she raped her partner and the worst of all she spoke with her late husband all over the book.

5) You can really skip all the pages that includes Susan's niece.

And I can keep writing more flaws but I'll tell you the book's story
