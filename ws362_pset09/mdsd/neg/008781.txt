I tried to read this book, but could not finish it.  The book had an interesting message, but it was lost in the inaccuracies, broad sweeping statements, and linear logic.  

His comments about Peak Oil were inaccurate.  There are plenty of books (1,000 Barrels a Second, for example) that address the issues accurately with much more thoughtful insight.    

With regard to broad sweeping statements he makes comments like the southeast is prone to individuality and violence.  He failed to mention that when it comes to a sense of community and willingness to help their fellow man there is no better place to live then the southeast.  (For the record I am originally from the upper Midwest, but lived in the southeast for 7 years.)

Much of his prognostications about the future are linear, that is if a then b then c.  The author is in his late 50s and I would think by this time he would have figured out that life is a dynamic process that constantly adjusts to its environment.  If the cost of energy is too high people buy better gas mileage cars, drive less, close off portions of the house in the winter, don't use the air conditioner, purchase smaller homes, etc.  If the environment changes people constantly adjust including me, the author, and you.

What bothers me most about the book is that young people with less "life-experience" will read this book and believe this is the way it is going to be.  The author's book is just one more scenario of what could happen in the future.  But if life is a dynamic process, the constant adjustments to the environment makes it really hard to predict what will occur
