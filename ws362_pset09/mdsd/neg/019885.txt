Mr. Geisler is far from an expert on many of these topics.  I feel he just flipped through other peoples books and wrote down what he wanted to present to others.

Example is, his talks on say Zen.  Anyone whose spent an hour online knows that the whole point of Zen or Eastern Religions, is to achieve an allocentric state of being, aka, enlightenment.

One of the problems is, in the West (USA) the ego is taught as being part of the brain that...blah blah blah

The ego isnt part of the brain, its your symbol of yourself, resulting from being selfcenterd.  By meditating, aka, keeping your attention on something else, aka, whats infront of you (the moment), you can go beyond this egocentric state, the state that leads to suffering.

In this allocentric state, time feels to have stopped, life feels blissfull and one has gone beyond fear.

The rulers dont want that...

p.s. 

...the fools will laugh, but the wise will understand
