I got this book because of the fame of John Gary and the big title of the book. I managed to go through half of the book and finally, I cannot stand it and throw it away.

Basically, this book gives you 9 principles to bring miracles to your life, like eating healthy, love as if it is your first love, blablablah. Yeah, it is true, but it is also totally vain and misleading. For example, everybody knows that if you eat healthy food and work out intensively four times a week, two hours each time, you will definitely be fit as supermodel. But, can anybody really do that if somebody just told you to do so? It has to be tricky to deal with like finding the right and affordable workout program, finding the incentive, etc.

What I found ridiculous is that John kept saying that if you believe in his nine principles, then you can do whatever you want. Even superman cannot do that! Well, John, have you accomplished all of your wishes in your life? Belief is necessary for any success, but it is not a guarantee for all successes.

Also, John made some metaphors to prove his points, but most of them don't make enough or any sense, at least to me. Another reason I hate the book is that it takes the first 1/3 to boast his former achievements, like 12 bestsellers, without touching the core topic of this book.

If you are looking for practical miracles in this book, I assure you that you will be practically disappointed, period
