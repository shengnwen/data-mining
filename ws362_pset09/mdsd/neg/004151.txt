I don't think you can really write a book to teach someone to be funny.  Fortunately the author does not even attempt that task.  Judy talks a lot on the structure of jokes and setting up punch lines.  I guess I have a hard time buying into this cookie cutter approach of humor.  I have not yet read her latest book so I can't speak to that but I would not recommend buying this book
