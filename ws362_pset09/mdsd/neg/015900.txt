Although the book boasts what seems as an interesting approach, it rarely lives up to the idea of cross-breeding geography with studies of the Internet. I found myself lost in endless rants on what can now be assumed to be common wisdom (i.e. explanations and definitions of the www, e-mail, usenet, etc.). Furthermore, I have found a lot of typos, which I find not only sloppy, but simply disgusting given the price of the book. Methodologically the book seems very rich, but it fails to elaborate thorougly on issues. An example of the latter would be the chapter on cyberspace, which quotes many authors being of relevance to the study of cyberspace, but how exactly is not thorougly discussed, it is merely mentioned. 

On a more theoretical level, I find the authors' emphasis on spatiality intriguing, but not as relevant as they pose it is. I strongly disagree with their virtual / actual distinction, which can only clutter theoretical discussions on the implications of cyberspace on our lives. I fail to see why people still metaphysically dichotomize the so-called 'real world' with the digital world. Sure, there are differences, but who would disagree networked information technologies have an impact on us?

Just what the future of cartography / geography will be remains extremely shady and mysterious. Sad but true
