This book is more about feel good stories of people who started a business and they liked what they were doing.  If you liked Chicken Soup for the Soul, you will probably like this.  I was looking for a book to give some  ideas of what good businesses someone could do part-time and make some  extra money.  These stories covered various set up costs and barely gave an  idea of what is needed.  The book basically sums up to be: Find out what  you like and make a plan.  If you already figured that out, don't buy the  book
