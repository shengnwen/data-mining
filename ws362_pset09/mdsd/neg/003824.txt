Why would someone with such a low opinion of motherhood and babies have an obsessive need to bear offspring with a husband she doesn't live with and who, by the way, is the age of some great grandfathers? From the eye-catching title, I was expecting a humorous story about an older mom juggling career, marriage and motherhood. Instead, I found a disturbing glimpse into the life of a woman so unable to connect with her husband and children she lets readers in on her fantasies of killing them. Someone please alert social services!
