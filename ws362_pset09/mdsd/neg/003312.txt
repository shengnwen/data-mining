While the concept of this book makes sense, application in the life of  a mother doesn't. I have four children and can't possibly retrain myself to think only in terms of my stomach. Basically the author wants you to think about how you sit, stand, carry your baby, cough, sneeze, lie down, get up and that's on top of the daily excercise routine. As an added bonus, she tells you that one jacknife can undo weeks of work! I know that at 3 am if one of my children starts crying, I don't stop to think about how to properly get out of bed first. I'm just trying to quiet my child before all of the others are awake too. That's too much of a time investment for me to make just to mess it up with one mistake.
