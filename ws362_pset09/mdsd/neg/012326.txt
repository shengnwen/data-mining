I tried to read this book, but only made it about 50 pages.  Despite the many rave reviews and status of this book, it did not ring true to me. I read it while vacationing in the Galapagos, and I just didn't buy it.  I love the genre, Krakauer being number one.  In the Heart of the Sea, etc, all good.  But this one did not work for me.  Sorry
