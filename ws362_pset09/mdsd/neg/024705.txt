I AM CURRENTLY READING THIS BOOK AS A MANDATORY OUTSIDE READING BOOK FOR MY 11TH GRADE ENGLISH CLASS. I AM ON CHAPTER THREE AND I STILL HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING ON EXACTLY. FAULKNER'S USE OF WORDING IS EXTREMELY CONFUSING AND DOES NOT CAPTURE THE READER AT ALL.ALONG WITH READING THE BOOK WE HAVE TO COMPLETE A PROJECT EXPLAINING THE PLOT AND MAIN THEMES. HOW CAN I DO THIS IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK ITSELF?THIS BOOK IS SAID TO BE A GREAT PEICE OF AMERICAN LITERATURE BUT I DISAGREE COMPLETELY.I THINK IT'S REALLY BAD
