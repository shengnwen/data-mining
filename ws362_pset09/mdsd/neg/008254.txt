I was disappointed in this book, having been a big Carson fan when Johnny had the helm of the Tonight Show. This book really sounded like Ed had some steak and margaritas with a hack writer and gave him a cut of the profits to put his stories together into a book. I give the two stars for Ed's stated affection for Johnny, and he has a couple of good stories to tell, but he repeats himself quite a bit and  after a few chapters I found myself saying "OK Ed, give me some substance". Just a light piece of drivel I wished I didn't waste my time on.
