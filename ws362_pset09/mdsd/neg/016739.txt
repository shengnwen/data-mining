This is real lightweight stuff. Lacks depth and lacks details to be of any help to the serious expat-wannabe. I think many of the reviews full of over-the-top praise must be written by the author's friends or at least by those in the same clique. Skim this book while you're having a latte at Border's and save yourself some money
