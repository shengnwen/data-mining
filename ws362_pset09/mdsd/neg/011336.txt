This might make a good book for your teenage kid trying to learn about small business but other than that I dont think it would be helpful.  If you really want the details of how to create and grow a real business (especialy high tech) and get funded, you should read "The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs"  (Stathis).  It makes this book looks like preschool.
