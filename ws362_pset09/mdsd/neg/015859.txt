I hardly know how to begin. First, I guess, the history: the Franklin Expedition provided one of the most enduring mysteries of arctic exploration. The fate of the crew was finally determined when some of their well preserved bodies were found on the ice and autopsies done. Bad bear meat seemed the main culprit -- in short food poisoning. This is not to discount the suffering that must have been their lot when their ship was trapped in the ice.

But this book! It's probably 600 pages too long, and yes, I did wade through it, but I found myself constantly wondering why I was bothering. The plot thread into the "thing" on the ice and Francis Crozier's  mental ruminations became, for me, tedious in the extreme. The constant descriptions of the suffering of the men, the slide into the depravity of cannibalism, the whole "what's out there?" just became burdensome. And the mysterious Eskimo girl with no tongue? Please! I suppose that when someone devotes enough time to a book to write over 700 pages, you almost owe them a read. I kept thinking "it'll improve," right up until the end... when it didn't.

Reviews say Simmons is an eloquent and beautiful writer. Maybe so. But not here. Not for me in this book. The size and heft of the novel make it great for a door stop or to press flowers in. It's not one that you'd want to re-read
