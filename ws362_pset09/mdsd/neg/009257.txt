The reason why the little boy finds the lecture so unbearable is never made clear. Was the subject matter too advanced for him or was the learned astronomer an exceptionally poor speaker? We'll never know. However we should remember that Walt Whitman wrote this poem half a century before the Wright Brothers first flight. To people of his day space flight would have been the wildest of fantasies. Perhaps in those days it was enough to simply look at the stars and enjoy their beauty. But to a 21st century child space represents very real adventure, wonder and danger. Such a child is unlikely to understand this story which seems dated and perhaps even anti-intellectual. 

P.S. Over the last five years I have shared my telescope with more than 50,000 people, most of them school children. In the October 2004 addition of Sky & Telescope magazine you will find an article I wrote about a starparty I conducted for a group of children living in a homeless shelter. 

Show a child Saturn, or some other astronomical object, and he will pepper you with questions about its size, distance, age and composition. Most importantly he will ask how we were able to figure those things out. Answering his questions will not stifle his creativity or bore him. In fact it will do just the opposite. 

Science has a beauty all its own and that beauty is often best recognized by children. To say otherwise is patronizing
