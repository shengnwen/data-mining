This book is indeed 'pedagogically sound'; the trouble is:  it likes the sound of its own voice, far too much, and plods on around the houses for far too long.  It is a Big Mac of a book: high calories--low nutrition. I wasted money buying it, don't you make the same mistake.  Buy something shorter, less cack-handed, and trendy
