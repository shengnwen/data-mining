The author has done a good job of scouring the antenna literature and summarizing all of the equations in one place.  The problem is the lack of any discussion about what the equations mean.  I am reminded of the definition of a college education given by Prof. McWhorter of Stanford, "the process of the professors notes becoming the student's notes without having passed through the mind of either."

If you are an experienced antenna designer, this book will be of help.  If you want to learn from scratch, try the 50 year old book by Kraus
