This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess
