While it looked promising at first, I found this book to be deeply lacking as it takes a secular view of faith and attempts to cast matters of spirituality into the mold of modern pseudo-intellectualism. If you are serious about studying the ancient texts of the bible you will need to dig deeper using other sources if you want a balanced perspective. The book seems to excel at amassing numerous factoids but fails to hold them together with the fabric of life
