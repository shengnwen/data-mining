Any book based on the premise that the Rosenbergs were innocent, deserving of beatification, victims of awful America, is not going to date well.  1977, I suppose, was a kind of high-water mark for that sort of thinking.  If you have a friend who thinks Stalin was unfairly maligned, this may be the book for him.

I was forced to read this book cover to cover by a vindictive college professor who assigned it to me (and me alone) as the subject for a class writing project.  I loathed every minute of it.    From its doctrinaire anti-anti-communist, anti-Americanism; its sub-Dos Passos modernism; its sophomoric delight in scatology (giggle, giggle, tee hee, Nixon has sex with Ethel Rosenberg and is then anally raped by Uncle Sam).  There are no fully-formed characters, just endless making of puerile political points.  Nixon-bad.  Time Magazine-bad.  America-bad.  Ethel Rosenberg-saint and martyr.  

Its like a bad book treatment of a very bad Ken Russell movie.  I'd rather eat jagged metal bits than be forced to read this pompous, train-wreck of a book ever again
