Yes, yes, there are some good concepts in this book, but overall it is very fluffy and most of the ideas are VERY poorly explained.  The charts are pure rubbish and only work to confuse the reader.  Also, most of the ideas will rarely ever work, which means you have to work and work at it over and over to get someone who will agree to your terms.

Essentially, the book contains alot of great pipedream ideas that may work someday for someone with enough effort.

Don't waste your time with this book if you know anything about real estate.  You may want to buy it if you are a beginner
