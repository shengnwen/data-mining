      I took up this book for my course in economics and i found the book clear and examples quite relevant. However, our calculus background was rather weak and we were left to study integrals by oursleves. Because of this, most of us floundered in the text and could not fully appreciate some of the more essential steps of the proofs. The solutions to many examples requires a solid background in calculus to fully appreciate and, at times, even understand since certain steps are ommited. So much so that our eco teacher, with a degree in engineering mind you, admitted the book was a bit too terse and spent most of the time explaining the calculus that we learnt very little of actual statistics.
      In short, master your calculus or this book will only give you a rough feel for elementary statistics but will definitely not arm you to take up higher stat courses
