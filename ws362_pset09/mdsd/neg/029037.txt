My 3 1/2 year old daughter is a huge Munch fan and likes this one well enough, but it's my least favourite.  She tends to memorize books and quote them constantly, and I'm not thrilled with the "hey, you dumb...." mantra.  This is kind of minor, but how was it that the pigs showed up at school after Megan locked them back in at home? If you're wanting to add to your Munch collection, he's written better.  Alligator Baby and Thomas's Snowsuit are fun without the insults and a little more logically consistent
