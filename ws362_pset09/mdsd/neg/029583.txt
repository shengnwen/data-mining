What this book does well is highlight some of the military strategy in the Yom Kippur War in easy to understand terms.  
But it is not a good book for learning about what actually happened in the war, wartime diplimatic manuevers, or how or why the war ended.  The book skips these topics.  If you want to learn about those things, you will have to read another book.
