I must agree with the first review. Although this book is well-researched, it suffers from a complete lack of understanding. Foucault's entire philosophy is junked in this attempt to apotheosize yet another French thinker...  And if the author abstains from excessive jargon, I say it is  because he cannot understand and effectively use that jargon; he is beneath  the contemporary intellectual current
