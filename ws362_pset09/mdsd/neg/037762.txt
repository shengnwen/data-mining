This is a puzzling book.  It seems to be addressed to Jews in general.  But it doesn't appear to have much advice for most of them.  Of course, Rushkoff is completely free to follow whatever religious views he pleases.  The question is whether this book has much to offer anyone, Jewish or non-Jewish.

Rushkoff traces the history of Judaism, a religion he appears to feel is not quite monotheistic enough!  Let's just say that I would not have thought of this criticism.  He then deals with the question of whether Jews are a race or whether they are simply individuals who follow Judaism as an idea.  Well, that is a good question.  Perhaps Jews ought to be more active in seeking converts.  But I think this exaggerates reality: plenty of people convert to Judaism.  

Another problem with the claim of Judaism simply being a collection of individuals is this: denial of rights to Jews is an attack on not only specific individuals, but also on the Hebrew-speaking people as well as on human rights in general.  It does no good to pretend that there is no such thing as homo sapiens, or no such thing as the Hebrew-speaking people.  

Well, what does the author think of Zionism?  It's too religious for him!  Had Zionism only been secular, it would have worked!  

With all due respect to the author, this is totally preposterous.  A typical early kibbutz was about the most secular community one could have imagined.  Attacks on Zionism have generally been due to the secularism of the Zionists.  Even religious attacks on Zionism would not be mitigated were the Zionists all to assure everyone of their secularism!  Zionists do insist on rights to life, liberty, and property.  But this is true for both religious and secular Zionists.  Were all Zionists secular, they would still demand their rights.

I'm sure the author means well.  But I do not recommend this book to anyone
