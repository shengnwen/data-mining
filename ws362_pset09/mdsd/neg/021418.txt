My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.

Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one
