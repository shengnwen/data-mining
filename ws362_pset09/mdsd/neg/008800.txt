A big fan of Lehane, I was LOVING this book in the beginning, thinking to myself what a great choice I had made buyingit.It was interesting, funny, etc and seemed to be leading to a very compelling mystery to solve.  Midway thru the book, things got a bit vague as I was not able to figure out how some of the various happeneings connected with each other, but I was relieved when the 2 main charachters, Patrick and Angie, were also questioning the events themselves, not knowing what to make of them. Expecting things to come together from that point on and become a bit more focused, the plot got even more convoluted.  I continued reading  for the hell of it but I have finished the book and still not sure who was intended dead in the car "accident" (Trevor or his wife?) as well as who was really after who.When Jay Becker returned from Nantucket and knew Desiree was alive, Trevor then sent him to Florida to find her and kill her.  Why would Jay accept an assignment to kill? He was  one of the "good guys", right? In addition, a few holes were left in the plot (eg. when the "Weeble" and the chaffeur (I think his name was Cushing) were killed on the bridge in Florida, the police search reported they were residents of Atlanta ,(NOT employed by Trevor) and that their neighbors had seen the almost every day.  Yet earlier in the book the Weeble was definitely part of Trevors
squad of cronies- this was never cleared up.. I was left quite frustrated by this book and because of it may never read Lehane again.  Anyone agree
