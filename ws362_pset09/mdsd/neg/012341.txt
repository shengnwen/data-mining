I'm about half way through this book and I'm finding it a little boring. I've read so many books about Diana, that I find myself skimming over the stuff that's been written SO MANY times. As a result, I'm probably missing any new stuff that might actually be in here. It's also very hard to find a reading flow--it seems more like an academic text or report, not a biography. Good try at compiling old news into a new book, but I'd recommend waiting for the discount rack or skipping altogether.
