I found this book to be so basic and limited in its approach that it provided little or no helpful information.  As an example, on &quot;school&quot; it gives advice such as &quot;Don't tell your child he is wasting time in school and might as well get a job&quot;.  I found the examples given for coversations were unrealistic.  The one topic I most wanted to review - homework - wasn't even covered
