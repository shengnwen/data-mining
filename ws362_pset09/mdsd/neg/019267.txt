And I do mean REALLY STUPID. Like a previous reviewer, I bought this to keep me occupied on a long flight. When, within the first 20 or so pages, the author introduces two made-up gimmicks that are central to the plot, I knew I was in trouble. First up is a liquid nuclear explosive. Yeah, right. Anyone who even slept through high school physics would know that's a crock. Then there is the super oxygen carrying blood transfusion that gets the major bad guy through an execution. In a science fiction story, the spare use of such gimmicks might be ok. But here the author uses them because he just isn't bright enough to come up with a good story otherwise. 
   Had I been on a train trip, this book would have gone right out the train window. However, they frown on opening windows on airplanes so I just left it on the plane. I probably should have taken it off with me and tossed it in the trash to save the next passanger in my seat from having to deal with this
