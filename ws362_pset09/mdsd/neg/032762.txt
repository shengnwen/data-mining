I'm part way into this book, I have about 200 pages left, and I'm already confused.   For instance how is everyone in the little unheard of community of Ravenkill right up with the happenings in The Hague?  Does world wide news reach little burgs that fast.  And what was with Andrew Franconia the innkeeper that he calls the US Marshalls as soon as Maggie registers?   I don't get it, everyone seems to know what everyone else is doing faster than they can move about.   So I guess I'll have to finish the story to find all the answers if they are revealed
