I get what the author was trying to do with this book.  However, given that she used an old fashioned, tongue and cheek, call and response type of language, it's better suited for adults rather than children IMHO.  When I first read the book I knew that it was meant to be taken lightly.  For instance, there is a part of the story in which the grandfather essentially questions why God would have given such a sweet child such 'nappy' hair.  While an adult might chuckle over this, a child might actually cringe because they are still dealing with this question in their own minds ('Why me?').  

All in all, this book was the first of several children's books attempting to affirm the positives in African hair.  In this sense, it should be respected as such.  However, first is not always best.  Subsequent books have done increasingly better in providing needed self esteem in this area for our youth.  If adults want to buy this, they should be prepared to keep it to themselves rather than force it upon their children.  Young kids might not be ready to grasp it's implications.
