This book started out promisingly, and the first part of it is an interesting introduction to American law.  Unfortunately, the last half of the book is almost exclusively about politics and administration.  He spends whole sections on things like New Deal agencies and Great Society programs.  Certainly, these were "laws" passed by Congress, but they don't tell us anything about the justice system.  If you want to learn about the American legal system, I'd suggest Law 101 instead.  It's not historically based, but you'll learn a lot more about how the system functions, and the principles on which it is based, than from this book
