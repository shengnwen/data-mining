This book may be helpful to some, but I found it to be way over my head.  It is extremely technical.  I would not have bought it if I had known this.  I only understood about 25 percent of what he is saying.  I have a legal background -- not medical or technical.  I gave it to my Lyme doctor.  He flipped through it and found it interesting.
