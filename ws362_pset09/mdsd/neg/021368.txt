I got this book for my son when we got to the point that he had so many questions (technical in nature) that I couldn't remember the exact answer to (or don't know, not being a boy). I turned to my male friends for help, and one recommended "The Guy Book," which he had given to his  5 boys and they liked a lot. My son loved  it. It has a lot of info on boys, their bodies, their issues with friends,  and such necessary details as how to buy a corsage and tie a tie. My son asked intelligent questions, sparked by the book, and has read bits of it over and over.

The book is laid out in a non-threatening way, with fun illustrations and enough silly entries that it draws the reader in so that when they get to potentially embarassing material they just keep on going. It's also divided up so that, like the car repair manual it emulates, you can dip in to the one specific piece of info you need and then put it down until later.

Because of his interest, I've given this book to my nephews and recommended it to friends with pre-teens. Some of my nieces found it really useful, too, because it explains a lot about how and why boys do certain things. 

I recommend this especially to parents who have trouble talking to their kids beyond a certain age, or single moms who, like me, just don't know the right answer. (If you don't know the answers, I recommend you read it. Then you'll know what you need to know to answer the next set of questions.)

The only thing wrong with this book is that I didn't write it. ;-
