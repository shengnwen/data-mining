Others have drawn attention to Hertzberg's civil tone. We have all become accustomed to discourse via amplified insult; measured voices such as Hertzberg's are refreshing indeed. Having said this, it amounts to nothing more than a shame. When a leftist advances his argument with the typical manic lunacy, we may simply dismiss him as a fool.
