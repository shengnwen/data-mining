 While packaged in a "new and daring" box, it turns out to be the same old stuff.... Nothing new here...just Maya, or more correctly a subset of Maya. Basic Hindi or Buddhist thought given a Paranoid Conspiracy Theory twist...please be compassionate with the poor controlbots and dominators...they know not what they do. The book lacks any kind of real development of ideas. The lame automatic drawing/writing/etc. hardly qualifies as Magick...I did like the insight of all writing/drawing being influenced by the "spiritual realm"...but to engage in this is just spiritualism...automatic or willed. Besides, consider that these spirits/angels/demons are really Maya at work...JUST a PRODUCT of MIND.  MARK PAXSO
