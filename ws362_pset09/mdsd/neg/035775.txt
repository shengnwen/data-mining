I should have read some of the earlier reviews on this Website.  This book may serve fans of the newer Superman, but it does little for the fans of the older Superman.

Superman comics lost my readership in 1970, when everything turned bigger and shinier.  Except for the first 7 pages of the chronology in the back, this book deals exclusively with the additions to the Superman legend which have taken place then.  The illustrations and the text are supposed to impress the reader with how great Metropolis is, what a giant corporation LexCorp is, and how terrifying the villains are.


I would gladly trade in all this hyperbole for the writing style of the earlier writers
