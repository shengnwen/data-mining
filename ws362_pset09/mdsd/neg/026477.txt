I stumbled upon 'Mantissa' after reading 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' and 'The Magus' - both extraordinary novels.
This story lacked the direction and seduction of the others. The sexual imagery was discursive and confusing, though Fowles' dry wit was still evident. 

Fowles' more notable characters display intensity, a need that cannot be masked. The lead character in this novel seems more on the defensive, recoiling into clouds of random fantasy rather than depicting an unconscious divulsion of desire.
