If anyone is new to the Dark series by Christine Feehan, you absolutely need to READ DARK PRINCE FIRST.  Feehan introduces a new race of paranormal humans, and you need to know what about their Carpathian/vampire universe.  Also, what happens in this book deals directly with what happened in Dark Prince.  Dark Desire is not standalone.  After Dark Prince you can almost pick up any of the other books.

Dark Desire has very little romance in it, so if you want to see some romance, don't bother.  It's just one big pool of blood and torture.  People are strangled, stabbed, staked, shot, mangled, manacled, healed and then injured again, bitten, bled...it just doesn't stop!  Oh, and they have a lot of sex even whey they are still bleeding.  Whatever.

And you almost need a scorecard and a handy family tree to piece together who did what and which people are being healed and by whom, and who else is near death at any particular moment.  Not that I want to be babied through a book, but everything happens awfully fast. and it seems that way too much goes unsaid with these people, as if Feehan didn't bother to organize the nebulous mass in her head.  There are too many characters and too many sideplots.  Think of it as a cross between a gorefest and a soap opera.

Suffice it to say that everyone is okay in the end.  So now you can get this from the library and skim to the sideplots that you're interested in. (for me that's the Gergori subplot).  On the whole it's not a disaster, but NOT great in terms of a romance
