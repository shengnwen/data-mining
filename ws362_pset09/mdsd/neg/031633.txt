I can not recommend this book.  While reading it I found 4 major errors.  This leads me to believe that the author did not do any research nor did his editors do any fact checking.  The 4 errors I found are as follows: 1. The author states that no trace of the crew of the B-24 Lady Be Good was  ever found.  All but one of the bodies of the crew of the Lady Be Good were  found by the mid-1960s.  2. The author states that Zeke was the allied name  for a kamikaze.  Zeke was the U.S. Navy code name for the Japaneese  Mitsubishi Zero-sen fighter plane.  The U.S. Navy gave Japaneese fighters  male names and bombers female names.  Any WWII historian should know this.   3. The part about the rescue of Eddie Rickenbacker says that a 2-man  Kingfisher float plane spotted their raft and they were picked up by a PT  boat.  In reality, the Kingfisher landed on the ocean and picked them up.   Since the plane only had two seats, the survivors held on the wings and the  pilot taxied across the water to an island.  4.  In the section on the  death of Joe Kennedy Jr. he states that the mission was to attack the  London Gun sites.  This is incorrect, the mission was to attack  U-boat  pens.  He also incorrectly states the crews of the bombers were to bail out  over German held territory.  The crews were to bail out over England and  the bomber would be flown by radio control to the target. There are other  things in the book that just don't seem correct.  I can not recommend this  book.  Mistakes like this make one doubt the accuracy of the rest of the  book.  The author is supposed to be a WWII historian.  If he is, then why  are such obvious errors in the book
