Short version: A half dozen scientists and engineers are working in the arctic, attempting to use explosives to create a huge iceberg that can floated to someplace in dire need of fresh water. They become marooned and only have a few hours before the explosives they've planted go off and kill them. However, a Russian sub may be able to save them.

Koontz had the right idea when he originally released this book under a pseudonym, because it's a stinker.

The set-up building to the scientists being stranded and the deadline imposed by the explosives is unbelievable. Suffice it to say that a natural disaster hundreds of miles away just happens to target the exact location of where the scientists are working. Additionally, they've planted explosives in the ice that are on timers and can't be switched off.

Besides suffering from incompetence, the characters have unbelievably bad luck (beyond being targeted for destruction by Mother Nature, that is): 

-One is highly phobic, terrified of (you guessed it): ice & snow (because of an accident that killed her parents)!
-Another's family was murdered in China
-Another's had close relatives assasinated while in office and is disillusioned by politics (a thinly disguised JFK jr?)
-Another lost his son to cancer
-Another's psychotic

If that's not bad enough, the main characters are a husband and wife team who run the project. She had a relationship with another scientist that ended badly before getting married to the current guy. So who does her husband pick to spend months on ice with? Why the ex-boyfriend of course! Because he was the best at what he did (excuse me, wouldn't second best have made more sense?)

If you don't mind really bad dialog and trite situations, give this book a try. If you want a really intense adventure/thriller try Wilbur Smith's "Hungry as the Sea" or anything by Nelson DeMille
