This book includes basic information on mood disorders, including major depression, mania, and hypomania, all components of what used to be called manic-depression and is now known as bipolar disorder.

I found other books more helpful as far as scientific knowledge and explication.  I found Kay Redfield Jamison's books insightful, inspiring, as well as incredibly knowledgeable.  I found this book annoying, and it relied too heavily on the double whammy of an explanation or point made by one of the medical authors with a lay person follow-up by Nancy, a patient with bipolar disorder whose experiences and anecdotes are leaned on heavily throughout the book.   In trying to warm up what they perhaps feared might be an overly objective, medical reference book, which it is far, far from being anyway, the authors used Nancy as a device to humanize the condition.  

I got very tired of Nancy and her loopy examples.  When not preening over the authors' attention as the pet subject of the book, she was just illogical and somewhat strident or annoying.  She had a very definite "voice," which to me was loud and probably possessing a strong New York accent.  I feel for Nancy and her experiences with this disorder, but her examples had no resonance for me and detracted from any actual information. 

Go for Jamison definitely and browse through some other newer sources.  Skip this one
