The novel starts out well, the Enterprise finds a major artifact on a distant world and investigates.  Then they go through the window and turn into crabs.  

Now, that in itself isn't a story killer.  However, these crabs culture is explained over and over for the next hundred or so pages, with some salvation in short chapters where Spock can't understand the totally alien technology.

It gets boring very fast.  I wanted to yell to the author, "enough!  I get it...they are xenophobic and have color/movement based language!"

Speaking of boring, the story is very non-dramatic.  Spock tries to decipher the technology while Kirk/crab slides down hills on his back chasing a female crab.  

I would have given this story 2 stars because it was boring but not bad...until the end.  The post story briefing is, to put it mildly, stupid.  Without giving it away for those determined to read this, the ending is somewhat like if, having seen a horror movie and deciding that it was so bad you will never watch a movie again.  There is a massive overreaction to the events in the story and to the artifacts.  It also felt like the author was tired of his/her own story and decided to just be done with it.

There are tons better Trek novels, don't waste your time on this one
