Since I was a child, people have been talking about this book.  It seems to be talked about on the news and just in general conversation.  I have to be honest.  I am lazy and this book is just TOO LONG.  I don't have time to read a book that is over 1000 pages.  And this book is sneaky.  It doesn't seem like it's so long, but the writing is on these pages that are as thin as t***** paper (the paper you use to wipe feces).  I am sure this is probably an okay book, but I just don't have the time to read this whole thing.
