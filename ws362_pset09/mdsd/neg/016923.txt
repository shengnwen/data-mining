Hmm, you'd think for such a paradigm breaking book Lubenow would have the credentials necessary for this critical analysis. No, Ph.D. in anthropology (or even in the biological sciences for that matter), no published peer-reviewed journal articles dealing with the issue at hand. If he's so correct in this, why didn't he ever submit his work to the scientific journals (where REAL science is done afterall)? He must be afraid of honest criticsim, that's why you publish to those who already agree with you, it's called preaching to the choir. 

oh wait, it's probably because of the conspiracy...yeah that's it
