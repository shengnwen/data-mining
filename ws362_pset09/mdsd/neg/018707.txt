Will, a neoconservative often mistaken for a conservative of the old mold, presents his case for the Leviathan state.  To Will, if government is good, then more government is better.  He sees the state as the rightful architect of society, trusting politicians and bureaucrats to steer the proles along the path to greatness, meaning Empire.  I regard neoconservatives as Judas goats;  Will is a prime example.  This is the man who, a few years ago, said that it is time America repealed &quot;the embarrassing Second Amendment.&quot
