Has anyone recently pointed out...that Teddy Kennedy's dog is named SPLASH???

Maybe they should make this a series of books.  Bill Clinton can be featured in the next edition with his dog named I RAPE WOMEN.  Just an idea.

And who's the artist?  Was he working with photos of Ted from 1969?  Ted hasn't looked that svelte since the sixties.  Where's the neckbrace
