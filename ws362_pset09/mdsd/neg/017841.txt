Some notes:
-- Pseudo-sociology or 'soc. lite,' masquerading as a more significant endeavor.  Author occasionally provides block quotes from more in-depth works by real academics; those may be the best parts of the book. 
-- Superficial analyses. Interesting questions present themselves but author always reaches for her pre-fabricated answers. She seems to have approached this project with a simple thesis, rather than a hypothesis and an open mind.  She seems to have written her conclusions before she even started her "research." 
-- Author sees/presents most things in "black & white." By which I mean simplistically, not in terms of race. B/c actually she totally ignores factors like race and class, i.e., factors that would complicate and add depth to her analysis.   
-- Author has little sympathy, empathy, or compassion for her subjects (except perhaps the sorority girls).  
-- Bias is, of course, a part of any qualitative research project.  But here the author does not explore or question her own biases, perceptions, etc. She simply runs with them. Frequently judgmental and condescending.  
-- Poorly written/in need of an editor: misuses words, inconsistencies abound. Lacking coherent structure at all levels (from the formation of sentences and paragraphs, to the overall lack of coherence between chapters. Fails to explain how pieces fit together. No methodological or theoretical framework). 
-- Wicca chapter is particularly appalling for its willingness to make sweeping generalizations. No acknowledgment of how limited the author's bases are for such conclusions.  
-- List of complaints could go on . . .
