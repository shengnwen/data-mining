Using the borrowed style of Ann Coulter (who he thinks is witty and smart and funny), Bernie has written a clunker. Let's not mistake this book for anything less than what it is - a smear book. The kind Bill O'Reilly was rallying against when written by a lefty, but brings the author on to rave about when written by a conservative. Here - the title makes it seem like he will have an honest debate. Instead it is all about the left, and how the right will not take it anymore. 
The targets are the usual suspects, but the main target no longer is Michael Moore (your remember the 100 people screwing up America book where all but a handful were liberals - and included television hosts of info-mercials!), but is Rosie O'Donnell. Somewhere along the lines, she became public enemy number one.
There is nothing new in this book that you cannot read online, or hear on any conservative radio program. You know the drill.
1) There is a liberal bias in the media.
2) Rosie and others work for the Democratic party.
3) Liberals get together and go over talking points (must be since they cannot have a thought of their own according to Bernie).
4) We hate Rush because he is successful. It has nothing to do with him being a racist, sexist, or overall piece of trash drug user.
I read these books, and usually my blood boils. This one could not get any reaction like that. Take it for what it is - a political book that tries to be funny, and fails.
