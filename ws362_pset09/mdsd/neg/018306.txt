I was extremely disappointed with this book. I couldn't even believe how biased towards Paul McCartney it was! On many of John Lennon's songs, there is either no more than a paragraph written about it, or it says how Paul was really the "innovator" but "John got the credit for the innovation". It was completely ridiculous. I agree with the reviewer who said this book was another attempt of Paul McCartney's to re-write Beatles history, what with the author trying to portray John as a lesser talent via snide little remarks scattered throughout the book.

Even if this book was completely neutral, I would have disliked it, because it doesn't always cite the inspirations for the songs, or explain the influences for writing them. It mainly explains what the song is about, which is a waste considering all you would have to do is read the lyrics of the song. 

To fans who are interested in the real history of The Beatles' songs, hit the Internet. Of course a lot of the information is only speculation, but that's better than what you'll get from this book.
