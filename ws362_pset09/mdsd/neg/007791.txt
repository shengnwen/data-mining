I am not sure why this book was written, except maybe, the author wanted to add another title to his published works. This book is basically comprised of briefs from various chapters of the author's two previous books (which were very good, by the way). If you have read his two previous books and/or you are a seasoned manager, the book is repetetive and boring. The author gives many examples of real life scenarios but the stories go on and on for pages. A good book to read if you can't fall aslee
