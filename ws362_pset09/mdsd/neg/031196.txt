The original story was one of wonder and terror.  This version is mostly wonder, where the good stuff from the novel went.  Where is the arena, or the silent and unmoving gods, or the end of the universe?   This is only the monster story of the attack of the swine things.  Yeah, the swine things are important, but they are NOT the most important part of this wonderful short novel.  Unless you are a real comics fanatic, or hate the writing of Hodgson, don't bother with this rip off.  It's okay for what it does, but compared to the original novel, this is a couple of mentally retarded children drawing scary pictures
