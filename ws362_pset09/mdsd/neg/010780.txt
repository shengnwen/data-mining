This book might be okay for someone who's lived on a deserted island for the past 20 years, or has the IQ of 30 or below, but otherwise, I say "one star".  

This is one of the most poorly written "non-diet" books I have ever had the misfortune of reading.  It is almost an insult to one's intelligence because this woman is merely repeating much of what most of us have heard for years - and she can't even manage to do so  creatively.

An acquaintance from work asked me to read this book after her daughter bought it for her because she wanted to see if I didn't agree that many of the ideas in it undeniably paralleled Bob Schwartz' 'Diets Still Don't Work' book. Well, I read it, and,  I have to say, some of his ideas do indeed seem to have been 'reborn' (albeit poorly) in this book.

The 'dedication' from this woman appears rather lofty, as do the subsequent pages of 'testimonials' which, I deduced, were supplied to make the reader feel s/he was onto a lucky find.  Surprisingly, they all seemed rather shallow and written in a very singular style.  The entire body of the book has the feel that she's addressing naughty school children instead of attempting to show sincere compassion to  sensitive people who've no doubt paid good money just to learn genuinely helpful weight loss methods.  There are also numerous vague areas in the book that just don't make much sense: mixed messages about how and what to eat.  ...As if overweight people need any *more* confusion to muddle through in their weight-loss dilemmas.

Many of the suggestions she throws out there to take up space on the pages just aren't realistic.  I think Ms. Fleming just found an easy way to make some extra Christmas money for herself in 2005.  Good for her, but bad for the hopeful yet serious-minded  seekers
