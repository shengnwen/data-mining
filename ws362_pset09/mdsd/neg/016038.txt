In contrast to much of Feinstein's earlier work, this book does not give the feel of truly being behind the scenes with a team.  Instead it reads as a series of personal profiles interspersed with bland descriptions of games that really add very little that couldn't be found in a wire service recap.  Feinstein touches on the issues facing the team, but doesn't delve into them at all.  He spends much of the book talking about Kyle Boller, but he never analyzes why Boller struggles; indeed from reading the bulk of the book one might think that Boller is playing well.  It isn't until the last few pages of the book acknowledges that Boller was, in fact, the lowest-rated quarterback in the league.  He mentions in passing that Ray Lewis's play is slipping (actually he notes that John Madden mentions the slippage on Monday Night Football), but he never talks further about the issue.  Actually that is probably the best description of the weaknesses of this book: John Madden made more insightful comments about a player in one sentence on TV than Feinstein makes in the entire book.  All in all, while it was an easy read and has some interesting sections, the book as a whole was very disappointing.
