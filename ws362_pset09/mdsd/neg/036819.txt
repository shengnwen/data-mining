The Book of Nothing was much better. I am surprised at errors made on simple physical realities. Eclipse of sun is defined as earth's shadow covering sun's disc...  Sun's light reaching earth in 3 seconds... As one reviewer already mentioned, letter used for &quot;1&quot; is indistinguishable from &quot;I&quot;... I could not find much detail on &quot;constants&quot;, just speculations and what if's... Quotes sprinkled all over are much more fun to read..
