After finishing this book I have decided to write my shortest review ever for Amazon. I have two reasons for doing this:

1) There is not much I can say that probably hasn't been said by 2,408 other reviewers

2) Maybe Robert Jordan will follow my example and learn to be more concise with his next installment in this series

As has been stated this book could be sub-title "Much Ado about Nothing" with apologies to Shakespeare. The descriptions are incredibly over long (I have sympathy for the reviewer who had to actually LISTEN to all this.) and almost nothing is resolved in this novel. My only hope is that Jordan has managed to set the stage for the next installment in this series and according to his website he is intending to finish this series in the immediate future. I would only recommend this book if you are a devout fan of the series and intend on following it to its' conclusion. However if you do not want to labor through the 822 pages, just read the reviews here on Amazon and you will find all the events that take place in this novel described in a much more concise version without all the extraneous narrative
