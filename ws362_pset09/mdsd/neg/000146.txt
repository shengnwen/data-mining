I am a parent of a 3-year old.  The tapes were overall helpful in terms of parenting tips.  The information shared for strong willed children was a little too broad for my use.  It covered all ages, toddlers through high school.  I would like tapes that are specific to age groups as approach would change.  Buyers should be aware that the tapes have religious insertions all along the way.
