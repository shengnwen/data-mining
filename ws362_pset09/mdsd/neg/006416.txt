We were greatly disappointed in this travel guide since the information was out-of-date.  We spent a great deal of time locating a highly rated and recommended restaurant only to find that it had closed years ago.  Other recommended restaurants also did not meet the expectations according to the review criteria.  We tossed the book aside and relied on recommendations of the locals
