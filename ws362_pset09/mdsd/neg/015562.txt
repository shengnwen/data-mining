When will publishers realize that Royster's books are just plain wierd? This book goes nowhere; after 100 pages of Va. genaologies, anecdotes, and poorly put together themes, the book barely mentions the Swamp and one  cannot tell where in the world the author is going. He writes in a pleasing  style but his subject is incredibly disjointed. The same was true of his  earlier book &quot;This Destructive War.&quot;  I have given up on Royster;  he has forgotten that a book has to have a subject and must deal with a  subject in an orderly fashion
