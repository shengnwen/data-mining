archer was not himself anymore. i have to give this book up after trudged along about 2/5. this story is so boring and dead-beat. the dialogue also contrite and rigid. with several uninteresting characters created both sides of the atlantic. what cat and what mouse or hide and seek? from the very beginning, you've already known whodoneit, the left is to try your patience to drag along between lines to see how the author could arrange it in a more logic way. this is a regretful ending of my love of this once great master storyteller. good bye, mr. archer and thanks for the good memories to some of your wonderful stories
