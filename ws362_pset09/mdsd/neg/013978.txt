This is a vicious book written by someone who obviously hated Diana, Princess of Wales.  And if anyone is 'mentally ill' it is Lady Campbell.  I understand 'lady' Campbell had a very strange childhood.  Apparently, her parents could not decide whether she was a boy or girl!  And I think it created a 'crack' in her brain.

Diana paid dearly for standing up for herself and getting out of her pathetic marriage.  Her husband was a Prince who turned out to be a selfish toad.  She was definitely a lamb to the slaughter.  And as for saying that Diana was schizophrenic that is postively ludicrous!
