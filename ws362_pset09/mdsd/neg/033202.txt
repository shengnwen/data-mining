First off, when I recieved the book there was a cigarette hole burned on one of the pages. (Nice one!) Right out of the package.  Then when I opened it, I realized that all the claims that the book is based around are pretty far fetched and really cannot be substantiated.  Every time the Bible used the words like: Evil Ones, Sinner, Wicked, etc. aren't really talking about people, but fallen angels....ummm...what?!  

Supposedly John the Baptist refuted these angels in the gospels by saying, "You brood of Vipers!"  Umm...it doesn't take a rocket scientist to prove that in the sentence before (or the current one) says that he's talking with the Pharisees and Saduccees.  The Bible is very clear on that point and I'm not sure what the writer was thinking.  

Too much conjecture, and false analogies in my opinion.  I'm really sorry I bought this book.  I wished whoever burned the one page burned the rest of it too
