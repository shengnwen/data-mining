I cannot even begin to describe how utterly disappointed I am in Bethany House for publishing this ridiculous piece of drivel.

The characters are so shallow, predictable, and without any growth that they are not interesting in the least. Their constant "Leave it to Beaver" attitude about everything paints an unrealistic and vapid picture of what could have been some very interesting characters. 

The plot, while seeming to be promising in the beginning, turns out to move slower than molasses on a January morning, and is just about as entertaining. It takes about 300 pages for anything of note to occur in this novel, and when it does, it happens so suddenly and jerkily that it is out of place.

The entire novel consists of nothing more than pointless, inane chatter about the most mundane details that do not even pertain to the story! Perhaps the constant repetitive dialogue is meant to create character development, but it falls horribly, boringly short. They just keep discussing the same things and nothing ever happens.

The "Christian" element of the novel was a sorry as the rest of it. The simplistic, sappy, shallow theology is simply preaching to the choir, and badly at that. Ms. Hake, give us some credit for having intelligence, and offer us something of depth, PLEASE!

I think that what most makes this book especially horrible is the potential that was squandered. The general synopsis for the story could have made a wonderful novel, had it been better executed, and I am saddened at the thought of what a wonderful book I could have read. I felt as though I accidentally stumbled upon a poorly crafted young adult novel, rather than the high caliber work I generally expect from a Bethany House book.

I am sorely disappointed at having spent my time and money on such a ridiculous book.

If you'd like to read an EXCELLENT Christian novel set in the same time period, try "The Measure of a Lady" by Deeanne Gist, and you will NOT be disappointed.
