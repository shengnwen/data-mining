Everything is fine. Go back to sleep. Nothing happened here, move along. The government is honest. The Warren Report was totally comprehensive and answered all the questions. Believe. Obey. Go back to sleep. Everything is fine.

I did actually read this book. I will give one thing to the author, he certainly did a fine job finding many of the conflicts and contradictions in the "offical" story. Too bad he He didn't explain any of them. It is a fine research tool in that way. 

Unfortunately for Posner his attempts to "debunk" are wholly inadequate and unconvincing. In fact this book is so filled with nonsense and speculation it does more to BOLSTER the case against the "Oswald did it alone" story. If it is true that this was a case of the "lone nut" why would the explantions have to be so over-reaching and internally inconsistent? If it was a straighforward case, the the evidence should be equally straightforward and not so convoluted.

The authors "explanations" are unsupported by fact and at times you can see Posner reaching to the point of "I don't even need to prove it, it should be obvious"

If this is the best effort to prove the Oswald "lone nut" story I no longer have any doubt about the conspiracy theory. If the lone nut story was true there would be supporting evidence that was consistent with the real facts, all the facts and not just the ones cherry picked by the author.

Nice try Mr. Posner
