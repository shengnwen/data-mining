I had read this one before I read the author's book on Iraq and it is the best of the two, but still I felt the author was giving out second hand information.  She lived so briefly in the kingdom and did not even live in a native setting, so I do not believe she is a person who needs to be writing about the Saudis.  She is assuming to be an expert when in reality, that is rather a joke.  I think of this book as giving me a chance to be an outsider peeking in, for about five minutes.  There are plenty of good books out there on the Middle East, but unfortunately, none are written by this author.  She should find a new career
