When I initially bought this book I thought it would be more of a book on small changes I hadn't thought of before. But, the more I read it, the more I realized how stupid this book can be. The first part of this chapter is on how to breathe. I mean come on people. They also give exercises for eyeballs and bathroom yoga. I'm sorry but I'll pass. I also didn't care for the Christian feel I got with some of the "suggestions". Example p. 40-41 "Here are some other mealtime small changes you can make into habits. Say a prayer, either a ritual prayer from an organized religion or one you write yourself. Sing a song or recite a verse." Christian book is it? The 2 stars are for the inital chapter that got me interested in the book. The rest is junk.
