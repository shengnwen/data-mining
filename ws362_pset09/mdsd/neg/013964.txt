Would anyone like to join with me for a letter writing campaign getting Garwood's publisher to stop producing this drivel?

She should be banned from penning any setting after the sexual revolution because she's stuck writing characters from a time when men were men and women were morons.

Her formula (beautiful virgin from a torn family is stalked by a nutcase and rescued from a knight in shining armor) is once again applied in the modern day requiring too much "Suspension of Disbelief" from her readers.

Our Virgin: Laurant Madden, rich and sister to a sexy priest, she's beautiful, upbeat, saccharine sweet and has the IQ of a dung beetle.

Our Knight: Nich Buchanan, who is the thinly disguised romance novel reproduction of "Lethal Weapon" Martin Riggs, burned out missing-child finder for the FBI, all around stereotype.

Our Psycho: "The Heartbreaker" who kills luscious young women, adores Laurant, and likes to tease her brother by apparently confessing a crime and then teleporting out of the confessional.

Laurent's brother calls in Nick to watch over her as she is apparently the next target. Nick proves to be overly macho and arrogant, and somehow falls in love with the brainless Laurant, though God knows there's no explanation of WHY.

Watching the two main characters trying to fall in love I like watching a bunch of monkeys trying to hump a football.

So far, of her modern novels (this being the first) this is the best attempt to utilize the formula but it's still as limp in the middle, weighed down by pointless dialogue, and as totally lacking in sexual tension as "Guardian Angel" and her other critically disclaimed historicals.

Stick to the formula in her better written pieces like "Lion's Lady" or "The Prize"
