Full of holes and alot of overbearing personal philosophy.  I found myself crossing out lines of this text, as so much of this is conjecture and hyperbole.  The chapter on Violence is worth the cost of the book, however, I would recommend going to the library and saving your money.  Some directors swear by this text, thusly it is a potent force in the contemporary theatre.  However, many of these ideas have been chewed up and misused by so many inexperienced Bogart groupies that it has little more validity than, say, a Richard Foreman text in its extremely self-referential nature.
