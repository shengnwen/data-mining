Nice, fun, but superficial book which makes heroes of treasure hunters who destroyed half of the artifacts that they were digging for because of poor technique, put thousands of years old treasure around their wife's neck to take a picture, and secretly smuggled entire treasures out of the country where they were found (read: Schliemann).  Does not mention scholars who built their work on other scholars' work but took all the credit.  This would be a good book for a child under 12, but for anyone older than that, it is too much "popular" and not enough "science" and does make heroes out of antiheroes
