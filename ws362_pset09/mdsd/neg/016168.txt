the movie is a total bomb in every way, starring high school dropout hilary swank as a teacher trying to convince kids not to...drop out. the real story is a rehash of stand by me, the substitute, etc. i'm sure you could find 2 dozen previous examples of 'teacher who believes in at-risk youths' or 'teacher who cares when no one else did'. and they'd all be better than this nonsense. in addition, the kids (from all backgrounds) are all so cliched it's ridiculous. pass on this book.
