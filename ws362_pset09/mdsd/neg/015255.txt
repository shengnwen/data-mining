This unfortunate book suffers from an acute case of aphoristic intoxication, evidenced in such pithy morsels as: "like most cynics he was profoundly sentimetal about sex" and "our marriage was the meeting of zero and zero."

Although such modestly entertaining observations kept me plodding along, the book is a lame attempt at armchair beat philosophizing, ensnarled in a wholly unengaging plot and unbelievably boring characters. I first read about this greatest of books in Joe Ezterhas's biography, and it makes sense that he would consider its shallow machisimo the stuff of masterpieces.

Avoid this. Reread Day of the Locust. Recommended for only the most die-hard of Hollywood historians or cultural completists
