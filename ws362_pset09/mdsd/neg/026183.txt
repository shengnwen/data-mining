Well, while I enjoyed the biochemical explanations for sugar addiction, the 'diet' itself is like so many out there now.  Basically, stay away from sugars and white foods (except for that potato)..  It also seems to embody some of the glycemic index theories..  All in all, I wasn't impressed..  It's helped so many people though, it might be worth a shot for someone else.. GOOD LUCK
