I have never put down a book (actually, I have, once)
I Have never left a series  unfinished
I am leaving my third decade
I have read this book one and a half year ago. No one goes anywhere and they go slowly.
I Will probably finish the series when i get to be around seventy, so I can say that I've finished it and go in peace with myself and maybe get Mr. Jordan's hidden message, which I seriously doubt.

I am also posting this on book one, so no one goes unwarned, as the series started off pretty well. 

Shame
