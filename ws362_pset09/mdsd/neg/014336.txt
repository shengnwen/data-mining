I guess I should start by saying that I really didn't like this book very much and would be hard put to recommend it --it had its moments but I found it very exhausting and not a very compelling or satisfying read -- I liked the Ireland part of the book but then it wen totally off course, for me, and I thought th author was totally out of control... I had lots of questions about the various plot "tiwsts" and characters --particualry when Scully and Billie were on aGreek island but ultimately I just wanted to finish it and move on to soemthing that would more satisfying and enjoyable
