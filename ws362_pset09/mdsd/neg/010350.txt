When this book was first issued back in 1979, the information was contemporary and useful. Unfortunatley for this book, the world of Ford performance has changed drastically in the last twenty years. I have the  original print of this book and was looking forward to this update. Boy was  I disappointed. The cover says, &quot;Includes all Modern Ford Performance  Engines.&quot; I guess this means anything built after the flathead. The  engine building techniques are old, the technology is old, even the part  numbers are old.  No information on the vast array of the new aftermarket  aluminum heads and manifolds, fuel injection, ignition systems, etc. or  anything on the new Modular engines is offered. If you want a nostalgic  look at what it used to be like or general information on older hot rod  Ford engines, this book may be for you. If you have the first printing of  this book or are trying to build a cutting-edge modern Ford engine, forget  it
