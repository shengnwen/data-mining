I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one
