Cold Mountain is an unfortunate novel.  It is unfortunate it won the National Book award (why did it win?).  The novel has an unfortunate structure; Fraser simply strings along one incident after another, with little connecting thread.  The weight of flashbacks alone drags the novel to the ground (and it hardly gets off the ground in the first place!)  There are glaring anachronisms.  It is difficult to believe that some of the sentiments he puts in his characters mouths could have been uttered in 1864.  This is a forgivable sin, if the novel is well written, if it rises about the banal, if it offers something more than surface.  But this novel is all surfaces and all banality.  Its publication is indicative of some of the pathology of today's publishing world (this will be a BIG novel, this will become a BIGGER film, which will sell more of this BIG novel).  Too bad for us the novel does not justify the claims of its promoters.  Fraser's eight million dollar advance for his next work is probably a clarion signal of another BIG novel to come
