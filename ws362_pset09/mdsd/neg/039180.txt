Well I had initially bought this book in the hopes that it was on the same level as Bloodlines the Hidden, but this book fell short of what my hopes were. There were only a few intresting bloodlines that really stood out to me that I think I'll use in my chronicles. However to start with, the opening story that was put into this book was lacking and wasn't really that good, in fact after reading it I went back and reread another one of the better ones in the books (that being the Lancea Sanctum and Bloodlines:The Hidden). The only Bloodlines that really stood out to me are The Children OF Judas, a group of Deava who were born out of Suicide, The Galloi, a group of horrificly beautiful Nosferatu, The Macellarius, A group of Gluttonous Ventrue who weigh 300+ pounds and can eat human, werewolf, vampire or any other flesh, And Finally the PLayers, a bunch of Mekhet who get off on being the stereotypical vampires (they have the nicknames of: Wannabes, Posers, and other less printable names. And there character concepts made me laugh!. The other down side was the lack of Gangrel and Nosferatu bloodlines (it seems as though those are few and far between anyway) If however you really need to add more bloodlines, then Buy Bloodlines:The Hidden, thats the better book. However if you TRULY need this book, at least buy it used to save you some heartache and wallet ache out of the dissappointment you'll receive
