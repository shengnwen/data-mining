JAK books are, imho, one of the best in the market right now.Her stories are spun from a truly talented mind, with determined yet understanding heroines and dark brooding heroes, and laced with humour and wit that never fail to bring smiles and laughter. PERFECT PARTNERS however, sadly lacked this winning JAK formula. It comes across as an absolutely frustrating novel, with a bossy and oftentimes irritating heroine, and a narrow-minded  henpecked hero.Definitely the worst JAK book around
