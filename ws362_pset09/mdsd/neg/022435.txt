Although fantasies were given by &quot;regular&quot; people, I found the descriptions of making it with dogs and dreaming of what you'd do to your baby neice, not only objectionable, but just plain gross. I don't think your average person would appreciate such fantasies. Based on other  reviewers here, I thought it would be about really erotic/possibly romantic  escaapades. I had no idea it would be bizarre and ugly. I think there were  2 I liked, but they were just so-so. I wonder about an author that provides  a forum for such material
