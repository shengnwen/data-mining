I bought the Moosewood Restaurant Low-Fat Favorites Cookbook by the Moosewood Collective and put out by Clarkson Potter Publishers in 1996, because I'd heard that this was a famous vegetarian restaurant chain with great food, and knew about it since the "headquarters" restaurant is located in Ithaca, New York, where I went to school.  

At first, the recipes, such as Mushroom Polenta Pie, looked pretty good to me and not too hard to make, but beyond that, I found that a great deal of Asian-inspired recipes, including Five Spice Rice and Lentil Sambar were too exotic and complicated to make for my taste, and the costly ingredients for various dinner recipes were often hard to find at my non-upscale, local grocery store.  Though I liked Moosewood's recipe for "oven fries," I could have easily gotten that off the internet.  

And many Moosewood recipes just started looking time-consuming.  Have I really wanted to make complicated Tunisian potato turnovers involving no less than 14 ingredients for my dinner on any weekday?  Not really.  The curried sweet potato roti recipe needs 19 ingredients and the tamale pie asks for an astounding 26.  

So, on the whole, I was disappointed with this book.  Though I'm sure the restaurant food is pretty tasty because Moosewood shows it knows how to flavor vegetables in innovative ways, I don't recommend this book to people who need simple tasty, vegetable meals on a daily basis while on the go.  This book might be more useful for entertaining guests on weekends, when you have more time and are feeling more adventurous
