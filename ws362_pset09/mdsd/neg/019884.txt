If you get this book, do so for one of two reasons:

1)You want entertaining tidbits about weird stuff
2)You already own everything else Randi's written

This book simply pales in comparison the the Skeptic's Dictionary (available free online) when it comes to debunking a wide range of paranormal claims.  In fact, I'm not sure if there's any good debunking in there.  If you want to read about the akashic memory and various forms of flat-earthism, this books if for you.  I suppose its nice to have someone who can provide entertaining tidbits in a non-credulous manner, but I wonder it would be better just to buy a believer's encyclopedia and ignore the fact that the author believes the things he's talking about
