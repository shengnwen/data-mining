I'm of two minds about this title-- on the one hand, it's a quality product, well written and organized.

On the other hand, I didn't find the concept to be all that compelling and I didn't really gain anything from the book, other then some familiarity with the subject matter.

Overall, this is a well written book but I just didn't buy into the theories
