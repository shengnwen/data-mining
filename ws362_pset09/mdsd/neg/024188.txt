I've been struggling to finish this book for over 3 months. A book of this length would typically take me a week to finish. This book, however, seems painfully endless. This was my first adventure into the world of biographies. I warn others who may choose this book as their first biography, STOP, put the book down and look for some other biography. However, if you want boring account of Natalie Wood's script selection, give Lambert's book a try, at the very least you can use it to treat insomnia. Lambert has done a grave injustice to such a fascinating Hollywood icon.
