Although the &quot;Everything Dog Book&quot; has some helpful advice about selecting a dog &amp; introducing it to your home, the training methods that it advocates are outdated, unnecessary, inefficient and inhumane.  The reliance on choke chains and forcing behavior are likely to lead to behavioral issues and can have a very negative affect on the relationship between dog and person.  There are far better ways to train a dog to obey that make learning enjoyable and easy for both dog and human.  Better options are: &quot;Dog Training for Dummies&quot;, &quot;The Dog Whisperer&quot;, and &quot;For the Life of Your Dog: A Complete Guide to Having a Dog From Adoption and Birth Through Sickness and Health&quot;. The last two choices in particular are great choices as they offer a wealth of practical information that will apply through the life of your dog. For your dog's sake and your own, try a book that relies on training through positive reinforcement
