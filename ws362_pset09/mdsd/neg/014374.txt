Esme Raji Codell ultimately is too smug for her own good in this diary of a first-year teacher in a poor, urban elementary school classroom.

In the beginning, her attitude is honest and refreshing and bold. She describes her job interview, her bullet-ridden classroom, her mentors, her ideas, her students.

Readers might wonder why more teachers aren't like her. Where are the other teachers' travel machines, gorgeous classroom libraries with books collected from interesting travels, who arranged for visits from children's authors, who dreamed up great songs and dances for school assemblies?

Madame Esme, as she insists on being called much to the administration's chagrin, has a real sharp sense of humor. When a student calls the inept principal a slur for homosexual, she replies, Don't insult homosexuals. When someone tells her she dresses like a whore, she remembers her youth, and how glamorous the whores looked, like they were going to a party, and she replies with a "Thank you."

But in the end, tale after tale, example after example, of everything she does right, everything others do wrong, it just wears the reader down. It's very clear she's a good teacher. Because, she tells us every page.

Sure, some of her anecdotes are touching, like when she almost yelled at a student for being late, but instead asked quietly for an explanation. The student was at a shelter that week, and Madame Esme was glad she didn't yell.

Teaching students who are homeless, who have parents in and out of jail, who will bring toddeler sibilings to class to protect them from their homelives, who have langauge barriers, well, that can't be an easy job. It's fascinating to have an opportunity to see inside such a classroom, and witness a teacher who is successful. It gives a sense of hope.

It's a pity that the author couldn't reign in some of her self-congratulations
