I picked up this book after reading about it on the Simple Living network, which I found as an outgrowth of my interest in the work of the late Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin and their work &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot;.  Unlike Mr. Dominguez and Ms. Robin, who manage to lay out an actual plan for simple living, Ms. Andrews chooses to ramble and rail against consumerism.  After reading Dominguez, this book is disjointed, preachy and quite frankly, bad. That's not so say that Ms. Andrews doesn't have some good ideas.  She does, but as with so many anecdotal books, they're not the basis for changing your life in any significant way.  If you live an environmentally sensitive life, Ms. Andrews will certainly make you feel good about yourself, but if  your goal is to simplify your life, you could do better than spending time on this book
