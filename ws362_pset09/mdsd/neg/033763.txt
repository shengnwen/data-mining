I picked this book up with very high expectations. I ordered the Harcover edition of this book because I thought for sure it was going to be a prized gem in my library. WRONG!!! This has to be the most BORING book I've read in my entire life and I am not one to criticize, but it was just poorly written. She said the same things over and over again such as "You know children don't take after strangers", which was cute at first but quickly turned into a nuisance.I was so bored I almost put this book on the shelf without finishing it and I always finish books. I finished the book to see if it was going to get any better. WRONG AGAIN! If I had known it was this bad I would have saved my money and used it towards something better. If you just have to read it, please borrow it from someone or check it out from the libary!
