The Shipping News by Annie Proulx is a rather odd book. Little action, nice descriptions of Nova Scotia, and far fetched characters are in this book.

The book tells the story of Quoyle. Quoyle is a newspaper reporter for a 3rd rate paper in New York. He is ugly, fat, and has very low self esteem. After his wife leaves him for another man and sells his two daughters (as I said, odd book), his wife dies in a car accident. Quoyle takes back his kids and moved back to his ancestrial homeland of Killick-Claw Nova Scotia. There he lives day-to-day.

I read this book with several other people. All of them found this book very boring and hard to get through. Nobody felt any remorse for the protaganists problems, or even cared. 

I would not suggest this book. It is kinda like a roller coaster,once you think that you are going for the sky (an interesting plot development), you find yourself plunging toward the ground. For the story gets worse
