I am very interested in the topic, but this book quickly disappointed me once I got past the introduction.  This really isn't a book at all.  Instead, it's simply the author's research.  It's a collection of quotes he culled from various sources.  There's minimal context, synthesis, or analysis.  Therefore the book doesn't stand on its own as a scholarly work that supports a clearly articulated thesis.  This might be a good book one day once the author actually writes it
