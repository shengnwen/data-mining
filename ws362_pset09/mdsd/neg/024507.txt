This book reminds me of the movie "Pulp Fiction".  Not the writing, the characters, or the complexity of that film, no this book reminds me of what happened the first few years after the film was release.  Every hack director and writer tried to rip off the plot and structure of "Pulp Fiction", and then pretend it was all their own idea.  This same thing happened after "Fight Club" was published, every tired writer who could not come up with an original idea tried to steal the writing structure and style of Chuck Palahniuk.  The problem is, if you are a talented writer you don't need to steal from Chuck Palahniuk, and if you're not a talented writer, you end up with a stink fest like Chemical Pink. 

This ugly book is poorly written, with cardboard characters, an uneven and at times non-existent plot, which is then topped off with humiliating sex between two people who hate each other.  

The story itself should have been interesting, female body building taken to an extreme.  Women who destroy their femininity, their bodies, and health, in exchange for acceptance into an obscure closed society that values masculine females.  Kudos to Ms. Arnoldi, who managed to make that entire subject no more then a superficial side plot, wedged in between all the silly sex between the main characters.
