The general content in the area of how-to was ok, but with so much reference to open reel tapes and minimal to digital recording made it disapointing.  Copyright dated 1988, 1994, the changes not covered that have taken place in the last five years are amazing.  The pointers on mic-ing are good, along with ideas on getting cleaner recorded tracks.  I am getting a lot more out of &quot;Home Recording Power!&quot; by Ben Milstead.  It is slanted toward the CakeWalk Sonar software, but gets things moving fast!  The sugestions are current as well
