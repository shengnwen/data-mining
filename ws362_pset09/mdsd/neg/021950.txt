I've been using this edition for four months now on a bicycle ride across China, and have been disappointed with the quality of information in it. The authors seem to have rushed through the country too quickly. There are just too many mistakes--details mixed up, important places missed, and poor descriptions. For some attractions, I wondered if the authors got past the ticket booth! 

Also the information is much older thant the 2005 copyright suggests. I hardly ever find the accommodations and restaurant sections useful. Prices are usually way off the mark.

It's not just this edition. I experienced similar problems with the 2005 Lonely Planet editions of Laos and Vietnam. Note to Lonely Planet: We need better quality books! Also, we need the Upgrades section restored to the Lonely Planet website.

A good guidebook is essential for travel in China because there are no tourist offices here. I suggest looking at books from other publishers first.
