but the fact is, this book is absolutely terrible. the majority of the gossip girl books - with the exception of this one and the last one - were just fun, trashy reads, and that was fine, because at least something interesting happened in each one of them. but legitimately, these past two books were completely horrible. nothing happened at all. if you want to spend your money on something worthwhile, go for the a-list - i just finished the last one, and it was actually really good, as the other books in that series have been. but don't waste your money on this book. i just hope the next gossip girl will be better. maybe if von ziegesar writes the new book herself, it won't suck as hard as this one did
