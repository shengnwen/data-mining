Man, do I feel foolish. Usually, because I read so many books, I check them out of the library and then buy the ones I love so I can re-read them whenever I want. Well, I didn't do that this time -- mostly because I loved _Bread Alone_ so much that I couldn't wait to read it and I am so disappointed.

To me, this book reads like a jumbled mix of everything that was edited out of the first book. The pace is frustratingly slow and not much gets resolved. For example: the whole divorce issue, which was core in the first book, peters out as if the author is tired of discussing it. 

As more of a minor but irritating point: not one person is happy in the entire book. Every employee has a personal crisis (none of which are resolved or moved forward) and the book ends very abruptly.

So, I'm ticked that I bought -- and read -- what amounts to the author's cast-off notes from _Bread Alone_. I kept hoping the story would get better but it never did. My mistake was not sticking to the "library strategy"
