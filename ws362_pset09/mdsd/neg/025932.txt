In the category Non-Tolkien Fantasy, the DragonLance story may very well be as good as it gets. I'll give them that. The story is epic, the characters are great and the writing is elegant. BUT:

For a first-time reader (like myself), the annotations in this edition ruin the thrill. If you don't want to know the identity of a mysterious, recurring character, have the death of important characters prematurely announced or have your reading flow interrupted by lame remarks about whose wife some character is named after, don't buy this book.

If you can't resist having the trilogy nicely wrapped in one hardcover edition, take the book to the basement before starting to read, flip out your chainsaw and remove 2 inches from all pages
