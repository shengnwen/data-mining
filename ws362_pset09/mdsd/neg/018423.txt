I was very underwhelmed by this book. Not a good "teach yourself to play bass" book at all. Might be better if supplemented with an instructor. Did an O.K. job of covering various musical genres hence the 2 stars. But not much information on how to apply the basics learned in each chapter to a wider variety of music. Overall there are better books out there and you don't have to look too far
