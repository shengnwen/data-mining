I don't get the Jennifer Weiner hype at all. I have read all her books and to me they are very repetitious (not just because some of her characters cross over in the novels, like Cannie from this one, for example) but the plotline, "problems" and characters are all the same. And you can see the happy ending coming from a mile away...For me, this is the best of the bunch but I found it stretched the bounds of credibility. I can't imagine a Hollywood star acting the way Maxi Ryder does but then this is fiction - fluffy, frivolous, forgettable fiction. Read it only if you are really bored and you have absolutely nothing else to do
