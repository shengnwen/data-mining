I was looking for a bit of reasurrance and guidance for alternative treatments.  I certainly didn't get it here!  Ms. Sheehy has few suggestions for perimenopausal women other than HRT, which she describes as almost magical.  Since I have a family history of breast cancer, and--consequently-- no desire to try HRT, I needed books with a more positive tone and other treatment options.  I would strongly recommend Dr. Susan Love's Hormone book and The Pause by Lonnie Barbauch instead
