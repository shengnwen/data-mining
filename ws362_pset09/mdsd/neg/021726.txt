Petra of all places. Supernatural protection, persecution, on ad naseum. The one drug on, and on, and on,  and on ...... 
Same tired story, persecution by Carpathia a lame attempt at evil incarnate and his lackies. Sorry.. 

I think the series denegrates Christianity rather then exalting it.   I've read all 12 and found it morose and condemning. The opposite of how I view Christianity is.
