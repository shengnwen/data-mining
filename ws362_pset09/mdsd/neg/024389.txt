I laughed out loud multiple times reading this book, which is why it took a while for me to realize that &quot;funny lines do not a good book make.&quot; The plot is far fetched, the characters are superficial, the &quot;erotica&quot; is crass and amateurish, and the ending is absurd. It barely qualifies as a good beach read, and I felt like I needed a bath upon finishing it. I gave it two stars for the humor. But really--dumb, dumb, dumb
