Five stars awarded for sincere effort at persuading evolutionary atheists to consider the claims of Genesis, since the author claims to be a Genesis-Christian (can't be Christian without Genesis). Three stars deducted for challenging the very Genesis that makes this Christian-scientist able to believe a cogent alternative to atheistic evolution. Genesis unrevised in its plaintext vocabulary needs no interpretation or reworking. God did just fine in telling us what He did and how/when. As the Ultimate Communicator as well as Creator, He left us with an unambiguous record of real history as it happened. No scientific revisionism, even by well-intentioned-but-mistaken astronomers, is required. The Lord is forcing the world to a faith-decision, Genesis vs. Evolution: Did God REALLY say...? The WORD said in the Beginning, 'Let it be'. And it was so. The world asks, 'Was it really so?' The WORD answers, 'It is written. So it was.'
Any questions? Can people handle God's own truth?
