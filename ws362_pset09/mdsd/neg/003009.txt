There are a lot of really bad books on portrait painting, and this is definitely one of them.  If Amazon was giving this book away, I would not want one.  There is really no instruction to speak of in this book.  The style is also pretty boring, and lifeless.  The type of uninspired, realism, and bad painting so typical of American Artist magazine.  
Instead buy any of the Charles Reid books, but his Natural way to paint is the best for portrait painting.  
...Okay, maybe I have been a little harsh.  If you took this book, and stacked it up with some other bad art books, you could angle your watercolor board, and paint in the style of Charles Reid.  So, I guess it isn't worthless, just not very good
