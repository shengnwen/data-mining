Very frustrating book to read.  The idea of the book is great--that the self-help business has gone too far and allowed people to cop out of their own personal responsibility.  But the execution of the book is filled with poor research, weakly-drawn conclusions and hypocrisy.

The chapters on love and the family are particularly bad.  Though he claims unconditional love is hogwash and that family interests should rise about individual interests within the family, by the end of the chapters he is preaching the same old self-help message that he claims to condemn.  He even praises bad parenting and then uses his own problem kids as an example.

The book doesn't deliver what it claims to sell.  It doesn't practice what it preaches.  And, worst, it uses a few oddball research studies to attempt to draw conclusions that are just not supported through most research.

So if you are buying the book based on the title or description, beware!  It ends up being a pretty traditional self-help book that preaches a traditional psychological perspective with a lack of moral perspective.
