I bought this book expecting to receive a comprehensive 31-day plan complete with recipes.  As I began to write out the recipes, it became apparent that nine of the lunch recipes were missing in the first week  alone!  Since the author does not respond to email at his website, I am  stuck with a lot of expensive health food ingredients for breakfast and  dinner, and no way of knowing what to do about lunch!  It can also be very  difficult to locate a lot of the ingredients, even if you can figure out  what they are.  I don't recommend this book for anyone serious about the  specific diet plan because you will be disappointed.  There are other  points he makes about exercise and self-empowerment that are probably  covered in many of his other books
