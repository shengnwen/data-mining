I am not sure what part Tim Grey plays in creating this book but if you are purchasing the book do it because of what Ellen Anon is contributing to the book.  I Think Tim Grey is a fantastic Photoshop and P.C. Guru - and a great writer in his element.  If Tim contributed to the Photoshop techniques of this book that is good.  He is not a fantastic nature photographer.  Leave the nature photos to the likes of John Shaw and George Lepp (Tim knows both of these nature photographers), etc.  Tim Grey has some great books out - Color Confidence and Photoshop CS2 are two of them.  Buy those two books before this one if you want some of Tim's best writings on Photoshop.  Photo Finish is another book that Tim Grey co-authored and it also a So-so book.  There are tons of good Photoshop books.  If you need a starter try the Adobe Photoshop Classroom in A Book series for whichever version of Photoshop you are using. Use the Adobe Photoshop Tutorials on their web site - they are great and free. Print these tutorial out in color and put them in a binder and you have a great Photoshop book with little or no cost to you.   John Shaw has an excellent e-book, "John Shaw's Photoshop Field Guide", about 208 pages.  A great source for nature photographers with some Photoshop experience.  No 'down-&-dirty' tricks in his e-book.  It is straight forward Photoshop information for a nature photographer of all levels of experience.  It does not cover Photshop CS2 but you can figure everything out.  Cost is $30 US.  http://www.johnshawphoto.com/ebook.htm.  Two other books to consider if you don't already have them are Adobe Photoshop, by David Blatner & Bruce Fraser and Digital Photography, by Eismann (a great photographer & writer), Duggan, and Tim Grey. (since Grey is at the end of the line here I can only assume his part is small in this book).  Purchase some of these other books before spending money on Photoshop For Nature Photographers
