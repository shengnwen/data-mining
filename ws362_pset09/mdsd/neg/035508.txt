This woman doesn't need to practice safe sex. I would guess from seeing her on tv that she never had an opportunity. Her views are not mainstream despite her wishes to 'fit in' and define morals. I glanced at this book and content and she if forceful and adamant about her views. Not an open-minded lady rather highly-opinionated, ruthless provocateur woman's libber. A disgrace to feminity and society..
