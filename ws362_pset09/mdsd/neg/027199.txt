This book, although beautifully written, did not make sense.  I was intrigued by the characters yet finished the book not understanding their motivations.  I would have liked to know more about the narrator, Susan, and her life immediately after the fatal accident.  Instead I felt like I was thrown into the middle of a story, with big gaps missing throughout. Perhaps some skillful editing would have made this more of a complete tale
