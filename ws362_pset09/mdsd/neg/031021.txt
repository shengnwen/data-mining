This just might be the worst technical book I own.  There is some useful material in it, but it is so poorly written that t's hard to tell.  There are non-sentences, some sentences that are impossible to understand even after re-reading, non-sequitirs, and more typos than I have seen in any other book.  The text repeatedly says things like, &quot;At present (as of this writing)&quot;, without telling you when that is -- and the data given will be at odds with data just a few pages away, which begins with the same disclaimer.  The text is also highly repetitive -- how many times do I have to be told that cHTML is just like HTML?  The material on WAP is internally inconsistent, and, from what I can tell, outright wrong in places.  Many of the pictures appear to be low-resolution images....  I feel the publisher should have had someone redraw pie charts so that the fonts are legible. ...  There must be a better one on the topic.
