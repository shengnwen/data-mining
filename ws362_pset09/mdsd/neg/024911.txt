When I saw the title of this book, I expected it to be a "Chicken Soup for the ___ Soul" type book.  I expected to read a bunch of short stories of the heartwarming (and possibly a little sickeningly sweet) variety, told from the pagan point of view.  However, the book had a bit of a "soapbox" feel to me.  It was full of articles, how-to rituals,(which are fine in their own right, but I wanted stories) and just an offhand mention of stories.  I felt a little cheated, because I wanted a light hearted and fluffy, feel good book and got what felt a bit like a homework assignment.
