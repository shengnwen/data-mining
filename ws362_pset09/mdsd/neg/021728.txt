This book was interesting, and If I were as passionate about poker as I am about investing, I would have learned a lot.
Brown assumes a deep knowledge of the intricacies of poker in his reader. (which I do not have)

He also assumes that "wall street" means Trading futures and options.

He is insightful about both, trading and poker, though perhaps most insightful about Psychology and deception.

I never knew how deep of a game poker was.

Brown's Idea of a community poker game as an early frontier community bank and a venue for establishing trust in a community was eye opening for me.

As to whichever Financial Times journalist prompted me to buy this book based on a rave Review about its valuable insight into Wall Street and investing, Shame on you.

What I learned could have been put into a two page article, and what I could not learn could have been remedied with a glossary of obscure poker terms.

Traders and poker players, Enjoy.

If wall street to you is a place to look for value and cash flows, as opposed to poker games and technical charts, steer clear of this book
