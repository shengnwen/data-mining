I have read many serotonin-related books and I am quite confused. In his book &quot;Beyond Prozac&quot; Michael J. Norden, an eminent Psychiatrist, states that the much-publicized high-carbohydrate diet may actually make you depressed and overweight. In &quot;Potatoes not Prozac&quot; a  high-carb plus protein diet is advocated. Dr. Joel Robertson in his  &quot;Natural Prozac&quot; states that protein is a dopamine booster. Who  should one believe? What is true and what is not? Should one accept Dr.  Wurtman's approach as correct? O.K. she is an M.I.T. professor but the  other authors have impressive academic credentials as well
