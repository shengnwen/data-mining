This book is a bit outdated now.
The author of this book currently has a brand of his own paints and materials.  He's so caught up on materials and your hands, that he doesnt teach to use your brain or eyes.  He's one of those types that's obsessed with finding out the "secret" Maroger medium, the ratio of oil:pigment in old masters paintings, etc.  
I dont know how anyone can think that using Raphaels' paints will make you paint like Raphael.  It's like putting on Jerome Bettis' football pads and thinking you'll weigh 265 and run faster than a cheetah.  It's not going to happen.

He's also big on slavishly copying photographs.  I guess that's how a lot of illustrators think, though.

Compare this to books by the golden age illustrators; like Loomis, Rockwell, Leyendecker. . . even guys like Hogarth.  They focus little on materials and "techniques," and teach more about learning to think and see.


In the end, you have to realize that Michelangelo could have painted the Sistine ceiling with a mop and a bucket of mud, and it would have been just as well done.  Learn the basics of materials (which you can just find online), and find someone who will teach you to think
