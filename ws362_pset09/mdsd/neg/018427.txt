Although I wasn't too pleased to see this book published, I read it while trying my best to be as unbiased as possible.  After pondering it and weighing it against Miss Ann's offering, all I can say is this:

Someone who makes a parody of a parody is not going to great lengths to convince me they attended Harvard.  

I think it's ironic that the author entitled the book "Soulless" as Estrich has some of the most skewed views on God and religion in general.
