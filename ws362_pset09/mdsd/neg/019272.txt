Robert Shank's thesis is that election in the Bible is primarily a corporate concept.  That is, God predestines no one to heaven unconditionally, but only predestines the church to be saved; whether or  not one is part of the church is left to the freewill of the individual.   Unfortunately, Robert Shank's work falls drastically short of Dr. William  W. Adam's promise that it would prove to be &quot;the definitive work on  the difficult question of election.&quot;  In fact, Shanks treatment of the  doctrine of predestination suffers some tremendous flaws.  The book was  obnoxiously repetitive and burdened by run-on sentences. Furthermore,  Shank's exegetical arguments were disappointingly weak.  He seemed to see  Arminian prooftexts like 1 Tim. 2:4 and Ezek. 18:23 as hermeneutical keys  used unlock the meaning of every passage in the Bible that did not appear  to fit with his thesis.  As a result, Calvinistic arguments were swept  under the rug with no real wrestling with the Biblical tension between  human responsibility and divine sovereignty.  Compelling Calvinistic  arguments were brushed aside by simple appeals to verses that indicate that  God desires all men to be saved.  There was virtually no interaction with  scholarly literature outside that of John Calvin, which is a major flaw of  the book.  Surprisingly, very little attention is devoted to Rom. 9:1-23 -  this fact alone reveals a major shortcoming of Shanks work.  The case for  corporate election is not argued strongly from texts like Eph. 1 but is  simply assumed.  It is astounding that Shank's book has received as much  popularity as it has.  Overall, I found the book lacking in verbal clarity,  even-handed exegesis, interaction with Calvinistic literature, thoroughness  and philosophical persuasiveness.  I don't recommend that anyone buy this  book, even for the sake of learning about Arminianism.  Better ones are  available
