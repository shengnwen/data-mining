We used this book for an adult Sunday School class that I taught.  I was extremely disappointed by the superficial treatment of the text.  I found myself using the Biblical text and other sources.  For the most part Dr. Swindoll's book was a distraction rather than a help.  For example, 2 Samuel 7 descibes
God's covenant with David that Christ, the True King, would be David's descendant.  Swindoll uses this text as to how to react when God says no to our plans. (In this case, it is God's rejection of David as the builder the temple that Solomon eventually built)  The covenant IS the point and Dr. Swindoll completely misses it.
If your looking for moralisms that you really already knew this is your book.  If you want a serious study of the life of David
you would do well to look elsewhere or try something bold-- a careful reading of the Biblical text.
