This book is nothing more than the authors' rants against U.S. politics, and its alleged ties to the criminal underworld.  The book is laughable in the extremes the authors go take to link almost every U.S. President since JFK to the criminal underworld.  The worst part is that most of the so-called evidence for these links is from &quot;anonymnous&quot; or &quot;un-named&quot; sources.  Do yourself a favor, and read something else
