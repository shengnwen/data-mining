The book starts out promising, with the first chapter being a very good quick intro to CMS and Plone and the types of things that CMS can do for you.  However, once you start getting into the specifics, it quickly become clear that this book is now outdated.  Many of the examples are hard to follow because the current version of Plone has different options or features.  Also, the examples cover only the "low hanging fruit" - the easiest of tasks, many of which you can figure out on your own just by sitting in front of a browser and navigating Plone using common sense.  (Which I ended up having to do, since the examples in the book are outdated.)  You won't find the real-world answers you need in this book.  Need to authenticate the users based on some authentication you already have, such as LDAP?  This isn't the book for you.  Only 1 page is dedicated to user and group admin, and that is basically a rehash of what you see on the screen in that admin panel.  Want to know how to allow users to publish their own work rather than wait for the admin to approve it?  Not in the book, you have to just figure it out by experimenting.  
 
This book does have its moments but a large portion of it is easy to learn just by playing with Plone on your own
