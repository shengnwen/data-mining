This book features 12 essays by black men about brothers, the courts, and the criminal justice system.  It is definitely for essay lovers and the fans of columnists.  The flavor of the writing reminds me a lot of Clarence Page, Gore Vidal, or Richard Rodriguez.

The book has a universal tone to which black males and non-black males could relate.  This is not a militant discourse; conservatives won't be able to cry out "P.C.!"  Some authors recall when they acted criminally.  Others say anti-social tendencies start at home.  This book is filled with everyday men asking how controversies in the news affect their lives.  The specific one here is the Diallo murder and the subsequent police acquittal, but it could have been any other matter.

This book is subtly gay-friendly.  The first essay mentions homophobia as an ill hurting the black community.  The next essay is penned by a famous, gay African-American author.  The third essay is by the editor who quotes from James Baldwin and Countee Cullen.

This essay has diverse contributors, featuring journalists, lawyers, and police officers.  However, most of the essays sound alike.  I am not sure if the editor made all essays sound like his or only chose essays written in his style.  Unfortunately, this get repetitive after awhile.  There becomes no need to read the whole book.

People may want to read this book alongside the books "Envy of the World" or "Living to Tell About It.
