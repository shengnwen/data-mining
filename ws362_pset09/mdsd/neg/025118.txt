I chose this book because I have long been interested in the Salem Witch Trials. I really enjoyed the parts of the story which dealt with Kim's search for the truth of her ancestor' role in the tragedy. I'll admit that I mostly skimmed the parts which dealt with Kim & Edward's relationship---as characters, they are totally unbelievable and not very likeable.  The part I found most surprising was Kim's attitude towards medications, especially considering that she is a nurse. The drug research storyline was so, eh, I don't even have a word for it. Not worth reading.
The interactions between the characters in the book are stilted and painful. I think we are supposed to feel sympathy for Kim's social awkwardness & anxiety, but really you just want to shake her and tell her to grow a backbone already. As much as I love reading, I can not  recommend this book to anyone.
