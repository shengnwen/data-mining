This book appears to be exactly the same as "A World History of Architecture" (Paperback) by the same authors and available on Amazon for $33.64 without the CD. The number of pages, table of contents, and intro sentence are exactly the same.  It seems more than slightly shady to me to sell the exact same book with two different names.  

This book is required reading for my Architectural History class and was for sale at my school's bookstore for $100.  My stodgy old professor isn't teaching from the CD. I am not giving these people my money, I got my copy at the library.
