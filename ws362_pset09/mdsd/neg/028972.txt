This book offers nothing new in terms of improving your chess. 
He brings no new ideas, no new methods, other than to study tactics.  Nothing in the book is composed by him, the vision drills, or anything else. Actually 99.9% of the work involved refers to chess software (CD Art 3.0) as a guideplan.  If you are into 5 minutes abs, or get rich quickly type of programs then this book is for you.  The author himself does not play anymore, as you can see at:

If tactics is an issue for you I would recommend CD Art 3.0 directly rather than buying this book and listing to this guy rave on how he did it.
Jeremy Silman puts it very well in his article about the book at

There is no such a thing as rapid chess improvement.  I would recomend any other book on tactics that the authour actually spent time composing or selecting them
