I cannot understand how anyone could understand this book, let alone claim to love it. It has the unfortunate distinction of being the first book I ever hated so much to give up on it, and before I was even halfway through it too! Allegedly there's a plot in there somewhere, but because it is buried underneath constantly shifting narrative, dialogue so unclear you can't tell who's saying what to whom, the unclear point of view, the shattered grammar and tense and made-up vocabulary, the book is so screwy that I literally had NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. It was like reading a transcription of someone's fever delirium. If I could give this book ZERO STARS, I would! This book is not a classic, it's a gross mistake
