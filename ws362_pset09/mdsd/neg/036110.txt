I don't understand why this book got so many stars on this site. I groaned aloud at some of the dialogue and found the characters one-dimensional. The female characters are poorly drawn and the dialogue throughout is weak. I felt like one minor character after another was introduced every few pages or so and had little to do with what there is of a plot. I expected a quirky, refreshingly funny novel but felt like I was stuck at a bar having dull conversations with its regulars. It's Seinfeldesque in that it's much to do about nothing, but lacks the humor that could have ensued. To be fair, the premise did have potential, but the author deserved a better editor perhaps to guide him to cut more. I found myself pausing to read the author's bio and thought "A-ha...it's a first novel." I've never written a review before but felt misleaded by the rave reviews on this site and wanted to offer some balance.
