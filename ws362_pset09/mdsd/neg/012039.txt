There was no "0 star" to rate this book. Someone wrote your innane comments were "South Park" but that was giving you more credit than due.  This book knocks rooms decorated with "mod," "hippy," "psychedelic," primary, analogous, complementary, or accented neutral colors; functional autonomous rooms combining sports, hobbies, recreation, and academic dimensions within one room; it knocks the budget-conscious decorations of the handmade, handpainted, functional, antique, dime store, yard sale, thrift or expensive furniture stores; it slams grouped wall, shelf decorations used as room accents: keys, Americana cushions, books, candle holders, fruit in a bowl, potted plants; criticizes large eye-catching "centers of interest" used with living room furniture, sun face wall painting, "Abe Lincoln with butterfly bowtie," large eye over purple tub; the accented neutral black/white/yellow bedroom with Colonial style poster bed, Queen Anne chair, rocking chair, possibly Ethan Allen, round table may be possibly an old wooden construction cable spool covered with home sewn tablecloth; cubist, geometric, fractal wall decorations; use of light through uncovered windows, sheer curtains, roll-up wooden blinds, tie-back sheer curtains; and repainting an antique chair to accent a child's room.  I would not purchase nor recommend this book nor anything else written by this author.
