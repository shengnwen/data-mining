This book was written with the sad misconception that a name itself can completely define your character- that's ridiculous. Who says a Bertha or Percy can't be daring, exciting, or sexy? Who says a Gertrude can't be a Dominatrix? I bought this book for the sole purpose of helping with my character's surnames- I have dozens of baby books that I can turn to for first names, thank you, but this book doesn't bother with surnames save for a handful for most nationalities. Beside that, I had to laugh when I read in the first chapter that the author actually named one of her characters "Joe Q. Public". In her "suspense thrillers". I'm sorry, but I've never read such a ludicrous name in MAD Magazine, let alone a serious thriller
