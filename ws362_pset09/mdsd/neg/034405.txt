Must have had friends writing previous reviews, because unless you are under the age of 16, this book is quite simplistic. If you've spent anytime on the job with some situational awareness, you will have received the utter basics this book imparts. I wanted to return the book immediately for it should have been listed in the children's book section. It never gets any better-- with any rich information or insight--just obvious trite pabulum laced throughout. This book is insipid and mind-numbingly simplistic.  DO NOT BUY if you want to learn how to make a knockout presentation!
