Steven N. Austad admits he spent a great deal of time studying opossums.  How that research relates to why we age, one wonders. (?)  Austad provides good critical analysis of historical theories of aging, but pokes too hard  at researchers of the past who had few tools to work with.  Though he has  no criticism for Darwin.  Austad's book is quite confusing at times.   Austad assumes evolution is a fact, but presents no facts in support of the  theory of evolution.  What damages the genes that leads to accelated aging  and disease?  Austad notes the mitochondria in the cell exhibit  abnormalities, but never points to the mitochondrial antioxidants that may  protect genes from oxidative damage, such as ubiquitin (coenzyme Q10).  In  the end, you could read a good book about the free radical theory of  disease and learn more about aging.  A bevy of biologists have observed  that animals and humans deprived of food live longer.  Like them, Austad  ends up advocating &quot;food restriction,&quot; yet says &quot;no one,  repeat no one, knows why food restriction has this effect or how it  works.&quot;  But he can't connect the dots to his own research, which  talks about iron and its all important role in the destructive process of  oxidation.  Now those humans and animals who restrict food consumption  would be limiting their iron intake, right?  Maybe we do know why food  restriction works.  Why does the body have so many intricate mechanisms to  control iron (antioxidants, melanin, iron-binding proteins like hemoglobin,  albumin, ferritin, lactoferrin), and organs that store iron, like the  liver?  Austad needs to go back to school and stay out of the sun.  Beware  of opossum fever!  -
