What made Wall Street Meat entertaining were the personal anecdotes regarding his contact with various well known personalities.  This book starts in a similar vein, with stories about his efforts to raise money for his hedge fund.  Then the book seems to completely lose its focus.  It turns first into a high level history of the industrial revolution in England, and then into an economics lesson.  The history is circumstantial and of questionable relevance.  The economics is pure poorly thought out drivel.  This stuff goes on for chapter after chapter.  Had I written a review after the first few chapters, I would have given the book four stars.  After finishing the book, I think I'm being generous giving it two stars
