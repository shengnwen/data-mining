I was required to read this for a college course I am taking and would never reccomend it to anyone on any level.  The main points of the story are already well known and can be summed up in a two page magazine article instead of a dry 200-some page book.  The author has a bad habbit of making the reader decipher dense sentences.  He writes repetitively, citing the same types of examples for fifteen page intervals and only gets to the meat of the subject in two paragraph summaries.  If you can skim through this book and find those summaries, you can definitely skip the reading, because you're not missing out on anything.

This is definitely not a book I'd ever read for pleasure, even if the subject is very enticing, the book is a battle between sleep and boredom
