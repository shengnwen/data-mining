Three things make me better than Sean Hannity:
1) I was actually in the US Military
2) I graduated college, unlike Sean
3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America.
Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans.
Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion
