This list is pretty standard, I think a trip to the chinaberry catalog or website would provide much better suggestions. Many of the stories included are classic. The author included a good amount of text describing each of the stories suggested. But in the last few years some amazing children's stories have been written that I think are much better, especially for the younger crowd in the board book and picture book category. We have an amazing collection of children's literature, but as I am always looking for more, I took this book out of the library and I was very disappointed. In our collection of thousands of books for my children, we have 15 of the suggested titles. My suggestion, go to chinaberry on the web and go from there
