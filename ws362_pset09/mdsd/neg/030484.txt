I have to wonder if the previous reviewers are writing about this particular book.  There are no "rhymes" and the letters of the alphabet do not run down the page.  I was quite disappointed when I received this book, since it was not what I expected.  The author could have invented more clever phrases than "Xylophone for Xmas" and "Nine in their nests".  

I was not impressed
