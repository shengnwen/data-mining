This book is very poorly written and badly organized.  Essential introductory topics are sprinkled throughout the book seemingly randomly.  Much of the writing is horribly ambiguous or just plain unreadable.  I am a beginning programmer, though I am highly proficient with Excel.  I was lucky to be familiar with some other programming languages because the explanations of object-oriented programming concepts in this book (as well as other topics covered) would have been completely incomprehensible without a moderate level of background experience.  The examples in the book are neither practical, nor particularly well designed to illustrate the VBA concepts that the authors are trying to teach.  Instead, the authors seem to be preoccupied with designing examples to convey stylistic programming conventions that they personally favor.
