The cover blurbs mentioned "plot twists", "mystery", and "suspense".  In fact, it's very linear and (spoiler alert?) everything happens EXACTLY as you think it will.  I kept waiting for the twists but they never came.  I like books about athletes, athletic team dynamics, and youth sports issues, so this looked appealing.  Not a bad read, but pretty ho-hum.
