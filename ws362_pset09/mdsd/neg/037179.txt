I wanted this for a long time, and finally received it yesterday from my Amazon Wishlist.

This is the first audio book that I actually find difficult to listen to. The sound quality of this CD is so poor and scratchy that I could be listening to an old radio broadcast. I do not feel as if I am sitting in a room listening to a wonderful story unfold...it's more like I'm listening to a conversation on a cell phone. It actually hurts my ears to listen to this recording.

Every time the reader says any word with the letter "s" the hiss goes right to your brain. I'm not kidding. I still have a headache.
