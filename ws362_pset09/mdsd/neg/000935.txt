If you are interested in learning about the *actual* science of food, but don't want to learn any science, at least read a book by someone who *did* learn it.  There is so much grossly erroneous information in this book that he discredits himself entirely.  "Oil is more dense than water-- and that's why it can be heated to higher temperatures than 212".  As a chemist and formulator I can assure you that nearly all oil is lighter than water, and even if it weren't that's *not* the reason it has a higher boiling point.  Ever make oil & vinegar salad dressing?  Ever seen crude oil on the ocean?  How about the funk on top of old greasy dish water?  Folks, oil floats on water... and the earth is not flat.  Either this guy is a complete moron, or he is a very clever con artist.  Either way, save your money... and buy that blind Amish author's book "Semiconductor Microengineering for Dummies" instead.  It's better researched
