The idea behind this book is great, but in reality it's nearly impossible to use. I had high hopes when I purchased it but was very disappointed once I read it. The directions were confusing, and the whole book is too disjointed to be helpful. Because it was so expensive I tried several times over a year to read it and glean something I could use just to justify the expense. Each time I would walk away no better off than I was before. It's too bad the author didn't take the general idea of this book, simplify the directions, update it, and definately make the whole thing user friendly. What a waste of money
