I am very disappointed with this book.  I wanted a book to help me keep track of my daily intake of calories. Not pages and pages full of the author's opinions and tips on weight loss. A lot of the items listed are commercial food that by law have to carry nutrition info anyway. I am prefectly capable of reading a nutrition lable for calories, I don't need the added step of finding it in this book, which doesn't have a very good order of listing items in my opinion. Instead I recommend "The Doctors Pocket Calorie, Fat & Carbohydrate Counter: 2002 Edition, Plus 101 Fast Food Chains and Restaurants" and "The Complete and Up-to-Date Fat Book: A Guide to the Fat, Calories and Fat Percentages in Your Food" - both of which are available from amazon
