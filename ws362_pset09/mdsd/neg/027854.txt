As someone who enjoyed previous works by this author, I was stunned at how poorly written and conceived this book was.  The characters are repulsive as are the sentiments expressed.  Actually the incompetent writing is the  book's saving grace: it is lacking to the point that at least it injected  some (unintentional) humor into the proceedings. One of the worst books  I've ever read
