When I was a university student 14 years ago, I followed this book to the letter - 3 days in the gym every week for six months and then a split system which got me in the gym 4 days a week for another year or so. 

In hindsight, it worked (as any beginner gets a little bigger anyway just by heading to the gym) but I picked up a copy of BRAWN a year later - training twice a week just focussing on the big exercises and realised far better results.  

This book is good for motivation, a trip down memory lane for some; it has some good ideas but generally the routines aren't suitable for anyone training without steroids.  I wonder why Joe Weider never discussed the issue when obviously so many, if not all contributors, depended on steriods to realize their success...
