I tried out this book and found it to be very vague. It tells some of the different types of travel but doesn't give you any specifics. It honestly isn't much help if you are actually planning to go to europe. It also mentions too few different ways that you can stay such as backpacking and such throughout all the different countries. It gave very little info on anything. Then at the end to take up space they rate and give short descriptions of damn near every restaurant in europe. Just to fill up space since this book was just about useless! If I were you I'd skip over this book and find another one that fits your needs the best
