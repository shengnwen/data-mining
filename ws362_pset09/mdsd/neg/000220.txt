If Zell Miller wants to live in a dictatorship, he's free to want that, but he's crazy with hatred for a party that has no power.  What a noble guy!  Rage against the oppressed - what a man!  This book is insane.  I read it at the local library and wondered how he considers himself a conservative democrat when he supports a man who spends like a drunken sailor on shore leave (though the drunken sailor isn't a fighter, but more of a mascott pretending to be a fighter....) and bloats the Federal government beyond and Democrat's wildest dreams....

why so many in the GOP have let hatred be the guiding force i'm not sure.  I actually believe in God and the God in the Bible isn't the champion of hatred and vitriol.
