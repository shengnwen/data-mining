i love the dc universe, and i'm puzzled why everyone loves the new frontier. it's pretty bad. not only is it extremely boring and poorly written, but it's also obviously written by a total hippie trying to push his shiny happy ideals on you. this is one reimagining of the past that didn't need to be done, or i should say should have been done a whole lot better than this.
