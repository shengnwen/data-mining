This book is pure you-know-what (too much of a lady to say).  Basically, he took Barry Rehfield's words and dropped them into his so called "book."  It does not focus on the wonderful music that Derek & the Dominos created, but instead focuses on the personal lives of the band.  The author seemed to be more interested in bashing a mentally ill man in prison versus writing about the talented players.  I hope he makes no money from this book and, if he does, I hope he will give it to a charity who raises funds for the research for schizophrenia or assists musicians with mental disorders.  This would almost make up for his bashing of a wonderful player who was suffering when he played and created the beautiful music that music lovers enjoy in all parts of the world.

Now, I'll jump off my soapbox and start writing my version of Jim Gordon's life....in a more positive way, of course.

Cheers!
