My wife wants to have her filling pulled because this idiot says so.
Why do I call him an idiot.  Here are two examples.
Coral Calcium: he says a goverment agency won't let him publish anything about it--so he refers you to his website where you can find out more if you subscribe!  Hey, Kevy, there are no apriori restraints on the press in the USA.
Pigs:  He says you should not eat pork because pigs eat thier own excretement.  He thinks that is disgusting, thus not healthy.  Well pigs and rabbits can eat their own. There may be many reasons not to eat pork, especially in third world countries.  but Kevy sure didn't bother to research them.  
Why do research when you can make up a stupid reason.  
Given his pork logic I'm surprised he doesn't say not to eat anything organic as the compost used to grow things contains animal excrement
