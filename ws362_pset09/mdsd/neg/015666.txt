Star Wars: Jedi Trial is a well written, easy to read war novel with good supporting character development, which despite having Anakin as a main character, has almost nothing to do with Jedi, The Force or Star Wars in general. The Jedi General, whom Anakin assists, is a bumbling civilian attempting to lead a well trained Clone Army and screwing it up every chance he gets. He apparently has no ability to use The Force at all because the authors don't understand The Force. At the end of the novel they attempt to have Anakin use The Force, but it is more like a Wolverine "berzerker rage" which would require Anakin to have a mastery of The Dark Side that he does not possess even at the end of Episode III.
The best thing about this book was the development of the relationship of the supporting characters Odie and Erk. The worst thing was the fact that Jedi Knight Halcyon had no ability to use The Force. One of the authors' objectives appears to  be telling civilians not to run an army.  Although the book was well-written, the authors should stick to writing about Viet Nam and not enter a world they know nothing about
