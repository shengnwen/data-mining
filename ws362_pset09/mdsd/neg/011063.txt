From the title, I thought this would be a great book - classic sweaters designed for larger women. Um, not as such.

The vast majority of the models for the book? Apparently sizes 8-12. There's one, count it, *one* model who looks like she might wear a plus size. 

I wasn't overly impressed with the garments themselves, but that pales beside the fact that I can't trust them to be sized correctly for plus sizes because their models are not plus-sized
