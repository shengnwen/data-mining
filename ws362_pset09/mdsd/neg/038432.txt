I was unable to finish this book due to the glaring errors and poor craftsmanship.  I should have realized that any author who listed People magazine as a model of respected journalism was not to be trusted; still, I let my curiosity get the best of me.  Finally, I determined that I could, in fact, be reading ONLY what could be described as an UN-authorized biography; and a re-read of the front cover of the book confirmed my desperate diagnosis.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but this book stinks; it reads like a ghastly farce of a paper cut-n-copy fan-zine.  I should like to see what a more capable author (not to mention editor and proofreader) would do with such interesting material
