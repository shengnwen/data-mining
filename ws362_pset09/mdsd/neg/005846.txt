I read the first 20 pages of this book and quit.  It was too painful to keep going.  The author's wording in convoluted, tangential, and just plain annoying.  She throws out dozens of names from the industry, so many you can't keep them straight.  There is poor flow to the writing, so you cannot understand why she is telling you things from one line to the next.  The topics of each paragraph jump from one subject to another with abrupt, confusing transitions.  I returned the book
