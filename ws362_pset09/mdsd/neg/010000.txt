The author, although well educated in the beliefs of pagan/goddess worshiping religions, tends to be guilty of the very things she accuses patriarchal religions of.  She states that male-dominated religions (especially Christianity) are responsible for the atrocities committed against women over the past 2-3 thousand years (a true enough fact) but then proceeds to encourage a view so far to the opposite extreme by encouraging a purely feminist/matriarchal worldview that she completely discounts any male contributions are possible unless he is thouroughly rooted in the feminine.        Overall, she understands the history of what paganism/ goddess worship is rooted in but completely misses the belief that equal contributions come from both women and men which, when in balance, benefit all of society
