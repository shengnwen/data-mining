At first I was a bit hesitant when approaching this book for my introductory linguistics class, but I wanted to give it a chance.  I even had hopes that it would be interesting and imaginitive.  Instead I found nothing but page after page of inconsistent and horribly overwrought analogies between the two fields.  As a chemistry student, I was completely frustrated by the "novel" approach of this book - it may be novel, but that doesn't make it good or even worthwhile.  No, not at all.  The chemistry comparisons were entirely pointless and just irritating, making the book twice as long as it could have been.  It was (understandably) written for people without any knowledge of chemistry, and thus covered only middle-school level material, often leading to gross inaccuracies and longwinded exposition.  Who needs ten pages on the history of chemistry just so Baker can draw a congratulatory parallel that isn't even appropriate?  Furthermore, if the whole point of a conceit of this type to is to aid in the understanding of the material presented, why is he using a subject he assumes his readers don't know anything about anyway?  No clarity is gained this way at all, just pages of evidence that Baker thinks he is incredibly clever.  But clever he is not - his entire premise is horribly flawed.  How could he justify writing such a book when he states "facts" about chemistry that are blatantly untrue?  I know this review was not well organized, but I'm just so annoyed right now that I have to read this useless, frustrating, narcissistic exercise in making an idea fit the truth.  Drawing random, inconsistent parallels between two totally different things is not informative at all.  It's just stupid.  Like Mark Baker
