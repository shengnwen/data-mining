Pipi Longstocking 
Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren is an inspiring tale about a girl named Pipi. She has a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nelson. Next door are two very polite children named Tommy and Annika and they become friends. I like that I can relate to Annika in that she is always hesitant but after she gets started she doesn't want to stop Pipi's fother is a sea man and left her at the house with a	suitcase full of gold pieces. Pipi likes to go on adventures. One was when Pipi tricked two thieves into leaving her house with nothing This is just one example of the many heroic adventures in this exciting book. I like that it has a moral that is deep so you have fun reading it and you close the book with a smile
