Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.
