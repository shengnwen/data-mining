DuBrul is a decent enough writer to keep you engrossed in this story until its end. But aside from that, this is a very silly book that is insane in its plot contrivances. I noticed on the cover that Clive Cussler said that this was a great book, and I have to say that if I were to name one author that DuBrul reminded me of, it would be Cussler. I have a lot of problems with Cusslers books and cant help but laugh often as I turn the pages. This is my first DuBrul and if 'Deep Fire Rising' is an indicator of what all of his books are like, DuBrul is skating on an edge even way more far-fetched than the ludicrous Cussler.

If this story were to have some relevance in reality it would have needed to break the steps that Mercer takes into a dozen characters.

What saves the book and allows the reader to continue from one chapter to the next is DuBrul's excellent writing skills. You can do better than this book. It's not hard to find an author more skilled at crafting a plot. I would steer you away from DuBrul if I could
