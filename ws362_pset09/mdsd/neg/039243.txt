I've read most books about Scott Peterson, and they were all pretty interesting and informative......This book was loaned to me, I did not spend a dime on it, nor would I. 
Dalton makes many claims (occult, etc) with nothing to back it up. If they were investigators, couldn't they have tracked down  all of these "supposed" leads ???? A partial license plate number should be enough....many "supposed" witnesses don't have names...the ones that do never testified....what's that about??  If they were credible, don't you think a suppeana would have been issued ???? Especially by the defense????  I can see why he was fired from the defense team....
Anyway, that aside, the writing is terrible, nothing is consistent....suffice it to say----you've been warned.
