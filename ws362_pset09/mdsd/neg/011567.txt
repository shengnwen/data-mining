This is my first Barry Eisler/John Rain book, and it will certainly be my last. I picked up this book in the hopes of some fun summer reading with a fast plot. Instead, the book delivered a meandering and barely interesting plot, two dimensional characters, and some of the worst writing I have ever read. Not only is the protagonist, John Rain, an unsympathetic, humorless, and charmless character, he's also apparently incompetent. The worst element of the book, however, is the sub-standard writing which is so amateurish and stilted that it ruins the book (when the character's brain screams "knife!" to himself while he's being attacked, for example, or when the primary word used in dialog and for starting sentences is "yeah," you know you have a stinker in your hands). In the hands of a minimally accomplished writer, John Rain might be an interesting character, but at the hands of Barry Eisler, he's not anyone I would want to read about again. If you want a good read in this genre, try one of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books.
