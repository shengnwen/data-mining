Although not nearly as heinous as Richard Avedon's "In the American West", Stephen Shore's "Uncommon Places" earns an honored place in the annals of overrated art. Its sole interest is its time-capsule appeal.

Imagine if you will, taking a camera across America and shooting ugly buildings, roads, humble homes, and desolate scenery with nary a concern of cohesiveness or narrative. Make no attempt to include a theme, other than perhaps a New Yorker's condescension much like the lyrics in the Talking Heads song "The Big Country." You then have this book. 

Perhaps 15-20 of these photgraphs hold some genuine magic. The rest are totally ridiculous. Much better is Eggleston's "Los Alamos." 

Even the title is grating
