I bought this item "blind," meaning I couldn't inspect it to see if it was what I was expecting. 

First, a little background: 
DeVito and Strickland put out a large hardcover illustrated book called KONG, KING OF SKULL ISLAND. It was a prequel and sequel to the original KING KONG novel. Naturally, I wanted to have the original novel so the two could be a "set," so my expectations of this book were as follows:

A hardcover book that was the same size as KONG, KING OF SKULL ISLAND, and lushly illustrated with new art by DeVito. I also expected it to have the original 1932 text by Delos W. Lovelace. 

Those were my expectations, now here's what it actually is: 

The book is only available in paperback and is about 3/4 of the size of KING OF SKULL ISLAND. The illustrations are sparse, most of which are partial-page black and white pencil sketches. That's not the worst part. The illustrations in this book are LEFTOVERS not used in KONG, KING OF SKULL ISLAND. The nicely done cover of Kong on the Empire State Building is not used in the interior at all, and key scenes begging for a picture in an "illustrated edition" don't have one. 

Oh, and the original Lovelace text? Not here. Oh, some of it is here, but Strickland had to rewrite the story so this could be a joint follow-up to KKOSI, but it looks and feels like a rush job. 

So don't buy this book thinking it is either the original 1932 novelization, or a worthy companion to KONG, KING OF SKULL ISLAND, because it is neither.
