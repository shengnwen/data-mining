We were forced to read this book in philosophy class some years
back and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men and 
inability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse.Her view
of women isn't much better in that they are supposedly the
poor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such a 
distasteful act as intercourse.The male in her book is the 
aggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willing 
victim to only get children and love in return.If she can't see
the pleasure of the sex act then it's no one's fault but hers.
Every page of the book was hard to read.I don't know why some
people bother to read such books because it's a waste of 
trees,paper and time!
Another problem is she makes it sound as though women who 
like intercourse aren't up to her intellectual level,as though
she has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse.
She tries to make very subjective material sound like it's 
supposed to be the objective norm for every woman.Not!!!
Very dangerous book
