This was an interesting little read, though I don't know if I learned much useful information except that raising mushrooms seems to be a super-tedious task. The author writes as if the reader is supposed to know what the heck he's talking about, but I sure didn't.  Perhaps someone with some laboratory know-how would find this book informative, perhaps not.  Since I'm not a lab person, I don't know if his methodology is practical or not
