I had read about memes both in Dawkins and Dennet books, and I thought it was a plausible idea. I purchased this book thinking that I would find how the idea evolved in the hands of true specialists. What a mistake!

The best that can be told about Memetic is that it is currently in the same stage that Darwinism was before Genetic was discovered and developed. It's probably true that memes obey laws similar to a great extent to biological evolution. But you can't develop this idea further without knowing why some ideas are more attractive to the human mind than others. Dennet writes about a stupid song he found himself singing. How did that particular song make it to be recorded in Dennet's brain so deeply? Until we find an answer to this question, all talk about memes will be no more than idle babblings
