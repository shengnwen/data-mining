I do not recommend this book to those of you who are looking into developing any Quicktime application with Java.  The authors have most blindly left out one important element while writing this &quot;reference&quot; book - the reference indeces lack what most API  reference books contain - descriptions.  As whimsical as it is,  the  reference section lists the methods per package, but there is no  documentation describing what they do, and NO analysis of what the  arguments represent or expect !   I look at these signatures, and have  absolutely NO CLUE how to implement them !  The rest of the book suffers  more or less the same sorts of ailments, lack of information.  The authors  are so wrapped up their GUI descriptions, that the object model (which is  so much adored by the creators and writers) is not documented near to  completion.   For my sake and yours, please turn your head (from this book)  while shopping for Quicktime for Java reference books
