The last line of my review comes first:

If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.

And now the review:

I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time.  And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.

The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.

This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor.  The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel.  The characters are all church characters.  And the god is not so godly.  Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.

Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly:
