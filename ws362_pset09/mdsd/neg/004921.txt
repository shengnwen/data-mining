While I loved Dixon's &quot;After Man: A Zoology of the Future&quot; with a lot of passion, &quot;The Future is Wild&quot; was the biggest disappointment in my quest for the studies of future evolution. While the mammals and birds amazed me, I was very disappointed toward the end when they started saying squids will take over the Earth. IAGH!!! Squids will NEVER take over the Earth. Maybe the waters, but never the Earth. Another thing that got me angry was this mess about the extinction of mammals. Well, if history has any bearing, major classes never die out, they become something else, like when dinosaurs evolved into modern birds
