Not to bemoan a point but where are the Japanese ballplayers' perspective since about the 1960s? I mean, how about some of the more post-'60s players like Furuta, Akiyama, Fukudome, Kuwata, Kiyohara...even Ishige, Nakahata, etc.  Even the Japanese MLBers like Nomo, Ichiro et al takes on J-ball would be great to throw in there. 

Sure these are all interesting snapshots BUT why the focus so much on the import players from the '60s onwards? It skews the book way too much towards the same-old tired "gaikokujin (foreigner)" viewpoint. Frankly, if you are going to do a book about Japanese baseball and the import quota in their leagues is so low, why not have a better balance between the J-view and the "foreigners' " view? 

Very disappointing, if you follow J-ball at all. I'll wait for Volume 2 and hope we get a big more updated version.
