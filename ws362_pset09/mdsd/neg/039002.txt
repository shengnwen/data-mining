I have read all of Kiyosaki's books and there are several that are outstanding.  I like Trump's earlier books better.  However, this book was just terrible if you have read anything by either of the two.  It is really a disappointment for the the two of them to collaborate on this one.  It appears they took excerpts from their other books and used cliches all over the place.  It was poorly written, offered little new advice or foresight, and was a major disappointment.  They spent too much time just talking about how they decided to write the book...Save your money for retirement and buy an earlier book of either of the two
