Although many seem to think that this is a delightful book, it is full of stereotyped information about people with Down syndrome that is outdated and offensive. Portraying Eddie as not caring that the children make fun of him, gives readers the idea that people with Down syndrome aren't bright enough to know when they are being made fun of. Always happy, always laughing--certainly not the real picture of people who have feelings, hopes and dreams just like you and I do. The illustrations, although lovely, exaggerate the physical characteristics some people with Down syndrome have in common. Instead of pointing out that people are more alike than different, this book points out differences. If you are looking for a book to educate readers about disability issues or Down syndrome, there are many better choices
