This book is obviously strongly on our side, but unfortunately it is not going to provide us with serious evidence.  Suppose someone challenges me on how they got their $100 billion estimate of the costs of guns.  Will I be taken seriously if I tell them that the book relies on one public survey question in one survey?  If I do use this number, where does that leave me in arguing with gun nuts that cite these wacky surveys showing that guns are used defensively 2.5 million times a year?  So they have 16 surveys.  I don't believe any of them, but what do I say when they say I only use a survey to measure the costs, why not also the benefits?   What if the gun nut morons point out that the estimates of benefits from the surveys are greater than our estimated costs?  The one paragraph that Cook and Ludwig have on defensive gun uses being silly could just as well be used against their reliance on a survey.  I want to use the figures here, but could one of the people on our side write a review saying how I could respond to these concerns.  Absent that this book risks making us look rather silly and hypocritical
