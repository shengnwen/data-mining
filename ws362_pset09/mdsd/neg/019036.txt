I had to buy this book as it was the text book for one of the subjects that I am studying. 

Dated: e.g. Many examples that deal with European currencies that were replaced by the Euro.

Errors: In the illustrations, there are some calculations that take incorrect parameters to derive the results (obviously yielding wrong results). This is misleading and time consuming.

Verbosity: The book explains in twenty pages something that can be explained in five.

No good
