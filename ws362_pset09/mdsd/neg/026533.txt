The book is not fun or a joy to read, nor even sweet.  As a parent I would suggest that this book only serves to promote feelings of neglect, rather than helping to resolve them.  As for the story, there is hardly one here.  We read many books to our children---I tried to stick this one out, but it is boring and dull, and by pre-supposing a problem, may even cause one.  I couldn't read further having read "every night, just before the sun goes down, it reaches out its rays and touches every star in the universe".  What utter tripe.  Children are smart and reasoning people, to cloud their interpretation of the Universe around them with this rubbish is educationaly dangerous. 

Unfortunately we also bough The Kissing Hand at the same time.   We never even bothered to read this and have dumped them both.
