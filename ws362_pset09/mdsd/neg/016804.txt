With all due respect to the other reviewer's enthusiasm, the Eucharist was of course already known by 60 a.d, since Paul clearly refers to it in 1 Cor. 11:23-25, written before 58 a.d., as were all of his authentic letters. We don't need Satyricon as proof of that, but we do need to note that Petronius is mocking the familiar mystery religion ritual dogma of eating the god, e.g. Dionysius, not necessarily the Christian sacrament. He elsewhere in the fragments that survive, mocks the notion of resurrection, with reference to Protesilaus and Mercury, i.e. Hermes psychopomp of Hades. Since internal evidence alone, shows that none of the Gospels could have been written before 68 a.d., it remains unclear to me what Bowersock has to be terrified of; unless it is the Shadow of orthodoxy itself. He certainly shows that resurrection tales were a popular theme in contemporary Latin literature, some of it indeed post-dating the Christian sources and some of it earlier. The genre itself can be traced back to the Greek world of Herodotus and further to the Sumerian legend of Inanna, i.e. Ishtar. So what is there to be afraid of here?..
