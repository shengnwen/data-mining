Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.

The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.

The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.

Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.

If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.
