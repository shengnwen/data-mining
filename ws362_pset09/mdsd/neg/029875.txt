I am a recent college graduate, so the premise of the story was definitely intriguing to me. The beginning of the story was written in such a choppy and direct, yet appealing style that I was excited about the possibilities of where this book would take me. As the story went on though I found that the "twist" or "spin" that I expected the story to take never occurred. From the first chapter this book gets progressively worse until you are left closing the book in disappointment. I love Land's style of writing. That was the only thing that kept me interested just enough to finish this book. I would pass on this story, but I am interested in seeing Land's creative technique combined with a worthy story to go along with it.
