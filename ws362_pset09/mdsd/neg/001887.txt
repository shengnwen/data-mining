I could not have been more disappointed in a book! This book offers no real spritual inspiration. Maybe Frank Peretti has become enchanted by the Bigfoot legend but this book is far and away his worst. The plot is weak, character development is terrible and the ending is anti-climactic. Extremely disappointing!
 Sometimes good authors feel obliged to publish a book, maybe he was pressured, who knows. This is even close to the same caliber of Piercing the Darkness or This Present Darkness
