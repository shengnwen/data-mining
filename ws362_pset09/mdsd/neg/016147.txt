If you buy the role Fenton proposes for the media, then perhaps you might like this book more.  But since he simply posits that the media is there to protect the country, promote unity, and a whole list of other (about 10 total) roles of the media, and then fails to explain why this is the media's role.....I sit there questioning this expansive role of news.

I see the newsmedia as a source of information.  They are to provide the people with the who/what/where/how and why of what is going on in the world at large and locally.  They are NOT to be ideology machines, whether good or bad ideologies.

Fenton observes how foreign news has drastically declined since the Cold War and how disastrous this has been.  Here, describing the ins and outs of his field he excels, and does not spare any administration or political position.  Yet he fails to notice that the reason why it was so much easier to report news in the Cold War era, and why his goals of unifying the country blah blah were so much more attainable is because we had an obvious enemy in front of us.  In today's society, what foreign threat do we focus upon?  Terrorism, the middle east, n. korea, chinese economic expansion, resurgent russian and japanese nationalism?  Its unfortunate and a very valid point that the newsmedia seems to focus on NONE of these, at least with their own correspondents abroad.  But Fenton's attacks often draw upon the sympathies of a post-911 world.  Of course the news, like the government should have paid more attention to Bin Laden and company.  We now that NOW.  But hindsight is 20/20
