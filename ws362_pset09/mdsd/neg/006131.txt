This Audio CD was produced in very poor quailty, in terms of the sound and by the person reading it.  It would be nice if it was the true voice of Wallace Wattles - because I'd keep it just for sentimental reasons, but it sounds like it was recorded in about 1970 in a closet with a $50 tape recorder.  The reader is not professional - being short to of breath to speak whole sentences, and they are very monotone without expression (and I love this book so much, I want to hear it with some amount of conviction, strength and joy!) 
If you want a better audio version than this - simply record yourself
