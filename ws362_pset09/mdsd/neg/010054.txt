People buy this book thinking that they will get great advice about how to become a bookie.

What kind of advice you get? None, unless you consider advice not to take the phone calls at your home, or how to fill a piece of paper with the information. It seems that this guy have not heard of spredsheets. 

Anyway, the worst of all, is that he tells you basically that you should not worry because people only take favorites and you will make tons of money because underdogs are not taken into account by the bettor.

I agree that in certain sports  like football there is a bias towards favorites, but if you take the data the underdog cover about 52% (or the favorite 48% ATS). This guy talks like 90% of the people bets on the favorite. But even if that it is the case, if the remaining 10% are wiseguys with a huge bankroll your days as a bookie will be counted.

By the way, unless you lived outside the US, his advice not only could make lose money but you could end up in jail!

Do not waste your money on this
