I can understand why there are so many glowing reviews for this book.  Mr. Merrick has vast knowledge of the ins-and-outs of the stand alone inventor's world, however, everything in the book is based only on his four small-time inventions, none of which even exist anymore (which is probably why he needed to write a book).  I have nothing but admiration for his accomplishments because few people would go through the many mundane steps he has taken, which is why I didn't find this book very useful.  In fact, after reading all the time and work it takes to becoming a true "stand alone inventor", he has convinced me that licensing is the way to go, which is the opposite effect I'm sure he was hoping for.

He talks about going to your local mom and pop stores to peddle your idea, which simply isn't possible anymore with the big chain stores.  The internet and e-mail are mentioned on only three pages, when it is the basis of most marketing today.  He mails media kits to the media when most won't even accept anything other than through e-mail anymore.  These are just a few examples of how antiquated his methods are in today's world.

It's generally decent historical information, but if you're looking for up-to-date and useful information and advice for today's inventor, I would recommend looking elsewhere
