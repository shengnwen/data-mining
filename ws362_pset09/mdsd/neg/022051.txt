I have Lee as a professor right now. I thought it was interesting that she helped write the book, and then was going to teach with it. Well when we were assigned to read the first chapter the first class, I thought..how am I going to read the rest of this??! The way the book is set up, I can't even follow it. The terms are thrown in the middle of paragraphs, and it's difficult to follow along. I think it just seems like a lot of "babble" throught the whole thing. If things were set up better, I'm sure the ideas presented would be wonderful, but it's just difficult how it is
