If you are a classics scholar or student, you might find this book to your liking--although I'd recommend you browse through it in a bookstore before buying it online, sight unseen. Just keep in mind, it is NOT A COMPANION to Greek Tragedy as it claims, which to my mind implies that it is a reference book about the tragedies and their authors. Instead, this book is simply a short collection of seemingly random and unrelated essays about select tragedies. This book looks like someone's attempts to get tenure in their department more than anything else. If you're writing a dissertation on Euripides or Aeschylus perhaps you'll find a tidbit of scholarship in this book that will make it worth the price, but if you're just a fan of Greek Tragedy there are better books to buy
