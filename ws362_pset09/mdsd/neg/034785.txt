As another reviewer said in his 1-star review of this book, the sections on poker are excellent but they are buried inside of seemingly endless chapters on Ted Binion's murder, the author's grandparents, and all kinds of other nonsense.  While those subjects could possibly be fascinating, McManus isn't nearly good enough as a writer to make them interesting.  So what we're left with is a highly-compelling description of the 2000 WSOP for about 1/3rd of the book and then 2/3rds garbage.  

Best avoided if you're looking for a poker book
