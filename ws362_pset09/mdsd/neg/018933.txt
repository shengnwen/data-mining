Book started off cutely, with Biegler the former DA coming home from fishing to find a murder had occured in the county, and making all sorts of smart remarks.  The case: Woman says she is raped, husband kills rapist.  The book should actually be called "Anatomy of a Murder Trial", since it does go on at length about that.  I never could understand why an attorney from the State Attorney General's office shows up to assist (basically taking over the prosecution) the new DA.  And of course he's just as horrid as can be, and Paul Biegler, the defense attorney gets to make all the witty cracks, putting Dancer in his place, and win the case.  The book is quite different from the movie (which wasn't very good either), in that except for the Attorney General taking over the case, and surprise witnesses showing up with no notice to either side, the book makes more sense, and of course, has more detail to explain things.

But instead of getting to the heart of the matter, the author seemed to want to show off his ability to blather on and on about nothing
