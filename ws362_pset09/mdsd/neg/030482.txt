I bought this based on the previous reviews. The book is very thin in content with about 250 cards per exam in the boook itself. It does not nearly cover the needed information.  The CD is better with more flash cards per exam, and a testing engine, but still thin in coverage and explanations.  It has information you can use, but not enough. If it was structured toward the exam requrements it would have been better. If you used the other Cisco press books, you don't need this, not even at the discounted price.  As a comparison, the CCNA flash cards book was much better.
