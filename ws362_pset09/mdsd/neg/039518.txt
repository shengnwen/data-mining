Paul Davies is a wonderful author, obviously well-versed in eastern mysticism; however, his understanding of physics leaves one wondering what his education gained him.  From the outset in this book, we are riddled with flowering phrases that, although alluring to the curious mind and sense of magical wonder of the universe, are quite misleading in physical reality.  Starting with his assertion that Einstein completely turned Newtonian mechanics on its head, he misleads the non-scientist down a path of dis-education and complete bewilderment.  The theory of relativity reduces down to newtonian mechanics at slower velocities!!  In this light, I fail to see any contradiction between the Einstein and Newton views of time.  Unfortunately, many authors appeal to the general public on the grounds of either sensationalism or mysticism.  The real physical universe is full of more wonder than any mystical experience could ever dream up!  For a GOOD overview of physics that the layman can wrap their minds around, read just about anything by Richard Feynman...or start asking physics teachers and professors - you'll always find an enthusiastic physicist ready to untangle the knot of bewilderment and confusion left in the wake of such authors as Paul Davies
