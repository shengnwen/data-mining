Well... I know kitchens in the USA are usually larger than the ones in Europe but even then... most kitchens shown in this book are 3 to 4 times bigger than my current kitchen. The book does NOT give you planning tips, no clever cabinet interiors, just pictures of finished kitchens, not even info on how that finished kitchen came to be. 
So if you are looking for clever ideas for making the most of small kitchens, DO NOT buy this book!
