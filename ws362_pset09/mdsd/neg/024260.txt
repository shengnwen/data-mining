This book is so embarrassingly bad that it seems cruel even to review it.  At the same time, I read it almost compulsively in horrified fascination (which is why it deserves one star).  Overwritten, vapid, crammed full of cliches, pricey brand names, infelicitous prose, useless Italian phrases dutifully translated (we get that your Italian is good, but so what?), irrelevant literary references (we also get that you went to Harvard and never got over your good luck at being there), it would be best to forget it and its cast of insufferable characters.  Still, I devoted some time and money to this silly book, so I'll continue.  I understand that this is not, strictly speaking, a memoir, although at times it has the feel of one.  Yet I can't help but feel that the author is striving with every sentence, through the character that she has created, to show the world how intelligent, sophisticated, well read, well traveled, beautiful, sexy, successful, and especially how rich, she, the author, is.  It's as if she's still trying to prove to all those girls who dissed her back in high school or college that she has become "someone."  None of this makes for good or interesting fiction.  As a matter of fact, the only interesting aspect of this book is why a black, sort of, woman would want to transform herself into a rich white Italian woman from Torino.  It's the twenty-first century.  Italy is no longer the ne plus ultra of a chic international life style.  It's so last century, as is our fascination with its outdated and superficial social relations and pretensions to nobility.  Apparently, however, the publisher still buys into all this nonsense and hopes that we will, too
