This is my first from Gennita Low. I was so enthusiastic to read it because of glossy reviews. What a disappointment... This is a US government suspense. Consequently,  the main idea was good in the beginning. The factor of ethnic flavour (the heroin is Asian) is also something new in this genre. 
[...] Ms Low repeats every single detail so many times that that made me almost thrown up. After some time I gave up counting to read how many times the bad guys tortured, raped etc. the heroin. How can it be possible to have operated perfectly after what happened her skin, face, body? Plastic surgery has lots of limitations Ms. Low. 
Actually I found the heroin totally dumbfounded. The hero is irritating and his fetish about long long hair is gross.
Is it really possible if a person really is unaware of herself throughout 10 years and then remembers everything in bed with her "husband"?
This book needs a good editing, but it is too late. Normally Avon is quite precise in this matters, perhaps they were in a hurry. Despite what I wrote, I am planning to give this author another try, maybe I will order her first or next work. I hope she improves herself in writing, as I mentioned before she has some great ideas.[...]
