Pedestrian, insipid, and banal are all descriptives with more life than what is encountered in this collection of bleh.  

It's unfortunate that the author applied his wonderful writing style to expertly strip all sense of humanity and intelligence from his characters, deciding instead that every represention and encounter be woven from identical nothingness.

After reading Barrel Fever I was left with a nagging feeling that I had been witness to little more than the kidnap of many perfectly innocent words for the ransom of a contracted book release.
