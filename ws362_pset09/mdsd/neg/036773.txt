I love watching the Bay Area Backroads TV show. I thought the card deck would be as advertised, toss in your glove compartment and off you go!There are lots of cards of individual landmarks to visit and one fold out card with a very simple map, but you will still need a real map, lodging book and a restaurant guide to make a nice trip out of any one of the destination cards. I think I will stick to cutting the weekend trip guides out of Sunset and Via magazines. I was dissapointed with the card set
