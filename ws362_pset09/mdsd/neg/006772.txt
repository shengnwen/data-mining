This should of been called &quot;The bad things that happened to me while pet sittng for 8 years.&quot; The vast bulk of the book is made up of anectdotes from the author's life that, taken alone, would keep anyone from wanting to become a pet sitter. Although the author obviously has a love of her job, there is not one recount of a positive experience that would explain that love. The reader has to pause in wonder at the author's fear of mice, squirrels, iguanas, and even some cats. If you are a lover of ALL animals, or you if are looking for advice on how to start or improve your business, you will find this book seriously lacking in substance. Written in second (yes, second) person, and full of uninspired language wrapped around poor attempts at humor(ie.repeated use of the phrase 'no pun intended'), this is a disappointment by any measure. Two stars is a generous rating
