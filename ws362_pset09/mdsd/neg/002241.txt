At the beginning of the journey, Tanner is asked if he trusts the guards he hired for the trip.  He says yes with no hesitation--it made you think they were going to be someone important in his life rather than just 2 hired men.  One day into the trip, the men screw up and Tanner questions their reliability--a little too late, huh?  Meanwhile, they were hired to guard $50,000 for 3 months.  That's a big responsibility.

The description of the hero and heroine really bothered me.  Tanner is described as having reddish brown hair with a craggy face.  Fox gets part of her ear chopped off in a shoot out.  It's referred to again and again how she's missing a chunk of her ear lobe.

When they become intimate, he takes off her sweaty, filthy, leather boots that she's been wearing for probably years at at time and sucks on her toes.....what a pleasant thought.  Their next love scene involves the feet again.  Gross.

She's a hard headed guide who's dedicated to her work and getting them quickly and safely to Denver.  Midway through the book the 2 main characters become involved intimately and now that's all she thinks about and talks about.  They've completely become lax in guarding the money and go off into the woods to be alone while leaving the guards (one of whom was robbed once already, and the other whose honesty was doubted from the start) with Peaches, an elderly sick man.  Need I say more?

Maggie Osborne is now 0 for 3 on my scorecard.  The last 3 books she's written have fallen way short of the keeper category for me
