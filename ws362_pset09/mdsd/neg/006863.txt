This was my second Ted Bell book and I must say it was better than the first (which is really not saying anything).  The action is face paced enough to keep you interested but in the end the horrendous technical inaccuracies, ridiculous characters, and poor writing make you wish you'd never started it.  

I made a long list of technical inaccuracies as I read, but I will limit this rant to only one.  Hawke's super yacht (which we know already contains a plane and a speed boat from his last book) is now equipped with an Aegis radar system!  Most commonly seen on US guided missile cruisers and destroyers, Aegis' SPY 1 radar uses 4 gigantic phased-array panels that emit enough energy to cook a human being.  Somehow he has secretly attached these to a yacht without anyone seeing them. ARG
