At first glance, I thought this book would be helpful when I spied it on the bookshelf at my local bookstore.  However, when I opened it to the introductory chapter I learned that the culture which gave the name Yule (the Norse) where not even mentioned...at all.  I finally found a blurb about them in the paragraph on mistletoe.  But the story pertaining to mistletoe and the god Balder was completely wrong.  All in all, when I flipped through the rest of the book, I found that if I did about a week's research online and in a few books, I could've done a better job with this than she did
