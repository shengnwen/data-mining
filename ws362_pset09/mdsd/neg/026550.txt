This is one of the worst books I've ever been foreced to read in my entire life. Having to use this as part of the University Text, I found it very confusing in concept explanation. In short there was no simple explanation of any concept. Every thing was said in very complicated sentences and the book was totally missing straight forward explanation on any topic. Some times, you would read a couple of paragraphs under a specific topic and still wonder which part explains the topic itself... I would not recommend this to somebody who is learning OO newly or for someone who is buried into structured programming like myself..
