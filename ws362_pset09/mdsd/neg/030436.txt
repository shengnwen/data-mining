This is the first one of the "Cat Who..." books that I have read. I thought this book was going to get really good but it never did.  I thought it was kind of boring because it really didn't have a point.  It just rambled on and on. This book was only a little interesting when Quill was interviewing people for things to put in the book he is writing. This book was mostly boring though again becase it had no point, it would go to one subject and then not carry on with that and go to something completely different. Overall this book was just okay
