Moriarty's Spin State is built on a premise that seems to be a cross of On Basilisk Station, James Bond, the Coal Miner's Daughter, and a John Grisham thriller.  Well worn SciFi concepts like a world sentience, virtual reality a la the Matrix, wetware, and AI's more human than the biological characters a la the Caves of Steel make unsurprising appearances.  And a web of contrived triple and quadruple-crossing is laid over the whole plot in order to keep it from spinning apart from the centrifugal force of the jagged and disjointed dialogue and scene setting.  At least six competing interests dominate the book; that of the main character, Major Catherine Li, that of the United Nations, represented by a power hungry intelligence general, that of a breakaway syndicate of genetically created humans, that of the natives of the host planet, that of the murdered character at the center of the plot, and that of the collective mind of the planet itself.  Not enough for you?  How about several more minor subplots competing for mind space as well?  Did I forget to mention occasional androgyny and homoerotica?  Oh, and Earth is uninhabitable due to environmental irresponsibility?  Really.  The publisher did give Moriarty a contract for a sequel, so perhaps I'm missing something.  Commercial viability offers some proof of entertainment value.
