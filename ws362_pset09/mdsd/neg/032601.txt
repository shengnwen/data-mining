I was very intruiged by the premise of this book, as both a research source and entertainment.  I was especially interested in how the author would approach the effects of the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune on Impressionism, which is often ignored by art historians.

However, while this book appears to be exhaustively researched at first glance, I had several problems with it.  The author offers no new information, arguments, or theses to offer a new perspective on Impression.  Instead, he simply fills the reader's head with MORE information, most of it superfluous, to support preconceived popular notions of Impressionism.  Secondly, his two "main characters," Manet and Meissonier (who I got the feeling was being continuously mocked throughout the book), are NOT IMPRESSIONISTS!  Seriously, I know Manet influenced the Impressionists and is considered the father of Impressionism, but he refused to exhibit with them for a reason, and I don't think he would particularly appreciate being included with them as default.

Futhermore, I have to agree with another reveiwer that we get no sense of the personalities of any of the people presented in these pages, including the author.  It wouldn't have killed him to make a judgement call.

Finally, I have to warn art history lovers that this is mainly a history book.  King does talk about art, but only tangenitally--he doesn't analyze it or make it a central part of this book.  How a person can have a book about the influences of Impressionism and not about art I don't know, but there you have.

For a really great book about the influences of Impressionism (and all art at this time period) that brings a fresh perspective to the subject, I would recommend ART, WAR, AND REVOLUTION IN FRANCE by J Milner
