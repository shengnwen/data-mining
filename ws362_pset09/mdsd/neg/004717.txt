I looked forward to a bunch of great stories about the future of earth and how mankind was dealing with it.  Instead this was three or four books obviously done at different times that were were slapped together to form a somwhat continuous story for the most part.  I liked the first couple of stories and then the repetitiveness of Cugel wore me out.  Unrepentent, scurrilous Cugel was funny for the first 30 pages but after what seemed like 1000 pages I wanted to bump him off myself.  
Please beware of the other reviews.  Unless you want a semi humorous fantasy novel telling a bunch of semi linked stories about a dying earth with lots of magic then stay the heck away from this.
