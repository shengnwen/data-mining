I wasn't actually expected a miracle diet, but this book is ridiculous. The entire books reads like an extended infomercial. You'll have to slog through account after account of how amazing this diet is before you get to the meat of the program on page 80+. The menus don't even start until page 100. This book might have been okay as maybe a 10 page pamphlet. Don't waste your money
