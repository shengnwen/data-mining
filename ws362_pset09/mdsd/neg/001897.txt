The "ultimate Reference"???  This man's hubris knows no bounds.

I got my 1st Hart book when I was a budding cartoonist at the age of 12.  I could wax eloquent about Mr. Hart's lack of artistic prowess and limited style, I will simply point out that aside from publishing these How To Draw books, he has done virtually nothing in the mainstream or independant comic/ art industry.  That in itself should be the biggest warning to all of you out there.

As far as strict anatomy for goes, few people have done better than Jack Hamm and Bruce Hogarth, with Hogarth being my current favorite.  For you aspiring comic artists out there, "How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way" may be a bit older, but still worlds better than anything Hart has produced.

For those of you just looking for one book that covers everything about drawing comics, I must reccommend WIZARD's "How to Draw" Book 1.  This, as opposed to Hart's books, are written by a collabaration of successful and undisputed masters of the industry, and is so superior to Hart's that there's practically no comparison.  So for pete's sake, don't waste your money on this book, or any other book written by Hart
