I just ordered this cookbook and can already tell I'm not going to get my money's worth out it. There are very few recipes that call for ingredients you can buy at a typical supermarket. Most necessitate a trip to a specialty or gourmet market.

Also, make no mistake: this is not easy, leave it in the slow-cooker type of cooking. It's not a good sign when a recipe begins, "take the first 20 ingredients and marinate the meat overnight."
