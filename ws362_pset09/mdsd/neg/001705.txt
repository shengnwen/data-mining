If this is the first time you've heard the words "quantum physics," then maybe you will get something out of this book.  If you have the slightest familiarity with the subject, such as having read a science periodical article about it, this book is probably a waste of your time.  Much of it is not very useful graphics and text blocks, and the actual narrative is sparse and overly simplistic.  I have enjoyed most of Gribben's books, which is why I bought this one, it was a real disappointment...and a waste of money
