One of the commercial reviews indicates that this book is a "period piece" and that description probably best describes the book.  It was written in a period of time long before Rothko was working his signature style and had achieved any success.

It also didn't help that the Introduction, by the late painter's son, Christopher Rothko, was unnecessarily portentious.  The later parts concerning the history of the manuscripts, also written by Christopher Rothko, do tone down the excess language and are quite interesting.

The essays themselves seem incomplete, pedestrian in spots, and extremely dated.  As others have noted, Rothko doesn't talk about his own work.

Who is the audience of this book?  Completists?  Researchers?  It can't be that many people.  

Something like the publicaton of Kurt Cobain's Journals in book form several years after his suicide had relevance to that artist, even if it was a bit like peeking into somebody's diary.  "The Artist's Reality" has almost no relevance to most fans of Mark Rothko and certainly none to those who appreciate his more famous style of painting
