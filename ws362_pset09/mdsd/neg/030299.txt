I got this book thinking it would help with animation principles and some technical aspects, but it gleans over everything so quickly that the whole thing is useless. For example the chapter on Web Animation is about 4 pages long and covers Animated Gifs- Yeah, because what I really wanted to learn was how to make a looping picture of a clown on a ball. It also touches upon Flash, but its only given a 2 page spread and the only info it gives is "Flash is good for web animation!" This book has nice coulor photographs, but the only information it gives is stuff you probably already know like you need a camera for stop motion and that you should figure out what your cartoon will be about before making it. Oh, and apparently Angelina Anaconda is the end-all be-all of animation
