this book can come across as pink, bubbels, rainbows and flowers. for those who read books in this nature but with more hard hitting subjects, i wouldent recomend buying it, instead read a few chapters for yourself in a libary. doren virtue seems to channel angles, but shes writting books just for money as she never relly writes stright foward answers to thhe questions. those who do already channel angels, you already know the score but buy and angle book off her anyway, most channelers have one somewhere.

on the other hand if you are having a bad, day/month/ year. this book may make you cry and allow you to feel good about yourself for a moment or two. or you could just have a lobley bath with pink bubbles and rainbows, instead of reading about them
