How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said.
I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest
