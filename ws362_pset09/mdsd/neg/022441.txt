Everything this book presents to the reader about B. F. Skinner and his daughter Deborah is based entirely on an false urban legand. B.F. Skinner did not, as this book claims, keep his daughter in a "skinner box". As a matter of fact he used her for no experements at all. This book also claims she eventually killed her self in a Billings Montana bowling alley due to the torment she suffered at the hands of her father. This is also not true. In fact, she is still alive.
Remember: Don't believe everything that you read.
