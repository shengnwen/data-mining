As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is full of scientific and musical inaccuracies. Campbell's research methods are shoddy, and he has spent much of his career publishing irreplicable results.

Don Campbell is not a board-certified music therapist, nor does he even remotely have the equivalent training. While listening to music indeed has benefits, this has nothing to do with music therapy. 

Music therapy involves a highly trained therapist working in person with a client, using music (usually live, often improvised, and usually created by client and therapist together) to work on client-specific goals. These goals do not ever involve "making a child smarter," and this does not ever involve using a CD that was "prescribed" without having met with and assessed the client.

The actual field of music therapy has published reserach showing that listening to a variety of music is good for intellectual and emotional development. This does not require any specific music selected by any experts. This just involves going to performances and/or getting CDs from the library.

Participating in interactive social music-making, such as community drumming circles, or parent-child play with instruments or improvised instruments has also been shown to be good for child development. Structured music lessons are also good for child development in different ways. All of this has been demonstrated over and over again by research.

Instead of buying this book, I suggest reading a music therapy textbook or speaking with a music therapist in order to learn about music therapy, and listening to recordings and participating in music-making in order to reap the benefits of music
