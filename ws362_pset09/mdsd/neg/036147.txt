Another collector of wishy washy grab table records, who obviously bought anything as long it was cheap and had some nipples on the cover, proudly presents his collection. This was probably cheap to reproduce for the publisher, since none of the shown record sleeves were of any lasting value for the market and probably scratched from memory after release. The artwork shown is superficial and mostly shows images that could have been cut out of page 3 of nameless 3rd class girlie magazines. The music must have been secondary indeed, I have been dealing with music for 30 years and never met people who actually listened to this type of entertainment. On the 70's and 80's it runs even shorter than on the cheesecake tradition (gack...this word alone...) rest, not even classics like Hendrix' electric ladyland are included here...bare anything that was a little more specific or explicit. A complete waste if time - I wish someone would get a serious collector to produce such a book..
