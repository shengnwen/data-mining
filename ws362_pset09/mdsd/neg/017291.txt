I started this book with gusto.  The writing was well done, the character's well developed, the speed moving along nicely.  The first couple of chapters had quite a bit of action and was a page turner...and then middle of the book-bam...nothing.  The story gets slooooow.  Suddenly the author is going on and on about things in the characters lives that are uninteresting and of little point.  The action dies completely.  I struggled on, thinking it would pick back up, but gave up on the last 70 or so pages.  I didn't even have enough interest to find out what happened to the characters and just felt cheated at having spent the time I did reading it.  Would not recommend
