The authors make the dumb mistake of assuming that because the shroud dates from the Middle Ages it must be a fake.  It's true connection with Jacques de Molay is not explored fully.  They haven't seen the true connection between Jaques de Molay and Leonardo Da Vinci, but at least they were on the right track here.  Miracles do happen and none of their arguments have convinced me for one instant that the Turin Shroud is a fake.  The shroud was used to wrap the body of Jaques de Molay, but the image is most likely of Jesus Christ.  It's that simple.  Can I prove this - No.  Can anyone disprove this - Give it a go.  This book was a rather lame-brained attempt
