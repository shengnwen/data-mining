I had expected something of the genre and quality of Market Wizards I & II,  Trading for a living, Trade like a Hedge Fund (by James Altucher), Soros on Soros, Reminiscences of a stock operator, Running Money by Andy Kessler  etc etc. I had been confoundedly disappointed. The book is flooded of interviews with hedge fund managers anonymous leading you to nowhere but setting goals, visualizing success, overcoming fears and all the stuff you find in any trading psychology book, only that the writing skill of the author is sub-standard. The author had repeated the term "Hedge Fund" highly frequently. However, the content is not related particularly to any hedge fund or hedge fund manager at all. Also, the author had elaborated the term "mastery" throughout the book. I assure you that you will have no idea of how to achieve it unless you employ the author as your personal trading counsellor. 

In short, a waste of time, money and the paper to print the book.
