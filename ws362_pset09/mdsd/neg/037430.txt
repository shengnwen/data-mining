PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!
Ive read several mafia books and this is by far the worst.
All Roemer talks about is him self theres actually very little about Spilotro???? He mentions and kisses up to every cop and agent he's ever meant??? He thinks J Edgar Hoover was god???
This book is extremely boring? hardly anything about Spilotro.
I dont even know why he bothered, after reading this book I would have given him my money not to write it!!! Complete waste of time!
Did you know that Roemer used to box in college? well you will when you read this book I dont think theres a single page that he doesnt mention it?(joke)
Each chapter starts with a couple paragraphs about Spilotro and then page after page about himself and everybody in the world BUT Spilotro???? THANKYO
