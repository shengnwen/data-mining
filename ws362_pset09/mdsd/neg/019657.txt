For something that advertises itself as the complete guide, it's completely lacking. Almost no information on tuning, way too general overview of cars w/ no discussion of various differences between the cars, pretty much nothing in the book that you can't figure out on your own.

When I reserved my copy soon after the game was released it was advertised to me by the dude at the game store as being delayed because they were spending lots of time adding lots of information to the book, so it was going to be a truly complete, extremely informative book... instead, I find out later that it was only delayed due to licensing problems and has actually been finished for months, before the game was even officially released.

It's not too poorly priced, but I wouldn't buy it if I had it to do over again. Last time I reserve a strategy guide ;
