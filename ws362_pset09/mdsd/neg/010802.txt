I'll agree with other reviewers that the content doesn't provide much supplemental information, but I confess a preference for hard copy documentation when I'm using software. It's the booklover in me, plus the fact that I like to look at the manual and the game I'm playing at the same time.

My complaint with this book is that it is cheaply produced and difficult to read. I've grown used to the 4-color Prima guides. They are excelently laid out and easy on the eye. The Civ IV guide, however, is B&W and the font size is 9 at best. Unless you have great vision, you'll find yorself wanting to use a magnifier. It's fascinating. The Prima Sims2 Nightlife manual has 224 pages, all 4-color, and is a pleasure to read. The Brady Civ IV manual has 188 B&W pages and is a complete pain to peruse. Both have list prices of $19.99. One guess which company is delivering the best value
