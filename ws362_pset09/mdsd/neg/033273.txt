This book is too dense and redundant.  Though I applaud Sharon Heller's attempt to bring this issue to the mainstream, it seems only to apply to the most severely affected people and not to less extreme cases.  Additionally, the only real suggestions for help seemed to point to seeing a specialist.  I really could not find anything practical to help with my "oversensitivity".  I did notice the author tends to mention "brushing your skin," yet never really tells what that is, but rather refers the reader to a specialist.  One last comment, the type is very, very small and irritating to read.  Bottom line:  Great for extreme sensory defensives, but overly detailed and redundant for those of us moderately so.  Offers no substantial or practical self-help solutions
