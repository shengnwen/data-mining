I really wanted this book to be better. I got this book after reading an excerpt from it in Outdoor Photographer magazine.

After reading the book I must say that I am a bit dissapointed. The problem is that the book tries to be all things to all people and really does not do a good job at anything.

For example the first half of the book deals with basic Photoshop 101 stuff. Things like levels, curves, crop, layers, selections etc. The only problem is that moderate to experienced Photoshop users (like myself) will find this a total waste of space, (which I could live with) but the problem is it is all presented at such a high level that novice users will find it totally useless.

The biggest issue however is that they did a VERY poor job with the layout of the book. The book has a lot of screen shots to show you various PS menus and workspaces and none of them are on the pages where they talk about it. You constantly have to flip ahead 2-3 pages to see the example. There are also many before and after shots of pictures processed with PS. It wouls have been really nice if they were on the same page, but once again you have to flip between pages.

The second half of the book does get a bit better, but I found I really wanted more. 

If you get this book and you have at least a basic working knowledge of Photoshop you will probably learn a trick or two that will help you with your photography and it is really not all that expensive here on Amazon.

If you are new to photoshop you would be much better served elsewhere, like the many great books by Scoot Kelby
