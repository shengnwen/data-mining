Theories put forth in this book are so far-fetched that it is hard to believe they can be found in print.  Conspiracy theory has been taken to its ultimate right wing conclusions, and all those theories linked into one unbelievable piece of propaganda. Of course that makes it entertaining, at times, until you realize that this author is serious about it.  There is plenty of logic used here, but you have to accept his evidence at face value to believe.  It doesn't work if you have ever read deeply in the subjects he covers.  The author is so far removed from society he should be living in a utopian commune, like the Amish, if he really practices what he preaches.  But his attempt here to convince the world of his view is fraught with logical inconsistency, incomplete perspectives, and extreme bias.
