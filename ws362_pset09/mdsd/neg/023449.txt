This book and it's author's logic is flawed beyond belief !

The fact that some Historians might differ on what exactly took place inside a concentration camp is not the same thing as "denying" there was such a thing as a concentration camp.
Well, it is the same thing in the mind of this author !

Asking for proof and evidence for some of the wild claims as to what actually  happened constitutes "Holocaust Denial" - in the mind of this author !

Dicussing what phisically could have happened based upon the exact science of modern forensic technology constitutes "Holocaust Denial" - in the mind of this author !

However, she goes even beyond illogic, and into the world of "make believe" with her wild claims when it comes to noted British Historian David Irving - whome she rashly bashes and libels as a "Holocaust Denier".

The problem with that reckless defamation is that David Irving has NEVER, EVER, written ANYTHING on the "Holocaust" in any of his many books on World War Two subjects.

This deliberate misrepresentation alone should consign this book to the trash heap - which sentiment a great number of others agree with considering how many are offered on Amazon Marketplace starting as low as four bucks.

For a much better look at the real meaning of the "Holocaust" in modern times, read THE HOLOCAUST INDUSTRY by Norman Finkelstein, a truly righteous Jew whose parents were both incarcerated in concentration camps in World War Two
