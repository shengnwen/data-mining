I really dislike giving a 2-star rating to this book. I WANTED to like it, really I did. But it's not a great book. Many of the quilts in the gallery are pieces that I have seen in other books I own. I have always liked many of these quilts - key phrase: ALWAYS LIKED.... as in have seen many, many times. Nearly a fourth of the quilts are five or more years old, and in this information age, that's a long time. As for the techniques section - if you have the Snippets books or the Painting book which Cindy co-authored, you already have about half the techniques. Some of the other techniques (Angelina, photo transfer) are shown in better detail in the Quilting Arts magazine or other books, and two of the "techniques" are just basic traditional piecing with perhaps a slight twist toward contemporary (for ex, stamping on sashing fabrics).

All-in-all, if I'd seen it before I ordered it, Amazon would still own it, and I'd still have my money. Unhappily, it's now the other way around. I know a lot of work goes into writing a book, but these authors should have put their efforts toward a better project. The best thing I can say is that the gallery photography is good (the projects photos less so). And if you don't own many exhibit catalogs or other books on art quilts you may really enjoy this one
