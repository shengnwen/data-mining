I am a Lisa Scottoline fan and have enjoyed all her other books, so I had looked forward to this one.  I was very disappointed.
The heroine, a judge, is not only incredibly dumb, but extremely uninteresting. Her behavior was to hard to believe for a woman who had the professional job as a judge.  The cast of characters held no interest for me and frankly, I couldn't care less why she acted the way she did nor who committed the murder.  The writing was boring, too long and a very weak ending.  
All of Lisa Scottoline books are usually are a fast read; not this one.  This took me forever to read and when I realized it was going no where, I started skipping some pages.  
I do not recommend this book
