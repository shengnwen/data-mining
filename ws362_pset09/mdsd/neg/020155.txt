Kim Harrison: 3 stars, maybe 3 1/2 because the story line was actually entertaining.  But it assumed you'd read her other books, and anyone who hasn't must have felt lost.  

Kelley Armstrong: 4 stars, a good story with entertaining characters.  It felt like it was stretched to make a word count, but a good read.  The best of the bunch, I thought.

The other two don't get a star, sorry. If you don't mind buying half a book for a whole book price, or if you're a Harrison or Armstrong fan and want to collect their entire body of work, this is worth picking up.  Otherwise, don't bother.
