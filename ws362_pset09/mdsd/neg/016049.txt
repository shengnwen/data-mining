Life is too short for this sort of thing. I even gave up on this book listening to an unabridged version on tape. I can't even imagine what reading it would be like with its ultra-dense, paragraph-averse style. Who would have thought that authors were this self-indulgent even back in the 30's!

Skip the entire ridiculously undecipherable book and read the chronology and geneaology in the back! Join the ranks of proud low-brows who have other books to read and enjoy!
