I crossed over to the "dark side" a while ago but Edward doesn't seem to want to talk to me. Too bad. I could tell him what it's really like over here, which is B-O- R-I-N-G. Not to mention dark. Somebody should pay that damn electical bill once in a while. Trust me, the spirit world is not what it's cracked up to be. And here he is making all that money on us and we never get any of it or get to have any fun at all. Oh well, I guess that's show biz for you. But when he gets over here, we're gonna have a little reception. Probably open up a can of whup-ass on that self-promoting cheapskate. We may be spirits, but we've got our ways. Just see how he likes spending a few thousand years in Purgatory. Oh sh_t, here comes the Big Boss himself. Sorry your Excellency, I mean your Royal Darkness, I'll get back to tending those fires right away. I was just saying to Adolf and Mephistopheles here what we're gonna do to Edward when gets down here...Ow! That damn pitchfork is sharp! Okay, okay, I'm getting back to work right now..
