When I started this book, a friend of mine said "He needs a new editor".  And I couldn't agree more.   This book could be called "Bonfire of the Vanities Goes to College."   It's pretty much the same book, but this time Wolfe skewers college students and athletes instead of investment bankers and radical ministers.   The characters all share the same "one-noteness" which seemed new and interesting in Bonfire, but seems forced and a tad boring in this book.   And he does go on and on and on with his descriptions.  What would be funny if done in a sentence or two (e.g. , the scene describing the gym habits of the basketball players) turns tedious after the third or fourth page.   The story was also predictable.   While worthwhile as a cautionary tale for anyone going or sending a child to college in this day and age, the same effect could have been accomplished in far less pages and with far greater success.
