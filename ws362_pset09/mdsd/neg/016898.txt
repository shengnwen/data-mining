There are many good things to say about this text. It is through, has great cross-references, and is relatively cheap. Sadly, however, that is pretty much where the positive ends and the negative begins.

As has been said before, the orgainzation is pretty terrible. No one section fully covers all they want to say about a particular drug, and most medical schools present it in a different fashion. I spend half my time flipping around finding the relevant section about which I want to read.

Also, is it too much to ask that medical textbooks be properly bound? A flimsy paperback with cheap binding simply won't stand up to the rigors of lugging this book back and forth to class every day.
