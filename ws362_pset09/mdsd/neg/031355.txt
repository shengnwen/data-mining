After completing my first year of law school, I really wonder why so many professors use this textbook.  More than half the people I spoke with in my class thought the casebook's usability was poor or worse. 

Property is not a difficult class, aside from future estates and related issues (Rule Against Perpetuities).  The hardest thing about property is knowing the jurisdictional views on various aspects of property law, and this casebook does only an OK job highlighting that.  It is basically a lot of memorization and the learning of that material could have been substantially aided by organizing the book differently.

Additionally, many of its cases are not sufficiently edited, thereby necessitating that one read through too much irrelevant information to get to the legal issue.  My other case books are much more balanced on this issue.  

As a last note, the production quality is lower than what I would expect for its price.  The paper chosen and the fair reproduction of what photos exist in the book contrast strongly with its price.  

I suppose this sounds like a laundry list of complaints, but the book compares poorly to my other casebooks, simply stated
