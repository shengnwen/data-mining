After reading this book and reading most of the posts, I can say that the ones who disagree with S. Hannity stole my thoughts. S. Hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else. He never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain. If you like controversy then buy Bill O'reilly and Michelle Malkin's books at least those two try their best to get their points across. Hannity's book is a waste of many even though it's only 5 dollars (you can buy two Mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price).
