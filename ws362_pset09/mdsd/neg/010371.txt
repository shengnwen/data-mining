I am fifty eight and have just started to play piano via the
chord method and I have perhaps a dozen fake books.
The print in this fake book is entirely too small and difficult
to read, making it a chore to use it.  I should have
known better - it has 500 plus pages and oftentimes two songs
per page.

For those of you who have difficulty reading small print - I
wear reading glasses - stick with the Hal Leonard fake books which have approximately 200 pages and 100 songs.  My favorites are:  Easy Fake Book, Broadway Fake Book, First Fake Book, Simplified Fake Book, Easy 60s Fake Book, Classical Fake Book (new edition).  They are easy to read and enjoyable.  An improvement I would suggest would be a spiral binding.

The bigger the book, the more songs, the smaller the print.

I understand that this book is for all audiences, but I suggest that about 70% of the songs were minor hits.
