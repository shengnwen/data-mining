So many people have written glowing things about this book, but I don't know why.  I think that I am becoming too practical and logical as I mature, so have less ability to appreciate pointlessness.  I think that the writing was well-done, but the novel itself failed to express or achieve anything of value. 

Either a lack of literary sophistication or possessing an understanding of life far deeper and more profound than this novel attempts to portray prevents me from appreciating this novel.  I didn't see why I should ever want to read it again, or have read it at all.  It is kind of like someone tried to artfully arrange dead flowers, so they looked all pretty and still alive, but still, the flowers are dead and have nothing to offer.  

About the only thing I got out of it was that the author struggles with mental illness and thinks that being a transient is a glorious transcendent existence.  I assume that I am missing the boat on what this novel has to offer, but still thought it was rather a waste of my time.
