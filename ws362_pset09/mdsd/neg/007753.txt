The original Five Love Languages was insightful, had a variety of examples and provided a good amount of psychological and Christian theory and application.  This book is supposed to be for singles, but almost every example has to do with dating couples--people I don't really consider single.  Rarely does it talk about regular friendship--and when it does, it's guy-girl friendships.  I was hoping to get some insight into my same-sex friendships, family relationships and guy-girl non-romantic friendships, but this book falls horribly short of that.  Get the original copy and just use a little imagination and brain-power to apply it to your single life.  You'll save the time, money and frustration
