I was very dissappointed that the book itself was of very poor quality.  Maybe the recepies are good but the way they were presented in the book, they did not invite the reader to try them out. The photos were all about Patti Labelle and her friends, not about the recepies or cooking.  A cookbook should contain colorful inviting photos of the various dishes
