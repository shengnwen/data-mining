...but I've suggested to some people that a name for this author that might be more appropriate would be Boris Lessing, as in BOOOOR-ING. Admittedly, I've only made it through 30 pages of this book but the  experience has been akin to watching paint dry while enduring a root canal.  I'd like to think I've the patience and the refined sensibilities to  appreciate the meandering pace and voyages into the lost depths of opaque  stream-of-consciousness prose, but I suppose I have a low tolerance for  pain... or maybe I'm jaded, in this day and age, where psychology is  simultaneously applauded and disregarded, conspiracy theorists have  appropriated the whole 'extra-terrestrial encounter' thing and television  has whittled my attention span to near zero... either way, this book  doesn't contribute much to my appreciation for poetry or science-fiction -  or the theater for that matter, given that much of the dialogue is written  as if it's to be performed in a play. A case of a text attempting to  transcend too many boundaries? In any case, not a book I would recommend
