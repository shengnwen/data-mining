I was surprised at the extent of the author's blasphemy. He seems to think he can read the mind of God. He seems to claim that he knows what God wants, how God communicates and so on. If I didn't know better, it seems like he's claiming to be a prophet. I can think of better religious books.

I'll give him two stars because I assume (hope) he's good intentioned
