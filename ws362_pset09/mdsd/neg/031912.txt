The book's strong points are its detailed maps and illustrations,but it suffers from an unconvincing analysis of Alexander's motives,plans and their results.Dodge has a tendency to take many things at face value and is  a modern day victim of Alexander's own propaganda campaign.this is clearly  seen in Dodge's failure to implicate Alexander in the assassination of his  father Phillip despite overwhelming evidence,his lack of understanding of  Alexander's long political struggle against Parmenio's clan for dominance  over the army[motive enough for their eventual purge] and of Alexander's  shaky relations with the  subjugated Greek citystates.Even Dodge's analysis   of the key battles of Granicus and Chaeronaea and the siege of Thebes are  suspect.As for the most readable part of the book, the narrative of  Alexander's conquest,credit is better given to Arrian's primary text.For a  far more interesting and convincing look into a man as brilliant and  complex as Alexander I would reccomend Peter Green's 'Alexander of  Macedon', Fuller's 'Generalship of Alexander ' and Arrian's 'Campaigns of  Alexander'
