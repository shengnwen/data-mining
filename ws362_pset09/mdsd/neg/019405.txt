This book was suggested reading as if &quot; THE GREAT SECRET to PERSONAL FREEDOM&quot; was going to be revealed. It spoke of a self-centered mindset that seemed to suggest that I was to live my life how I wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me. A very simplistic and selfish point of view
