Far too many of the tofu recipes in this book consist of taking a block of tofu, slicing it, frying the slices and then covering them with sauce. (Tofu with Mole Sauce, I'm looking at you!)

Other recipes fail because they simply try to replace meat with tofu or tempeh, rather than trying to be completely new recipes in which the soy product can shine on its own, rather than as a substitute.

So far, there are only 2 recipes that I would recommend - the Spinach Burgers and the Brown Rice Pilaf. The rest? Meh. I'm still looking for a really good tofu cookbook
