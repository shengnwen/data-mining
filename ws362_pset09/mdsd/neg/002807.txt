I liked this book because it makes a good showing on my shelf. People at my house say &quot;Akmed, you are a coffee chemist?&quot; I say, &quot;yes, everything coffee does for me this book can undo. Ever drank too much  coffee and can't sleep? This book solves that problem! Sleep for days after  reading this book! I did. And you can too.&quot; One of my friends borrowed  the book just before she quit coffee and died of severe depression. I'm not  saying she read the book, but carrying it around seem to have the same  effect. I hope everyone with too much time and energy will read this book,  as they too will suffer a lingering malaise
