The author says Jewish feminists are anti-Semites, NPR is anti-Semitic,  BBC is anti-Semitic, Los Angeles Times is anti-Semitic, New York Times is  anti-Semitic, Washington Post is anti-Semitic. Everybody is anti-Semitic. The  term is devoid of any content. Anyone who ever criticizes Israel is  anti-Semitic. 


What does the evidence show? There has been good investigation done,  serious investigation. All the evidence shows there's no -- there's no evidence  at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America.  The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there's a new book put out by an Israel  stalwart. His name is Walter Laqueur, a very prominent scholar. It's called The  Changing Face of Anti-Semitism. It just came out, 2006, from Oxford University  Press. He looks at the evidence, and he says no. There's some in Europe among  the Muslim community, there's some anti-Semitism, but the notion that in the  heart of European society or North American society there's anti-Semitism is  preposterous. And in fact -- or no, a significant rise in anti-Semitism is  preposterous.
