The original Mechanical Engineering Design book written by Joseph Shigley, and later, with Larry Mitchell, was an excellent undergraduate text; it was readable at the introductory level, and it contained enough information and methodology for use as a good reference book after graduation.  Unfortunately, this revised text, which was rewritten by Charles Mischke, is thoroughly unreadable, obfuscating, and is totally unsuitable as a text for undergraduate mechanical engineering students.  The book is full of nuances, subtleties and informative data that do make it useful as a reference book on the shelf of an experienced design engineer, but not as a text for students learning the subject.  For those who plan to teach a course for mechanical engineering majors on this topic, I recommend other texts such a Jack Collins' Mechanical Design of Machine Elements and Machines, Wiley, 2003
