The writer does not understand the plight of Christians in muslim countries or what in practice Dhimmitude involves today as opposed to centuries ago under the turks.  She depends on interpretations of texts rather than the life experiences of real people.  The experiences of each country under Islam has been very different.  Christianity was not destroyed in by Islamic rule in places like Greece or Bulgaria, even though they suffered terribly in all places.  Islam cannot destroy christians who stand true.

The purpose of this book and its author is to whip up anti-islamic feelings in the west to a point where a conflict of civiliations becomes a reality.  After all, for those who accept her (false) case, the only viable alternative to "save" the west is going to be to eliminate freedom of religion for Muslims.  And what an anti-islamic crusade will mean for eastern christians is their total destruction.

Christians in the middle east learned in Iraq that they have no friends in America.  The only thing the americans brought were missionaries to convert Christians to american churches.  Churches where Christ is ignored, there are no crosses and where their god seems to be the Israeli government.

If you want to read true stories of eastern christianity in english, I would recommend William Dalrymple's From the Holy Mountain.
