This is the worst cookbook I have ever used, and I have a lot of cookbooks. While the photos depict mouthwatering dishes, every recipe I have tried has one, if not multiple, faults. These were clearly never tested. Amounts, temperatures, times, pretty much anything and everything is wrong. As an example, a recipe that claims to make 12 cupcakes produces enough batter for 24, and enough frosting for 48! A recipe for roasted veggies calls for a baking temperature of 325 -- maybe after six hours that would roast a root vegetable, but I'm not so sure. At best, this can give inspirational ideas for those with enough skill to make it on their own. At worst, it's a series of failed recipes and wasted ingredients. With so many other great vegan cookbooks out there, I have decided, after giving this book plenty of chances, that this is not worth the space on my shelf
