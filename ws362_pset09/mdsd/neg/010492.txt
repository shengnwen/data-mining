The first chapters are quite good, but then the content really goes off into the blue. There are a few interesting things in all chapters, but overall I would not recommend anyone to buy this book. It's not that I'm a 100% computer nerd who don't like non-technical books, but most of this book is a lot of talk that doesn't connect very well with real down-on-earth things. The only people I can imagine who would like this book are complete newbies to information security who are coming from the academic world and never have been exposed to the field in practice. There's nothing wrong with theory, but it has to connect to the real world in a way that you really can use it
