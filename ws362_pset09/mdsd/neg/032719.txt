The combination of sex and violence presented here isn't anything new, and it fails to shock or disturb, clearly its intention. This is basically supermarket horror, made to be picked up off the rack on impulse. Just like an impromptu Twinkie purchase, this is easy to devour, but hardly satisfying, and certainly not good for you.

In the edition I have, as well, the text sports one glaring error per chapter, something that certainly draws you out of the already wafer-thin plot. The responsibility for this sloppiness falls on the editor, to be sure, but it doesn't help matters any.

If you're dying for a quick gore fix... still pass on this one
