"The Princess and the Pea" by Janet Stevens is the retelling of the famous Hans Christian Andersen tale. This time, we get beautiful pictures, reminiscent of Maurice Sendak, and a bland story.

The typeface is an uninspired black Times New Roman, placed unimaginatively at the bottom of each page.

The Plot:
A prince wanted to test his beloved to see if she were a real princess. His mother demanded that the prince be sure. Each time the prince met someone he fell in love, she failed the test. One could not play soft music, another ate like a pig, and still another could not dance.

When a rainstorm brought in a young tiger who claimed to be a princess, the queen decided to lay out 20 mattresses with a pea beneath them all. Would the young tiger sense the pea and prove she was a real princess?

The story is all there. The problem is that there is nothing exciting in the language. There is no alliteration or assonance, and no word play. The writer goes through the motion of storytelling without ever bringing the story from her heart into the child's.

Better retellings are out there, and the illustrations, as good as they are, are not so much as to make the book a worthy purchase.
