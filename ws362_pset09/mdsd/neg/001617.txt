I was looking to get up to speed to teach an intro bio class for community college.  After reviewing bio texts, I bought this book thinking that it would be a great summary, review and offer quiz questions for bio.  I wanted it to be to the point, revelant,  and a pithy supplement.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  This book didn't highlight or sum up bio.  It went into in-depth discussions that might be of interest to grad students. I looked at Biology the Easy Way and liked it much better.
