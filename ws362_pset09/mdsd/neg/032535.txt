If this book were edited to cover the material that the title promises, it would be twenty pages long, five pages if condensed into a tight read.  This book is about Mrs. Holzer, with a few references about Rand.  I could care less if she got to hug a movie star, where she lives, etc.  Her "Imagined conversation with Ayn Rand,"  is outragious.  I assume that this was thrown in the book to bring up the page count.  In fact, I think a lot was thrown in to get the page count up to "book length.
