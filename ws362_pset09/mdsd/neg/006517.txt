This was hardly a diet book, rather it is an infomercial posing as literature.  Every other sentence seems to be about the virtues not of the diet but of a specific product.  Macademia Nut Oil, and not just any generic macadamia nut oil but instead only one specific brand.  Not too surprisingly other reviewers have indicated that the good doctor apparently is the owner of the company.  I can't believe the positive reviews here, they had to be posted by someone in the author's employment.  This book was such an insult to anyone with intelligence.  Another reviewer refered to the author as a SNAKE OIL salesman and I highly agree.  Please save your time and money and don't buy this book
