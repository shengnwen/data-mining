Ok, let me say one thing first: I have yet to finish the novel.  I don't know that I will.  So can I really write a fair, balanced review? No.  But I couldn't keep reading without saying a few things about the book.  First off, someone should have edited this book.  I've yet to encounter the typos mentioned in other reviews, but the author tends to drone on and on about things I couldn't care less about.  Second, where in the world are these people from?  The actions of the two main characters are so superficial and staged that it made me lose interest almost immediately.  Scott even thinks to himself several times that he doesn't like Ryan, but continues to hang out with him because he's so cute.  Next thing you know, he's playing his flute for him in a completely ridiculous scene that had me groaning out loud.  And the camping trip....I mean, come on.  Let us in on a real story, with believable actions, not where the two characters seem to be merely drifting through a string of set pieces that don't make sense.  Third...ah heck, I'm not even going to get started on the corny dialogue.  Let's just say I hate that I spent money on something and I can't bring myself to get through it.  But sheesh.  I compare this to Common Sons a little, where the characters sometimes behaved and said things that didn't seem real.  The only difference is, with Common Sons, the two main characters were at least interesting enough to care about.  They held that novel together even during its hard to swallow parts.  This one simply falls apart page after page.
