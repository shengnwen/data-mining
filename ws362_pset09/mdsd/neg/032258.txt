I have become greatly dissapointed McDonell's work in recent years. In the first couple of collections, Mutts was right on target, witty and fresh, but now it seems that Mutts has become preachy, and cloyingly sweet. Most of us already have helpless guilt from reading newspaper articles on vanishing tigers, do we really need it in a comic strip? Even the artwork seems lacking, as if McDonell was late for a deadline and did a rush job. The Mutts creator definitely needs new ideas
