If you buy this book expecting to find details of Steve Michalik's legendary Intensity,Insanity training....then keep your money in your pocket, you wont find what your looking for in this book.
Instead we have a selection of circuit traning routines.
The Intensity,Insanity section is restricted to a few pages of repetition schemes, which to be honest you could find anywhere on the internet, no depth,no detail? 
For the novice weight trainer this book is over complicated, the experienced trainer will be left frustrated by the lack of real training information and the "padding out" of chapters with disjointed information, seemingly from a variety of different sources.
The book is very dissapointing, especially when you consider the status that Michalik has, in this respect I felt misled to read the 5 star review - only to find this person was a technical assistant on the book.
I am sure actually training with Steve Michalik is a different ball game altogether, few will get the chance to do that, therefore; people will buy this book in the expectation of finding something which is really exceptional, in my opinion it isnt.
