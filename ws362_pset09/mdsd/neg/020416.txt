Sixty-four out of the 66 reviews currently up talk about THE BOOK. The product listed is THE AUDIO CD of the book. I ordered the CD set for Christmas, and it was good - up until the final, 6th CD. There, one section repeats over and over, over all 18 tracks. It's the part of Chapter 26 where Thor and Kate meet Tsuliwaensis. Each track is not identical, but the part of the book that is read, is. Needless to say, you never get to the thrilling conclusion of the book.

Amazon quickly replaced the CD set (thank you!), but the replacement set has THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM. (I apologize for appearing to shout here.) Has anyone reviewing this product actually listened to the CD from beginning to end? Are they all this way, or have I gotten two clinkers in a row?

Thank you
