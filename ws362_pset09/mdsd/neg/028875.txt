One part uncontroversial cognitive psychology and five parts lit-crit bluff--the kind the author clearly doesn't understand, and hopes no one else in the seminar will admit they don't either.  To be fair, the almost random juxtaposition of bits of continental philosofeces is consistent with the author's apparent contempt for reason.  

If this book was intended to be a hoax, or a test of editorial standards similar to Alan Sokal's bogus article in "Social Text", then I apologize for the low rating, but it really is about time to reveal the joke.
