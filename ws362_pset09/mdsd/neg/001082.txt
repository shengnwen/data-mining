This book is laden with stuff useful for anyone dealing with networks on a support level.  However using this book as a primary source is a bad bad idea.  The spelling, grammar, and factual errors left me with a &quot;duh&quot; a few times.  The chapters are out of sequence as far as any type of learning curve (more often than not other chapters are referenced to explain something that's being explained in the beginning chapters).  It's very long winded too.  I doubt anyone who has read this from cover to cover once can remember nitty gritty details when they hit the last page.  The software test really bites too.  The questions are WAY easier than what the real test covers.  I'm sorry to say this book is out of the return policy timeframe for me.  Get the ExamCram book instead
