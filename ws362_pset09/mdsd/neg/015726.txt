There's certanly been enough written about this story, so I'll keep this review brief. All one really needs to know is that Frank Miller's characterization of Batman does a disservice to fans of the admirable hero with cunning detective skills. That is the Batman that most comic fans know and love. Not the cheesy, 1960's television version, nor the completely unrecognizable brute portrayed here. To boot, the author obviously doesn't understand Superman's appeal either.

Casting those major complaints aside, though, there is some good stuff in DKR..., just not nearly enough to warrant it the spectacular praise it so often recieves. If you really want to pick up an essential Batman book by Frank Miller, Year One is the way to go. The simplicity of that story kept Miller from imposing his warped view of Batman on the reader.

Dark Knight Returns is the total opposite of Year One. It's too complex for its own good, dark to the point of being more depressing than it is thought-provoking, and just downright mean-spirited at times. Rent this from your library if your're a Batman fan who wants to see what all the fuss is about. If you're like me, you'd regret adding this to your personal collection before reading it. Unless, of course, you just like being bummed out by by superhero comics.
