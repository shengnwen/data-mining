A Dull, Predictable Holmes Pastiche

I found Mr. Day's Sherlock Holmes and the Alice in Wonderland Murders to be a dull, predictable pastiche.  I've read scores better, and this one could have been left for a simple rereading of one of Doyle's superior tales.  Here, Moriarty is back, yet again, not really dead at Reichbach Falls.  His return seems to have turned him into the Joker of Batman fame because he keeps on sending ridiculous clues to Holmes very loosely based upon Lewis Carroll's famous Alice stories, which leads Holmes and Watson into a silly series of comic book episodes.  Actually, the entire story would have fared much better AS a Batman and Robin tale.  Day's handling of Holmes and Watson works somewhat but only because he annoyingly refers again and again to Doyle's famous descriptions.  Save your money on this one unless you are a collector and have to have every pastiche.  I'm just glad the covers are finally closed.  Sorry, Mr. Day.  This is just one man's opinion, but I can only give your book 2 stars.
