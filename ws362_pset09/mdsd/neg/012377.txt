I bought a dog-eared copy of this collection (&quot;Trouble is My Business&quot;) at a book sale for $1.50 a year ago.  The copy I have is thick with 12 stories.  I bought this copy of &quot;Trouble is my Business&quot; to have a better copy, but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four Marlowe stories.  My question is, what the hell happened to the first 8 and why is Amazon.com still describing this as a collection of 12 when there are merely four?  That's not jake, fellas
