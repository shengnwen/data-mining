I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust
