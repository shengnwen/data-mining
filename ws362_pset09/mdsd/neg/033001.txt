This is an unfortunately poor attempt to transcribe the music of "Kind of Blue", the world's favourite jazz album. Full of incredibly careless and basic errors, this edition of transcriptions really marrs the celestial and transcendent glory of the recordings. 

Many of the melodic transcriptions of the horn solos are passable (although based much around what is likely to have been played rather than what was) but the piano transcriptions are pretty useless. On the whole, the score is pretty minimal on the page: the piano and bass parts are often omitted, even at the head of a piece: this is extremely counter-productive to the purpose of the book - to provide the music in a form as "study scores for small group jazz" (thus the horns are all notated as transposing instruments to this purpose), even if such performances would produce as erroneous a rendition that these scores would inevitably instigate. 

Despite all of this, a substantial introduction by Bill Kirchner, the author of "A Miles Davis Reader", is the redemption to this ill-fated endeavour: a thouroughly interesting and illuminating insight is given here to the album that this edition fails to capture on paper. Even down to a contribution to the debate on the authorship of "Blue in Green" does this discourse fathom. 

However, this has failed to distract me from the fact that good, solid transcriptions are not difficult to make these days, and that a lot more care could have been injected into the production of this book. Do not buy this if you can help it - make your own transcriptions if you really want them. 

But, with all this said, can one really put such a beautiful masterpiece into notated form? Can one effectively render poetry into prose? Can one map out the heavens?
