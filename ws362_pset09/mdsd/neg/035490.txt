This review is actually an homage to the 2004 review of S.C. Mitchell, who said everything that I was thinking.  I laughed, I cried, I wished I'd written that review myself.  I enjoyed her review way more than I enjoyed the book.  I was given the Sleeping Beauty series by a friend who knew I was reading the Vampire Chronicles.  I gave my friend back the books and told him to get his money back.  He did.

I cannot - repeat, cannot - improve on the Mitchel review, so I'll just say:  Yeah, what she said
