I bought the "Mayo Clinic Healthy Weight for Everybody" book because I didn't want a "fad" diet, I wanted a healthy eating plan.  I fell in love with that book so I bought "the New Mayo Clinic Cookbook" to have additional recipes.  I haave to admit that I have not cooked one single recipe from it.  I've looked through it several times and haven't found anything that even looks appealing.  I DO like that the recipes have the pyramid on each page so you can stay on track with the healthy eating plan without any extra work.  What I don't like is that there isn't anything I want to try
