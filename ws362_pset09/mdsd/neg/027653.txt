This book is a disgrace. Despite its academic paraphernalia (extensive bibliography, endnotes, etc.) the one chapter I read first contained 27 errors ranging from misspellings of characters' names to misquotation from texts. The style is embarrassing, littered with cliches, ridiculous and inflated diction and garbled grammar, which renders the book almost unreadable and totally meaningless. This book has nothing whatever of interest to say about John le Carre, beyond offering a bibliography of sensible proper books about the author. I wrote a letter of complaint to the author and to the publisher. The publisher replied with profuse apologies and refunded my money.  The author has not yet replied to me. I strongly recommend you not to buy this book, and if you have already done so, write and claim a refund
