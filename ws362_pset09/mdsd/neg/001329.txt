Full of gimmicks and silliness. If you are into "gimmick therapy", you might like to call your eating disorder "Ed" and talk to "him" in an empty chair. Not helpful at all, although Ms. Schaefer seems sincere enough. Glad I checked it out of the library instead of buying it. I prefer to be talked to like an adult
