First of all, I wonder how this woman received the title of doctor because it's obvious she didn't do her homework!  When she advocates the use of corporal punishment by saying "Children without discipline often become adults with tempertantrums, defiance, rage, depression, anxiety, poor school and work adjustment, drug and alcohol abuse." she is implying that this will happen to children who are not hit (or spanked whatever you would like to call this form of child abuse) by their parents.  Had she done any research or even looked at the research of others she would have found that the majority of children that were spanked by their parents are the ones that end up like this!  So it is very clear that she needs to take a good long look at her own values on parenting before she begins criticizing other parents for refusing to deliberately cause pain to their own offspring!
