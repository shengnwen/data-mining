As a graduate professor who teaches several course on M&amp;A, I've chosen two other efforts from publisher John Wiley for this year's curriculum over Pat Gaughan's updated version of his old book. Jeffrey Hooke's &quot;Practical Guide to Doing the Deal&quot; covers most of the same material in a more interesting style and &quot;Winning at Mergers &amp; Acquisitions&quot; shows my students how all of this applies to the real world. Mark Clemente &amp; David Greenspan, authors of &quot;Winning at M&amp;A&quot;, helped my students to understand the business rationale behind deals and brought to light many of the reasons so many corporate combinations fail. In addition, the juicy chapters on strategy, due diligence and culture and a whole section on integration best practices -- I feel -- will prepare serious readers on the topic and students of business alike for the M&amp;A challenges that actually exist in corporate America today. Case studies and testaments on what works and what doesn't from corporate VPs and CEOs involved in mergers and acquisitions make &quot;Winning at M&amp;A&quot; the core content I've already added to next year's syllabus. As for John Wiley's reprinting of Gaughan's book, they probably should have asked Hooke and Gaughan to collaborate on an updated version rather than publish two versions of the same manuscript
