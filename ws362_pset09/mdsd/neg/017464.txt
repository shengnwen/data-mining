You notice how this book does not have the "look inside the book" like most books on Amazon.com? Yet it's been out for years? This is intentional folks! If you look inside this book you will not want to buy it. 

I was SO disapointed when I got this book. I loved the title, cover picture and it sounded like a great idea. Yet when I got it and opened it up it was the most boring and worst kids book I think I have ever come across. And most of the stuff in there is more related to the environment, not to vegetarianism. 

I'm still smarting over losing my money on this one
