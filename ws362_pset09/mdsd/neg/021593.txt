As a 23-year Marine pilot myself, I thought Weber's work would be of special interest to me, but it was a big waste of time, forcing me to scan the last few chapters just to get it over with.  His special anti-terrorist team spend more time worrying about themselves while they break up their equipment, all the while coming up with "cutsie" conversation--and they don't accomplish a thing--but Uncle Sam pays them handsomely.

Even his side stories (which rarely affect the story line)about how terrible and scary it is to fly military aircraft are filled with supercilious thoughts by the pilots who are about to die.  In Chapter 27 (of 34), he brings in a totally new character who smashes up his plane on a carrier landing.  He lives, but is never mentioned in the book again, nor is the incident connected to the story.

Weber does, however, emulate W.E.B. Griffin in one respect--all his characters are either independently wealthy or have super-wealthy donors, so they need not worry about any expense whatever.  And they are all officers.  No mention of the grunts who make everything possible

Weber is touted as a "Marine Pilot", but no mention of what he flew, or where---????
