When i bought this book it had a lot of good reviews but it was nothing like what i expected.  The main charaters at first are good but they develop into wining and annoying people always complaining.  the book has absolutley no action done by the main charaters, no sword fights or any action at all, all the main charaters do is run away and complain about having to run. I give this book 1 star because the plot had could have become a good book but the charaters are nothing like what you would expect after reading Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks, Le Guin, Rowling, R.R. Martin, Nix, Herbert, Tolkein, and all the other fantasy authors i've read.  I hate to tell authors that their book was bad because i know they worked on them extremely hard but i will never read anything else written by this author Ian Irvine.-read something else
