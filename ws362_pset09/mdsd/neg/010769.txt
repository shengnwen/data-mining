Paul Russell can be a brilliant writer -- see A Coming Storm -- but you would hardly know that from this book. There is way too much pop-psychology "insight" into the characters, coming both from the narrator and from the characters themselves, who seem to be constantly musing about themselves and the other characters.

There is an underlying current here, that Paul Russell obviously feels will hold the reader's interest, and that is the infatuating allure of youth, personified here by the character Leigh. But, really, in this book and maybe in life, that just isn't enough to hold your interest for a long period.

This is just a slow motion melo-drama with lots of emotional molehills fashioned into tedious mountains. The interwoven relationships and obsessions and sore points are all just too much, hardly credible, and rarely interesting. Also, some of the main elements of the book, such as the flamboyant hairdresser, or the mercurial immature teenager, are just clunking cliches.
