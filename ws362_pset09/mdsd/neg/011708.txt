Kenneth Alfred Ham knows everything about dinosaurs.  Absolutely amazing things about dinosaurs.  Things that no other living man or woman knows.  And he wants to share all of it with you.  His very special gift to children everywhere is the book "D is for Dinosaur."

Here are some other letters you need to keep in mind before purchasing this flight of fancy or reading it to your children:

A is for Absurdities more than a few.  B is for Beliefs that are cruelly abused.  C is for Charlatans that prey on the young.  D is for Delusions from which you should run.  E is for Evidence which must be supplied.  F is for facts quickly denied.  G is for Glaring mistakes and omissions.  H is for simply Hysterical opinions.  I is for Intellect left behind.  J is for Juvenile when in a factual bind.  K is for Knowledge never used.  L is for Legitimacy so sadly abused.  M is for Manic hand waving and tantrums.  N is for Never happened as stated here.  P is for Pandering to prejudice and fear.  Q is for Queries the author doesn't want to hear.  R is for Reality left unrepresented.  S is for Science silenced and undefended.  T is for Truth for which you must look elsewhere.  U is for Unsupported assertions everywhere.  V is for Veracity sadly lacking.  W is for Whopper with smirking satisfaction.  X is for Xanex or whatever the author was on.  Y is for Young Earth Creationism a notorious yarn.  Finally Z is for Zilch, the value of this book.  Don't waste your time, don't give it a look.

 "D is for Dinosaur" is little more than creationist propaganda and histrionics aimed at children.  The cynicism of this ploy is standard operating procedure for Ken Ham author.  All of his published works singularly fail to distinguish fact from fancy.

Do your children a favor - instead of serving up some half-baked Ham how about the Dr. Suess classic "Green Eggs and Ham."  They will be forever grateful.
