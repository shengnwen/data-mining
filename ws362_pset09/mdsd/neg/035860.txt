Well, straight out I will admit that I am only half-way through this book, but already, I feel really bogged down, and slightly confused.  

Ms. Myss seems to take a rather overly authoritative tone in this book, as she mixes Jungian psychology, Eastern religions and divination, all in an attempt to convince her readers that through her guidance they can come to know the destinies chosen for them before their birth, their "Sacred Contracts".

I suggest taking the book out from the library before you purchase it.  Some may like the authoritative tone, and complex theories of the book.  I did not
