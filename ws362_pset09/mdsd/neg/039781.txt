The book is 10% about Jefferson and 90% about the author's far-left political agenda.  I also lost trust in him after reading his criticism of American voters' low turn outs in comparison to Austalia, while failing to mention that in Australia, voting is compulsory.  It makes me wonder how many other self-serving "facts" he used.(?
