Lots of great information about things to see and do in Los Angeles, but presented by someone who cannot keep their distain for conservatives and/or corporations to herself. For example, in her description of the Ronald Reagan Presential Library, she refers to Reagan as "the Forrest Gump of modern American politics". Very nice, eh? Then when writing about Disneyland she states "In Disneyland, democracy equals capitalism. And capitalism automatically creates social justice. In other words, Disneyland isn't real, though suburban American desperately wants to believe it is." HUH? I guess outside of Disneyland, socialism equals social justice; just look at the workers paradise Gray Davis turned California into. And Disneyland isn't real? Seemed solid enough to me the last time I was there. Once you get past these editorial comments, the useful information is quite good. But if I wanted to read left-leaning social commentary, I would have headed for the that section of the library
