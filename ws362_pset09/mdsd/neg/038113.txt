 Bought this book thinking that it might be the key to opening my brain to math. I'm bad at math. So I've been reading every subject surrounding it hoping to grasp an understanding of what it is and maybe have that "eureka" moment. But it didn't happen. 
So maybe I'm judging this book harshly just because it failed to intrigue me enough to understand math. 
Have you ever noticed how people who can add and subtract in their heads tend to laugh at us people who can't? And then they tsk-tsk us when we can't even get it right on paper. Yet, along with me, they can make gross mistakes in English and those who know better say nothing at all, lest they hurt their feelings....
