This book started out well, but it wore itself out due to monotony.   Examples were given over and over and over again about how the main character writes letters to get free stuff and bring about change.    I had to stop reading because I said to myself, "I get it! You write letters to get what you want, now get on with the story."

Bentley Little's books are all very similar.  He takes an ordinary entity (writing letters, convenient store chains, mailmen, college, homeowners association, resorts, insurance policies) and he turns it into an absurd oppressive force that involves violence and sex.  I don't understand why he is so famous or so widely read
