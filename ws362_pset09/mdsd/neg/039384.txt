Boy, yet another collection of incoherent musings by Feynman.  Instead of being impressed, I am quite disgusted at this bundle of babble being sold as some profound truths uttered by a deep thinker.   If there is one thing that's been elucidated by Feynman's nontechnical writings, it is the fact that outside of physics Feynman was a totally pedestrian individual.  His thoughts on social and religious issues are no deeper than those of an average college kid. Yet with his "genius" label successfully marketed, in no small part by himself, he could ramble aimlessly about anything and the Feynman groupies would take it as gospel.  Even on some technical issues, such as quantum computing and nano technology, his thoughts were really quite superficial, or sketchy, at best.  Nonetheless, they have been billed as ideas of a "visionary."  For those of you who aren't paying attention to the cult behavior among physicists, a side-benefit of being a visionary is that you don't actually have to think hard about the question of feasibility -- it's mundane task for the lesser men.

All in all, another ripoff from the Feynman cult industry
