I read the book all the way through, which I suppose is saying something.  But from somewhere around page 30 through about page 230 all Rubin does is WHINE.  On and on and on.  Some of it is enlightening, and it did explain her process (which can at times be interesting), but for the most part it struck me as neurotic and extremely redundant. She also doesn't take much responsibility for her own physicality.  Connections are important (i.e. mother, father and sister), and I know some things can be ingrained, but at some point we have to be accountable for our own lives.  

This book could have been about a hundred pages shorter. 

Sorry.
