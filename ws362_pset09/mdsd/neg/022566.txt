This is just another historically inaccurate account of numbers.  Greeks used Greek numbers such as alpha, beta gamma etc.  The modern numbers known as Hindu Arabic numbers and arithmetic comes to us from India via Arabs.  Medievel Europe called them "Nine figures of the Indians" and Arabs called it "Hindasa" or "Ilm Hind" meaning science of the Hindus.

Nothing is mentioned of men who built our number system. Aryabhata (Indian/Sri Lankan), Brahmagupta, Bhaskara etc
