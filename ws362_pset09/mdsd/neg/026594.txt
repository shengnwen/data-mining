I'm sorry I ever started reading this book.  The writing is so good that I couldn't stop -- but man . . .

Somewhat like the fictional author's fictional readers, my nose started to bleed and most of my goldfish died.  You need to be really hard up for a book to read to knowingly choose this one.

After much cursing and gnashing of teeth, I finally finished it.
