No wonder there is so little said about this award-winning Faulkner work. It is a chore to read. Only in a few passages does the reader have the sense that the writer can tell a good story. Worse than that, the  characters are like Rorschak blots with the Christian mythology mixed in.  Stick with Faulkner's southern writings for characters who remain in your  memory and images that are profound
