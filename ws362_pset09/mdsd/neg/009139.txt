It seems all they do in this book is cook and eat! This is the second only book I've read by this authour.   I could care less about the receipes, I'm not going to try any of them.  And those women that had nothing better to do with their time and husband's money than shop, shop, shop for so much stuff they had to rent additional storage places.   I did enjoy the description of the scenery in the Aspen area, but that was about the only redeeming aspect of this story.  Talk about spoiled kids and pampered wives, I'm glad I don't know any of them.  I'll move on to others than can really keep me interested in their mysteries
