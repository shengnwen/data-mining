Because of the award nomination and short-story format, I bought this book.  I found it boring, honestly.  I thought this might be the case because I'm a man and this is about women (though that's not stopped me enjoying books by Amy Tan, Joyce Carol Oates, Jhumpa Lahiri, or Sandra Cisneros but I was thinking there I must be reading something wrong).  However, I felt vaildated when my mother - an avid reader - read it and complained about the pace and characters as well.  Fortunately, it's a short read so it wasn't a long waste of time
