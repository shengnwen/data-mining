After reading Ms. London's BEAUTY QUEEN, I was anxious to read MISS FORTUNE.  However, the book just never caught on with me and the heroine is definitely someone I wouldn't want to know or be.  I have a problem with romance novel heroines who are in their 30's and still living off their parents yet get angry when their life goals, etc. are questioned.  After a while I gave up on Rachel and wondered what anyone would see in her.  She really had no redeeming values.  I did like the book's hero more and loved how Ms. London used a lot of British slang with this character.  I found him charming, but once again, couldn't see what he saw in his lady love
