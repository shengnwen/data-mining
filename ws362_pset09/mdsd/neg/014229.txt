I don't even know what to say about this book other than anyone who pretends to like this nonsense deserves to read it. Truman Capote's quote about Kerouac's writing, "That it's not writing, it's typing," probably sums up the matter better than anything I can say.  What disappoints me I suppose is that I really want to like Kerouac - I love the idea of him, though I can't say I care much for his typing.
