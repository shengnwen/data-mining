"Pity the Nation" is more a diary of Fisk's travels and experiences in Lebanon than a history of the Lebanese Civil War.  Fisk vividly describes events he sees, but what occurs beyond his literal field of vision is undocumented. As an example, Fisk spends four chapters discussing the 1982 Sabra and Chatila massacre, but only two pages on the 1985-1988 War of the Camps (where Amal killed more Palestinians than Elie Hobeika).  

Fisk brings to life a few of his reporter friends, but the main political actors of the war are only described from a distance
