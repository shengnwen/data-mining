If there were, Fogel would have a chance to add a second Prize to his earlier one for Economics.  Consider this book purporting to describe the wellsprings of social improvement in America, to the present -- and  focusing on its popular, rhetorical wellsprings -- with one index entry for  &quot;Progressivism&quot; and none beginning &quot;Socialism,  &quot;Workers,&quot; or &quot;Communism.&quot; In fact, according to Fogel  social progress has come about due to technological change and church  preachers responding to it.  Mother Jones was just a mother (my  characterization, Fogel's vacuity).     That a Nobel Prize winner could  publish such tripe I think has dumbfounded almost everyone, so little  commented upon has this book been.  But if you put stock in others'  opinions and read history, take my word for it, this is an very poor  amateur history by a non-historian with a Nobel Prize. If you don't, and  have a brain in your head, buy it and weep
