After reading 100+ pages, my knowledge of MBA programs and MBA practices has not increased at all.  This is a random collection of essays with little practical use.  This is not a "How-To" book or a "Cookbook" by any means.  This book is very light on practical advice, and I doubt that it would help anyone learn about MBAs.  Although it was written by people who have MBAs, their writing has almost nothing to do with getting an MBA yourself.

I was pretty disappointed with the quality of writing.  There are better MBA books out there
