If you're looking for a dumb book to waste your time with, then this book is just the ticket. You'll notice that the author's friends in the "self-help/success" book industry all gave the book 5 stars, but people who actually bought the book say it sucks.

The self-help industry is, unfortunately, largely populated with individuals who are less than perfectly honest. They ALWAYS give each other' books super-great reviews, thereby scratching each other's backs so that they all can sell more books and make more money. 

When one reads these reviews with a critical eye, one notices that they often don't say anything very specific about the book itself, which is usually a strong indicator that the reviewer hasn't actually read the book. You'll notice that most of the information contained in these reviews can be gleaned from glancing at the books table of contents, and sometimes the review focuses on the author without really describing the book at all. These also are telltale signs that the reviewer hasn't read the book.

In closing, this guy has published a whole series of similar books which purport to tell everyone how to be successful in life and handle any situation. What makes this guy an authority on life? Try reading one of his books & you will find the answer to that question. He isn't an authority on anything. He's just a guy with a lot of time on his hands whose trying to make a living without having to actually work
