We used Lonely Planet guidebooks all over Europe while we were there with our kids for 7 months.  This book was the first time Lonely Planet let us down.

The book is organized badly and it was full of bad information.  Two of the restaurants that were recommended in the book (both of which sounded as if they had been there forever) were nowhere to be found.  In fact, one was a pile of rubble.  This was very frustrating when you're hungry and you're dragging four kids around the city looking for a place to eat
