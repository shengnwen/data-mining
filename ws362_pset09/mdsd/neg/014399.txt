This book was published by BookSurge, a self-publishing service owned by Amazon.  It contains a collection of the author's disjointed personal observations about various topics only tangentially related to emotion.  There is nothing scientific or insightful about this "book."  I encourage social and behavioral scientists, academics, professionals, and interested members of the public to look elsewhere for information about emotion.  I am terribly dismayed to see that Amazon would promote such a book
