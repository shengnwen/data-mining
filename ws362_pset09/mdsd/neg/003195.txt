We purchased the GoLive software because it promised to do "everything" we could possibly want for our business website  ... we purchased the GoLive book because we needed help figuring out how to make this non-user-friendly software fufill its promises.  The book only covers the simplest of web designs and does NOT go into detail regarding anything that we require. We were very disappointed.  I would only recommend this book or software to those who want a very simple, very generic website
