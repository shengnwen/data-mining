Lent to me 'cause I'm such a mystery fan.  But I couldn't get over the fact that Anne Perry is herself a convicted murderer and if I bought her books I'd be contributing to her profit off her murder.  

From Time: "When mystery writer Anne Perry was 15, she committed murder. She and her friend, Pauline, killed Pauline's mother. Perry served 5 1/2 years in an adult women's prison. After her release, she left New Zealand and has never returned. Now living in Scotland, Perry has fashioned a new life and a successful career. Although family and close friends knew about Perry's past, it was never known to the general public, including her agent and her U.S. publisher. The New Zealand film, Heavenly Creatures, deals with the 1954 case. A New Zealand reporter uncovered Perry's previous identity as Juliet Hulme. Perry insists she does not remember specifics of the actual crime."

Watch the documentary "Heavenly Creatures" for the facts.  It's just gross that she got off so light for murder and is now rich because she writes about how to committ murders.  She's not wise, she's opportunistic
