This book is obviously not for the average reader. I read it for a psychological anthropology book review and found myself regretting every moment of it. First of all, Linde tries to give to many examples and  restates the same thing over and over. When I finished chapter 8 and read  the conclusion which was four pages I was a little upset. The whole book  was a waste of time, by just reading the conclusion the few points that  were made are clearly stated there without the non-sense and all the  repetition. INSOMNIACS this is a must buy for you it put me to sleep about  7-8 times. Besides that avoid this book if at all possible. You can thank  me for the sacrafice I made for you
