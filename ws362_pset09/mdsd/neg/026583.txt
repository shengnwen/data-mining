I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on. 

Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books.
