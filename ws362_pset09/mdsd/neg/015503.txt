I have never read any of Hoffman's books and only bought this one because it was a "highly recommended" read at my local bookstore.  This book is awful to say the least and I don't understand how it can get such high praise.  The first thing that bothers me about it is Hoffman seems to be romanticizing being a homeless and aimless drifter.  The main characters Matt and Edmund are exactly that.  Matt "asks" houses and other places if she can stay in them, there is a word for that it is called squatting or trespassing and it is illegal.  She gets her food out of dumpsters. Matt apparently got her powers after too much drinking and drugs, interesting message there, be a homeless drug addict/alcoholic and get the power to talk to inanimate objects.  Hoffman refers to the garbage bag Matt has her property in as her luggage.  Give me a break.  The story itself doesn't flow well and goes off in weird directions.  Matt and Edmund visit his sister and find this wild magic lying around and his sister and her family just accept it and are all OK with it.  They finally meet up with Susan, totally blow apart her carefully constructed world and she blows off her job and her carefully put together life without a second thought and goes off with someone she doesn't know (Matt) and someone she hasn't seen in over 10 years (Edmund).  That makes absolutely no sense.  
I will not be reading anything else by Hoffman
