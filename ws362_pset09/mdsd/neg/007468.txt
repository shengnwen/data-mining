First, I will confess that this is the first time I have bought one of Dozois "best of" books new rather than used.  I have never considered his collections worth paying full price, but amongst the dross I have always found two or three real gems that was I glad to discover.  I have come to conclude these gems must have been included by complete accident.

When I saw "Best of the Best", I assumed that he had decided to put out a book spanning several years, using gems only, skipping the filler.  Well, I was wrong, and feel cheated out of the price of this book!  I slogged through page after page of stories ranging from mediocre to poor, with nary a gem in sight.

I understand that Dozios did not actually write these stories, and therefore did not create the turgid prose, sloppy plotting, hackneyed and pedestrian themes, and uninteresting characters that fill these stories.  He is, however, responsible for choosing them and holding them up to the public as the "best" examples of a genre that has so much more to offer than a reader unfamiliar with science fiction might conclude it does based upon this book
