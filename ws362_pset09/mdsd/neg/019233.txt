Danielle spins the usual McRomance. Fairly decent for her, but sometimes there are situations in her books that are simply 50 years out of date. Example is the lady in a former book whose husband REFUSED to let her attend law school. Hello? 2004 calling? I remember a story about a character giving birth who was forced to give birth with her legs strapped down. This written in like 1985 and they stopped doing that in like 1965. Well, the throwback in this book is the two selfish girls who were &quot;cruel&quot; to the stepmother. Hello? 2004 calling? Like 60% of their contemporaries don't have mixed families? Like mom DIED two years ago? Like y'all are adults? The twist that irritates so much that it throws you out of the web of belief needed to enjoy a romance novel
