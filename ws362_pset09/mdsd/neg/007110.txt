This book is merely one big (and shaky) conjecture, based on strenuous and improbable readings of ancient texts, and motivated by the current absurd drive to legalize same-sex "marriages". It is also a good example of the surrender of intellectual honesty to political correctness in the present-day academia. The popularity of such crude post-Freudian interpretations which imply the presence of physical sex in every union between two people is a sad reflection on our age of (deepening) ignorance. I give this publication one star because my preferred zero star rating is not an option.

PS. An excellent detailed critique of Boswell's product by Robin Darling Young can be found in the "First Things" magazine, issue 47, November 1994, pp. 43-48 ("Gay marriage: Reimagining Church History", available on the Internet.
