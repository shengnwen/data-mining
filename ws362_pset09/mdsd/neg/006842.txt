I have long admired Richard Dawkins, and have profered copies of the Blind Watchmaker folks with whom I have discussed/debated the evolution issue.

But,  you know what? This book has made me question my own doubt. Dawkin's maniacal stridency is so unhappy, so joyless, so void of humanity - I find myself faced with the ultimate choice: Do I CHOOSE to accept a totally random universe without meaning, or do I CHOOSE to question organized religion while ACCEPTING there is an unknowable mystery and magesty to life and universe.

I have chosen the latter. Richard Dawkins can sit alone in a corner wallowing in his own misery
