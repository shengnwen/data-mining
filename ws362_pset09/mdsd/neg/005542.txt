The book I received in July, 2006 was published in 2004 - NOT 2005, as indicated. It doesn't contain contain any information that you can't get from other guidebooks - and the information on specific sites is sketchy. Maybe it is useful if you plan on touring on a motorcycle, but otherwise, there are more current guidebooks covering the same places more effectively
