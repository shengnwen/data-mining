I found this book while casually browsing through a bookstore and bought it because I had seen great reviews of it online and I really loved the Disney version of this classic fairytale. 

However, halfway through the book I found myself uninterested with the cardboard-like characters who all seemed to have the same personality. This book also could have been much shorter - McKinley, I felt, went too overboard with the description. For example, she spent two long paragraphs describing dark woods EVERYTIME one of the characters went into it. It was very tedious to read this book and it neither tickled my imagination nor made me feel any inspiration or love of the book like so many other books made me feel. 

I actually find myself wishing I had spent my time reading another book rather than this one. I do not recommend purchasing or reading this book
