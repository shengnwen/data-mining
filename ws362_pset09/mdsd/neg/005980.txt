This book was first published in 1981, but later edited and republished with a new title in 1984.  The author was clearly influenced to change the direction of this book from the first printing because of his contact with YWAM, John Dawson, Richard Twiss, Daniel Kikawa and others who are hawking these same ideas.  Any good Christian anthropologist will tell you that history shows that, though most Gentile cultures had some sort of "supreme being" they worshipped, those "supreme beings" were one god among a pantheon of gods.  The Bible is clear that "from the creation of the world" all Gentile cultures had corrupted the knowledge of the true God.  Though the first printing of this book had some good ideas about cross-cultural methods to preach the Gospel to many cultures, the additions to this book prove clearly that it is unbiblical in its basic premise.  The new title "Eternity In Their Hearts: Startling Evidence of Belief in the One True God in Hundreds of Cultures Throughout the World" is an unbiblical statement.  Why do I say that?  Two verses end Richardson's unbiblical speculations:

Eph. 2:11-13  Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of  men)-remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now inChrist Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.
Rom. 10:14-15  How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!
