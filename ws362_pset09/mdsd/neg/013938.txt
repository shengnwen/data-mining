The only reason you would need cliff notes for this book is if you are lazy or short on time and theres a test the next day.  Yet the cliff notes arent descriptive enough for you to get the whole book.  I can understand needing cliff notes for the confusing dialect of &quot;tale of two cities&quot;, or the background and analysis for &quot;Brave new World&quot;, but going through the Catcher in the Rye is a breeze, and the book is enjoyable.  Its one of my favorite books ever.  Dont even bother with these cliff notes
