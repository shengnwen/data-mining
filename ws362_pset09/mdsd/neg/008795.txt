This book seems to be more of an autobiography than a novel, whereas the author uses the fictitious name Rachel Baum. Which would be ok, however the author seemed to feel the need to promote herself and how great her party life - including doing all sorts of drugs and sleeping around -  at South Beach used to be rather than give some interesting insides of the lifestyle there.

It was amazing how in every single chapter she found a way to mention the great cloths collection of Rachel, the great parties she goes to and the drugs she does.  While she has certainly had an interesting life, I felt that the main focus of the book was more on her own experiences than offering any kind of an interesting plot-line or just a good story. 

The whole book could be summed up in the writing of the About The Author section. Any diary of a high school or college girl is probably better than this book - save your money and run
