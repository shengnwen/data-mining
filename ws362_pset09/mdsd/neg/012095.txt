Okay Mr. &quot;I love Everyman&quot;, I also am an AP High school student and am portraying Everyman in our High School production of the Everyman and trust me, the story is reptitious, boring, anti-climatic and fails to  actually captivate an audience unless drastic revisions are incorporated.  The morals are good, but the lines are superficial
