What was Greg Gorman thinking when he decided to publish this book?  The photos are boring, the model is boring, the style is derivative.  The twinkboy model has two expressions - bored and extremely bored.  It's nice that the young lad was able to accompany Mr. Gorman to Paris and the south of France and other exciting locations, but the locations seem to have no effect on twinkboy.  Greg Knudson gets his fifteen minutes of fame in this book.  I have never encountered a model that produced such a negative effect on me.  If I could give this a rating of zero I would, but my choices are limited to one to five.  I sent my copy back the first day for a credit
