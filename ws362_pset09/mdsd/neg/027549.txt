The Jason Kelly &quot;Neatest Little Guide&quot; franchise of books is sometimes inspired, and sometimes he just &quot;phones it in&quot;.  This book is an example of Kelly &quot;phoning it in&quot;.  Even absolute internet beginners will be scratching their heads over why there's a chapter devoted to &quot;How to Buy a Computer&quot;.  Obviously someone interested in making a website already has a computer.  We're talking extreme basics here folks, and unless you've been dwelling in a cave for the last decade, you'll probably view most of this book as common sense.  Sporting a 15 dollar price tag just reinforces the fact that everyone should steer clear of this book and buy their favorite CD instead
