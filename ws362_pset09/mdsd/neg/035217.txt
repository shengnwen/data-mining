I bought this book solely to build the adirondack chair which I recently finished.  Lots of Cut List info makes buying the lumber easy. However, once into a project the pictures/illustrations and descriptions of precise placement of key parts leaves much to be desired. I have built several other chairs from different plans and based on this experience, I sadly cannot recommend this book
