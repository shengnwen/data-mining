I had to read this book for a course on Latin America. The author is clearly very biased, if you agree with him you will most likely enjoy the book. Chasteen often states his opinions as fact, stating several times that marxism would have been a better option for Latin American countries (how well did this work in the USSR?) Also, he skips over details that don't support his thesis; while he goes in great detail describing the killing and torture commited by government forces, he never acknowledges the torture and murders commited by guerrilla forces. 

The book does cover a great deal of history, but the excessive bias takes away from the credibility of the text and the learning experience. I would reccomend finding a book that focuses more on fact than opinion
