Am really disappointed in the book for a variety of reasons. One, 95% of the people listed aren't well known, or have such little to say that I got the feeling this was a slap together book that was produced simply to produce monies for his cardiac foundation. So disappointed I am sending it back to Amazon.com.

The few bits of wisdom one can glean from the people in the book, is work hard, don't give up, don't lie and be nice to people on the way up because you may need them on the way down.

Am sitting here trying to figure out who the target audience for this book is?  Sure cannot be the under fifty crowd since there are so few people aside from Bill Gates, Joe Perry of Aerosmith for boomers to read.  Where are the Tom Hanks, Steve Jobs, the young men who founded Yahoo and Google? Oprah, Jon Stewart, Ron Howard, Mel Gibson?  Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Steve Young?
Condi Rice, Tony Blair, etc?
