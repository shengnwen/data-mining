It is truly disturbing to see books like this apologia for human behavior enter the reproductive arena of argument and try  to come away with something positive to say about the population disaster awaiting us.  The sad fact is that humans are rapidly overwhelming the earth's resources to the point that their numbers cannot be sustained.  Culture of Death???  The only culture of death relevant to this nightmare is that such a point of view so incredibly ignorant is now being given the publishing light of day.  Just perfect to give everyone yet another excuse to do nothing constructive, only destructive.  Reproductive rights need to be limited, as do human numbers.  A life without hope is indeed a culture of death and it is moronic, dillitante views like those in this book that only serve to perpetuate it.  If these authors lived on Easter Island, it would have sunk into the ocean due to the overburdening weight of the existing, increasing human mass.   Welcome to the end.   Thank you, religious hacks,  blinded authors, and the morass of idiots who believe that the world just needs a better management model to make things work.  Please visit Mexico, India and Africa at your earliest opportunity to promote your thoughts, and, perhaps, get a glimpse of what awaits all of us if this scourge of increasing humanity is not remedied.
