this book is held in high honors by historians, but in contempt by archaeologists - and for good reason. if you want to understand a period of human history from which the literary evidence is virtually non-existent, you must incorporate other sources of evidence in your treaty. murray does not, and his vision of archaic greece is thus vastly different to the view of robin osbourne, whose "greece in the making" is a much better treatment of the archaic period than this. oswyn murray, although a vastly skilled historian and a wonderful scholar, just does not get it right.

if you have no idea of what is going on during the 7th and 6th centuries BC and have this book at hand, by all means read it - but please keep in mind that there are much better treatments of the period available
