You need a plan, and its going to take work. No Kidding? You need an image. REALLY? When you submit items, you may get turned down - NO?!?! This book is ok if it's your first on the subject, but if you have ANY kind of marketing knowledge, skip it. I came across one idea that I thought, HEY Never thought of that. I had to force myself to finish it. Not enough examples of a press release's or other items (but you have tp PLAN, AND SPELL CHECK - WOW!). He has a chapter on the internet, that again is for the beginner, and almost a beginners guide to html. How about where to promote on the Internet? One positive is the author availability. He publishes all sorts of ways to contact him. It was easily read (although I was frustrated by the end as it wasn't giving me what I wanted). He explains how you can take a press release, reword it, and re-release it. I got the feeling he did that with each chapter. (Sorry Jeff)
