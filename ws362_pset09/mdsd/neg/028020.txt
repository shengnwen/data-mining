This book relies heavily on squirting cats with water, which is not a positive reinforcement. Also, the steps do not address problem cats that don't want to cooperate. For instance, the section on nail-clipping tells you how to clip a cat's nails, but does not address how to get a cat to accept nail clipping without fussing
