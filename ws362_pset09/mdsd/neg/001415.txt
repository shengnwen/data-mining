While this book is a relatively interesting read, as a Greek woman I find it extremely insulting. This book takes every stereotype out there and looks for evidence that it is true. Robbins goes looking to find the information she needs to prove that Greek life is sordid and scandalous. This book also over generalizes implying that all sororities are like this one, not caring that this is the account of a very small selection of sororities and Greek women. As a member at a smaller school I can honestly say that most of the stuff that goes on in this book I have never even come close to seeing happen. Robbins goes into researching this with a very biased opinion and it shows throughout the novel. While some parts are true, they are not true to the extreme Robbins makes them. There is also very little focus on the good done by a sorority, philanthropy is a huge part of who we are, some schools may not take it as seriously as others, but there are many sororities who focus on doing good. The sisterhood also isn't shown in the best light in this book, I have met so many girls that I am so close to now, this book doesn't show the closeness between sisters a sorority can bring. This book starts off with a very offensive tone by the way Robbins describes the girls at the Greek Boutique, we were our letters with pride, we want others to know how proud we are of who we are. And Olive Green and Green are two extremely different colors, thus why the distinction is needed. To get a truly accurate account of a sorority life, it would take more than the word of four girls, at one or two schools. Interview hundreds of girls from all over the country at all sizes of schools and all sizes of chapters for an accurate account, this book is just another stereotype that we will have to fight.
