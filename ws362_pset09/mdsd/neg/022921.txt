I was excited to see that Steven King had a new novel out.  I began the book full of anticipation, eager to enter into King's world.  However, as I began to read I became more and more unable to sustain interest in Lisey's world.  I was bored, and I gave up.  Perhaps I will try again some time;  the book is still weighing down the shelf
