I was disappointed with this book. He has his picture on every other page, literally. The numbering of chapters is confusing. I truely have gotten much more out of "Strong Women Stay Slim" by Miriam Nelson, which I got from the library, and now have purchased. I would suggest taking a look at Jorge's somewhere before making your purchase~ (do as I say, not as I do LOL) "Strong Women" just seemed so much simpler, and the drawings of the exercises are pleasant and clear. Often times I don't want to do the exercises, then I think "well, I'll just do the first one" and before I know it I've done them all and am feeling better. In fact, I have now ordered Nelson's book on arthritis. Note: There are only 6 basic exercises plus stretching in Nelson's work, so it certainly doesn't take much longer than Jorge's "8 Minutes.
