Though I love Brother Cadfael, this story was most tedious and far-fetched.  I couldn't believe that this young woman would do what she did for a man she hardly knew, and the conclusion drags out too long and  elaborately, once you realize who she is.  I've read worse books, but after  the true excellence of most of the other Cadfael novels, this one was a  strange, sad let-down
