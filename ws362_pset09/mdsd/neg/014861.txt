Like another commenter said, there a lot of typos and bad formatting in this book that make the recipes unclear. Also, it seems like quite a few recipes were added just to fill up pages, like the pizza dough recipe for making enough dough for 30 pizzas (the author worked at a pizzeria). While I loved that there were Ethiopian recipes included, they really had nothing to do with the theme of the book and were just stuck in there to take up space.

Good recipes, but very disorganized
