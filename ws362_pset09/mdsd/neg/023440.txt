I read the book to find a new gems of wisdom from the prophet.  It became clear that the book is full of virtues that very few would quibble with.  However, you would think that a modern prophet would give at least one quote from the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, or Pearl of Great Price. But there is not a singe one.  Upon reading the book, everyone will see that we believe in the Bible, since it is quoted every few pages. The book stands for everything Christian that everyone will agree with, and stands for nothing that is uniquely Mormon.  No mention of the restoration of the gospel, Joseph Smith, eternal families, or any of our beliefs from the plan of salvation.  More and more, we seem to downplay who we are, a part of mainstreaming which all members should objectively admit is occurring.
