Great subject; poor execution. Starr is so determined to prove his point that people have the capacity to determine their historical decisions that he forces the facts of his arugment to fit his theory. There are some perfect moments of pure contradiction here. My favorite is the chapter on radio, where he concedes that maybe the technical limitations of media determines the process of their deployment in society, only to dismiss it with an offhand, "of course that can't be the case." The book is also hobbled by a limp wrist embrace of American exceptionalism, as though the geographic, social and class context of America weren't enough to account for difference between the deployment of technology in America and Europe. No, it HAS to be the genius of our political institutions. There are at least three great stories here: How the aesthetic conventions of media determine historical consicousness (a la McLuhan), the role of media in price revolutions, and how media is used as a tool in class and ethnic competition. But Starr misses all of them either because he has an agenda when he gets to the facts, or because doing political history is easy, and economic history hard. Either way, lame. For bourgeois historians only. If you're a media professional, pass
