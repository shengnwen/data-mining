First, I should preface this review by saying that I believe the edition I read was an earlier one, which may have not been thoroughly updated.  That said, what I did read was, well... not too revolutionary.  I have read a number of books in this vein and know what entails a good read.  For me, that has to be something which really challenges me and not so much gives me answers, but new questions and avenues to explore.  This book did not do this for me.  Basically, Shakti explains her background.  She is very self-congratulatory (I felt) as she explains that she lives her life by intuition, and has done all kinds of things people have felt were crazy, because she listened to her intuition.

I really feel that this book has one core truth to offer, and that is listen to your intuition, your immediate feelings, your first thoughts. Don't analyze.  Just be.

But you don't need to read this book in order to get that insight.  You just got it from reading my review of the book.

If you are interested in learning about the author herself, this book may be a good read as it explains quite a bit of her background and her spiritual growth.  But it's overall a very general book, which offers no real answers other than "follow your intuition." And I feel that a book which purports to discuss "planetary transformation" ought to offer something more than that one insight
