The premise is great - man on a mission to save his long-lost love on a dying world - but the plot went downhill from there, at least for me, and the ending was completely unsatisfying. There was no real resolution, and what does the hero have left at the end? I didn't like his love interest at all, and she seemed vapor-brained to me - putting herself into a culture where she was essentially a sex slave to both her mate and his bondsman. Ick. George R.R. Martin is a brilliant writer, but this left me cold
