What is Zionism and why must it be critiqued.  This book is addressing the latter, but we must address both.  Zionism is a nationaist idea coming from the late 19th century.  It is nationalist and religious and secular(one of many ironies) and embraces the Jewish people's quest for a nation.  We must view it as we view pan-Turkism.  pan-Tukism views the Turks as a people, but the Turks are also Muslim, thus it encompasses religion and nation. Jews are basically the same, a nation wrapped inside a religion, like all old tribal religions used to be and like Hindu Nationalism is today, and we might at Japan is.

Zionism was socialist.  It looked for a land, originally Uganda, and then Israel, which shoes just how unreligious it originally was, since it didnt see Israel as essential.

In Israel is did suprisingly well and like most national movements it envisioned a 'greater' version of the homeland, like 'greater' Greece or 'greater' Serbia, or Ukraine.

The critique is that it doenst have clean hands.  Most ideologies dont.  Ideology and its affects are not two in the same.  COmmunism isnt inherently evil, but it is responsible for evil.  

However the contemporary critique of zionism is decidedly a left wing communist view that nation doesnt matter.  But then COmmunism died and so did Zionism.  Zionism and its ideals died long ago.  So why is this book trying to put a new spin on it?  Most likely what we are seeing here is an appeasment of the international media, the neo-nazi and the islamist obsession with 'zionists'.  However zionists dont exist.  It is a red herring, like those who used to find communist conspiracies everywhere.

This book is outdated and lacks percpective.
