This book felt more like a gossip commentary on the woman who wrote this book and her local mom friends than something that others could learn from.  This book could have been a real help for me but it missed the mark.  The author of this book has infant twins AND and older daughter, as do I.  One of many challenges of the last year has been how to give the babies all that they need emotionally and physically while managing the development and emotional state of my older daughter.  Practical advice was missing -- things like how do you take them all shopping at the grocery store?  While the original message may have been lost in the editing, it seemed like her older daughter was ignored during the babies first year
