If I can prevent anyone from wasting time and money on this book, I will be pleased.  It is written on the level of a bad high school newspaper.  Moreover, although it is a coffee table book, clearly intended for English speaking readers who are not familiar with Indian cinema, it is not organized to translate the Indian film titles into English, and it rattles off those incomprehensible names without ever describing what the film is about.  IT IS NOT WRITTEN BY ISMAIL MERCHANT!  He wrote the foreward; and I don't know why he did that.
