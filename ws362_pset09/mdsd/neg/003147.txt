It's killing me! Recipies are not complicated enough, wines are not difficult enough to get a hold of, figuring out american measurement system and calculating it into metric is not bad enough?
Oh yes, let's make it HARDER and let's not include any photos. 
Jesus and Blessed Virgin Mary!
I need pictures in my cookbooks. What the meal is supposed to look like in the end for sure. A "how to" strip - even better!
I'm gonna be too intimidated by my absolute lack of culinary experience / finesse and lack of pictures in this cookbook to even TRY to use it!
Other than that (is there anything left? oh yeah) book is beautifully designed, paper quality is excellent but format is kinda weird (square and rather large) so it sticks out the cookbook shelf.
