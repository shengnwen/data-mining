This book came out when America was all aflutter with the Communist scare.  China had gone Red.  The Soviets had "the bomb."  We were at war (correction, "police action") in Korea.  And Tailgunner Joe was in his ascendancy.  Mickey Spillane's earlier Mike Hammer novels had been apolitical for the most part.  The villains were just hoods, gangsters, motivated by money.  

With "One Lonely Night" Spillane went full-bore anti-communist, without much understanding of the threat beyond the Chicken Little the-sky-is-falling outcry.  The reality was that American communists were self-styled intellectuals talking revolution in darkened Greenwich Village espresso shops.  The laboring class Marx so adored were not having any of it, and the threat wasn't much of a threat at all.  

But Spillane made straw men out of the commies and shot them down.  And somehow Mike Hammer was the loser for it.  As a young man in the 1950's I admired the prose in Spillane's first few novels--and then I came to this one and was weaned.  He was way off the mark, but I forgot that until I picked this up again after a hiatus of five decades or so.

I will admit that the first chapter is a gem of writing, perhaps the best Spillane ever did.  But one gem is not enough to get the book much praise.  It's just barely enough to get it two stars from me
