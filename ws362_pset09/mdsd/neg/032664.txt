"Some Men Are Lookers" is among my favorite gay novels, along with Mordden's masterpiece "How Long Has This Been Going On?" so I was eagerly waiting for the next installment of the Buddies cycle. Tragically "How's Your Romance?" is by far the weakest of the cycle and a poorly assembled conclusion. The book reads as though Mordden was cleaning out his desk drawer and cobbled a story together using disconnected bits and characters. New characters appear at every turn: Lars Erich, Evan, Henry, Tom-Tom, Davey-Boy, Nesto, Red, Vince, and Ken. 

For bad measure, Mordden tosses in a pointless road trip and non-erotic "porn" story that burns up pages and has nothing to do with anything in the book. Page after page shows Mordden marking time with no direction and seemingly no idea where he's going or what he's doing. It's a stunning turn from such an accomplished and prolific writer.

Worst of all, previously major characters like Carlo, Dennis Savage, and J (formerly known as Little Kiwi and Virgil) are relegated to walk-on roles with no real integration. Characters appear and disappear with no rhyme or reason. Cosgrove's dog, Fleabiscuit, is more involved in what passes for the plot than any of the human characters. A writer planning the conclusion of a series might have taken care to produce something organic and satisfying. This, boys and girls, (as Mordden likes to say) is not it. 

The saving grace in this epic disappointment is seeing what has happened to my favorite character, Cosgrove, since we left him in "Some Men Are Lookers." He alone shows growth and change. His story arc partially redeems this abysmal effort.

If you must buy this book, buy it used so Mordden doesn't get another royalty. His lazy, half-hearted effort doesn't deserve additional financial reward. Better yet, skip this altogether, re-read "Some Men Are Lookers," and leave your memories unsullied. Shame on you, Ethan
