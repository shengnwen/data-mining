Why our Catholic high school is making our kids read this book - that reinforces pathetic stereotypes of girls, bad relationships with their moms, uses dirty words and culminates with a trite rendition of - what else - a girl who handles her 'coming of age' not with strength, dignity and guts, but, alas, an eating disorder.  Don't get me wrong - that's a real deal but to have our nations teens - nations girls - read this drivel is downright sad.  They need MORE BOOKS ABOUT GIRLS WHO SHOW STRENGTH THRU ADOLESENCE, NOT THIS GARBAGE!!
