This guide is a shaky review guide at best. Using my experience of the test, the essays, and my excellent teacher, I can successfully say that this book WILL distort your image of the real AP test. The one compliment, if any, I can give, is that the outlining and notes of each section was sufficient. Besides that, the practice tests were absolutely awful, and the sample grading the author provided was inaccurate. In one edition (I think it was 2nd), I scored about a 30/80 on the multiple choice section, and freaked out. The only &quot;5&quot; essay the author provided was absolutely stunning---so stunning that the only way someone could have written that was by totally cramming on that topic and that topic alone, then getting lucky on test day. I don't recommend this guide at all. And I certainly didn't get a 30/80 on the multiple choice on the real test, seeing as how I got a 5. I recommend Princeton Review or Arco for AP Euro
