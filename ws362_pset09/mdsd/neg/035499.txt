Having used the third edition on many an occasion, i was dismayed to find the 5th edition so inferior---no nutritional assessment tools are included at all, and of course then, no discussion  whatever of the validity and reliability of various screening methods.  No discussion of HOW to do a proper 24 hour diet recall, just the listing of it in the assessment process.  i was further disappointed to read the statement that babies should be breastfed until the age of one year: the AAP recommendation reads "for AT LEAST one year."
