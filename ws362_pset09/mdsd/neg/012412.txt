This book has won the Hugo award and may have had a tremendous impact when it first came out, unfortunately it is now greatly outdated.  While some books hold up better over the course of time, this one did not.  Looking purely at the science involved in the book I'll give Leiber credit for at least thinking of it.  It's a nice premise to theorize the gravitational impact of what would happen to the Earth if a planet the same size as it called, &quot;The Wander&quot; suddenly appeared in space next to it.  He does a decent job covering the effects this would cause to the Earth and the Moon with the changing of the tides, flooding, earth quakes, and volcanic activity, but I think he may have missed the effects that the gravitational pull of Earth would have had on &quot;The Wander&quot; as well.  I also had trouble with several of the characters who seem right out of the 60's.  In the 60's there must have been a great deal of mistrust between the populous and the government and several of the characters reflect this feeling in that, &quot;The Man&quot;, or &quot;The Fuzz&quot; are out to get them.   It also appeared that there had been no advances in science on the Earth since the 60's but yet we have a manned base on the Moon and have astronauts out by Mars.  It just didn't add up
