Unfortunately, my copy of edition 3 fell open to page 81, in which the author compares forces from a piston engine to forces generated by living tissue. Unfortunately, this type of comparison is often completely invalid, particularly when the force is accompanied by zero motion in the direction of the force. For example, if the combustion force is replaced by a highly compressed spring, and if the crank is balanced exactly at top dead center, the spring will never "get tired" of exerting its force. In contrast, a human leg WILL get tired, even though no motion occurs. This is because chemical energy is consumed to exert the force even in the absence of motion. 

Unfortunately, with this single unreasoned comparison that drives to the core of bicycling science, the author has shot himself in the credibility foot, leaving all else he has to say in question.
