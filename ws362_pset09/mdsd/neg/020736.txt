Maybe I have completely different tastes than the editors of this anthology, or maybe there just wasn't a whole lot of excellent fantasy published in 2003 but I found Year's Best Fantasy 4 to be a hit and miss affair.  Many of the stories are decent but nothing special.  A few are pretty bad.  Even the usually reliable Neil Gaiman has a misfire with the dull "Closing Time."  Kelly Link's "Catskin" is just plain bizarre (but I suspect it's supposed to be).  Among the few excellent stories are the Nebula Award winner "Basement Magic" by Ellen Klages, a clever update on the fairy-godmother story; 
One Thing About the Night" by Terry Dowling, a creepy ghost story involving a mirrored room; and "Dragon's Gate" by Pat Murphy, a well-told high-fantasy quest adventure.  There are also some good stories by Lucius Shepard and Terry Bisson.  I should also mention the editor's introductions to the stories often contain plot spoilers so I recommend reading those after reading the story.
