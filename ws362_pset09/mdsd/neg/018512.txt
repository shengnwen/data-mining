The author used avidly personal examples, examples from others, quotes, and related scripture which illustrated themes in the principles Jesus taught to his disciples. This also aided in allowing the readers to relate the examples in the book towards their own personal life. The book also outlined that a questionnaire was sent out to 100 women and the book was based on the experiences those women had with mentoring.  

I did not feel that this book was adequately categorized as a book that's primary focus on mentoring.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who is a mentor or contemplating whether or not to be a mentor. While this book did do a good job outlining how one can intertwine religion into mentoring it's it did not provide enough material for me to be able to learn from it's text and apply what I learned to a real life situation.
