I've studied in IT major and my professor use this book as the main text for this subject. Even though I'm not English/USA but I read many text book before. unlike the other texts, this book is pure nightmare.. use very bad language and very hard to intrepret what the author try to communicate..

Moreover, the picture in the text represent nothing. I get nothing from the figure and it's totally useless. I try to find a group of people and let all of them help to translate the books. Surprisly, most of them do not understand the text as well as I am and we cannot conclude what we can get from the book.

I ask the senior student who already pass the class I'm studing, all of them said that this is the worst text book that we had seen in thier real life.

- hard to read, (no common-fundamental word here.., author always use high level descriptive language )
- expensive
- dull
- case study that hard to understand / useless / old / not update
- lots of fussy comma.. will cause you headache.
- etc.

Finally, I advise that you do not purchase this title and all title compose by these author unless you already did read it first
