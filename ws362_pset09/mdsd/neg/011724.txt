I was so disappointed in this version! I have a "Joy" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old "Joy" on ebay and you'll be happier
