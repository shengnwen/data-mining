Imagine buying a simple electronic device, bringing it home, and then discovering a 600-page step-by-step directional manual for setting it up. This is how the visual quickstart guide explains designing a web site. This book has a full segment on how to use a pen tool. We all know how to use the pen tool- a monkey can use the pen tool. If you can coherently read a scientific manual- have at it, if you're like me, and you need to put it in practice and have a sample project to work on (I realize I have been spoiled by the Classroom In a Book series), then you cannot use this book. All I wanted to do was to expand my graphics ability, not become a master Flash guru
