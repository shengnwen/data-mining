My real rating is 1.5 stars. The book won't put you to sleep, but it's not going to teach you anything you won't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years.
Readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport: though the closest I've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood, I learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent.
Feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context: what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity. Hence, for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time, the book will be useless.
Bad points: besides that mentioned, the prose is (as mentioned in my title) in large measure cliches and reads, as other reviewers have pointed out, like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure. For newspaper articles, such is no great handicap, but for a book is makes for tediousness. Next is a quibble, perhaps, but in the trade paperback edition I picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book. The book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper.
If you're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none (as I was when I selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion), "A good walk spoiled" will suffice. If you're looking for a good book, look elsewhere
