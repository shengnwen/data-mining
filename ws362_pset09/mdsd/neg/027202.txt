I bought this book thinking it would be a more specicfic musculoskeletal companion to Braddom's generalized PM&R textbook. Unfortunately the treatment paragraphs (most important section from my perspective) for each topic were very thin and nonspecific.  They were woefully inadequate for an attending or physiatry resident.  I sent the book back which unfortunately meant I didn't get to critique the DVD.
