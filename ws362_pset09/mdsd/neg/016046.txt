Laura Shumar read my mind when she posted her review.  

Bujold is by far my favorite writer, living or dead.  Hers is the only fiction, other than Shakespeare's, that I read with pencil in hand so that I can mark special passages.  I have read all of her books multiple times, with the exception of "Diplomatic Immunity."  "The Hallowed Hunt" will now join it on the far end of the shelf.  

I will still buy her next book as soon as it is available, but with trepidation
