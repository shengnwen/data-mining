Atheists have a lower divorce rate than born again christians but I guess thats just a fluke hu, Ann. They must be bad people somehow. People like Ann can't be christians because they shame one person for having an affair and then forgive another that is an alcoholic because he's a republican. She speaks to people who want to believe so bad they don't care that she doesn't have a christian bone in her body. True christians don't defame, judge or claime superiority. She doesn't have any idea of what being Jesus-like is. Oh and intelligent design is not science. Science is how Religion is why- They are too different questions
