There is no scholarship in the book, a few reference that are minimally supportive to his cause.
The premise of the book is that Agriculture hijacked civilization 10,000 years ago.  Hijacked!!! How do you prove that one?  He believes ALL agriculture is detrimental, including organic.  He asks us to go back to hunting and gathering in the form of "perenial polyculture" and describes the satisfaction of a Buffalo hunt in a farmers field. He believes (no proof at all) that hunter gatherers had sensory abilities that make us moderns practically robotic. Are we victims of agriculture? - there is a real arrogance here for the reader, who apparently is too ignorant to see what has happened. This author has not got a clue what it meant to be a hunter gatherer, and there is little description of their lifestyle other than how the author feels when he goes out hunting.This is real belief in and grief for the loss of the garden of eden.
It is written like a expose, a conspiracy of the elite( probably started by a female), who just wanted to keep slaves and accumulate wealth.
 This is a real disservice to people trying to improve/reform and innovate in agriculture.
It should have no stars at all(that option did not seem to be available) and I would not have read it, if it had not been choosen by my bookclub
