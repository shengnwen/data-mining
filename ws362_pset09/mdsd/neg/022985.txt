My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book.  His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........   Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed?  Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest.  Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church.  God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal.  Maybe he was abused by a priest
