I wont say anything about correctness, but in the end Ahmed Ali has been unable to convey the profound tone any of our holy books has, and definitely Kur'an does too.  The English is not in the least exciting or moving.. Finally the edition is a poor one, a uselessly big book, hard to handle when its paperback like mine.
