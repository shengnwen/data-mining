I could not help but make a smile on the words of the first commentator. Actually, I was also greatly touched by that great film 'The Love is Many Splendored Things'. I also was puzzled why the original book was out of  edition. I realized why it was not when I checked out an old copy from a  big library: well, it was a kind of poorly written love story and was  nothing else.If you doubt my words, please check out the book from some  library. I, for the sake of fairness, must add that other books by the same  author, such as 'Eldest Son,' were interesting and instructive to me
