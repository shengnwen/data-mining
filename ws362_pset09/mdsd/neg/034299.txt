Are you KIDDING? 

That was my thought after completing this novel. Horribly cliched with second-grader knowledge of horses, a plot too silly to comprehend, a child that simply gets dragged to one ranch after another and apparently (other than music and horses) receives no education, and a couple of horses who know how to get to (for the love of Pete!) an engine in the desert. Throw in sex, guns, an untouchable evil person and a woman who is the only person in the WORLD who can tame the wild Pair. I guess you call it a book. YIKES.

Masochistic streak. Yup, that's why I finished it
