In my opinion, this book reads like a school book report. It is a disappointment, considering the reputation of the source -- Stephen Ambrose. Maybe I expected too much because the author is well known. On the other hand, I didn't expect too much from the not well known author Norman Thomas Remick and his book &quot;West Point&quot;, and was most pleasantly surprised. But there you are, then. It's not what you do, it's who you know that counts
