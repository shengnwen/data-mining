There is a big confusion in the introduction pages from the auther. 

He spent more time on criticizing the other students of his guru and how in-effective their styles are. 

It looks very unprofessional to declare all of them are not good and only his own style is good, since they have all been taught by the same guru. 

Does he mean, his guru was wrong in the beginning when teaching Iyengar, Jois or his own son? If so, did his guru find the right way of teaching only at the end? 

How come there are more different sytles of yoga from the same guru and they are criticizing each other?
