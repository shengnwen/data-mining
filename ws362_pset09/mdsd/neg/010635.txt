Hello from Britain.  I bought this book, but I'm sorry to say I returned it back to the AMAZON in my country.

I'm very happy for people who get on with this book, and I believe every reviewer has very wise insights into that very frustrating and confusing craft of writing.  And I think the book was frustrating and confusing for me!

I just didn't agree with having the story told from different viewpoints, and having the bad guy have a "right" point of view - so the story could just have been written from his view.

I didn't like all the examples in the book.  I thought the passage on dialogue was very poor and unrealistic.  And there was no talk on creating a plot from a character.

Also I disagreed on his attitude about the publishing industry and how to write a synopsis.  Publishable writers DON'T always get published - and synopsises are usually just ONE page - here in Britain at least.    

Finally, Publishers DO NOT believe in "How to Write books" - we should just follow a published book - and write something similar
