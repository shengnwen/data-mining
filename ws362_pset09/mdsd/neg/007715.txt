Cressida Mandeville wants to recover her family's fortune.  Her reckless idiot father gambled away their property to Lord Crofton.  Her father had hidden jewels in an erotic statue and Cressida agrees to be Crofton's mistress for a week so she can get the jewels back.

Tristan Tregallows, Duke of St. Raven, poses as a highwayman to clear his cousin's name and, thinking Cressida needs help getting away from the evil Crofton, kidnaps her.  They spend the next 350 pages being stupid.

This story was a mess.  Tris was okay for the most part.  But Cressida - what a hypocritical, judgmental harpy!  She's the Worst. Heroine. Ever.  She agreed to be a lecher's mistress, does all kinds of inappropriate things and still looks down her nose at Tris?  She's a sanctimonious shrew.

And ew, ew, ew, on page 359 she decides to have sex with Tris (they're not married) and says, "I want to be closer to you, Tris, than I've been to anyone since I slid messily from my mother's womb."  Blech.  That's romantic HOW exactly?

I've enjoyed some of Beverley's previous books and wonder what happened with this one.  Thank goodness I bought this from a used book sale that benefited the public library - at least some good came out of the experience.
