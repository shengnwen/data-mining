I am one of the Vietnam veterans referred to on page 217, the ones that didn't agree with anything the VVAW had to say.Someone wrote in their revue &quot; the myth of civilian disrespect to the soldiers during this period of time&quot;, I would have to say it felt quite real to me. The only reason I checked this book out of my local library was to confirm a couple of things about John Kerry and the VVAW. All my questions were answered either by the book or by a recent interview with Gerald Nicosia. The first was that the other members of VVAW felt that John Kerry was just using the organization to gain public notoriety to help him with his political career. The second was that he was at the november 1971 meeting. This is when the anti war VVAW considered assassination of pro war Senators. Simply amazing
