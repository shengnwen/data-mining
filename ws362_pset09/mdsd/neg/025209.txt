This book is quite bad with the analysis, and if you want to read a book about Patton's life, D'Este's work is the one to go to.  Some of the conclusions are simply lunacy, unfounded in anything but the writers opinion, as mentioned before of Patton's fiery speeches.  Did these cause atrocities?  Do not even kid me with this.  I've read too much to be suckered in by this book
