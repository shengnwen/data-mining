Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters.
My reasons for such an accusation:
1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling.
2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.)
3. The book's ending is utterly terrible.
4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.

Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me
