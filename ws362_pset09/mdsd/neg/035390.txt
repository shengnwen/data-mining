After listening to Lori Petty and Debra Mazer read the first six novels, Lorelei King was a distinct disappointment. Stephanie is from New Joisey, for crying out loud. Not Nebraska, or wherever the bland Ms. King is from. a major delight of listeneing to the first novels was the wonderfully expressive voices of the readers. They gave attitude to the words. The latest efforts now sound as if they are being read by the local librarian, local if you live in Kansas, that is. 
From now on I'll read these delightful novels, and listen to others
