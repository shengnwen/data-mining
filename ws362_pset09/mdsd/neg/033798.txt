I admit - I've only read a few pages of this book before putting it down for the reasons I'll put below. I'm willing to give the book 2 stars on the basis it may have gotten better in time, and I just wasn't patient enough. But I doubt it.

The book's protagonist seemed like someone I wouldn't care knowing, much less reading about. Childish, too impressed with his own silly wit, a bad friend & husband - since he doesn't make an attractive person to know (either as a friend or a foe) - why would he make an interesting protagonist
