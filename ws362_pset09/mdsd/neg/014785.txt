Why do people seem to find it necessary to focus on the dark aspects of a person? I think that's an important question to ask of this book. Steel seems only interested in deconstructing Bobby Kennedy. No consideration is paid to the positive parts (of which there are many) of the man and his legacy. I felt that Steel was merely writing the book to sound clever or different. I really didn't see much substance
