Celebs using body suits to pretend they are pregnant while using surrogate mothers and claiming the babies were born the natural way. Also, celebs using body suits since they don't want to put any weight, favoring the now ultra thin mothers to be, those who lose the baby weight in less than a month.

Well it's a creative idea, as is Guatemalan week at Les Sprogs, the baby shop that Ruby and her posh cousin Stella manage; only Ruby is too tacky for Stella and she quits the partnership.

Dating a Gynecologist who delivers your 50 year old mom's newborn baby girl when you have 32 is also a creative take but the novel just didn't do it for me I was eager to put it down at any given moment when in reality when I am engrossed in a great read, I definitely cannot put the book down.

I would recommend it for people who have no other reading material and want to have 2 or 3 laughs. Just an OK book there's no other way to it.
