The late Dr. Kelly is one of my all time favorite authors in the field of Church History (_Dictionary of Popes_, _Golden Mouth_, _Jerome_), but this foray into Biblical Studies, is quite disappointing.  Dr. Kelly merely retreads tired interpretations of what are three of the most overlooked but most interesting of the New Testament epistles.  The inclusion of 1 Peter with 2 Peter &amp; Jude is highly dubious as well.  For really interesting writing on Jude &amp; 2 Peter, I would suggest E. Earle Ellis' or Richard Bauckham's work.  There are many excellent commentaries on 1 Peter, too many to list.  I guess even brilliant authors have their off days
