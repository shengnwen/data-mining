Sorry to say but this book is a dud.  While the concept of presenting interesting mathematical facts is great the presentation is so brief, so wrought with errors, and so incomplete that the work is not worth perusing.  

Some of the "chapters" have answers at the back of the book and some do not.  It appears that the author could not make up her mind wether this was to be a "math tricks" book or a "popular mathematics" presentation substantiated by theory.  

There are many other excellent books that are more fulfilling.  Journey Through Genius comes to mind. 

All in all a disappointing work
