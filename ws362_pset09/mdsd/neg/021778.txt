This book offers "cookie-cutter" solutions to parenting problems.  I felt that there was nothing new presented in the book...simplistic ideas that you can find in any parenting book.  It's common sense that you should reinforce the positives, reward good behavior, spend time with your child, listen without judging so that the child doesn't get defensive.  If you're a beginner to this type of thinking this book is for you.  If you've been around and around the block with your "hard to handle child" you'll find better information in "Setting Limits with your Strong-Willed Child" by Robert MacKenzie.  For a Christian perspective, try "Boundaries with Kids" by Cloud and Townsend
