The title of the book is nonsense. Abraham Lincoln is the most misunderstood figure in American history. He was an individual from humble beginnings who betrayed his nation for greed and power. As an attorney, he represented corporations and the wealthy and powerful. As President, he defied the Constitution and law by forcibly preventing the Southern states from lawful secession. Of course, he also illegally imprisoned newspaper editors, conscripted the poor and immigrants (while permitting the wealthy to buy their way out of service), suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus, manipulated the freeing of the slaves only from those states which seceded, promoted racial discrimination and their return to Africa, and was primarily responsible for the death of more than 620,000 of his countrymen. Everyone should read "The Real Lincoln," a book which contains the true facts about this dictatorial fool. In other more civilized nations, slavery was abolished by payments made by the government to the slave owners, acknowledging their prior lawful property rights. It was the law and government which permitted slavery. Lincoln did not argue against slavery. To the contrary he only "freed" the slaves when he was losing the war. Then he committed countless war crimes by burning and destroying entire cities and murdering civilians. A war built on lies? Does it sound familiar? Our historians are not worthy of the name
