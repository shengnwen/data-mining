Since I ordered this for a young budding artist, I was willing to wait awhile until it shipped.  What a disappointment - this book is not at all what I expected - I imagine I should have been warned by the price.  There is almost no instruction about drawing horses - the pictures are pretty but they will not help in actually learning to draw horses.  One star is almost overly generous for a "learning" book
