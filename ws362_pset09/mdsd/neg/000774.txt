Daniel Greenberg, a Washington-based journalist, analogizes the American scientific activities after WWII as a metropolis dominated with academic cultures in its core. In contrast to the general conception that the budget for the basic research has been cut since the "golden age," or 1960s, the financial support to science enterprises actually has increased. He argues that the problems in the American science have not come from a deficiency of money but from a self-ghettoized, apolitical scientific enterprise of science itself which only competes for the public money but is ignorant of social consequences of what it does. He suggested more political involvement and enlightenment in the scientific communities as a prescription.

Recent study shows that there is a room for even the "self-ghettoized," "apolitical" enterprises of science, as called by the author, to be admitted to be raised as "the fifth branch" (Jasanoff, 1990) which bridges science and policy through the scientific advisory board. Although tons of conversational examples were presented in the book, many questions remain still ambiguous: for example, how political ignorance was gauged; to what other enterprises it can be compared (if possible); how the political ignorance negatively affected public welfare.

I admire the author's effort to incorporate all the transient newspaper articles and volatile dialogues among the congressmen and the heads of various scientific institutions into a 500 paged book. To read Introduction and Epilogue seems enough for this book, unless you have a plenty of time or historian-like interests in the episodes occurred in the Washington regarding the research policy and budgeting
