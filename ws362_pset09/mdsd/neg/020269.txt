As we've come to expect from poetasters like Billy Collins (who are increasingly dominating the contemporary poetry scene), the guidelines for becoming one of the "best" poets of the year just get easier and easier.  

With each page I kept expecting a gem to pop up, possibly a piece that Collins had overlooked or some editor, somewhere, with the true spirit of poetry on his her mind, managed to smuggle in here.  It happened once: Franz Wright.  Even Thomas Lux turns in a disappointing performance, which is rare, asserting the intellectual snobbery which is usually restricted to his interviews.  

I've come to expect precisely nothing from this series and that's exactly what I got.  I am not a neo formalist, a language poet, and I'm not snobbish when it comes my selection in this medium: I just like good poetry.  No matter what anyone might say, it's not here
