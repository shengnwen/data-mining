Strange that this person is listed as a woman who changed modern America.  Isn't this supposed to be a book about positive change?  Gretchen Buchenholz's efforts to save border babies somehow seems more a vanity attempt, promoting herself, inviting her friends (the political, the rich and famous), and photo ops.  Ms. Buchenolz always seems to have her name in the front of advertisements about her programs.  What a beautiful facade....promoted for the benefit of babies.  But if her purpose is to help babies, it doesn't seem that her track record is that good.  In fact, it is shameful. Ask about Tanae Green and Stephanie Ramos, babies in the foster care agency run by Ms. Buchenholz....  Both babies died of horrible neglect, and Ms. Buchenholz didn't show her face to protect, protest, or speak up for them, even at the end of their lives. She was strangely silent, and used her connections to prevent bad publicity.
