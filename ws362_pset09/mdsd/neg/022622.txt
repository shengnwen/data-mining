WP Kinsella's book &quot;Box Socials&quot; is an excellent insight into the white trash of Alberta. It displays a community kind of like Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; with many well-defined social  classes in an area where you're judged by your name. However, the book  loses a plot during a Ukranian wedding, and it drudges on to the end
