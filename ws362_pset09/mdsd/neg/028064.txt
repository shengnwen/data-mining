As a college student, I am required certain books for my history class.  The firsthand account books I have read this semester have been very enjoyable (Kaffir Boy & Son of the Revolution).  However, even though Soldiers of God is a firsthand account of Robert Kaplan traveling in Afghanistan & Pakistan during the Soviet invasion & occupation, it was one of the most boring books I have ever read.  I could barely read 3 pages without beginning to doze off.  The action is limited and sporadic and the commentary is less than stellar.  If you are looking for another Kaffir Boy this book is not the one to pick.
