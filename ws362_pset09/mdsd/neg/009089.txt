This book had some potential at the beginning but bombed about half way through..I am surprised at the favorable reviews here..The story is very weak and almost eerie considering it was published pre-911..I am amazed that J.P.'s publisher didn't hand the manuscript back to him and tell him to rewrite the ending..The ending was probably the worst I have ever read..In fact, if you decide to read this book, skip the last 10 chapters and write your own ending..I'm positive you'll do better than Patterson did
