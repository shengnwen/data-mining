I used this as a textbook in a college course on the history of 20th century physics.  Kragh may be factual, and he may be a good historian, but he simply is not a good writer.  (Even the professor admitted it was a good book to aid in falling asleep.)  Emilio Segre offers a more personable view in From X-rays to Quarks, which I found far more valuable
