This book would've been a &quot;find&quot; if I were in my early teens, but for any adult who considers themselves a bibliophile, this book is just too lightweight.  Yes, it is about books and literature, but the coverage is extremely shallow.  I would consider this to be something like the Reader's Digest Condensed Books form of Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia.  Buy that work instead of you're looking for a good reference work on literature
