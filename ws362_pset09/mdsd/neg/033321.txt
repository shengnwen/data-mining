Despite the subtitle, this book is very technical and has little information which is of use for the average person with a pet betta. There is a lot of information on breeding and the different types of bettas, which might be useful for a breeder. As a pet &quot;owner&quot;, I found it unhelpful. You can find more information about keeping bettas as pets for free online
