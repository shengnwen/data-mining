This book basically states that &quot;All your employees are lazy whiners and need to be disciplined or fired&quot;.  While this may be true at a small number of companies, it is NOT TRUE for most.  This book is a prime  example of Upper Management Incogitancy in American Business.  I would  recommend this book to &quot;The Common Worker&quot; in order to better  understand the dysfunctional actions of those in Upper Management.  This  book might also be a good manual for raising unruly children or teen-agers  but NOT for running an innovative and competitive company.  This is  probably the ONLY management book that Dilbert's Boss has read
