Although art history does not change, technology does. This book accompanies CD's, DVD's, or video. The films are dry, lifeless and formatted in prehistoric documentary style, causing even the most interested art students to drift into a drooling stuper. Since 1989 (publishing year), documentary formats have become more exciting and entertaining. Please update this study guide and media sources(16 years later! Hello?), if only to spare poor unsuspecting students hours of bordom and certain regret for having registered for a course that "sounded interesting," but well.
