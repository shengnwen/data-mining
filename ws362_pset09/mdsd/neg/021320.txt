This book is pretty much standard for undergrad analytical chemistry but it is not a great text.  It provides a very basic introduction to analytical methods in a poorly organised fashion.  The information is presented in such a way that it calls for you to memorize rather than understand.  The mathematics presented confuse the reader more than they help.  I recommend you buy this used.  If you plan on pursuing analytical chemistry, this book will quickly be shoved aside to make way for much better books, each specific to a particular instrumental method
