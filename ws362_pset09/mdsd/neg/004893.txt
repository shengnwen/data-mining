As the title suggests, this is a book about improving your speed.  It is a general book applicable to any sport.  And so the authors go to great lengths to generalize their program.  I expected to read about the latest  in exercise physiology concerning speed, recommended training, and  exercises.  We do get that sort of thing in a manner of speaking, but to  put it very bluntly, this book is one of the most jumbled, mixed up,  illogical presentations you are likely to read.  Hard to believe three  college graduates put this together.  In order to get anything out of this  book you kind of have to trudge all the way through it and improvise your  thought process as you go.  The authors give absolutely zero help. Do we  get titles to the latest studies on sport speed--in the negative.  Do we  get information on the latest persons doing research on the subject--in the  negative.  Do we get a logical, understandable training program--in the  negative. What we get instead is kind of a hodge podge of information  coming from all directions without hardly any logical organized  presentation. Oh--there is the seven step speed training program presented  in 7 different chapters.  And to give credit--it does look like this is a  good speed improvement program.  However the information  the seven  chapters (and you have to get through 3 almost imconprehensible chapters to  get to the program) seems to rain down from the sky in a very disconnected  fashion.  There are few explanations of the whys and wherefores; there are  zero explanations on where the program comes from or how it was put  together, or where it fits in anywhere in what is being done by any one.   It is just there, presented, and I suppose we are supposed to swallow it  all on faith.  There are presented many descriptions and photographs of  useful looking exercises.  I do know more about speed improvement after  reading the book.  But the information was gotten by pulling teeth
