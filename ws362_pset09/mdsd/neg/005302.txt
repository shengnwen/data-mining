I am a 40something male, diagnosed with MS 10 years ago.  Ms Davis seems to have missed her mark! When she writes about "finding your bliss", is she kidding me?  Bliss for most of us who suffer from MS would be to just have 10 minutes without pain, discomfort (I won't start with a list).  Ten minutes, that's all.  Just take away our pain (body and mind)just for this brief instance, would be beyond any bliss you could imagine.  Her biggest and most damaging issue is that NOT ONCE DOES SHE ADDRESS THOSE OF US WHO SUFFER FROM PAIN!  Mostly pain in our bodies, how to deal with it, what to do, who to turn to.  Who is she kidding?  She must not an issue with pain, only numbness.  This is understandable, MS is different in each case.  Actually, if I had to choose, I would have gone more twoards the numbness (in the event I had to make such a horrible choice)  Her Ten steps to moving beyond.... should be retittled: "My walk down the yellow brick road and it like totally stressed me out".  In "Lean on Me" who is there to lean on?  Don't wast your time with this book.

I only give it one star for the references made in the book i.e. web addresses, orginizations etc.  It's the only reason I'm going to keep the book, it will be on my shelf in the reference section.  Sorry Ms Davis, but I had to tell it like "I" see it, in thousands of people.  Just ask Montel Williams about his "pain" issue
