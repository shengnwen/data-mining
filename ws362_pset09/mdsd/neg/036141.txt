 I decided to read Blue Latitudes after reading a review from an Amazon "Rate It" patron. It suggested that Blue Latitude was a far more superior book than Over the Edge of the World. Since I thought OVTEOTW was one of the best books I ever read, I'll give BL a read;the longest chore I had to endure this year.
