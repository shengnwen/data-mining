I saw this book in a store and LOVED it.  It gives reviews on each ride for preschool, grade school, etc.  Then it tells you about the "fright potential"  YEA RIGHT.  Many rides were rated no fright potential and scared the snot out of every young kid in the place.  The Winnie the pooh ride for example was rated "Not firghtening in any respect" and "Cute as Pooh bear himself".  So I take my 3 year old on to discover it is a ride though the hurricane from the orignal Winnie the pooh blustery day movie.  You even ride though owls house that is shaking its self apart.  Roo is being blown away, and kango is trying to catch him, etc.  The stupid ride is even complete with the nightmare scene about heffulumps and woozles (not Lumpy, the old scarey original heffulumps and woozles all done HUGE in neon paint with black lights spinning on them).  The original sound track of beware, beware, BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!!!!!!!! is playing all around you so loud it is hard to hear your screaming child.  Over and over I read the book and said "This ride is ok sweety" and over and over again my daughter and most of the other kids got the snot scared out of them.  By the time I got to the it's a small world ride my daughter was begging to not go on anymore rides and she was in the fetal position though the first half of the ride, afraid to even look up for fear of what she would see.  If you love your small kids DO NOT TRUST THIS BOOK!!!
