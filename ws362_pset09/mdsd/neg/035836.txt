Many, many years ago I read Catherine Coulter, read her avidly, eagerly looking forward to her next book. Well, this is the first one of hers that I have read in about a decade and WHAT HAPPENED? Three times I set this book down in disgust, only to come back to it out of sheer stubbornness.

There is not enough room to write about just how bad this book was. From generally poor writing (Mary Lisa said, Jack said, Lou Lou said... until you want to yell "I KNOW who is involved in this conversation!), silly plot, unneccessary side stepping. 

WHO CARES that the hero digs a chunky chip into guacamole? OH WOW, we get to know the different flavors of potato chips being devoured by three woman while they talk about the big case. WHEN have any of us heard of investigating cops asking "why is she wearing those pajamas when you are wearing those"? YEAH sure, an agent involved in a case is going to let endangered person call the shots in even the tiniest part of the investigation. And the names! Mary Lisa? Lou Lou? Puker? Gimme a freaking break! Aaaarrrrggggg!!! 

Ms. Coulter, I used to love your books. PLEASE get back to what you used to do so well. If you cannot write the "FBI style" books that are so popular now, then don't. STOP feeding the bestseller beast anything less than your best. Cease. Desist. Please go back to what you are great at
