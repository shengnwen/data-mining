Travels in the Scriptorium is Paul Auster's (mercifully short) 13th novel ... or is it?  Sadly, Mr. Auster hasn't had a new idea since Leviathan; each novel he's written since then has been nothing more than a repackaging of his old ideas (chance, alienation, identity).  I've read all of his novels and, with the exception of the horrible In the Country of Last Things, regard his early ones as exceptional, and they meant a lot to me; that's why reading the latter half of his oeuvre has been so disappointing, and frustrating.  

Between the age of 50 and 60, a career (and acclaimed) novelist should be in his prime, but Mr. Auster has not fulfilled his promise.  Instead we have Mr. Blank, the protagonist in his latest novel(?), which reads more like, I hope, his confession that he knows he is out of ideas.  The novel reads as if Mr. Auster himself is in his old age, in the grip of dementia:  the shards of his former writings and influences are haunting his soul, and he's decided to scrawl it all down and pass it off as a novel.  So in Travels we get a stifling pastiche of Kafka and Beckett peopled with ghosts of characters from Mr. Auster's other novels, plus the distasteful details of Mr. Blank's member and his bowel movements.  

The limited action contained within this slim book's covers are detailed in the product description and don't need to be restated here.  If you've never read a novel by Mr. Auster before, this isn't the one to start with:  read the NY3, Moon Palace, The Music of Chance, or Leviathan.  If you've read Mr. Auster's other novels, you have read Travels in the Scriptorium already.
