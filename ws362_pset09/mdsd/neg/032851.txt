"As an African American gay man, Gomes is interested in re-viewing the biblical passages on sexuality and race" Without even picking up this book, you can see where it is going. The Bible clearly speaks out against the homosexual lifestyle? Strike those passages. The Bible is God's word and ought to read as such, not reinterpreted to make us feel better about our sin. By the way, being named one of the best seven preachers by TIME magazine is like being named one of the best seven Republicans by MoveOn.org, it doesn't hold much authority. Read a decent translation of the Bible for yourself and see what God has to say to you
