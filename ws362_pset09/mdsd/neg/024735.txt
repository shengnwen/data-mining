The anaglyph conversions were poor, to put it nicely.
(Honestly, I've seen better in TV Guide.)
I'm a stereo aficianado, and was quite disappointed that none of the original stereo photos were included.
Also, not all of the photos were 3-D, and I found it quite annoying to be putting on and taking off the glasses every third page or so
