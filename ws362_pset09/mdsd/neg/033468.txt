This book is poorly written, poorly focused and poorly researched

It barely gets around to talking about Teddy Roosevelt and when it does, it tries - lamely - to claim he had socialist tendencies.

This book isn't about the "Making of Theodore Roosevelt's America" 
It is about the socialist movement at the time.  It is about the assassin's alleged homosexuality...it's about everything EXCEPT Roosevelt

A big disappointmen
