I expected something akin to Mortimer Adler's How to Read and Why.  Instead I found myself dragged into a solipsistic rant of Mr. Bloom's favorite books.  To be sure, some may enjoy his discussion of how Cervantes is instrumental to modern literature however this book did not meet my expectations.  Instead I got the impression that this is more of a 'vanity' book than anything.  Not only is the book mislabeled, it is an irritating read
