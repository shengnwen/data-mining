If you are looking to add to an existing collection of books on Washington, this would really help complement it.  This book was not what I was looking for, however.

What I was looking for was a book that (1) shed light on Washington as the man who presided over the creation of a new nation and (2) did not go over the head of someone who didn't take any American History class at the college level.  It sorta met these criteria, but I think it would be more appreciated by someone who were familiar with the historical context and wanted to add to it.  I felt like I read a lot of snippets which shed some light during this period in his life, but I didn't get a good feel of the significance or the context of his achievements.

Biographies (which this really isn't, because it only covered his life in the 1790's) are difficult to write because you have to present the facts but make it appealing as a fictional story (narrative trajectory, character development, etc...).  I felt that the author has an elegant style of writing, but I kept saying "So what?" to myself at the end of the chapters.  The book describes many instances where Washington maintained the delicate balance between the "Hamilton" style vs. the "Jefferson" philosophies of the federal government, along with many other political maneuverings and actions which occurred, but my impressions are that this book is better suited for complementing someone's existing knowledge of his achievements than a layperson like me who is several years removed from AP History
