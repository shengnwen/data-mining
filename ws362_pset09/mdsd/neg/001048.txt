I love this book until I came across a part where Mary Anne talks to Dawn about her parents' divorce. MA said "So what if your parents are divorced? There's nothing WRONG with it." I was furious! YES there is something wrong with it! Divorce is against God's law, and I feel extremely strong about this. I cannot believe the message Ann M. Martin is sending to readers!
