I am a student of Ayurvedic medicine and particularly passionate about Ayurvedic nutrition.  I just wanted to point out to all readers and potential readers of this book that Ayurveda does NOT support the eating of raw foods as the majority of your diet.  It encourages all constitutions to eat a majority of cooked food, because it is easier to digest and helps to support healthy agni (digestive fire).  Ayurveda is also a very strong supporter of drinking cows milk, providing it is organic, unhomogenised, and appropriately prepared (cooked with spices).  In fact, drinking milk is one of the keys to health and happiness in Ayurveda - milk is the one food that directly nourishes shukra dhatu (reproductive tissue) and therefore directly nourishes the immune system.  Ghee (clarified butter) is also a very important food in Ayurveda. Ayurveda only supports vegan diets for certain constitutions or conditions, usually for limited amounts of time. Ayurveda also supports the eating of meat in certain conditions and by some constitutions, providing again that it is appropriately prepared.  If you really want to improve your diet and ensure it is appropriate for your prakruti (constitution) and vikriti (current imbalances), go and visit your local Ayurvedic practitioner!
