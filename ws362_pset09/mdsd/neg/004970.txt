Budiansky tries to make a clear point about domestication: it is a matter of human/nonhuman symbiosis. Some of this thesis is interesting, and Budiansky makes it clear and readable. His argumentation relies on the fact that some species resist domestication attempts while others are easily tamed, and the fact that domesticated animals develop cartain features which make them even more easily tamable. So far so good. The problem starts when Budiansky claims that this is all domestication is about. Force and one sided exploitation are forgotten or simply ignored. But this is far from all: the symbiosis model might sound reasonable for the beginning of domestication (and as one side of the story as well), but in later developments it becomes unimportant, and when industialized agriculture appears, the whole approach becomes irrelevant. Budiansky fails to apprehend that. But the book has even more embarrasing aspects. Budiansky is an enthusiastic anti-animal-rightist, and the urge to prove right pushes him into a way of handling facts which is very loose, to say the least. And above all, he tries to present ethical arguments for modern farming methods - which amount to, well, nothing (farmers have real connection with nature, so they know the big truths which city dwellers never know...) In short, it's a book that could have some potential as a humble article, after some heavy editing. But as it is, its only value is as an example of how ideology works. It might be said, that it is regrettable that Budiansky is such an eloquent writer: that way his ideologically-safe and oversimplifyed ideas might convince some uncritical minds
