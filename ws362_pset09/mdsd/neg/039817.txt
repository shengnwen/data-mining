Planning an herb garden, or just thinking about it? Do yourself a favor and get yourself &quot;Taylor's Guide to Herbs&quot; or another herb-gardening resource. This book has photos and rambling descriptions of different kinds of herb gardens, but there is very little defining  information on herbs themselves. If you are looking for color photos or  illustrations of different herb plants, medicinal/cosmetic/culinary uses of  herbs, or even suggestions as to which herbs to plant next to each other,  this is NOT the book for you. If you're a professional gardener, this is  still not the book for you. However, if you are looking for a coffee-table  book that suggests you are a gardener, then go ahead and buy this book. I'd  give it a negative star if I could
