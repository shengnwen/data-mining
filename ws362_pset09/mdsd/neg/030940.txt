This book was recommended reading during my studies on interior design, so I bought it without really looking into it.  I was disappointed.  Maybe I expected too much, maybe the title misled me, but it seemed very much based on thumbnail sketches and it wasn't what I was looking for.  It is a thin little book full of rough pencil sketches that you could easily lose down the back of the sofa! (in a nutshell). I wanted to know the more indepth technical ways of doing perspectives and this book left me in the dark.
