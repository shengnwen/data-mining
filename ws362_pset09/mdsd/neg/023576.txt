This was the worst book I have ever come across. The only thing this "book" had was definitions in it. Definitions are fine for other subject, but not for a math subject where formulas are important. I am also disappointed at the fact that this was not a text, but a "study guide" for the text. perhaps this would be useful for someone who was going to take a CLEP test or something
