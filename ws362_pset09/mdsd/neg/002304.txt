A previous reviewer expounded ad nauseum on the anger and rage that MUST be felt by fat women the world over; almost as though he himself has been involved with women of size and felt their wrath. However, that is more indicative of his own issues (why keep choosing women with these issues? He himself must be overly familiar with anger and rage) than an indicator of the value of the book. I found the book to contain many of the familiar diatribes and platitudes of any recovery program, without the depth. This is not to say that there were NO redeeming qualities; simply that such a simplistic ideology about the reasons for obesity insult the individual who suffers from such a disease
