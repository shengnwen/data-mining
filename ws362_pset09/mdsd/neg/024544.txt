Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit.
Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression.
