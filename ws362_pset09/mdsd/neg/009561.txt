To put it bluntly, this is one of Stephen King's worst novels.  As a big admirer of King, my major criticism has always been that he has a poor "end game".  His ability to create and make you envision people and whole communities as if they were real, is second to none.  However come the end of a story, he doesn't seem to know how to finish in a way that would do his stories justice...  And for me, Needful Things is by far the worst example.  Annie Wilkes would not be pleased!
On a final note, this story is obviously influenced by an old Peter Cushing movie called Temptations Ltd, made in 1973, which is about an antique dealer with supernatural powers..
