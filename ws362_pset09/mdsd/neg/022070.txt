This book is neither about Aristotle nor General Motors.  Do not be fooled into believing it is in any way an application of Aristotelian ethics in modern business; it is not.  Morris consistently contradicts Aristotle throughout the book.  

An example is Morris' proselytizing conclusion that leadership requires humility.  To make his point Morris quotes ancient Hasidic verse and the Tao Te Ching to establish that we are all worms.  Nobility, Morris suggests, is lowness.

Did Aristotle ever say this? No.  Could Aristotelian writing lead us to these conclusions?  No again.  Is Taoism consistent with Aristotelian reason and logic?  No, no, no.  Is Hasidic verse? Definitely not.  So what is going on?  Did Morris forget to read Aristotle?

Aristotle understood Man as a rational being with happiness as the moral purpose of his life.  Morris does not.  This book does not.

Morris peppers his book with quotes at the furious rate of no less than one or two per page.  He quotes every thing from fortune cookies to Einstein.  Ironically with all this mad quoting he never once, ever, (I checked) quotes Aristotle - never.  
 
This book could better be titled, "If an irrational populist ran a non-profit organization."   

The prefaces of basic economic texts usually contain better discussions of the practical intersection of business and philosophy.
