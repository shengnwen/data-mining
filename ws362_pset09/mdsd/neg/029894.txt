This book is a complete fantasy.  Without wasting any more time writing a review, I'd like to point of one huge error of fact contained in this book.  In Chapter 10, pg. 65, the author claims that &quot;In the 1950's, ITT developed sensor technology that could literally display what a person was thinking.&quot;  Later on this same page and on page 67, he claims that a Cray 1 computer was used &quot;...interfaced with an IBM 360...&quot;.  The problem here was that the IBM 360 was introduced in 1964 and the Cray 1 was not introduced until 1976, so having this &quot;developed technology&quot; in the 1950s as described was impossible
