Lipstadt is patently an intelligent author, and some of her in depth analyses bring some discrepancies to light, statistical and other, in the works of David Irving. However, any historian, journalist, or writer in general could be found to have an equal level
of faults in their works.
  Irving is one of the integral historians of WW2 and Nazism. His research has probably brought more new evidence and data
to light than any single historian of this era. The bibliography of any work of note on this period in history will contain references to Irving's work. The vast amounts of data, and the unique and varied nature of his sources, have made his contribution priceless.
   Lipstadt criticises his fluctuating figures, on, say the victims of Dresden. Yes, his estimates have varied, but then history in general is prone to evolution, rarely are such figures maintained as 100% accurate as decades pass. Especially the field Irving works in - what with the cold war, massive amoutns of integral material laid hidden for years, even decades.
   I would also state the statistics of Auschwitz victims have fallen from 6 million to less than 1 million in the last 50 years, very gradually. This represents much wider change than Irving's figures, and illustrates the evolution of historical analysis.
   The scariest part of this whole book/trial is that the expert historians who testified against Irving were paid £500,00. Very, very sinister. History, indeed, on trial. And if you're reading of it differs from what it's supposed, prepare to face annihalation. Remember Salman Rushdie and Iran? People in America and Europe decried the 'backward and fanatical' Iran for attacking the author. Look closer to home, and be very afraid..
