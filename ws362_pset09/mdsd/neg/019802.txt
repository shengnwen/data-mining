I am a seasoned Java developer, but not an experienced Web developer and I bought this book because I wanted to bring myself up to speed on Web development using Spring; but I am sobered now.
The book was obviously quickly pieced together from disparate material. Nobody seemed to have worked the examples through before releasing the book; these examples are inconsistent, and I lost a lot of time debugging and searching for the reasons why it did not work. E.g. on page 62 there is a diagram of what you should get when you follow the instructions; but if you follow the instructions, you do not get it. (resp. it makes assumtions about what is availble in the Web server without telling so).
If you are an experienced Web developer, you can probably make up the missing parts by yourself; if you are not, you spend a lot of effort searching for missing parts of the puzzle, instead of learning the thing you wanted.
Its a pitty the autors or editors did not spend the time in order to tediously check the content and make it consistent throughout; I think it could be a good instructional book (despite containing too much vain praise like ".. are highly configurable and extensible ..." instead of hard facts (e.g. useful examples of extensions); so it is only a text book for those already knowledgeable
