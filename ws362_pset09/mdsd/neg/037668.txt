This is the worst book on the subject that I have read.  It is not written well - or even easy to read for that matter and with advice like have good skin, have a pleasant voice and don't have an opinion that is contradictory to your date's, Nakamoto's book is shallow and unhelpful. Other books on the subject like He's Just Not That Into You are much more realistic, empowering and helpful
