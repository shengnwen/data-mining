This is by far the worst self help book I have ever purchased.  To put it simply, this book is titled incorrectly.  There is only one chapter, 15-20 pages, on financing a business.     At no point does the author explain in detail how it is possible to purchase a business for little to no money down.  As a matter of fact the author continuously mentions that you need a large cash source to purchase and run a business.   If you are looking for an EXTREMELY basic book that outlines the process of buying a business this is for you.  If you are looking for a book that will explains how to buy a business with little or no money down, look elsewhere
