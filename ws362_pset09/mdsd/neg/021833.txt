This book is big on eye-grabbing claims and weak on substance. It is designed to appeal to the credulous. The title is one obvious example of the lack of rigor. The book was about "radical enhancements" - including the genetic manipulations. It had almost nothing to do with evolution. The author skipped glibbly over that distinction. Readers should be very skeptical about the exaggerations, loose claims, and handwaving in this book
