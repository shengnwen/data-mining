Until the author mentions that he is a native american I thought he was just ignorantly biased.  He laments the tourism of the Black Hills and Mt.  Rushmore while complaing and totally ignores the Crazy Horse Memorial which  will dwarf Rushmore when completed.  He concludes that it was just fine for  Means to block access to important segments of &quot;Custer Battlefield  National Monument&quot; while ignoring the rights of other Americans to  visit the battlefield.  (My family came all the way from Texas and were  unable to see the Reno site because of the illegal blockade which had  nothing to do with the Sun Dance.) Who wants to hear the usual park service  inaccurate litanies when the real 'mccoy' is outside the door.  There  should be a rating lower than 1 star for tripe such as this book.  Of the  more than 97 books I have on the Custer Battlefield and Indian wars, this  one is the second worst.  The author omits anything that would detract from  his agenda and ignores countless resources that would prove his hypothesis  wrong at many key points.  He doesn't even believe the winter count records  apparently. I was most disappointed in this book.  The title should be  &quot; My views or A Midsummer Nights Dream&quot;. I wonder how much of his  royalties the author has donated to the Northern Cheyenne or to the various  Sioux councils
