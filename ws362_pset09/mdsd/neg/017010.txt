Several times during my reading of this book I said to myself, "This is one weird kid."

As so many other people in these reviews stated, Jonathan Schwartz is a great singer and DJ with a huge knowledge of his subject.  But he comes across to me as thoroughly unlikeable in this book.

A good deal of the book talks about how terrible things have been , yet he never lacked for money.  His dad and stepmom may have been quite odd (or eveil, in his stepmom's case), but he never lacked any material things.

Speaking of odd, didn't they take pictures in the Schwartz house?  None are in this book, I would have liked to see some of his dad.

BTW, didn't Jonathan have one friend in any of the schools he went to?
