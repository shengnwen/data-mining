The claim that step by step the artists reveal their secrets is a sham, they reveal nothing, and their text is just airy rap about nothing. The artwork must be their left overs, including several pages devoted to a tedious ad campain for a fruit juice. In addition there are several ridiculous repeated images just for fill out. A shoddy and hastily book put together for self promotion. It's amazing how two such capable fantasy artists dont have the IMAGINATION to put together the genuine article. Buy this only if you are a die hard fan with no sense of discrimination
