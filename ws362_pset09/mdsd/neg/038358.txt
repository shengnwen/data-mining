This book makes me want to stay in my bed and never drink or eat anything.
According to this booking there is nothing on the face of the earth that will not cause you to contract a disease.  Kevin Trudeau has extreme and elaborate schemes to "make you perfect".   However, you would have to be filthy rich to be able to afford to stay on the program he wants to put you on because noone else could afford it!   I guess I am frustrated with the impossible scenarios of this book.   Some of the items that he wants you to ply your body with, well educated people have never even heard of!
I'd be interested to see some totally factual research of REAL PEOPLE who have followed his program to a T and see how they are doing.   Much of the items that Kevin wants you to get you better get ready for shipping and handling charges big time
