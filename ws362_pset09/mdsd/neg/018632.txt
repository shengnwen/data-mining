I am halfway through the subject book (Gerald Green's &quot;East and West&quot;). I have found several historical discrepancies and I'm wondering how many there are that I don't know about.  1. Mr. Green refered  to Camp Pendleton, twice in the timeframe of 1941. The US governement did  not buy the land for Camp Pendleton until March of 1942. 2. He refers to  Japan's Imperial Marines. Japan did not have marines. They had a Special  Naval Landing force often called marines by US troops, but that is not what  they were. 3. He refers to a Japanese major's rank insignia as  &quot;leaves&quot;. This one I'll have to look up, but I don't believe  Japan used the same type of rank insignia as the US. Has anyone else  complained about authors blowing it like this ? I think it casts doubt on  the credibility of his work. Can you comment as well ? Thank You, Lee Ras
