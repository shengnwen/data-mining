Mosby is a poet, and there are a few nice turns of speech, but the novel is ridiculous.  The prose style is labored to the point of exasperation; the plot lacks direction; the characters are romance-novel farcical.  The few attempts to create a real sense of time and place one are unconvincing.  Very little to recommend about this one
