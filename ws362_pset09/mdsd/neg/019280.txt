I used to think of regressions as harmless pursuits, but have since learned that "memories" created by the mind are virtually indistinquishable from real memories and that people who seek to create them tend to believe them, even when those memories later turn out to be demonstrably false.

In his opening paragraph, Andrews notes: "We many never be able to prove that we lived before. Even if we are able to produce names, dates and places, it still does not proved that we lived at that time and place." 

So why the book?

"Because, even without conclusive proof, the benefits for personal empowerment, healing and enlightenment are tremendous."

The "theology" of reincarnation comes from unsure sources, one of which is the primitive African Zulus. As explained in this book the souls of people depart and go to sleep until notified that another learning experience awaits it. Then it returns as a human or as an animal. 

My own personal view is that man should seek God for spiritual knowledge. Once one begins trusting in "suggestions" of unsure memories, the foundation becomes more than a little shakey. Three different people claiming to be the same historical figure is something that should cause anyone to reexamine this belief in past lives, and this is something that's not difficult to find. False memories seem real but aren't. That's why books like this don't sound dangerous, but are.
