As with other works written about the theories of theism or Christianity, this one still fails to deal with fundamental issues in physical reality and epistemology. The author of course wishes to reject rationalism, but the presupposition that he replaces them with fails to preserve intelligibility and thought. Once again, the question &quot;How do we know what we claim to know?&quot; destroys theistic philosophy. For more information, read the works of Massimo Pigliucci and Richard Dawkins. Until theists can justify their presuppositions, they are just building mythological castles in thin air
