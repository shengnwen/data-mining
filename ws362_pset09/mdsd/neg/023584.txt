I picked up this book in hopes that I would better acquiant myself with the conflicts in our world. This book focuses on 10 hot spots in the world: Bosnia, Cyprus, Karabakh, Kosovo, Palestine, the former USSR, Rwanda & Burundi, Sri Lanka, Transylvania, and Ulster (Northern Ireland). The author tries to give a brief historical background (in many cases an extremely biased and uneducated view) on these regions and then tries to come up with his own solution to these problems ranging anywhere from the partition of land to population exchanges (thank goodness this guy doesn't run the UN!). My advice to everyone out there...spend your money on a better read
