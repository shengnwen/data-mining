I expected more from The Smithsonian.  This book contains a total of three paragraphs about Martha Wayles, Thomas Jefferson's wife; four paragraphs about Anna Symmes, William Henry Harrison's wife; five paragraphs about Rachel Donelson, Andrew Jackson's wife; eight paragraphs about Letitia Christian, John Tyler's wife; and only three sentences on Hannah Hoes, Martin Van Buren's wife.  A high school research paper based on such a half-hearted attempt would have received a "D".
