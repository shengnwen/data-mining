I thouth this book would tell me how espionage works--the real kind, not the 007 kind.  How could a book about a class at the CIA NOT tell me about CIA's inner workings?  Unfortunately (and perhaps for security reasons) there was little detail.  It did share a bit about how covers are protected, how officers avoid surveillance, and a few other things, but always in overly general terms.  Unfortunately for the reader, Mr. Waters is annoyingly patriotic, which got WAY too sappy at times.  The book also spent too much time on his personal life.  Okay, so being in the CIA is hard on your personal life--so what?  There was NOTHING interesting about this guy's life outside of his work; his s attempts at "personalizing" the story amounted to little more than filler, and pretty dull filler at that.
