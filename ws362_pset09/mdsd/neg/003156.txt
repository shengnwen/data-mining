Almost bought this in the store until I noticed there were case studies for both Win2K and WinXP. These are very similar operating systems and, sure enough, the text for the chapters is exactly the same for most of these two chapters. I do not understand why  interesting operating systems [FreeBSD, Mach] were left online in order that these two redundant chapters could be printed. Were it not for my familiarity with previous editions, I would assume the authors knew very little about OS concepts if they thought that covering 2K and XP would provide two distinct case studies for comparison. In short, the 2K coverage should have been replaced by one of the online chapters
