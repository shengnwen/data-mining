This book should be pulped. Maushart is entitled to her own interpretations of the literature but her analysis falls woefully short, first in her over-reliance upon feminist theories on gender oppression to explain poor or weak marriages; and second from her unwillingness to acknowledge the change happening around her. Maushart seems more of a woman with a grudge to bear than an author with a possibly important message. If her true stories were from the experiences of other women (indicating research), I, for one, might have been able to stomach her biased diatribe. Every choice comes down to a yes or no. Maushart twice said yes. If offered the choice again she should do some research before making a decision
