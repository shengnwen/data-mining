As a violin teacher, I bought this CD for one of my students.  However, I am NOW ordering the Cd of the same volume performed by a different violinist.  The performances on this CD are, unfortunately, all very sharp, in other words, not in tune.  I do not recommend any student listening to them, as their use as a reference for intonation will be incorrect.
