There was enough redemption and entertainment in the first 2 books to have me reading the third, but what a way for Sinjun to go!  I liked Sinjun, I liked Colin, the Scottish adventure and running away from the overprotective brothers is great... So why does our Strong and Manly hero have to ruin it all by subjugating the eager and talented Sinjun to HORRIBLE sex.  And later in the book when Sinjun decides to "let" her husband hurt her, it's DISGUSTING.  Having a man force sex on a woman is NOT romantic!  Rewrite the book to take out the rape and I would love it
