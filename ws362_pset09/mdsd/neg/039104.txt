The history of the making of the Nancy Drew books is fascinating, and I did enjoy reading that part of this book.
However, the author simply could not keep her point of view (that the Nancy Drew authors and creators were modern feminists, showing the great big male world what women could do back then) when the facts simply did not support this point of view. The author even says that the writers SAY they didn't think they were being pioneering or feminists, yet, the author tells, us, even though they say there weren't, they are, and Rehak insists on it.
I can't understand how an editor could have allowed so much bias to enter into this book unless the editor, too, shared this slanted point of view.

So, read this book for the history, that part is fascinating. But take all the feminism with a grain of salt. Mildred Wirt Benson is a fasincinating lady, but her intention with Nancy Drew was simply to write a great story and earn a living. She was not trying to impress any men or show the male world that women rule, as the author seems to imply
