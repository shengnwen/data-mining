It's been a while since i read such a poor work like this one.I had my hopes when i started reading this book.But as i read it,i realized the author doesnt care about the reader because he never explains anything.He never explains who's who, what's what.He just describes what he's seeing but without troubling himself with explaining the reader important facts necesarry to understand.His narrative is dull and,simply put it,boring.It makes you wonder if the author was being punished and writing this book was his punishment.I never really understood what was going on in Spain at that time,nor did the author made any effort to explain it to you.I had to stop reading it at page 198 and then i tossed the book.I realized that explaining the different situations and turmoils of the Spanish Civil war is difficult but Mr Thomas just makes it more confusing.Right now i am reading Anthony Beevor's Spanish Civil War and,altough i am just on page 54, the book is good and with good and simple explanations as to what really happen in that war.Dont even bother with Mr Thomas' book
