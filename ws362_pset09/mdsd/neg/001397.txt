I am appalled that the publishers continue to pimp these books to lovers of Lillian Jackson Braun.  When you read these past few books, you are gradually disappointed more and more--and this one is the worst of the bunch.  I found the style annoying.  The book skims through the story.  It is sorely lacking in the rich details and characterizations that made the first 20 books so enjoyable.  When I finished this book--so short that it took me less than an hour and a half--I threw it across the room and into the trash.  What a waste of time and money.  There is no ending, the plot has promise--but is never explored in any quality or depth.  I think Quill should have eloped with Violet and ditched Platonic Prozac Polly and her evenings of sheer boredom. He needs a passionate affair--how long has he been in this sad relationship? The most interesting characters were ignored or forgotten.  I am done with this series.  I will just reread the first 20 and mourn what might have been..
