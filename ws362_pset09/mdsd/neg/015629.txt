This book is rife with inaccuracies.  Bonnie and Clyde were not killed May 23, 1935 but May 23, 1934.  Clyde's head was not "unrecognizable".  I've seen the autopsy photos and, he's a mess, but he still looks like Clyde.  Two lawmen, not three, were killed by the Barrow gang April 6, 1934.  There's no real evidence that Bonnie participated in the murders (the single eyewitness changed his story several times under police pressure).  Bonnie's famous "cigar pose" was left behind after the Joplin shootout on April 13, 1933 so the photo isn't from 1934 as our author claims.  And, the most glaring error, the Bonnie and Clyde ambush was arranged by Henry Methvin and his father Ivan, not W. D. Jones.  These are the errors I found on one (!) page of a 229 page book
