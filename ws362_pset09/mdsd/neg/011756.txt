I did not buy this book, but gave it a cursory review. Some reviewers complained about some absurd examples that this book uses. I think the problem is that the authors wrote this book as if the readers were all going to be dummies. It is common sense that anyone who is interested in an in-depth study of any subject, or anyone who just wants to try to understand the basics of a subject, will not buy a book with such an inappropriate title. In any case, I have been studying grammar for a while and the best books available for studying grammar are The Grammar Bible by Strumpf, The Elements of Style by White, and Grammar Smart by Princeton Review. The difference between these books the one written for "dummies" is that the authors don't beat around the bush with useless stories and sentences to try to retain the reader's attention; instead, all their comments are incisive, insightful, and very interesting. And let's face it, if you are not so interested in grammar, you might still buy this book for dummies but it's unlikely that you'll ever end up reading, or retaining (which is more important), the information contained within the book. In my opinion, anyone who wants to learn grammar but doesn't want to spend too much time on it is far better off getting a book that is as succinct as possible. Here is a hint: just the usage of the myriad of extra words in this book for dummies is already a bad lesson in grammar. It teaches one to use many unnecessary words, whereas an author like White relentlessly emphasizes the importance of brevity. His book so small that one can put it in a pocket, yet the information contained within the book is anything but too little
