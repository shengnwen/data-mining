This book should have either covered a narrower base, or covered it's broad base more carefully. Halfway through I realized that about the only point I really was getting was "the East hates the West, in particular the Muslims hate the Jews."  There were lots more specifics, but I didn't feel as if there was enough context for them to help. Instead the specific examples clouded the meaning for me and distracted me from the real theme.  I had to finish it because I read if for a class, but unless you have to read it...don't. You can find much better writing
