The pages in this book are unevenly cut. Customer support tells me that the publisher did this intentionally. It's incredibly annoying to read - difficult to get to the right page and it just doesn't feel right in my hands. Parker's work is, of course, exceptional - but find a copy of the old edition and steer clear of this one.
