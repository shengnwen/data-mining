Seth Lloyd thinks really big thoughts.  Like, "In addition to matter and energy, can we also think of the universe as being made up of information?"  

That puts Lloyd into pretty rare company right there, but there's more; he also has a great way with words and writes with a sense of humor.  This book is as heady as anything I've ever read, but Lloyd keeps it understandable and engaging for the layperson.

If this is sounding far better than two stars, it's because we haven't hit the downside yet - the book's structure; there isn't any.  It's almost like being in the head of a brilliant quantum physicist starting at one randomly selected point in time and finishing at another randomly selected point in time.  The good news is that our time there doesn't start earlier or end later; it really gets that old.

That's too bad, because Lloyd has so much going in his favor.  The topic seems to be there, but Lloyd doesn't seem to have decided what the point of the topic is.  Will quantum computers be very important and here's what you should know about how they calculate?  Is the universe more clearly understood when you look at it as a quantum computer?  Is there no God because the Universe as a quantum computer doesn't need one?

All these ideas are there in their nascent stages, but none become a central theme and none get developed to the point where they become really interesting to think about.

Good raw material gone to waste.  I'd almost like to see Lloyd start over with a central theme and write it again, because I think there's a REALLY good book (and quite possibly several) in this man's head
