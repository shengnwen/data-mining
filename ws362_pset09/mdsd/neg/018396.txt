No one could ever mistake JoAnna Carl for Joanne Fluke (writer of the Hannah Swenson Cookie Jar Series)! The character development was seriously lacking, the story was choppy, there was no emotion behind the words and it was not entertaining! The Chocolate facts between the chapters were the most interesting thing about the book but not really useful, they were more of a distraction than anything else
