Oh my! The positive, glowing reviews you will find initially posted here must be inventions of some publications relations firm! Read on and you will shorter, pithy, but achingly accurate reviews of what is a tortuous read.
The character are well developed although the Schizophrenia, John Hardin, is over the top and just plain ludicrous.  Except for engaging chapters in which a priest eludes pursuit by his father and Interpol the remaining chapters are like walking barefoot in sand with a one hundred pack. (no idea how I came up with that simile!)  Read The Great Santini or Prince of Tides.  This novel will bore you beyond tears
