There is so much wrong with this book its hard to put it in a short review.  Let me keep it objective and give just a few of the many, many inaccuracies that fill its pages.  First, this pompous tome refers to the movie "When Worlds Collide" as being based on the pulp fiction of the 1930's, when as everyone else knows it was based on the acclaimed novel of the same name by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer (the book is not even mentioned in the description of this classic film).  Another example of a clear disconnect with the material it claims as subject is the entry which describes the milieu of the film "Silent Running" as being in the "throes of a post-apocalyptic nightmare"  ruled by an authoritarian government.  This movie never makes reference to any such thing.  In fact the society is described by some of the characters as being idyllic.  But for me the last straw was the entry describing one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made,"The Thing from Another World".  It states that the movie is set in Antarctica, when actually it is (again, as the rest of us know) set in the Arctic (North Pole).  The entry then goes on to tell us that the researchers "thaw" the flying saucer when they accidentally blow it up, and that the Thing is found in the saucer (after it was thawed, of course), not in the ice.

My advice is that if you have not bought this book, don't!  If you have, throw it away.  It is worse than no good.  This book gives the term Encyclopedia a bad name.
