BB offers no meaningful insights into the securities industry. Like all businesses, there are various types, but he never once calls into question the very nature of the activity. As he is still in business, he does not want to offend the pantheon of interests that control OPM (Other People's Money). Among his comments:
1. Long only managers add value - some may. His friends? Who knows. But the vast majority are closet indexers.
2. Hedge Funds add value - this is dubious.
3. Funds of Funds add value - I TRIED to believe this one. But I can't. Not after BB describes his own diversification strategy. Its just another layer of diversification - and hence fees.

He does say that large asset management firms are run along business rather than investment principles. He worked at MSAM for 30 years. THEN he found religion? This is a convenient jailhouse conversion, now that he has a hedge fund.

There are several veiled comments that one is only TRULY successful unless one is worth $500. Ok Barton...I'm not worthy.

I have +10 years in the industry and am very aware of the conflicts of interest and outright crime that occurs on a daily basis. BB papers over all of this with bland platitudes and the help of a good editor
