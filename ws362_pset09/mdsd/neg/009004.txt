I wrote a detailed criticism/ critique of this book, but it didn't get published...??? So here's my concise re-review: The authour spends far too much time plugging his own web sites and software than giving deep suggestions and information. This book may be ok for novices w/ AdSense: a few good tidbits here and there, but frankly, you can get far better, far more reliable and far more UNBIASED information from Google's AdSense homepage and the myriad blogs etc. on AdSense. I'm very suprised that the overall feedback for this book was as high as it is! Save yourself the money, go to the source at Google directly
