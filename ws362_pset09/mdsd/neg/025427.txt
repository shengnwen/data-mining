He's a superb athelete, a hard worker and highly intelligent. But he's slick as he can be and contemptously refers to &quot;square Johns&quot; by which I think he means non-hustlers. He spent his Army career fixing sports events and participated in other dubious activities. The book is candid and moderately interesting but I have to admit, I wouldn't like to meet this man in person. He seems incapable of making an honest deal. Seems like he's gotta hustle everybody
