This book is actually worse than Lahaye's deeply disturbing and nonsensical "Rapture" series because it masquerades under the guise of "scholarship."

Of course the book it claims to be analyzing can only be proven true by refrencing passages in that book that claim that its true.

So, borrowing a tactic from our all knowing Heavenly Furher Jesus:

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS TRUE:
Christians are full of **** and shouldn't be allowed to publish books.

You read it so it must be true
