I had read all the rave reviews so was disappointed by my own experience.  I am a new-comer to multisport competition.  I found this book to be too much theory and not enough practicality; what was practical was presented in an incohesive way.  I could see this being good for the serious triathlete, but for me, I found better use out of Eric Harr's book and on the internet
