At only 96 pages, this crappy book is not much of an introduction to the geography, history, government, lifestyles, culture, and current issues of Costa Rica.  I would suggest another book, "Costa Rica : The Last Country the Gods Made" in lieu of this one, as it lives up to it's scope of topics. Aside from geology and social history, it covers the political and economic history of the country and emphasizes its liberal reformist tradition as exceptional in Central America
