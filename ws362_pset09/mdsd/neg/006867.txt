The book A Gathering of Days is a journal of a young England girl growing up facing some trials and tribulations.  The whole book consists of Catherine's journal entries about her happy, sad, and eventful life as a young child growing up in England in the 1800's.  The journal was given to her by her grandmother, which later Catherine passed down to her granddaughter.  Catherine experiences many difficult times as a child.  At the beginning of the book, Catherine's mother dies leaving her with her father and siblings.  Later in the story her dad remarries and Catherine has to get used to living with a new brother and step mom.  Her step mom teaches her many new things though that she never would have known, like quilting.  
	The whole narrative is told from Catherine's point of view.  She describes through her journal her feelings and emotions that she is going through as a child growing up.  The story is realistic in such a way that young girls or even children can connect with Catherine as they may be facing the same situations that she does.  By reading her journal, children can also see what is was like to grow up in England and compare it to their lives.  The author does an acceptable job of describing the characters so the reader is able to visualize them in their head.  The story though is a bit confusing because it is written like it was back in the 1800's.    
	The overall story was okay.  It was realistic in such a way because the reader could see what it was like growing up in England in the 1800's.  The reader could also connect with the main character as she describes her feelings and emotions.
