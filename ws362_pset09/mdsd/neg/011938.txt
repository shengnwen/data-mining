I am so sorry I hadn't taken the time to read the customer's reviews of Made in America and The Lost Continent, prior to buying them.  Frankly, I'm not sure which of these two books is more disappointing.  The only thing I was able to take away from them was the idea that Bill Bryson thinks hammering and bashing anything North American (USA only) is considered extremely good fun and humorous
