This book is easily categorized, and is best judged with an understanding of that category.  'Visualizing' is a book aimed at popular fan readership and is thus what has been called a a &quot;fannish&quot; book.  That is not necessarily a qualitative statement, but it does set certain parameters.  One need only look through the table of contents, what with chapters on 'Happy Hobbit Holidays,' 'Dear Gandalf' letters modeled on Dear Abby letters, an entire chapter on whether or not Balrogs have wings, to understand the direction and intended audience of this book.  The author is an energetic fan of Tolkien and participates on numerous web-sites that discuss various fan issues of Tolkien's works.  He is also a fan of 'Zena, Warrior Princess,' and participates regularly in Sci-Fi/Fantasy Gaming conventions.  The book clearly reflects interests of this nature.  There is, however, very little real scholarship to be found in 'Visualizing Middle Earth'.  The book, as has been pointed out, is a collection of on-line essays, most from a popular Tolkien fan website that the author administers.  Martinez delves very little into the academic and literary sources behind Tolkien's work, and when he does attempt to do so it becomes clear that he is an amateur scholar in the field of literature.  I recommend this book to the many young men and women of highschool age (or those adults who still play D&amp;D on the weekends) who want to explore the popular ideas to be found in 'The Lord of the Rings', but I would urge serious students of Tolkien criticism to look elsewhere.  See Tom Shippey's 'Tolkien, Author of the Century', for instance
