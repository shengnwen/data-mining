Luckily I bought this book used and paid very little for it. 

The content of the book is good and I keep it on the shelf as reference, it's nice to be able to look up specific topics and the sections are usually short and to the point.

My major complaint is that the much touted DVD that comes with the book is, for all intents and purposes, USELESS.  In the book he references a file or where that file is on the DVD... and there is no such file or folder on the DVD. After my third attempt at looking for a file I realized this and had I not paid so little for the book I would have returned it instantly. 

As I said, the content seems good but the disk makes you crazy and neither the author's website nor the publisher's make any attempt to apologize for this or give you the option to acquire the files on-line. I would only purchase this book used if at all.
