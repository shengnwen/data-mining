Tompkins book is a good list of the works of those who have researched the pyramid themselves.  To make use of the varied and stimulating ideas he reiterates, it's necessary to go to his sources.  I'd advise starting with Smyth if you can put up with his religeous overtones.  Overall a light read, but well done
