About 8 months ago, during a very bad "flu-experience", I had a great afternoon reading all the negative reviews on 'The Alchemist' and this little gem. And although I was warned, I just HAD to find out for myself (some stubborn people just never learn, do they): could this book really be as awful as these reviewers said it is? And the answer is YES. 

The story is utterly predictable and boring. The characters and plotline are as thin as the paper this book is printed on. As a writer, Coelho totally lacks a sense of humour. 

To top it all, Coelho has added a few 'exercises', to help the reader with his/her own spiritual development. Perhaps the most stupid one of them all was to pour some water on a non-water-absorbing flat surface (e.g. a table top), and to dabble about with your fingers in this self-created puddle. I can't even remember what Coelho claimed the effect would be, but it would be a very deep, spiritual and revealing experience. If this appeals to you, please buy as many of his books as you like. You will probably love them. If, like me, just the thought of doing this silly exercise makes you laugh (or cry, depending on your mood), please stay away from this author. His books are just as deep and spiritual and revealing as this puddle.
