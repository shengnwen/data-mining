I only read about 25% of the sections. I did not proceed because every section I read was astonishingly shallow. Either nothing at all would be stated on a subject or extreme statements would be made with no back up reasoning what-so-ever. For example Mr Burrows says that all types and alloys of steel have equal rigidity in bicycle frames and anyone that claims otherwise "is a liar." This contradicts all the data about different qualities of the variety of steels. Maybe Burrows is right but he gives no supporting evidence at all. In other instances he will be wordy on a subject, send the reader to another publication sometimes stating "if you can find it available" -- This about steering and trail in the chapter dedicated to handling. About handling he concludes "tyre size is not so important... Wheelbase is unimportant and neither are angles or fork rake ... there are no good bikes just good riders. And I should know, because I'm crap on all bikes." This is an exact quote from page 35
