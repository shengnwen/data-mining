Look at the world economy, Toyota just passed Ford in US, Sony is doing very good, even they make the dead-Ericson alive, look at Kodak, Panasonic, Honda, Japon Tobacco Ind, Seiko....
They all do excellent/very good, except a few industries as pharmetucals and FMCG, where US or Loreal gets all the profit from dumb products...

What is the reason for this? If you have some money to spend for nothing read this book, and read "Mind of Strategist" from Ohmae, and compare both of these books... 

you will see the answer of the first paragraph above: US is dealing with theory and Japan with excellent execution. 

This book is so theoretical that, almost none of the things mentioned are applicable. The critical thing is, even this book does not show how to think, since the writers are so much involved in theoretical aspects of strategy/game theory, in their offices at the universities that, applicability is dying in united states..

as told, there are some categories still US dominates, in belgium huge profits is done in pharmacy/beauty care products, as other US companies do in europe, (except Germany, Russia, UK, where Lever and Henkel is more powerful).

but all dying, thanks to theorical works as Co-opetition. As I told, please read Ohmae, and compare those books. The difference is so significant.  
I do not know why this book get so much good comment, it can be due to positioning/image. But nothing inside.
