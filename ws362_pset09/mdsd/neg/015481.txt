I read this book, which I understand is also a prime inspiration for "The Secret" -- just another variation on the old "name it and claim it" philosophy which pollutes American spirituality.  When those of you who buy this stuff start working to attract better living for others, THEN I will be impressed.  For now, all this is just a variation on snake oil salesmen, as far as I'm concerned.

I'm glad I got this book for free, because what I paid is precisely what it's worth
