While I bought this book expecting an &quot;engaging and erudite&quot; insight into the biological causes behind human behavior, I ended up getting one scientist's narrow perspective.  Although the concept of the  book is promising, its goals would perhaps be better served in a  multi-author collection of essays.  This book, written by a researcher of  primate stress and its effects on their behavior, might be better titled  &quot;What Baboons do in their Spare Time and Some Obscure Connections to  Humans&quot;
