Between sending our country to war over false pretenses (ie; Bush's personal greed), terrible response to Hurricane Katrina, this whole anti-gay thing, and the failure that was No Child Left Behind, I'd have to say that Bush is not a very good leader. That and the guy can't seem to acknowledge 
BTW, I myself am not gay but see nothing wrong with it. If you can see it in no other way, the gays might strike back, the way the blacks reacted to whites (and believe me, they had a good reason to) when they were being treated like crap in the '60's. So unless you want riots through your city, you'll at least try to be tolerant. This goes out to all you anti-gay people. And remember; Don't hate people without logical reason! (See, I have good reasons to hate Bush!
