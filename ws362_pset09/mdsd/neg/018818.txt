I'll admit right out that I am only a student (college) and still (relatively) new to studying the history of the conflict, but with that said believe that this book was given the wrong title.  The title leads you to believe that maybe finally there has been an unbiased book written about the conflict that will refute both sides stories and give you some truth, but all I seem to find is information that discredits the Arab side of the story, leaving it extremely one-sided.  I believe that this book in the wrong hands has the potential to produce some violent anti-Arab behavior.  Look at the chapter devoted to Arabs threatening Jews, you could just as easily fill a chapter with Jews threatening Arabs, but what positive effect will that have?

For those of you in my position, just started out researching the topic and maybe still a bit naive, it is my recommendation to stay away from this book.  It is easy for some to fall into the trap of either anti-Semitism or anti-Arab sentiments and this book is only an invitation for the latter.
