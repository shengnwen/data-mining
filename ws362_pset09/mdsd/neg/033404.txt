I found this book to be uproariously hilarious.  This book is some sort paranoid fantasy about the &quot;Illuminati&quot; (the conspiracy that rules the world).  Mr. Kinman's "work" attempts to give an overview of the history of the organization, as well as its goals for the future.  There were two major problems with this book.  The first was the internal inconsistencies.  He contradicts himself systematically, both in minor details and in major concepts.  The other problem is the writing.  It is unclear and imprecise, and poorly edited.  In short, this would be exactly the person whom the Illuminati would allow to write about themselves
