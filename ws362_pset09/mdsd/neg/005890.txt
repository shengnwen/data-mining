Look I enjoyed the book a lot, but got nearer and nearer to the end and noticed the plot wasn't wrapping up.  I got that awful sinking feeling that I had been suckered into a book without a good ending, without closure, which I HATE.  Sure enough!  At the bottom of the last page they *FINALLY* admit "Armageddon's Children ends here.  The story will continue with the publication of Terry Brooks's next novel."

NOWHERE on the front cover, back cover or ANYWHERE ELSE but on the last page does it mention this.  I hate being manipulated, and that's why I gave the book one star, and why the publisher Del Ray/Ballantine Books will never get another cent from me
