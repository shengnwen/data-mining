this may be more of a customer satisfaction issue.  AN Wilson is a bit of a wandering writer, but my issue is really with the physical condition of the copy I received.  Listed as "Very Good" I received a copy with yellow pages, several creases and a tear in the cover, long hairs in the book, and writing throughout.  not my idea of "Very Good" condition.
