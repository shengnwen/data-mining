I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read.

There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school.

Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it
