The story starts well, and drags you in, you can't help but start to like the characters.  Among other reasons, thats why I had such a hard time  with this story.  I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief.  There are several parts of this book where as I was reading I simply had to say, huh?  

The overall romance and story is enjoyable enough.  I simply wish the author could have changed a few minor plots, and perhaps removed or altered a few scenes to make the story more believable
