Alan Lomax's contributions to American music are enormous. His field recordings and archives are the foundation of the American Songbook. But he's a terrible writer, and this book is practically unreadable. There are some great interviews with Delta singers and musicians, but they're embedded in page after page of Lomax's lousy prose. If you really want to know about this music, skip the book and buy the CD, which is a phenomenal collection of blues, gospel &amp; work songs Lomax recorded in the South in the 1930s and 40s. The music says it all much more authentically and eloquently than Lomax's words can possibly convey. God bless him, but he should have stuck to the tape recorder and thrown his typewriter away
