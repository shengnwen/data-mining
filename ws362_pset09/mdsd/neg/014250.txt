Zoe Heller tells the story of three obessions. The first is the desperately lonely spinster, Barbara Covett, who longs for companionship. The second is the bourgeois bohemian, Sheba Hart, who goes into teaching because she wants to be loved,and because she lives in our time, confuses love with sex, and the third is the author herself who seems to believe that only a terrible person could say terrible things about other people, especially children. Barbara, Heller's brilliantly drawn protagonist, sees through all the "care and share" rubbish put out by the striving headmaster and her moronic colleagues. She knows whereof she speaks when she sums up the barbarous behaviour of the kids, but the author won't let that stand, so she turns this magnificent misanthrope into a monster. The "battle axe" is made out to be exactly that, a battle axe, whose predatory lesbianism distracts the reader from her hard earned insights. By turning her into a disturbed stalker, readers will not gain from what she no doubt actually was, namely, a strict, disciplined teacher who knew that being nice is not a viable strategy for dealing with today's benighted youth. If readers were asked to deal with this instead of the author's witches brew of sexual repression, something really scary would be revealed, namely the fact that it is the adults who have to change and not the kids, and the "battle axe" provides us our only hope
