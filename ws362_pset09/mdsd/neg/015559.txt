I took a chance on this book and - wow - it's awful. I'm going to be returning it to Amazon. 

The "flip chart" design is a real pain! And - because of the weird design - a lot of the recipes have no picture.

I'm still looking for the perfect "cupcake" book. This is not it!

Save yourself the hassle of having to send it back and try to look at this one at a bookstore first
