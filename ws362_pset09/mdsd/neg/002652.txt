The book analyses the subjects at an amateur level and it is lacking in content. As a necessity of my doctoral dissertation I bought it and regret.The letter fonts are unnecessarily too big; according to me the real  volume should be about 175 pages.Photographs and drawings(plan, etc.)are  inadequate and print quality is not good.I was expecting a satisfying book
