I was very disappointed with the authors obviously biased view of the LDS religion.  The authors stated at the first of the book that most of their research was conducted doing interviews, which shows their lack of true knowledge about how the church works.  In describing the sacred temple ordinances in the church they obviously relied on some disgruntled and attention seeking ex-mormons for information, because the information was totally and without question wrong!  I think the authors were on a witch hunt of the Mormon Church.  They constantly protrayed the church as being the guilty party in this when it was one or two sick men that cheated and lied to make money.  Just because one person, that happens to be a member of the church, does something wrong, doesn't make the church responsible.  That one person can't speak for the whole church, but these authors obviously thought they could.  The only good part of the book is that it does have a lot of information on the history of what happened.  My suggestion to the authors in the future, stick to writing about what happened, not your feelings about one group or the other.  This was a very biased and unfair protrayal of the Mormon religion, I feel sorry for those of you that read this book and get a very distorted view of this religion.
