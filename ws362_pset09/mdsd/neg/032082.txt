If you are that "Dummy" who wants to know how to build a web-site, then this is not the book for you. It tells you hardly how to build, it tells more about links which can help you making your web-site look more cool. You have to have some HTML cq Dreamweaver experience to understand the context of what the writer wants to clarify.
By reading the book and going through the enclosed CD Rom with ty-out software, I soon came to the conclusion that the title of the book is somewhat misleading. See comments above why.

If you are that "Dummy" who has not a single thread of  knowledge about building web-sites, then do NOT buy this book.
Not giving it 1 star (but I was close), there are some interesting chapters in this reference giude, but typing what you want to have inside your web-site (links and related web-sites with loads of info what comprises around 50% of the book). you will get the same information from any search engine.

Recommendation: concentrate first on a book, that teaches you the basic HTML-programming language, continue then with either a Dreamweaver/FrontPage manual. You're much better off..
