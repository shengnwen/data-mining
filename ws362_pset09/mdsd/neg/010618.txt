John Haught's concern, in his book "Deeper than Darwin" to convince us that science and religion cannot only co-exist, but can co-exist without relegating either the former or the latter to second chair. 

He tries to explain this by arguing that the two may well simply be interpretations of the world 'on different levels.' To show how 'different levels' of interpretation are possible, he resorts to metaphor. Just like social issues can be explained in terms of psychology, economics, politics, biology, etc. (each interpretation being right on its own level of explanation) he agues that science and religion can also do this. 

But this is where Haught's coherence ends. Nowhere does he give much of an explanation as to what the "deeper" level that religion supposedly gets to. Nowehere does he address the question of how, as the Bible (and other holy books) make historical predictions that can be checked by science (many already disproven), the two are not at odds.

What's more, Haught gives no reason to suppose that religion occupying a "deeper" realm than science is anything short of the kind of Gouldian "non-overlapping mysteria" he writes so sternly against! If he means something different, he never made it explicit in the book. We are constantly left guessing what "deeper" might actually mean. 

Lastly, Haught seems to resort a decent amount to the "god of the gaps" idea that he, again, rails so much agianst in the Intelligent Design movement. Science hasn't explained x, he exclaims, and might not be able to. Therefore, religion should supplant science here. But that is EXACTLY what ID is. 

In brief, this book needs to be rethought. The ideas need to be presented more explicitly (rather than every paragraph seeming to be a rehash of the one that came before). Haught never quite gets to the point and (maybe) because of that, fails to offer anything convincing; his only offer is poetic prose.
