For many years, Middle East departments of American universities including Columbia have provided intentionally fake and fraudulent education on Middle East problem and history to American students. 
The Table below lists major milestones of the Middle East history and demonstrates that long before Arabs came in Palestine, there were Jewish states and Jerusalem was a capital of one of them.  In 1917-18, British army with Jewish contingents liberated the Holy Land (Palestine) from the Turks. During the WWII, Palestinian Arab clerics contacted Hitler and asked him to exterminate Palestinian Jews. There prove, that Jews lived there before creation of the state of Israel in 1948.  
The 1964 PLO Charter addressed to UN used term "Palestinian Arabs" and PLO did not claim Judea, Samarea (so called West Bank), and Gaza their territories.  The term and national group "Palestinians" have been invented some time after 1967 by Arabs who fooled the entire world because the world would like to be fooled.  They also invented a fable that Jews never lived in Palestine.
In 2003, Dr. Nabil Hilmi, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Al-Zaqaziq, together with a group of Egyptian expatriates in Switzerland were preparing an enormous lawsuit against all the Jews of the world.  They blamed Israelites, who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC, of stealing gold from Egypt.  In other word, Dr. Nabil Hilmi and his colleague acknowledged that all Jews of the world are decedents of those Israelites who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC and, therefore, have a legitimate right for entire Palestinian land.
