The writer's English is better than my Chinese.  Unfortunately, the editor's English is not very good, and this author has been poorly served (I think)in both line editing (grammar and style) and whatever kind of editing would have made the prose flow and actually convey information. It reads like a term paper by a not terribly bright high school student, who has not tried to synthesize the information found in various articles on the Internet.  Admittedly Tea and Chinese Culture is a big subject, and even discussing Chinese culture is perhaps as bogus as discussing 'European culture.' There have been a lot of cultures over a long period of time.  They are not served by flat sentences like "Sichuan teahouses played an important role in spreading information. The local people went to teahouses not only to drink tea, but also to exchange information.  The most important function of the teahouses was that people could chat with each other there (p 73)." And on. And on.  

The layout, binding, and typeface are nice, but too many of the illustrations have feathered edges for my taste. When the author refers to an important painting or teapot (p 59), it would have been nice to see either of them. The illustrations that appear are not always related to the text.

Reading this book irritated me. It's not good enough to have even a veneer of scholarship and not  entertaining enough for a coffeetable.  The sadly OOP book, The Chinese Art of Tea by John Blofeld, is better even at three times the price
