I wonder how Christians would like a book called "Anthropology for Muslim Witness" or "Anthropology for Hindu Witness"?  That is how all anthropologists will feel about this book.  Anthropology is not for anybody's "witness."  It is to witness the diversity of culture and religion itself.  Anthropology is not designed or intended to impose one culture or religion on another.  In fact, that is the very opposite and antithesis of anthropology. Anthropology is a science and a method for understanding and valuing other cultures on their own terms, not "witnessing" your own culture to them. And that is what one's own culture or religion is--just one more culture or religion in the pageant of human cultural and religious diversity.  This book is a travesty, as are all such attempts to bastardize anthropology in the service of the most anti-anthropological causes
