It's an entertaining book, it's a pity that the author has appearently done his research at 'Something Somebody Said Once University'.

The number of history blunders, plain falsehoods, and misinterpetations is staggering. It's a shame, because Mr. Allen has a great style. Not reccomended at all, I'm afraid
