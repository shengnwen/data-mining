This is a story book!  I usually give books the benefit of the doubt but this book flat out sux.  All this guy talks about is how he is some hot shot sports agent and the lessons he supposedly learned through the years.  Let me tell you something, this book got old after the 2nd chapter.  Every F'in paragraph has to do with one of his golf clients and bla bla bla.  Its ridiculous.  The title is true, they dont teach this at Harvard because they're stories of an individuals life which completely put me to sleep.  But im not going to leave without giving some positives, like saying you should check out Automatic millionaire and the 12 critical factors books.  Those are worth reading.  Peace in the middle east
