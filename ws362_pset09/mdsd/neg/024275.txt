I was extremely offended by the author's disrespect towards his subject, not to mention bored to tears by his dusty writing-style. This book was written eighty years ago by a man who consistently belittles the spiritual beliefs of all non-christian peoples, and refers to the buddhist, taohist, and hindu cultures as being childish, pathetic, silly and to be pitied and ridiculed on many levels. His attitude towards dragons is nothing if not derisive. Do not be taken in by the book-jacket review and the playful cover. If you want a book tracking the rise of dragon worship throughout the world, but with little to no historical folklore, than this is your book. But if you are looking forward to reading entertaining dragon lore from around the globe, than this is NOT what you are looking for
