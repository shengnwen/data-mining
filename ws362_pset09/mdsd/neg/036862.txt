The 2 stars are strictly for the London portion of Rosie's life - which has much of Fielding's talent for humor in romance.  But as soon as Rosie's story gets serious, it fails.  Granted, as other reviewers pointed out, most of us reading this were attracted by the fact that Helen Fielding is the author.  But she had a way to go before she honed the skills that made Bridet Jones so enjoyable to read.
