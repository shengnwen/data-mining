Unfortunately, I must agree with B. Brazy. I've read all of Jo Beverley's Regency and Georgian titles and she is a superb writer. First, the premise that Mara (who has known Dare all her life) suddenly decides she's in love with him strains all believability. Then, she decides she'll be the one to rescue him from himself like he's some sort of project. Oh, by the way, overnight, Dare decides he's in love with her, too. Why? I didn't find Mara spunky, I found her incredibly silly, and annoying. 

Dare's struggle with his addition would have been such a strong story if he'd had a strong, mature heoine by his side, and if the Eastern element of the plot involving Feng Ruyuan and and mysterious Mr. Salter had been fully developed. What could have been an intense, moving, incredible love story was treated with the fluff of the light-hearted romps so prevalent in Regencies these days.
