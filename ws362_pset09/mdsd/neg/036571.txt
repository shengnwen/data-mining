I bought this book based on customer reviews and was disappointed.  I found not only the look to be dated but the information as well.  He actually reccomends kneeing your dog in the chest to break him of jumping  up.  This is preferable to stepping on his toes because that would be  harder for the owner to maneuver-Too militaristic/barbaric for me
