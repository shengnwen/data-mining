Terry Pratchett's only written four bad books of which I am aware. This, I suppose, is a sign of genius -- when your work is so consistently good that a small slip-up is so glaringly obvious. It doesn't help Carpe Jugulum, though.

The Witches are the least interesting of Pratchett's sub-worlds, since Granny Weatherwax is simply too confident and sure of herself for us to really believe that anything can threaten her. Her cohorts are simply not as funny or interesting as Death's family, the University Wizards, or the Night Watch.

The storyline here is also something we've seen many times before; something strange and modern is invading the Discworld, and the native forces have to oppose it. In this case, the threat is a bunch of vampires who play by modern rules instead of traditional; they like garlic, they ignore holy symbols, and so forth. The Witches mobilize to oppose them using a combination of clever tricks (which don't really make sense) and blind optimism (basically just hoping something lucky will happen). The subplots involve the arrival of an Omnian revivalist in Lancre, some strange avian life, and a bit more of the fairy-tale cliché from Witches Abroad; none of these subplots actually go anywhere.

Really, this is the exact same plot as Lords and Ladies, but not as well executed. It's still not Pratchett's worst (that's hands-down Fifth Elephant) but it's certainly nearly as much fun to read as his other works
