God is so busy lashing us with hurricanes, terrorists, tsunami's, that I think it would be well near impossible to shower us with miracles.  Why would He want to?  According to the Rev., God is plenty sore at us.  Pat should stick to being God's weatherman/hitman/prophet of doom.  That just seems to fit a guy like Pat Robertson so well.  Especially when he can grin so well while he's doing it
