Sadly, James Spader's voice couldn't save "Strange Highways."  The story is a good idea that just went wrong and the writing isn't that good either.  The similes are clich-ish, and bits of vocabulary are dropped into the story which just don't fit.  The protagonist is so slow on the up-take, when faced with repeated evidence of supernatural experiences, that he should've been killed just to end his rampant stupidity.
