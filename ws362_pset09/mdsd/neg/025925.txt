I had to read this book for an anthropology class taught by an intelligent but uberfeminist professor.  There's an important point in this book that sheds light on its angle: when a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and full coverings was asked how she can walk around in the heat dressed in such a manner she responds something to the effect of "it's not as hot as the fires of hell."  Mernissi is not about to challenge behaviors that are dictated by Islamic scriptures.  Her argument is that the veil and woman's place in the Muslim society are a result of misinterpretation of the scriptures and the hadith.  This is sort of akin to Christians trying to reinterpret creation as an instructive myth after Darwin shattered the fundamentalist vision of creation.  I think Mernissi's approach is generally doomed because, if tradition has failed to maintain the original spirit of a religion, a new analysis almost 1500 years after the fact is almost certainly doomed.  There are too many epistemological problems with diving the original intentions behind a text that is so old.  Mernissi may convince some readers that her radically new interpretation is correct but only at the cost of introducing uncertainty and mistrust in the traditions themselves. Fatally wounding relgious traditions is nearly a fatal wound to the religion itself, and will only cause apathy or fundamentalist overreaction to a challenge of the status quo
