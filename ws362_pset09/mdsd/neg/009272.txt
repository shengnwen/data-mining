Having suffered 2 major depressive episodes in the last 6 years, I can assure those who swallow Breggin's nonsense hook, line and sinker that nobody could have "talked" me back to anything resembling "health."  The mental anguish I suffered during those episodes was unbearable and waiting for a quack like Breggin to use psychoanalysis or some other form of talk therapy to provide any relief would have taken far too long.  Financial and insurance considerations aside, talk therapies alone are simply too slow to achieve positive results.

No doubt pharmaceutical companies often drive treatment trends in a highly questionable manner both via perks to MD-psychiatrists and (the increasingly obnoxious) practice of direct advertising of prescription drugs to the public.  Nevertheless, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety meds and sleep aids HELP relieve the suffering quickly, which is what medicine should be all about, not ideology.

Only one of Breggin's points is valid, and that is the disturbing trend for nearly all MD-psychiatrists to focus on psycho-pharmacology to the exclusion of psychotherapy.  The current treatment model has the patient seeing a psychiatrist for meds management typically quarterly while also seeing a psychologist for psychotherapy anywhere from weekly to monthly.  It would seem that "one stop shopping" would not only make things more convenient for patients, but competence in multiple therapies would also make for a more effective and insightful professional.  Use meds to stablize the patient and minimize the suffering, then pursue cognitive and other talk therapies to provide coping skills and attack the environmental and experiential contributors to the disease.
