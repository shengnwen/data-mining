I disliked the violence Jacques occasionally displayed towards Shea, with his 'insanity' serving as an excuse.  Particularly in the scenes at the beginning of the book, such as where Jacques meets his brother again, the abuse was too much to ever allow Jacques to be a likeable, or even tolerable, character.  This was my least favourite of all her Dark series books
