Early on the author tells how he proved to concept of "learned helplessness" through his experiments where he administered electric shocks on caged dogs until they gave up and just lay there and whimpered.

I threw the book away at that point.  This "scientist" shouldn't be rewarded for his senseless cruelty that proves nothing.  We don't support your science, Herr Doctor Seligman!

Get the book from a library if you must, but don't reward him for his "experiments."  It could have been your dog this moral idiot experimented on
