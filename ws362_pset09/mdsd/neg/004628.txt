Joseph Ellis is a learned, competent Revolutionary era historian. While this book is a fine introduction to Washington's role in the Revolutionary War era and beyond, it doesn't approach the caliber of David McCullough's John Adams or Edmund Morris' The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. Ellis seems to lack the sympathy and insight necessary for a good biography. He doesn't seem to understand Washington - he doesn't get us into his head, relying instead on historical narrative. Ellis also misses opportunities to bring out more of Washington's character. Admittedly, part of the problem of interpreting Washington is that Washington manipulated his public image, acutely aware that it would endure to all generations. The Great W. was scrupulous about his private life. But rather than admitting this paucity of information and pointing to the gaps in our understanding, Ellis attempts to paper it over. His prose style, attempting conversation, yet creaks with scholarly habit.
I bought this book, relying on the stellar recommendations here on Amazon, but it seems I must wait for a great tour of the mind of this great leader
