Jones belongs to that school of thought that believes behind every failure of a system, or every historical cycle, there lies a guilty party. This search for conspirators is the sort of thing that generally leads to pogroms and inquisitions.

Jones doesn't have any particular ideas of his own, but he has handily summarized some books that appeal to him, showing both a lack of imagination, and an inability to distinuguish fiction from fact, a la his enthusiastic endorsement of a well-known and long-ago exposed hoax.

If you're the sort of person who enjoys this type of fictional romp through current events, I imagine you'll enjoy Jones and his Readers Digest approach to world dynamics. More discerning readers would do well to look elsewhere
