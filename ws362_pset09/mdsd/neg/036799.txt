I am extremely disappointed in "The Inside Ring" by Mike Lawson.  Injecting his personal political views into the book as a way of adding current events into a fiction book has made this unreadable.  I did not select his book to read his political views.

Page 21 - Reference to Dixie Chicks
Page 28 - Reference to the "invisible weapons of mass destruction
