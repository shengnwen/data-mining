First, despite what the socialist apologists tell you, Walter Rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some co-conspirators out of prison.  Only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding walkie-talkies.  Come on.  It exploded in his lap for goodness sake.  Mark Hoffman tried that defense and it didn't get him anywhere either.

Second, championing the cause of the poor, which Rodney admittedly did, is not the same as actually helping them, or even more important for HEUA, being a perceptive scholar.  Rodney's book is riddled with distortions, fallacies and unsubstantiated premises.  One glaring example.  Rodney pays practically zero attention to Mediterranean Africa.  For him, only sub-Saharan Africa is the "real" Africa.  Why?  Because his natural ethnic affinity for the area.  Nothing wrong with that, but then again, you shouldn't title your book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" but rather "How Europe Underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa." Rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman, a straw man, or almost anything other than the truth: Africa's problems arise from its residents, not from outside forces.  And spouting Marxist dogma isn't going to change that fact.  It was known 25 years ago; it's known a fortiori now
