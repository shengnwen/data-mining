One has to know and understand the original German text of the Dreigroschenoper to be really able to judge the quality of the English translations. This one, used among others by Helen Schneider on her album  with Weill songs, has nothing of the sarcasms of the German lyrics. Better  read the 1954 translation of Marc Blitzstein or the translation made by  Frank McGuinness in the early 1990s
