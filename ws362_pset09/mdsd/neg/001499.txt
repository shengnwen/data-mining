What a disappointment.  I was expecting a great story about sibling rivalry and instead a pseudo murder mystery where the most interesting character was killed within the first several pages.

The sisters, Francesca (smart) and Amanda (pretty) inherit the coffee shop once owned by their deceased parents. They are having a hard time making a go of it, especially when a Starbuck's-like mammoth of a coffee shop sets up shop down the street.

Enter Clarissa, a student at NYU who has big plans for the store and soon is bulldozing her way through everyone.  She decides that the way to drum up business is to have a Mr. Coffee contest and sets about finding hunks to enter the contest.  When the guy that gets chosen as their coffee hunk is found dead, a murder mystery ensues.

Meanwhile, Francesca takes up with the runner up, a model, who she questions as to why he finds her attractive, and wonders why he is not chasing Amanda.  Lots of red herrings are tossed at you, but there really is not a lot of suspense in the end.

In addition to solving the murder, they also discover what really happened to their parents and get closure on their loss.  Save your $10 and check this one out of the library.
