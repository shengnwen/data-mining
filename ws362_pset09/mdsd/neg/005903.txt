I picked up this book for a quick, enjoyable suspense read. Unfortunately, the book only annoyed me. There are many male authors out there who do a decent job writing from a woman's perspective. Patterson is NOT one of them. He took every stereotype of a woman and combined them to create these four women. It was extremely disappointing that the main character was supposed to be a strong, female lead was so stupid that her bright ideas constantly "surprised" everyone, including her. The plot was very predictable, the characters were not fleshed out, and the storyline was boring. This was the first Patterson book I've read...it will probably be the last.
