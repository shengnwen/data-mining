There's nothing in this book that could not be learned during one hour net-surfing the more mundane, hum-drum satsang sites on offer.

Nick "Arjuna" Ardagh is first and foremost a new-age entrepreneur not a true spiritual writer.

His latest book reads like piece of vanity marketing for those quoted. However, it fails to go anywhere but to the superficial which is exactly what we don't need.

Arjuna is reasonable at spotting conceptual trends but is not sio able to follow them to their conclusion i.e real freedom. Just see any of his video presentations over the past few years. This book is any no-brainer with little practical value.

I'd recommend any books by Lee Lozowick, Adi Da, Dave Oshana or Lobsang Rampa over Nick's latest offering
