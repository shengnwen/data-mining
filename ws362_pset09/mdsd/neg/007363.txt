I was disappointed with this book.  There were a few worthwile tips (such as going to bed early to take advantage of the more productive morning hours) but mostly the author solved her problems by throwing money at them.  If I could pick anywhere in the country I wanted to live, buy $700 coats and hire people to run all my errands, hey, I'd be organized too!  As for "simplicity"....there is nothing here that anyone with even a passing familiarity with the simplicity movement would recognize
