Don't waist your money.  From cover to cover Larry Sontag tells about who is watching and how these evil men will use this information against you.  I wouldn't mind that if he gave one useful bit of information on how to avoid the problem.  I would recommend "How To Be Invisible" by J.J. Luna or "Bulletproof Privacy" by Boston T. Party (although it is out of date, he still gives good advice.)  Also "You and the Police" by Boston T. Party is a valuable read
