What so many other reviewers are saying about the slavish similarities to--and sometimes outright copying of--Lord of the Rings are right on the mark. True, Brooks dresses his world up differently, and adds few original touches (some of which aren't bad), but in the end this story simply fails to deliver anything new or even anything worth the time it takes to get through the 700+ pages of poorly-wrought prose. As John Gardner once said, it takes an authentic junk mind to write junk fiction, and the poor quality of the sequel bears testimony that Brooks doesn't improve a great deal after his debut novel.

It's a pity, really, because Brooks's conceit of placing his fantastic tales in the far future might have provided a counterpoint to Tolkien's placing his own stories in the distant past. The races of man Brooks invents (apparently "human" is different than "man") have some potential, but they just slip into the silliest stereotypes as soon as they appear on the page. The world his characters inhabit looks large on the map, but apparently it can be traversed without any great difficulty on foot in less than a week. I got the sense that Brooks is the kind of person with a lot of ideas but without the tools to make them work. J.K. Rowling does a much better job juggling her multitudinous creations.

As mentioned earlier, I did go on to read the sequel, "The Elfstones of Shannara," based on the insistence that Brooks gets better as he goes. Maybe that's true 10-15 novels down the line, but "Elfstones" is even weaker than the first novel, probably because he made up the plot himself rather than stealing a better plot from a better writer. Don't bother with either one unless you have low standards and a lot of time to kill
