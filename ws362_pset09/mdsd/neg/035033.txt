I used this book for my second course in fluid mechanics, and I thought it was terrible. THe chapters are not organized very well, the example problems aren't presented effectively, and this problems at the ned of the chapter are not well written, as well as this book contains many errors. I don't reccommend this text to other students; I would use Munson&Okishi 's text for undergrads
