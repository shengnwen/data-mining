I see that some readers had good results from this book while others were frustrated. I'm afraid I'm in the latter category. Being new to the whole .NET world, I lack the experience to fill in the blanks regarding details the author omits. I have been unable to see any of the sample meshes, or to get the compiler to locate the DirectX classes. Based on other reviewers' comments, it's clear that these things are possible, but one cannot achieve them by following the instructions in the book. 

I don't question the author's qualifications. I think the difficulty lies with the publisher. For hands-on tutorial material, especially when it is aimed at beginners, it is important to do a real hands-on review prior to publication. It isn't sufficient to edit the text for grammatical errors and leave it at that. Had the publisher actually tried to use the book, they would have encountered the same problems as I and others have encountered within the first 15 minutes. It is not acceptable to approve tutorial material for publication unless and until it has been verified accurate and usable by the intended audience. I will be very cautious about purchasing books from Sams Publishing henceforth
