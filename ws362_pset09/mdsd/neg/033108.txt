I first heard about this boys are stupid throw rocks at them from a girl who had a crush on me.  She kept hitting on me even though I never showed any interest in her and I didn't understand why she was so obsessed with me since I didn't do anything to lead her on.  She was getting pretty annoying to say the least.  Then I found this book in her room and it all started making sense to me.  The book was hilarious!  Just thinking about all of the losers who are into this stuff makes me glad i'm no longer around her.  There are plenty of good women out there.  I don't need one that will throw rocks at me simply because I don't want to be her boyfriend.
