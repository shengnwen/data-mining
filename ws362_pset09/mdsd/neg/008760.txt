One thing is sure, Steven Griffith has not done a lot of research before writing this book. Actually anyone could have written this. It lacks of research like a survey of the current users, facts and figures, the impact on management and businesses, concrete examples not invented ones... I read it in one hour and learnt nothing new. The author just applies to emails what Dale Carnegie wrote about the basics of communication some 70 years ago!. Easy. I recommend then to buy "How to win friends and influence people" which is the Bible about communication and can be applied indeed to emails today.
And it is also disppointing to read 10 times the same concepts throughout the book, that could have been done in one page.
