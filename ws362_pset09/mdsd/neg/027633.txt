I knew the existance of this book for a while but never had a chance to read it. I checked it out this time to read it only for fun! Indeed, it is amusing reading it and comparing what was predicted in the book with the reality. Mr. Chang definitely had an ax to grind when he wrote this book. Don't waste your breath to argue the right or wrong of his arguments! He hates China! In fact, he could not care less about Chinese people! That is it! Period! Read it for a laugh! Don't waste your time to get serious with him
