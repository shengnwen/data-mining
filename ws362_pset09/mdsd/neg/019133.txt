This is a very hard book to get through. Mainly, b/c there is so much name dropping and venting about being a divorceï¿½, "wife of".  It's also hard to read through the constant pity party that she throws for herself every ten pages or so. I frankly, don't want to read about a 40-something yr old who is completely insecure with herself in every aspect of her life. Not to mention it sounds like her young daughter gets the brunt of it.  The rants are too long, there is really no need for this book to be in print. It was a waste of a tree.
