I'm a McCartney fan as much as anyone, but......I'm sorry to say, this is not Paul's best work.  The undeveloped characters (and there were a plethora of them)reminded me of the work of my 5th grade students, as did the writing of action-for-action's sake.  I'll continue to buy all his music though
