Since my wife and I are new residents of Raleigh, NC, I figured this would be a great guide.  It has given us some interesting facts about the Carolina and put some areas on our targets to visit. However, it is full of mis-information such as wrong Website URLs, wrong times of operation and incorrect phone numbers.  Perhaps this was all valid when the book was written in 1999.  I'd recommend saving your money on this book and looking for something more accurate
