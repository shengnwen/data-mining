The main question I had after reading this book -- Who really wrote Kissing in Manhattan? If Schickler wrote "The Smoker" and Kissing in Manhattan, then who wrote this book?  It's not the same author. This is writing I would expect from a high school student's rough draft.  The dialogue is pathetically horrible, and while the characters are believable, it is achieved through too much backstory, making the whole tale feel unbelievable and contrived.  I've read that people thought it was funny.  There is nothing even remotely humorous in this book.  The item about "I tolled the f'ing bell" is so lame and freakishly unfunny, I was beginning to think the author was making fun of his own writing.  I admit I was expecting a lot from Schickler, but this book was so poorly written, it made you want to laugh (at him), then ultimately cry
