I must begin by saying I am a fan of Gregory's and love 'The Other Boleyn Girl', 'Virgin's Lover' etc - could not put them down.  

However, I did not like this book at all - and I tried very hard.  I see that I am not alone here as other people have loved her other work and disliked this one.  There was too much focus on the incest and sex - and while I completely understand that Beatrice is just a fictional character, the detail in the way she treated her brother sexually, etc was a bit much at times.  I actually preferred reading about the beautiful land she lived on.  

One positive thing I will say is that Gregory really has driven her point home well on the fact that the women of Beatrice's era were very much powerless - they had no money of their own, could not inherit land even if they loved it - in fact lived and breathed it - more than their (to quote another reader) 'dimwitted brother'.  They were really quite forgotten and I have always found that truly sad - so well done to Ms Gregory for making that very important point.  She brings women to life on the pages of her books moreso than anything and you really feel for them - as much as I loathed Beatrice I felt sorry for her at the same time - she was in many ways a product of society and the way she and all women were treated.  She went mad in her desire to possess the land she so loved - but if she had the freedom that women today are lucky enough to have, she would probably have been a relatively normal woman.  A sad tale indeed.  

I wouldn't recommend this one though - I'd point people towards Gregory's other work
