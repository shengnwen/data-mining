I was a fan of the Berenstain Bears as a kid and as I grew up I respected the way they could address difficult issues in an open minded, positive, and non-biased manner.  Thus, I was suprised when I read this title.  Expecting maybe a look at world religions or some such, I was disappointed to find it only looked at Christianity.
