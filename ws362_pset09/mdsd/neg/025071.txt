First off, let me say that I have read just about all of the Dragonlance novels.  Frightening thought, I know.  While I am not of the belief that the first three are gospel, I come to expect a bit more from a book.  In every trilogy by Weis (as well as Hickman in most) there are events and cliffhangers that keep you going.  Dragons sacking a city that everyone is in.  A building falling on someone.  Finding out the "true" name of the One God in the Souls trilogy.  There was usually something to keep you going.  Be it a question that was left unanswered or the state of a character that you have come to love.  

This book has none of that.  In other trilogies, there are actually 3 minor stories that are built into a larger one.  Each book is its own work.  This book is built on one simple idea, what if Mina fell for yet another god.  She is one of a mere handfull of characters that appears in the novel, and remains as shallow and dimwitted as ever. 
 
Rhys, the other main character, is really the only interesting thing this book has to offer.  Yet, he shows no action to speak of.  You get about a hundred pages of him wandering around looking for someone.
Essentially, to wrap up what is turning into a long and (sorry) obnoxious review, nothing happens.  Pick it up a library sometime if you are interested, I am sure it will keep until the rest of this tale is generated
