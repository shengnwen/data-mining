Probably my least favourite of the books I have read by this author. And I love him, I do. Just not this one.

The bit on the back sounds really good, "crazy rain making people into savage killers!" Neat. But the book isn't that good, it really isn't. It's BORING. I don't know how it's possible for crazy rain making people into savage killers to be boring, but it is.

I will never be convinced that if a woman has been raped, her clothes ripped off during an attack, or there's a naked female corpse, that apparently ALL males nearby will become sexually excited. I mean... you're under attack by crazy, slime-covered maniacs, your wife is freaking out, your child is home with the babysitter and you don't know if she's okay, people are being disemboweled and torn to pieces around you... and you're still going to take the time (much less be able) to become excited at the sight of a half-dressed woman?

Also ridiculous is the fact that when the character John realizes that the maniacs can be "cured", he still rampantly and without remorse shoots them in the head and kills them. Hmmm.

I don't even want to get into the fact that Richard Laymon talks about the little 8 year old girl's "panties". Not cool. He always does this in his books, "rumps" and "panties"... but my god. This is supposed to be a CHILD. Pretty gross.

This is not his goriest book, his most creepy, nor his most interesting. Not a good Laymon book at all.
