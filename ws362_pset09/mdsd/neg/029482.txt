This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  The research is suspect.  The prose amateurish.  The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work
