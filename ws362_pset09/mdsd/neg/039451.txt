I suppose if you are a true Romance Novel fan this may be your cup of tea.  I, however found it to be overwritten and a little too full of "dark and glittering" expressions, "gasps of desire" and "taut bodies" for me.  I was drawn to read this because of comparisons to "Birth of Venus", and was sorely disappointed.  I also found Ms. Haeger's portrayal of everyday life in that time period to be sloppy - a baker's daughter would not be wearing different dresses several times a week, and probably would not have been sewn of even a "simple cotton" as that was a fabric for the upper classes.  Wool or linen would have been a more likely choice.  The culture of that time would have called for an up and coming citizen to marry for connections, not love, so Raphael's angst over a loveless match seems contrived. Again - I am not big on Romance Novels so that is why I was disappointed, if you care for that genre you may enjoy "her body shivered with a barrage of new sensations", over the historical content
