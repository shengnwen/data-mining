The book's premise was so promising -- how to find work that fulfills your higher calling.  The book just never fulfills that promise.  Just a lot of unmemorable writing about how you will be more fulfilled if your work is meaningful.  Well, that's not a shocker.  But how about some insight into how to find or how to create meaningful work.  For such a deep and spiritual topic, the thinking was very superficial.  The author merely rewrites what he has read elsewhere.  No new thinking.  Readers would be better off reading some of the books he recommends in his bibliography such as Flow and the books by Viktor Frankl.  I was also left with the icky feeling that the real point of this book was to sell you on his company's feel good workshops.  A real disappointment
