This book did a great job of spelling out the problems with oil and the history of the oil industry and the USA's success linked to oil.  This was very informative and interesting.  Then Rifkin quickly mentions renewable energy will become available to make hydrogen.  It's almost unnoticeable how quickly he skips this step, however this is the critical step.  Without cheap electricity from a renewable source we might as well use fossil fuels.  He never mentions and I don't think he understands how a substitute for fuel cells could do the same thing.  
I can't believe how many copies this book sold and how the public blindly believes everything in this book.  Now I have to spend my time correcting people and arguing with uninformed newspaper editors as to where our public funds and attention should be directed.  They should be focused on the production of cheap electricity through renewable resources.  The EU leaders understand this, it's obvious or president doesn't, and it's pretty obvious that the general public in the US doesn't understand it either.
