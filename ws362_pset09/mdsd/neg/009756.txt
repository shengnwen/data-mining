I think Arnold's philosophy was: "Use as little periods as possible. Who needs 'em when you have a host of commas, semicolons, colons, dashes--indeed, an assortment of methods to elongate your sentences." I pride myself on my reading ability, but this book was just too much. I have only encountered two books that I could say this about, and the other one (Book of the Wars of the Lord: Volume 1--Immortality of the Soul) is within my grasp--indeed, if I had a lot of time, I could definately tackle it. This book, on the other hand, uses so much complicated languages and elongated sentences that I got completely lost. My criticism isn't directed at Arnold (after all, such a writing style was almost expected in the Victorian era), but just at the fact that this is not a good book. While I may be wallowing in my ignorance (I notice that about every other reader gave this 4-5 stars), I don't see how one can stay awake for so long
