I read this book hoping to find activities to do with my child at home, what I encountered was a difficult to read, poorly organized, confusing book.  Rather than divide the book into age groups, the book is divided into different aspects of curriculum. It is impossible to look for activities, development milestones, etc. for a specific age.  You have to read each chapter, and even then they are hard to find- buried in the author's interpretation of the Montessori method
