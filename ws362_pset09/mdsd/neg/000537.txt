When I ordered this book, I expected a tongue-in-cheek retrospective of the ups and downs of being the parent of a gifted child.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  Very wrong.  This book is no more than a regurgitated  compilation of common lists found at every gifted site on the internet.   Any parent who has come this far looking for information on parenting their  gifted child has already seen every characteristic list in this book at  least two or three times for free.  Do not waste your money on this book
