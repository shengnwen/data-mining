I understand the ways in which the media manipulates, but it goes both ways, Blyth.  Fox, Limbaugh and Hannity managed to get Bush elected again with the worst performance record ever.  The fact that one reviewer suggests Coulter would like this book is certainly a reason to toss it aside.  Susan Sarandon is not like me?  No kidding.  Neither is W like the average American, but he won on that platform spin.  His family is blue blood from Connecticut--he attended Yale, Harvard (all on the merits of his daddy), but nonetheless, he has a silver spoon education.  The Dixie Chicks aren't proud he's from TX--Connecticut does not want him either. (He was born in New Haven, CT, by the way).   I am not a victim--I never thought I was.  The point is all of us should be watching every level of the media with an open mind--it is obvious we didn't during this past election
