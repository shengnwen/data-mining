These reviews are probably more interesting than the book. What's so interesting about them is that the reviewers don't seem to get that more than two-thirds of the country are now fully aware of Bush's utter incompetence as a leader. The "vast left-wing conspiracy" now consists of a 2/3 majority of the country. Apparently, 1 1/2 years wasn't enough time for a clear majority of voters to figure it all out. But nearly 3 1/2 years later, we all see. This book is a couple of years too late. Today it's utterly ridiculous to denounce a "conspiracy" to reveal the TRUTH
