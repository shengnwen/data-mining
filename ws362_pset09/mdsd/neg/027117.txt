I give Mr. Pretcher's book 2 stars because I'm in a real good mood right now.  Realistically, it was a way over my head. I asked "what time it was?" and the author is telling me how to build a watch. I had hoped for practical examples in putting Fibonacci retracements to use but found none.  It's extremely heavy on theory and is of little practical use to the investor.
A disappointment.
