I took a psych course from Bandler when he was a grad student at CMU in 68. He was quite shallow then believing in overly simplistic  models of human behavior. I've read a number of his books and while they promise qite a bit they don't work all that well. Recall the old saying, "seek simplicity and distrust it". Be careful, this is likely to be just another dead end on your road to enlightenmen
