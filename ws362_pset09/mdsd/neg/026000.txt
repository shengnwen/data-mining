I was really hopeful as I started to read this book, because I found that I cared about Jess and her family.  If the goal of the author was to be completely creepy, she definitely met that goal - I had nightmares all night upon completing the book (and I'm not easily scared).  The writing was very good, especially as regards developing characters, but the story was uneven and a bit wandering at times.  I was left with several unanswered questions (and not the good kind, where you are OK with not having enough information).  I will be giving this book to Goodwill, but I would not be opposed to reading another effort by this author, who clearly has potential..
