There are several very good crochet stitch guides on the market.  This is not one of them.  I should have realized when I read the introduction and saw some blatant errors.  It states that "These days machines crochet items as small as doilies and as large as sweaters and afghans."  Wong.  If you look up "crochet machine" on Google you will find a huge industrial machine that makes drapery trim.  It does not, nor does any other machine, crochet doilies, sweaters or afghans.

Then it talks about the diagrams which  it says are based on International Crochet
symbols  "...the old European code used widely today" that were found in France.
Actually, the symbols we use today are of Japanese origin, and the earliest recorded
sighting of them is about 1915.

Finally, it says that crochet was called Nun's Work in the Middle Ages.  But nothing
about crochet has ever been discovered  as early as the Middle Ages.

Doesn't give much reason to trust the rest of the book.

Each stitch is presented with hand-drawn symbols (pretty well done), a fuzzy black and white photo of the stitch, usually worked pretty poorly, and written instructions.
Nothing new here. No color in the book except on the covers.

And as one previously revidwer pointed out, the covers feature a rectangular motif for a teddy bear block that may enduce someone to buy it.  Too bad!  The pattern for it is not in the book!
