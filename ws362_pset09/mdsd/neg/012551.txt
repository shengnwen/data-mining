The author has unearthed a large amount of information, as you would expect from a professional historian and academic.  And he wishes to share a lot of it with the reader.  His style is flat, clear and in the tradition of some of the better Wikipedia entries. If you are fond of reading histories by David McCullough, think of this as the anti-McCullough.  Long paragraphs full of detailed information, and a very long book.  Minimal amount of interpretation, synthesis and story-telling.  Tough-sledding if, like me, you had the impression from Caro's books that LBJ was an unsavory man whose lack of courage and honor kept him from ending the war when he knew he should.  There is a tidal wave of information here, data overload.  Not sure what the point is, though.  A more thoughtful, interpretative, argumentative approach would have been far better.  Do we really need to know everything he did on so many days
