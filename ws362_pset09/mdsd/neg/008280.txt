I am trying hard to finish this book...i have about 60 pages left and have been trying to finish them for a week now.  This is my first Jo Beverley and while I realize it probably isn't a good indication of th ewhole of her work, I cannot see myself reading another of her books anytime soon.  Glad I didn't pay for this
