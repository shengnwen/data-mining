These metaphysical wet dreams will delight sulky teenagers and juveniles of all ages, but adults will agree with Rimbaud's own judgement: "It's all slop."  The Varese translation leaves most of the (rumored) music behind in the original French;  what remains is the prose end of the prose-poem equation.  I found these pieces supremely boring.  Perhaps if I cared about the Rimbaud myth I would read these with different eyes-- but I don't, and therefore what I find is faux passion and histrionic hormones.  Add a stilted English to this mixture and the result is malodorous.  Not recommended
