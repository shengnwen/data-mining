Sadly Revernd Sundby is just one of many people riding the tide of the "feel good" God.  As much as she may think she values truth, she has followed interpretations of scripture to land at what she wants to believe, not what is truth.

There are lots of online resources surrounding this issue which are much more compelling than this.

Don't get me wrong, I agree with her that God loves gay people and that the church should not judge them simply because of their orientation.  But the message of the Bible is crystal clear - God created sex to be between a man and a woman within marriage to the exclusion of all others.  That's not how all Bible characters behaved, but whenever word comes straight from God or Jesus, that's how it's portrayed.

Homosexual practice is not a sin worse than any other, but it is a sin.  And like any other sin it requires the grace of God for one prone to that given sin to turn away from it and be made a new creation in Christ.

All that such literature as this book serves to do is give false feel-good answers that seem to take away the problem, but don't bring people any closer to the truth
