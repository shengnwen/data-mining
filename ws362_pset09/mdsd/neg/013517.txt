I hate to judge a book like this based on only one issue, but as a gay man, this is an important issue for me. In answer to the question "What role does homosexuality play in human relationship?", Emmanual gives the following answer (I'll use slashes instead of the poetic line breaks):

"A necessary one./It is a means of loving./It is a means of reaching for oneness./It is a means to camouflage fear./It is, in short, a path.

"It is difficult to accept unification/because you live in a world/that encourages the either-or illusion./But things are becoming more closely aligned./Many people are learning to accept/their androgynous natures./Some express it in homosexuality,/which is an overstatement, however,/because of the need to accept/the sexual structure of the physical world./Nevertheless, in the long run/it is a healthy statement in your civilization./Ultimately we are all androgynous."

Despite the apparently encouraging beginning ("It is necessary"), this passage is troubling for several reasons. Homosexuality is defined as "a means to camouflage fear," whereas heterosexual relationships are not defined thus. Next, Emmanuel seems to identify homosexuality with androgeny, which are obviously two different things. A man can be extremely masculine and gay, just as a man can be feminine in some ways and be straight.

Then Emmanuel says that homosexuality is an "overstatement," whatever that means, "because of the need to accept the sexual structure of the physical world." Emmanuel seems to be saying here that homosexuality is somehow less favorable because of an inherent heterosexual structure to the physical world.

I cannot believe that the God which Emmanuel describes throughout the book would really care or choose to distinguish between the genders of two souls who reach out to each other. Perhaps Emmanuel's views on this subject are colored by Pat Rodegast's own confused and ambivalent attitudes toward homosexuality.

Thanks but no thanks
