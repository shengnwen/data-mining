This lifelong Cardinals fan managed to get through the book, but it's hard to imagine any non Cardinals fan who is not a speed reader doing the same.
Though I am not an obsessive baseball fan (haven't seen a game even on TV for nearly 20 years), the in-game stategies Bissinger details are nothing surprising; in context, anyone, experienced or not, would seem likely to come up with them. Readers will learning virtually nothing here.
To give Bissinger a break, it seems he agreed and perhaps signed a contract to write this book without realizing there would not be anything to say.
Bissinger does not deserve a break for his criticisms of Lewis' "Moneyball," however. (The hardback edition of "3 Nights," perhaps, is not so strongly positioned against that far better book, but the paperback I read contains an afterword devoted entirely to trashing Lewis' book without (a) any understanding of it, (b) apparently, a rereading of it, and (c) any evidence whatsoever to butress Bissinger's "ya gotta have heart" position.
Likewise, Bissinger deserves no break for the horribly bad, lazy prose here. Examples: Pujols is referred to in his first 20 or so mentions as "the great Pujols." No variations (not even "the really great") of the phrase are used. Page 275: a player plays "each and every game at five hundred percent." Page 254: a World Series victory is marked by a "Rubik's Cube of a hug." Page 243 (and elsewhere): "sultry hot," as if "sultry" does not imply "hot." Page 224: "white hair as finely woven as pasta." This is the kind of writing folks compose deliberately to win bad writing contests.
Disappointingly, the paperback edition, at least, doesn't even have any pictures.
Stay away from this one
