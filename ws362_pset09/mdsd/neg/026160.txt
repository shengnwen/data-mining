(Maybe 2 stars is a little harsh, but I'm not sure I can change it)

The book is relatively thick. It's full of the kind of detail I find somewhat tedious and a deterrent to reading cover to cover - but what to me is tedious might strike you as comprehensive. In any case it seems reference oriented.

There's a little too much pointlessly obvious and irrelevant detail (e.g section on the difference between a scanner and digital camera; a line drawing of how to set up an item of folding furniture which isn't even referred to in the text). Frequently sprinkled contact details for particular companies give it the feel of advertainment at times (eg the page dedicated to detailing modular furnings available from one retailer, complete with price tags and the supplier's web and phone details). It is in all ways US-centric, which is either an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your location.

Though on first look (I do own it) I found little to make me want to actually read the book, it might also as a passable 'wide but shallow' quick reference, especially if you're in the US.

It might also make an OK first book on the topic. I would recommend however, that the prospective reader preferentially (or at least additionally) purchase a number of more succinct, specifically targeted books which explore key topics in depth
