Very poor analysis of West African civilizations. For example, Ghana was a very significant Soninke empire in Western Africa, yet barely any attention at all is paid to it. To make matters worse, the author was so desperate to disregard it that he threw in a baseless and eurocentric statement that its capital may have been "founded by whites from the North". Fact is, there were no "whites" to the North. The only light skin berbers nearby were mixed-race "browns".
