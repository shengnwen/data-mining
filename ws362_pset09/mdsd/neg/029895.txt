I have the first book this author wrote, and was extremely disappointed to find out that at least half the blocks in her new book are repeated from her first book. I feel that the title is misleading. Several of the authors of multiple volumes on the same subject are in my library. Examples would be Bethany Reynolds, Marsha McCloskey, Sharyn Craig, and Carol Doak. In each and every case, the blocks or techniques do not repeat the items that appeared in their earlier books. Therefore, it's logical to expect that a book entitled "More Biblical Blocks" would have  additional blocks to the ones you already have. 

Have you ever bought a CD of an artist you liked to find out that half or more of the songs were repeats from one you already owned? Well, this is the equivalent. Since the book isn't cheap, it's doubly disappointing.

Whereas I do agree that the directions are guite good, they are no better than those contained in many other books on the market by other authors, so there is nothing remarkable in that arena. If you have this author's "Biblical Blocks" book, I'd recommend skipping this one. If you're considering buying one of her books, buy only this one and skip the first, so it can have value to some. I, however, feel ripped off
