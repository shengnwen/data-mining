The actual content of this book and its truly interesting parts are muddled by its author's self-righteous, self-important conversational style of writing. 

The author frequently inserts snippets about himself (whom he has quite a high opinion of), unbearably awkward similes and off-the-cuff thoughts in an effort to be clever or interesting, and winds up being neither. Perhaps his excuse is that anthropological linguistics is a very personal study, one in which fieldwork cannot be done without factoring in the researcher's temperaments. In either case, this book quickly becomes tiresome due to the author's intrusive, egotistical ramblings.

There are plenty of interesting points that he makes; unfortunately, you will have to wade through plenty of self-indulgent blather to discover them
