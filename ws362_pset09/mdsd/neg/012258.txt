After all of the great reviews, I really wanted to like this book. Unfortunately it leaves me feeling a bit like something is missing. There's a lot of information based on statistics and history of classic beer styles, but no real examples. Several example recipes for each style with comparisons would have been very helpful. 

Overall I think the author had good intentions - I just don't feel very confident that I could formulate a good recipe on my own using only the information in this book.
