Around 25 years ago I read a book titled "Somebody Else is on the Moon." The author claimed he saw all kinds of buildings, bridges, and construction  equipment in photographs of the moon, taken by astronomers. The book contained a few dozen photographs where these artifacts could be seen, but I was never able to see them. I wrote a TRS80 game based upon the book, and then wrote a letter to the author describing the game: he wrote back giving me permission to sell the game.

Even though I was 16 years old at the time I realized the author was "seeing" what was not actually there: the artifacts he claimed to see were not and are not there. Later, in high school, I learned about Professor Lowell believing he saw massive "canal works" on Mars, which was also a figment of hius imagination: Leonard was therefore in good company when he wrote this book reporting upon his imaginary artifacts. I remember feeling sorry for the author, realizing he had deluded himself. (Yes, I still have his letter.)

Sadly, there is nothing within this book of any redeeming value. It is not entertaining; it is not informative; it is one long plea for the reader to see that which IS NOT THERE
