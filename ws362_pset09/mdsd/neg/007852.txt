We Can Build You is one of PKD's weakest books. It starts in a quite interesting way, but ultimately leads nowhere. The best ideas are discarded and the end of the book concentrates in the lead character's descend into schizophrenia - and even that is not interesting in any way (unlike in some other Dick's books). Recommended only for Philip K. Dick completists
