Although I found the period writing style interesting and the review of Poe's life refreshing, I was puzzled how the death of Mary Rogers and its coupling with Poe's " The Mystery of Marie Roget " really broke any new ground in our understanding of the unsolved murder.

Both the police and Poe engaged in an array of theories and speculations regarding the Beautiful Cigar Girl's demise; however, neither was able to successfully deduce who the real perpetrator or perpetrators were. This made for me the reader a conundrum unfulfilled and wholly unsatisfying - thus wondering why the author went to the trouble of writing on this frustrating subject in the first place.
