If you have been a Chomsky fan ever since you read "Manufacturing Consent" then you may like this book- if you ignore the sloppy reasoning, and unsupported conclusions.

The author's thesis seems to be that persuasive techniques (political and commercial, but mostly commercial) are so effective that the targets of these persuasions essentially lose the ability to resist.

As others have pointed out, definitions of "coercion" almost always include the phrase "force, or credible threat of force." Yet, even the slimiest car dealership is not going to beat you up if you refuse to buy the car.  Indeed, this would be a far better book if the author at least considered the possibility that the dealership needs customers far more than any customer could possibly need any particular car dealer: after all, a dealer who can't sell enough cars will suffer large losses and go out of business, but a customer who walks to another car seller will lose- perhaps an hour or two.

In short, unless you can accept the book's thesis- that people lose their ability to resist in the face of these powerful persuasions- the book makes no sense. Which would be acceptable if only the author would provide evidence to support his thesis- but, he doesn't. As the old saying has it, "evidence" is not the plural of "anecdote."

Are Promise Keepers rallies truly Hitlerian (as the author implies), or (at most) just mildly annoying? Is it truly coercion when a chain-store salesperson tries to sell you additional stuff that you really didn't want and probably don't need, or is it just mildly aggravating? Is Rushkoff's attempt to convince you that ordinary, everyday politics and commercialism are coercive itself coercive and cult-like (by its own definitions)- or is it, too, just mildly annoying?
