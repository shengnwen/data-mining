Although there are a few good recipes, I found this cookbook to be disappointing overall.  I'll start off with the good: The lemon tart recipe is not only delicious, but a breeze to make and worth the price of the book.  The chocolate sorbet is also delicious.  The quality of the paper and photographs are excellent, with many beautiful color photographs illustrating the finished product.  Now the bad:  There is at least one glaring typographical error in this book.  The recipe for Linzer Cookies calls for over 2 sticks of butter, 1 cup of hazelnut flour and 1/3 cup of flour.  These proportions simply do not work.  I had to add at least 1 1/2 cups of flour to prevent the cookies from melting into puddles of butter in the oven.  Given that the cover price is $35.00 and the author is a prominent N.Y.C. pastry chef, this alone justifies the two star rating.  There simply should not be any recipes whose failure is not attributable to any individual person's taste preferences but to incorrect ingredient proportions.  In addition, for what it's worth, three other recipes that I tried (Apricot Tea Cakes, Pineapple Tea Cakes, Golden Banana Cake) tasted very bad in my opinion.  

For a good cookbook containing French-style pastries, try "Paris Sweets," by Dorie Greenspan instead
