Unfortunately, I just finished "Wild Fire" and am sad to report that DeMille's quality is continuing the slide downward that began with "Night Fall".

Through his magnus opus "Up Country", Nelson DeMille was my favorite fiction author. But in his last two books, he's decided to weave his stories in and out of catastrophic real-life events. I frankly don't care about John Corey's posiiton on George W. Bush or when to invade Iraq...I appreciate an author who creates an entirely new universe and populates it USING HIS IMAGINATION. Just like DeMille used to do in his other novels. Shoehorning real life events into his recent books has taken priority over a strong narrative and the storytelling suffers under this neglect. It's a blatant attempt at broadening his appeal that does so at the detriment of his longtime fans' intellect.

It's also worth noting he's writing books now that run about half the number of pages his past work offered. It's been pointed out he has contractual deadlines to deliver a book every November...I personally don't feel like this is a valid justification for the startling decrease in pages and by extension, story.

Overall, it's sad to realize that the author whose work I fell in love with is no longer committed to the same level of quality he used to consistantly provide
