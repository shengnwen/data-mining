I expected good things from this book, but was surprised to find it offered very little useful advice.  The examples of what to do in certain situations must have been jokes, they were that inappropriate and irrelevant to real life.  Amazingly, the book was also racist at times, making odd comments about Muslims.  I actually tossed this book in the garbage, a first for me.
