While Liz Greene has a smooth writing style, it is unfortunate that it  has not been put to more constructive use.  She identifies some of the key characteristics of Neptune, but views them in an almost entirely negative light.  What is worse, her descriptions of "Neptunian" people and problems are done in a  condescending and belittling manner.  Although she dismisses much religion and spirituality as Neptunian phenomena in a negative sense, her book offers no viable alternatives.  There are few constructive suggestions given in this book for the supposed weaknesses of those with hard aspects to Neptune in their charts.  Reading this book might lead some "Neptunian" people to think of themselves as being problematic and of little use to society, and could do more harm than good in many cases
