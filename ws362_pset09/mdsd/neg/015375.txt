I was disappointed with this book. It promises "Quick meals for busy couples" but only has a few of those. First off they include alot of meals that serve more than 2. A good portion of the meals take 40 minutes or more to cook. Alot of the recipes were not very appetizing from just their names. It was also kind of bothersome that they did not separate the sections from one another. I was able to scrape 1 recipe I would like to try from this book so that is why I gave it a rating of 1
