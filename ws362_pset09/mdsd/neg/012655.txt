There is no question that Anne Lamott is an extremely talented and gifted writer, and the writing in Blue Shoe shows it off well.  

However, the problem experienced by this reader is (the main character) Maggie's, well -- general lack of character.

She lives in her mother's house and puts her mother in a nursing home at everyone else's expenses, without giving a nanosecond's thought to taking her in.

She obsesses about her father's love life while her own children show signs of increasing neurosis.  She yearns for oral sex from another woman's husband while wanting to peel her "needy children off like starfish" stuck on something or other at the beach.

She refuses to apologize to her brother after betraying an important confidence to a town gossip.

Interestingly, her ONLY female girlfriend is a lesbian, who has decided to live some distance away.

I was shocked when she decided to wash someone's feet, but had the feeling she only did it to compare herself to Jesus.

But perhaps the worst thing this character does is claim something of intense sentimental value to the person it belonged to. This item should have been returned to its rightful owner, and any mature woman would have known this.  Imagine if it would have been her boy who lost it.  Actually, forget that. This woman has no compassion for anyone but herself.

Not surprising that the author concludes the story with a birthday party for herself.  And that the powers that be made the sentimental object disappear in the sand.  One can only hope that its rightful owner might come across it sometime and hold it to his heart, where it belongs.

When Maggie (or is it Anne?) goes to church next (without her children, as usual), the one prayer she needs to make is to become a better person.

Was relieved to finish this one, and will not be reading another by Lamott
