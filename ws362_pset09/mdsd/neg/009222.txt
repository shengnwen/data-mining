The plot line simple and at times choppy. 
Girl in small town. 
Girl has problems. 
Nice foriegn vamp (Got to have that french accent) hears her call and comes to the rescue. 

In addition the character development leaves quite a bit to be desired. It's a nice story if at times a bit hokey (yes I needed to use that word to describe it). I wouldn't recommend it but if you have some spare time, check it out at your local library before commiting to own it.
