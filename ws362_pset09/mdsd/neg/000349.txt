Stack was chosen to lead a former International Harvester plant that was nearly bankrupt.  Instead of massive layoffs he focused on rapidly increasing sales and obtaining employee involvement through opening the books.

Sounds too good to be true.  Large unions have had open books for years - yet, G.M., Ford, etc. have not benefited to any great extent.  The REAL problem in business today is "meeting the China price."  To my knowledge China is only just now looking into diesel engine remanufacturing (Springfield Remanufacturing's business).  We'll soon see how effective open books are in combating competition paying only 5-10% of American wages.  If they fail, open books will have proven to be a fatal distraction.  On the other hand, "open books" doesn't hurt, is somewhat helpful, and may be wonderful for firms not facing intense price competition.

(Several Internet searches on Springfield Remanufacturing were unsuccessful in obtaining latest financial performance data - I'm not even certain it still exists.)
