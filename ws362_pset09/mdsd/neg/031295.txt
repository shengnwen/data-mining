I bought this book partly because I am around 90% obsessive compulsive---hoping to gain a little more insight in how to plan my day and use time to my advantage...and partly to see if Dr. Arnot knew anything any other life oriented person didn't.

Well, the book is quite easy to read, but I believe the largest reason for this is because the majority of it is common sense.  We all know that the right foods have the ability to make or break our mood, and that just the right kind of music will either darken or lighten our mood.  I guess Dr. Arnot has made a fortune (from me as well) explaining all of this in a common, readable context.  For that, I congratulate him.

One part of the book that I found rather interesting was the "type" section, where readers are asked to answer questions regarding their behavior, thoughts, and processes.  After tabulating your answers, you'll receive a 4 letter code, or type.  The explanations for each type (located in the workbook section in the back) were dead on, but useless if your career is already underway.

If you haven't got a clue *at all* when it comes to working with your body to conform it into a success machine, this book is a good starting point on your road to where you want to go..
