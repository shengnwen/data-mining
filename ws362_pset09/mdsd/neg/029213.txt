This book starts out slow and dry.  It didn't get exciting until Pat Garrett started to take over the story.  This doesn't occur until about midway through the book.  Don't expect this to be a screenplay for the movies Young Guns and Young Guns II.  The book isn't that exciting but it does introduce you to an interesting character profile of Billy the Kid.  Personally I feel that the first half of the book is fiction that is read for pure entertainment and the second half covers the real story of the Kid.  I would recommend this book if you are interested in the Kids story and you want to read every angle of his story
