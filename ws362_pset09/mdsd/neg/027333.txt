Berenstain bear books are usually great reads, with a good lesson within the fun and enjoyable text.  This story had a good message, but wasn't a fun book to read.  I lost attention, and attentiveness.  My voice as i read it became slowly more monotone.  If you want a strickly educational book, its better to read them the dictionary
