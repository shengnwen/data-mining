Why, why, why? This woman is a talentless hack. I've seen better recipes on the back of soup cans! Sandra Lee's approach to inspired cooking is to add a can of tomatos to your Hamburger Helper! Woo! Seriously, though, this is a joke. I have nothing against easy cooking, but this is an absolute waste of time and money.
