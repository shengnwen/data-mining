This book has been compared to Richard Yates' brilliant "Revolutionary Road" which is why I decided to read it. There is no comparison at all; this story is boring beyond belief, rife with characters who are irrelevent to the story, and led by a protagonist who I couldn't have cared less about. This book has a definite 1950's tone throughout - the female characters were so unbelievably rendered that they almost seemed like stepford wives. It's rare that I cannot finish a book - but this one seemed a huge waste of time
