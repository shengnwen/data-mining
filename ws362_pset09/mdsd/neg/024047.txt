What a terrible book. It's slow and mostly pointless at times. Think of all the excitement you have working in a cubical with situations much less funny than those you'd see in Office Space. That is the premise of this book. I went into this book thinking:

1. This a great author!
2. All the characters are about my age!
3. I'd love to see what working in Microsoft was like when things were just starting to get huge!
4. My friends and I are all computer nerds. This is EXACTLY what it are going to be like when I graduate college this year!

I was wrong on all counts. There is nothing I, as a 21 year old tech-savvy, internatioanl business major, could relate to. It lacks an interesting plot. It lacks characters  the reader can enjoy. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of a few mildly interesting situations scattered few and far between in the book. Go. Read ANYTHING else
