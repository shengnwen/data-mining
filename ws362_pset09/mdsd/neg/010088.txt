This book has a lot of great examples of illustration, but the layout of the book is way too confusing. I found myself often lost where I should continue to read. The intro for interface has very little help for the beginner to start this program. This book might be good reference for advanced users, but not for beginners. Maybe the author wants to make a nice-looking book, but this book is over-designed, lack of functionality . I would recommend video tutorial from Lynda.com, it's ideal for beginners who never used Corel Painter and Wacom drawing tablets
