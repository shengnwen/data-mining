Early on the authors of this book let us know their extreme disdain for Christianity.  This didn't bother me at first, though I am a believer in Yahushua/Jesus.  It is always good to get more than one perspective.  But the constant sarcastic put downs of Christianity, and the presentation of themselves as understanders of the Gospel and it's impetus in history, got to be annoying really fast.  Baigent & Leigh think they are knowledgeable, they present themselves as objective scholars, but they are actually very biased.  

It appears to me that their operating principal goes something like this:  "The supernatural stories of Jesus Christ are totally mythological [this belief they cannot resist emphasizing over and over, tiresomely] i.e., lies.  We know this because we assume a priori that the supernatural as it is presented in Scriptures does not exist and because we are beings who have vastly superior intellect to that of Christians. Therefore...we don't have to be too careful about our understanding of the Gospels, and can with impunity present ourselves as if we are experts on it, even though we are not at all - because you see, it's all nonsense and doesn't matter anyway!"

This type of intellectual dishonesty and sloppy thinking - like for example claiming that Paul was the first one to start worshipping Yahushua (hello, how about the first chapter of John, and the Apostle Thomas bowing before His feet and saying, "My Lord/Adonai and my Elohim/God" - duh) made me realize I couldn't take seriously any "scholarship" these two have to offer.  When it comes to the Dead Sea Scrolls there is so much controversy.  Why should I trust these sloppy, dishonest thinkers, to tell me the real truth?  Answer:  I didn't and I don't.

There is some purely objective fact to be found in the book - most of it known very well already.  If you haven't heard those parts already, you can find them on the internet and save the money
