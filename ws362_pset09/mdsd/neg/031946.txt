I have read this book and I do not agree with it.  Certainly eating vegetables is a good way to go and will help you lose weight- no doubt about it!
However, the author cites acid as the cause of all of our ills and diseases.  Let us take a good look at that.  Ascorbic Acid, you know Vitamin C, which is said to be the closest thing to cure the common cold.  Guess what that is an acid.  
Linaus Pauling, a real doctor, not one that got his degree online at some school that he can not reveal, used to take up to 15,000 mgs a day of ascorbic acid (over 200 times what Centrum has).  Did it kill him, no he lived into his nineties, over twenty years longer than the average man.  So much for acid being bad.
And the stomach what is that composed of?  HCL, Hydrochloric acid, and if it did not, you would not be able to digest your food.  Also that acid, destroys bad bacteria, parasites and yeast.
In addition to this there are other acids which we need to survive on, such as Amino Acids, which are in every protein you eat.  Also I am sure you heard of Essential Fatty Acids, Omega 3's.  Scientists will tell you they are some of the best things to eat, and are essential to the body.  Still think acids are bad?
The bottom line is the authors credentials are dubious at best, and he should have stuck to what is true in his book.  That is that vegetables are the best thing for you and will help you lose weight and get healthier
