I liked this book in the end but it took me awhile to warm up to the two people in the story.  The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk.  I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding.  He was kind of shallow.  But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk.  I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them.  I have read better chicklit
