There are so many contradictions in this book that I don't even know where to start.  Was she a selfish, slobby, money-grubbing leech?  Was she a generous, dynamic, intelligent woman?  I know that part of the point of the book is that she was a complicated woman, but part of the author's job is to make sense of the incongruities.

Although the authors seem sympathetic to her, their attempts to pass her promiscuity and abortions as the actions of a woman ahead of her time are off-base.  Her behavior strikes me as bizarre and sociopathic.  Ted Hughes fares no better in this book, more-often-than-not behaving in ways that are no less a puzzle after having read this account.

One last note: The authors claim to have been researching this book for 20 years, but almost all the citations are from email exchanges in the last few years.  Yes, they did have an interview with Ted Hughes before his death, but I found myself wondering over and over what they were doing the rest of the time
