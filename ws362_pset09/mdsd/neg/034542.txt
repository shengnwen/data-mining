     I hated this book even when I was a kid. Lucy Maud Montgomery didn't know how to "create" a happy marriage between Anne and Gilbert because her own marriage was so disasterous. In real life, Lucy Maud's only friends were women and her negative attitude towards her husband is reflected in this book. Gilbert should have been outgoing, interesting, debonaire and REAL. Instead, he's a flat cardboard character who hides in the background. Although Anne is only in her late 30's, she's a prim and repressed matron who feels life has passed her by as she watches her children grow. And the kids are annoying! Saintly Walter is being primed as the sacrificial lamb and martyr--a destiny he fulfills in "Rilla of Ingleside." There's something weirdly disturbing and unreal about them...and their parents. Believe it or not--the most fascinating character is "Christine," the sultry widow who flirts with Gilbert and tries to "steal" him away from Anne--sort of! Christine is a little naughty and not very nice (by early 1900's standards) and she spices up this otherwise dull book.
