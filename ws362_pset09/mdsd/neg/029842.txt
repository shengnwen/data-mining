This book on the surface seems to be just another quickly rushed, put together autobiography for monetary reasons alone...which is Victoria Beckham all over.  This book is now a few years old and you'd be surprised that since it's publication the amount of contraditions that have been exposed about this talentless, insecure, attention hungry, mean to the bone so called "entertainer" is hilarious.  If you want to be sucked into this con game then go ahead but lies, lies, lies will be all you'll be reading.  A big fat 0/10 for this one
