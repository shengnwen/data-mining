In my opinion, the interesting parts of this story were the travels themselves and the relationship between the brothers.  The dull parts were when Franz would indulge himself, his escapades and "his" Annie.  Hopefully, the story worked as therapy for him as much as he feels the travel did.   I am guessing that a story written from Kurt's perspective would be more exciting.  I did finish the book, though felt it dragged on, and have to admit I'd see the movie...for more insight on Kurt.
