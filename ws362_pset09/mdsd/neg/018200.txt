I am not too impressed with this book, nor its author, Donald Oliver, with whom I had the &quot;priviledge&quot; of taking a series of his classes.  His book, and consequently, his methods, are far too rigid; the guidelines in the book are presented to the reader as if they are the ONLY way to do an audition, and if you don't do it HIS way, you are wrong.  He even provides a list of songs NOT to sing.  However, I believe that a successful audition is not about following a set of rules, but rather what works for each actor.  A song might be overdone, but if one can do it, and do it well, then, by all means, do the song.  Additionally, Donald Oliver is a pompous, arrogent man, who &quot;name drops&quot; to try to impress his students, and believes that his way is the only way.  Do not buy into the &quot;rules&quot; of this book.  If you must read this book, only use it as a reference.  I recommed the book &quot;NEXT&quot; by Steven M. Alper instead
