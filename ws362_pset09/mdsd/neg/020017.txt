"Scholars" like Rothenberg love to choose subjects like racism, Native American history, and feminism.  They do this because these subjects allow them to not only feel "multicultural," but to feel as if they are somehow saying, "I told you so" to American conservatives and any white citizens who might feel that racism is overblown.  

The fact is, racism is overblown.  Take Hurricane Katrina for instance.  African Americans and liberal whites were screaming, "RACISM!!" after the failure of FEMA to respond effectively to the disaster.  This argument dies when you look at FEMA's response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992.  That hurricane decimated predominantly white neighborhoods in Miami to the point that the chief of Miami disaster relief, Kate Hale, said, "Where the hell's the cavalry?"  FEMA did not respond effectively then.  In fact, they have never responded effectively to a major disaster.  But, I suppose Katrina is different, right?   Wrong.

Katrina is only one example in a sea of them.  The Paula Rothenbergs of the world like to use South Africa as an example.  They claim that country came together for a national dialog and collectively eliminated Apartheid.  What they fail to acknowledge is the fact that their "invisible racism" is still alive an well in South Africa and always will be.  White South African shop owners still prefer white South African customers.  This will never change, no matter how many books like Rothenberg's are published.

There has never been a society without subtle preferences for one's own race and there never will be.  As long as people like Paula continue to press white people for ever more "progress" on this "invisible racism," they'll merely push this supposed invisible-racism-free utopia further away
