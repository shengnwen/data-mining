I want to start off by saying I am a huge fan of Little's works and have amassed a collection of his books. He is an author who will go the road less traveled and I am all for that.  With this in mind I looked at the synopsis on the back cover and opted to give it a try. Bad Mistake!  Don't get me wrong, I found myself interested in Bob's dilemma, though a bit confused as to how he got that way, and was hanging on to every word in order to satisfy my curiousity as to how Bob, the book's protagonist, dealt with these challenges and waiting to see if it would get any worse for him. It did and I sympathized at first.  When the book starts it's downhill slide, in my opinion, is when he meets up later on with characters who are having similar problems. I spent the remaining time reading the book,not out of enjoyment, but wondering to myself as to how many different ways are they going to rehash their plight, causing my sympathy level to ebb as the situations go from the ridiculous to the sublime. For instance, towards the end, a full scale invasion on the 
White House complete with tanks and ammunition,with only a small blurb mentioned of it on the TV news.It is illogical in it's premise only by making his characters literally undefinable by any action they take no matter how atrocious!  Anyway, out of respect for Mr. Little please pick up "The Policy" instead, not only do you care how they resolve the issue, but you get a few cheap laughs as well
