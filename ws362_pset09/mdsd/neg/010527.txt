I respected her work more before I read this book. Some of the essays are good and some are really bad. The worst part is the repetition. I understand that these were previously published, but couldn't someone have reworked them a little to take out the repetitive passages. I was also left confused; on the one hand she states that shed doesn't want to be pigeon holed as an Asian or Women's writer. On the other she mentions several times that she attended   a conference for woman writers or Asian writers.
