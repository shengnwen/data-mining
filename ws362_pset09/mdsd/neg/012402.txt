I really wanted the famous sea poets and authors: Masefield, Tennyson, etc.  What I got was some of that, but interspersed throughout with the anthology editor's own poetry -- which I'm sorry to say, isn't that great.  And the editor doesn't appear to know much about sailing either; for instance, he totally misses the nautical meaning of the line "when the long trick's over" (Sea Fever).  A trick is a turn at the wheel, standing watch, silly rabbit!  

Serious sailor-readers should find a different book
