The Motely Fool has never shied away from congratulating itself, in an entertaining sort of way.  The trouble comes in when the reality fails to live up to the authors' claims.  Their style of rah-rah anyone-can-make-a-million investing appeals to some novice investors for obvious reasons.  But as Malkiel points out in the classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street, there will always be a few people who have a fortunate run for a few years.  Today, sadly, after the crash of 2000, the Gardners' conclusions in Rule Breakers Rule Makers seem to be more misleading than helpful, especially for someone just starting out.

If investing were only as easy as the Gardners make out then their own "Rule Breaking" portfolio might have continued to work.  They have tried to selectively cite certain of their more recent portfolios to make it appear that they're continuing to "beat the market like a drum", while sweeping under the rug their losing portfolios.  But as the reality of their results stands, they ought to be ashamed of themselves for hyping up stocks and making themselves sound like the next Warren Buffett.  

There will always be people on Wall Street like the Gardners, inflating expectations and temporarily taking in some newcomers.  In contrast, real investors like Buffett and Graham are modest about their results.  They stick to a realistic expectation of returns, and realize that today's hot stock is often tomorrow's set of crashed dreams.  A beginning investor would be much better served reading Graham's The Intelligent Investor, or another classic of the Street, rather than being drawn into a charming but unrealistic look at the high hopes of what are ultimately mere self-promoters
