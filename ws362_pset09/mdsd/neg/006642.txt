Coffee is a brown beautiful color.Ink is black set to a white back ground in books for a very good reason.If I had known the printing in this book was a light brown color that is hard to read I would not have wasted my time or money.This may be a very good book but I will never know.Keep the color in the coffee and your hands off the ink.I have the fifth edition
