Denice and I grew up in the same small town in Oklahoma. It is of the utmost importance to understand how those of us who knew her were profoundly affected by her death. This heinous crime not only shook Ada, but also shook those of us who grew up with her in Purcell,OK. Denice was a sweet girl who had a smile that would light up the room. She was a year behind me in school. I recently pulled out a old High School annual. Looking at her photo brought back a rush of memories. Memories of a beautiful, innocent young woman who's life was ended in the twinkling of a eye. As important as it is that justice has been served in this case, it is even more important for all to understand that we will never forget Denice.
