This book is so terrible I cannot even begin to describe it. 
The format is unnatural and hard to get used to, especially if you're used to normal textbooks.
It introduces a few facts, but the examples are just not very good and then it gives you problems to try out and then that format continues througout the whole chapter, making the whole learning experince very odd and uneven. I found it very hard to focus on the material because of that problem.
The material is not hard to learn, if presented the right way, which this book does not do. I can't wait to sell it back.
If you want to get a real understanding of statistics and actually remember some of it, I would advise you to try another book
