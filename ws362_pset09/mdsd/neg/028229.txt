I felt compelled to write this review.  I can't state this more clearly, don't buy this book!  I read the reviews stated here by other readers and the only one that I can forgive is the one written by the 6th grader.

This book is a mess!  Characters are introduced haphazardly and then forgotten.  The pace is confusing and the conflicts are resolved in an almost comical way.

Save your money!!!
