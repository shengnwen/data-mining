This book provides an interesting perspective on C.S. Lewis that you won't get in other books.

However, I was disappointed by the writing style and the content of the book. It seems to be targeted towards a juvenile audience. Much of the book is simply a retelling of other Lewis biographies. There are many typographical errors. I was also surprised at the way Gresham constantly maligned others in Lewis' life.

Another disappointing thing about the book is that only the last few chapters are dedicated to the time period that Gresham actually knew Lewis. He speaks with great authority on Lewis' entire life, interpreting events before he was born as if he was there.

If you are expecting a well-written and enjoyable book about C.S. Lewis, this book is not for you. I found the book tiresome and hard to follow
