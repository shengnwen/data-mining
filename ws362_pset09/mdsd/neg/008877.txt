I usually do not put aside a book before finishing it.  In this case, I got about a third of the way through and just skimmed the rest and could not bring myself to read it in detail.  I purchased this book hoping (despite prior reviews) that it was more food lit than self analysis.  However, the strength of this book is in its description of tense family relationships, and indeed not in its descriptions of food in Desalvo's life.  If you are interested in it anyway, good luck - there is a lot of emotion in it
