I really want to give 2.5 stars. It's really just sort of a dry, rote listing of every control on every rack device. The examples lack aesthetics and interest. A lot of the better info is tucked away among the odd collection of sidebars, captions and block quotes. The illustrations are likewise offset from context and in funny formats. Typically, the illustration for the point in the text is several paragraphs later in the book. Also there are a lot of partial shots of the interface so you sort of have to track down the area of the device interface the book references. It's just a petty annoyance, no worse.

The info that's in there is accurate, and that's good, but it is neither in an easily referenced format, nor a format that would cause tidbits to stick in your memory. It's just sort of "there". I'm still reading it cover-to-cover because, well, I paid for it so I may as well get all I can out of it. 

There are much more entertaining and stimulating books out there -- one which even has the word "Power" in its title, too.
