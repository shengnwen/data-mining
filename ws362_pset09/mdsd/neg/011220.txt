I bought this book in the hopes that the text would be simple enough for my four-year-old. It was simple enough, but at great cost.  Details I remember from the tellings I heard as a child were missing.   There was nothing in the text that would help a child even remotely empathize with the characters.  Ugh.  I wanted my son to like or at least remember the story, but hearing this retelling was like eating cardboard.  The illustrations weren't that great either, with nothing to attract a child's eye.
