When I first read Peter Drucker in 1982 I was bored to tears 
by a pompous man telling us the pol correct. Unfortunately, 
those who teach business are not those good at practicing 
it. In fact, many of them loathe it and seek revenge for 
their own unemployability. Recently, with the advent of
differential pay, we have faculty who don't even care, but 
who switched form teaching operations in engineering, psychology or economics in liberal arts or even 
biostatistics. This is why you don't see Drucker 
(who proclaimed Japanese "participative" management 
before it came into fashion - MacArthur deliberately 
forced socialism on Japan to de-fascistify it) apologising 
for the failures in Japan today. No, now they tell us 
to emulate communist China, or the "knowledge" feudalism 
of the university. Wait, didn't the university-style
environment they promote cause Arthur Andersen and KPMG 
so much trouble? Did they ever tell you that large USA 
made cars weren't the problem in the 1970s, but that gas 
prices made consumers buy smaller USA-name cars made 
with defective Asian parts and yet somehow the peaceniks 
who rebelled and bought "pacifist" Japanese cars turned 
this into something else. Also, as USA education was deteriorating, our mechanics weren't telling us the 
reason they preferred foreign cars was because they had 
no clue how to upkeep the computerised USA carborateurs. 
Now, as customer service has returned to 1970s levels, 
did anyone mention it was caused by the inflationary
environment, and the excellent customer service of 
the 1980-90 era was due to low inflation, as inflation is intimately involved with mass paranoia and irrationality?
