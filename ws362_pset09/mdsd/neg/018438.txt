PLEASE NOTE: I RATE THIS THREE STARS, BUT AM UNABLE TO CORRECT THE SCALE WHICH INCORRECTLY SHOWS ONLY ONE STAR. THANK YOU:
Tulku Thondup's Peaceful Death, Joyful Rebirth is unique among Tibetan books. It concentrates on our experience after we die and is a guidebook that outlines what to expect when we pass from mortal life to post-life experiences. For example it provides stories of experiences during a time of judgment in the Bardo state. 

Thondup gives us vivid details and sample experiences of practitioner's passing sensations during their time of death. It also offers a sense of the wide range of worlds our consciousness may experience after mortal death, everything from hellish chimaeras to celestial, peaceful visions.

His book places heavy emphasis on karma and the belief that deeds determine our experience in a life after this one. It stresses that a consious, kindly life leads to a positive afterlife while a self-centered life leads to more hellish worlds.

With its unique and detailed picture of the relms of consciouness after death, Peaceful Death, Joyful Rebirth is a worthy addition to the body of literature on the subject of dying and the afterlife
