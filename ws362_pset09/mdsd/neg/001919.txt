I ordered this book online, and just received it.  A quick scan through and my first impression was...pictures?  Where are they?  It's a cookbook about cupcakes.  I'm probably going to decide which ones I want to make based on how good they look.  That may sound simplistic, but when's the last time a recipe grabbed you without a picture to go from?  Especially when you *paid* for the book.

I already had "Hey There, Cupcake! 35 Yummy Fun Cupcake Recipes for All Occasions" but there was no recipe in there to make the kind of frosting that piles up sky-high, which is why I bought this book (I have recently developed a love for cupcakes).  I don't see any kind of frosting recipe like that in here.  Literally, I don't *see* a recipe for that frosting.  I doubt I'll use this book at all
