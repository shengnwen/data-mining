It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport.  I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed.

If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.

Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad..
