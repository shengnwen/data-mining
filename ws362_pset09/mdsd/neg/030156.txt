Or is it just personal (because of jealousy)? Its hard to judge emotion from the pages of a short book. Peggy was infamous for her support or Reagan and his lies (even if he was a senile puppet).
You should consider the source. Although I am not from NY, I wouldn't vote for a person who was put in office as part of the deal to cover-up the "accidental death" of JFK Jr (IMHO)
