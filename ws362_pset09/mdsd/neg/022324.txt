As expected, anything coming from Victor Ostrovsky will be negative and against Israel. The book is filled with real events, which the author dramatically changed and turned Israel responsible for them. No wonder this book is banned in Israel. In fact, because of the ban, many people believe that this book has true accounts of Mossad activities. True, the book gets interesting, but the author's motive to run down the Israel for everything happening around the world spoils it. This book is a perfect example of blaming a country and its intelligence agency for your own mistakes. I absolutely agree with J. A Magill's review, this book has no credible source of information, except the fact that Ostrovsky once worked for Mossad. 

Vindictiveness is the word behind this book. Absolutely one sided, and nothing to prove what author says. All I can say is that I want my money and most importantly my time back. I doubt if I can have either.
