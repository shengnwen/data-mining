Brad Gooch is certainly a skillful writer.  He researched his subjects meticulously.  However, the title and blurbs on the dustjacket of his book are totally misleading.  The book is more about a few spiritual outposts in America than it is about the spectrum of spirituality across the country.  There are only five chapters:  one about an arcane revelatory path called the Urantia Movement, the second about the life and times of Deepak Chopra (mostly in other countries), the third about Trappist monks, the fourth a collection of miscellany about the Cathedral of Hope, Soulforce, and Jerry Falwell (mostly in Texas and California), and the fifth about Islam in New York.  

A blurb on the back of the dustjacket says, "It's hard to imagine a more important subject than religion in America, or a more compassionate, accessible guide than Brad Gooch.  Godtalk is a necessary book."

Another says, "In this period of self-searching, Brad Gooch guides us through spiritual America with intelligence, wit, and sensitivity."

I gave Gooch's book only two stars because I feel swindled
