I can't believe I bought this, one of the worst purchases I've ever made.  Far from being a step-by-step how to actually set up a web site, it's filled with "if you want to do this, then do this, or if you want to do that, then do that."  Perhaps I'm more comfortable with programming books that actually step you through a series of ever-increasingly-complex projects in order to teach you how to use the languange.  This book reads more like a reference book for those who already know FrontPage, or a page-by-page description of what the controls will do rather than why I would want to use the control in the first place.  IMO, it's hardly a beginner's book, and not worth the deeply discounted price it's selling for
