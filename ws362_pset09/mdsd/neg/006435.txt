I am a thirty-something, pretty hip, pretty shapely Californian, and there is not one pattern in this book that I would wear, let alone spend the time knitting. "Sexy" is a misnomer -- "trashy" would be better. I was hoping for some non-dumpy-looking sweaters and flattering garments, and instead I got see-through tops, peek-a-boo swimsuits, and bare midriffs galore. The only person I know who has the body to get away with this stuff is my 14-year-old niece, and her mom wouldn't let her out of the house wearing anything in this book! Save your money. Wrap yourself in cellophane and save yourself the trouble of getting out your needles.
