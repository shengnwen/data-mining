History doesn't have to be a boring list of facts - look at Norman Davies's Europe: A History for evidence of that. But Lukac's Budapest 1900 is an example of what can go wrong when the historian attempts to write like a novelist. 

Many parts of Budapest 1900, a potrait of the city at the turn of the century, are bogged down in long descriptive passages which try to impart a mood. In Budapest's heyday around 1900 sun lights up the beautiful women shopping in the boutiques on Vaci Street. Later, during the short-lived Communist government after World War I, politicians scheme in badly-lit basement rooms.

This kind of impressionistic history becomes irritating, and detracts from otherwise interesting detail about a city which was once the fastest growing in the world. There are also sizeable footnotes on almost every page, which seem unecessary in a non-academic history like Budapest 1900.

Furthermore, Lukacs employs a flowery style, which also grates. There are lots of unecessary self-references to "this historian" and tortured sentences like the following: "Seeds of trouble is the title i gave to this chapter: but semination is one thing, and fructification another."

The book also fails to draw all of the chapters together in a thematic whole. Finishing the book is unsatisfactory - You have very little sense of what it was really about, beyond a trip down memory lane.
