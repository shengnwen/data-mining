In his centerpiece "exposure" -- the oil-for-food program -- Eric Shawn simply ignores the facts.  For starters, US government reports document that the biggest chunk of billions going into Saddam's pockets came from oil smuggled outside the UN program through neighboring countries -- and that the White House and Congress not only knew for years this was going on, but authorized special legal exemptions for Turkey and Jordan so the smuggling could continue. Given what Shawn pretends to do, the book is worthless without such material.  He is a practitioner of  misdirection and blatant propaganda.

Shameful stuff.  Too bad one star is the minimum rating, this book deserves zero stars
