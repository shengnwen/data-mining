At the start of this year I pledged not to buy any CDs for six months and it took some willpower on my part to pull this off.  When I saw this book I was happy because here I expected to find a "how-to" book written by someone that pledged not to buy anything that was not essential.  Mistake.
The book doesn't have all that much to offer by way of how to cut down on purchases of nonessentials except that they offer many examples of mooching off of their friends.
While reading the book you need to realise that the author's rambling's are often just plain factually incorrect.  On page 259 the author says "Europeans can choose not to work as much because they don't have to pay for a great deal of what we pay for.  The welfare state pays for..."  The author seems to think that the Man in the Moon pays for these things, i.e., some distant third party does the paying.  Not so, these things still have to be paid for.  An economy can only consume as much as it produces (in the long run).  In the book you have to be constantly vigilant to separate the rambling's from the facts.
The book is a personal diary of 2004 but the author is careful not to make it too personal.  I wouldn't mind reading someone's diary for a year if they included everything.  The author talks at length about the radio tower in Hardwick and the Republican convention but the book is very sparse on her relationship with her partner.  That part of her private life stays private.  So does much else.  You're given some insight into her relationship with friends but nothing about family.
I took the book out from a library.  I'd suggest that other readers do the same
