Any non Greek Orthodox person should take great caution in reading this book as it is in no way a definitive book on The Orthodox Church.  Where Ware excels in explaining a very condensed history of The Orthodox Church he loses all credibility by throwing in Greek Orthodox propaganda.  Please note, The Philokalia and The Jesus Prayer which are mentioned multiple times in this book are not widely used in the Russian Orthodox Church. Somehow he exemplifies the troubles of the Russian Orthodox Church under communist rule but barely discuses the widespread corruption in the Greek Orthodox Church.  He almost goes to the point of saying that the `locum tenens' aren't part of the `real' Orthodox Church.  Many would argue that these are the "True Orthodox Church." Chapter 16 "The Orthodox Church and the Reunion of Christians" is nothing more than an editorial.  His support of the Anglican Church and his distaste for the Roman Church is nothing more than ecumenism.  The truly sad aspect of this book is that it is one of the only English written Orthodox books on the market.  Hopefully a less biased book will be available in the future
