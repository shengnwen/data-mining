If you are interested in the entrepreneurial world, you might find this book an entertaining read.  However, if you are an entrepreneur or want to be one, this book is most likely not going to help you.  

I have read so many business books (including books on start-ups) and invariably with the exception of a couple of books, those for start-ups are of low value and do not provide sufficient information desperately needed by entrepreneurs.  

With so many fluff books on start-up companies and entrepreneurs, there is a great need for more in-depth how-to books.  This one certainly has not bucked the trend.  It seems that so many of the reviewers are just so proud and honored to speak of Mr. Kawasaki's previous stent with Apple or his garage.com firm (which I still do not think he is sure what their mission is) that they have not given the book a truly subjective and unbiased review.  

When reviewing a book for entrepreneurs you should ask yourself the foillowing question:

Does the book really show you how to be successful?  Is the information so valuable that you will study it and take notes or refer back to it for future use?

There are very few sources of valuable education for entrepreneurs anywhere.  Therefore it is important that the authors of these books provide what is left out in business schools.  Traditional business topics are covered well in business schools so there is more room for business fluff books.  Despite this fact, there are still many books on traditional business topics.  

In contrast, for entrepreneurs, the only source of education is the book market so you should stay away from fluff books or motivational type books, all of which teach you nothing.
