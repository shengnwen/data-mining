"Severely wounded" in combat?  Was this when he claimed the actions of another PCF commander, and wasn't even on the boat?  Or was this when he aimed an M-79 into the rocks and got a thornbush wound which was denied by his commander when Kerry put in for a Purple Heart; but got it later when he gamed the system and ran it through a different commander?  Or was it when he and Rassmann threw grenades into a rice cache, got hit in the rear by flying rice?  Or was it when he claimed his boat was hit by a mine when in fact it was a different boat?  You know, the time when he claimed all the other boats left, but in fact his was the only boat to flee?  Or was it when he ran the gauntlet of VC lined up for 5000 meters
