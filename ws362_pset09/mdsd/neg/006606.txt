I really enjoyed the TV show but this book is soooo boring!  It is chapter after chapter of exceedingly dull anecdotes.  Do you really want to know what each person ordered at dinner?  I know I don't.  Each chapter ends with an "informative" list like Brian's top 5 favorite hot dogs.  Gimme a break.  Don't waste your money on this book
