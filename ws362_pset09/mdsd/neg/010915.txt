I'm very disappointed at the amount content in this Book.  Sun posted a Java style guide that was essentially the equivalent, but free.  Equivalent in terms of topics covered while there were some noticable difference such as variable naming. 

One of the redeming qualities of the book though is that it can serve as a coding standard thus saving one from tidious chore of deciding on your own standards.  In the end does it really make that much of a difference as long as everyone on your team is following the same standard?

Best part of the book is the title.
