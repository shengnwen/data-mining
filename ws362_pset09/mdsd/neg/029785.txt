Having spent a couple years now as a venture investor, I was looking for a book I could point entrepreneurs to, so they could get a better perspective on the venture investment process: what do they need to have in place, what's most important, how does the process work, etc. &quot;Inside Secrets to Venture Capital&quot; would take someone maybe 75% of the way there. Unfortunately, that's not good enough, as the lack of that last 25% would likely mean that the reader would head off in some unproductive directions. So I can't recommend this book to entrepreneurs I counsel, or to anyone else
