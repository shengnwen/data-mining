The careful reader of the book's footnotes will notice that the author admits to concocting pivotal scenes for dramatic effect.  Such practices are worthy neither of history nor of journalism.  Moreover, early in the book the author spins out a series of speculations that somehow transform themselves into assertions of fact by the end of the book:  that the hero of the book radioed the first warning of the first Soviet atomic test, that he was ordered by CIA to remain where he was, that he was sent on a mission to Tibet rather than just tried to escape the Chinese communists.  The author also relies far too much on the reminiscences of family members far removed from the scene, who of course have an interest, perhaps subliminal, of sprucing up the story.  Finally, the author's animus toward CIA and his disagreement with US policy toward Tibet drives the narrative often in bizarre ways:  at one point, the hero, caught on the Tibetan plateau, is transformed and transported in time and space to Vietnam in the 1960s, only to betray that people, too!  This is a frustrating book.  The subject has yet to receive a fair, balanced, and well-researched treatment
