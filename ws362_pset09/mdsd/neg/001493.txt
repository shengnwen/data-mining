Unfortunately, many masonic authors are doing the worst possible disservice to the craft and to history, this being a perfect example. The collectective gibberish of Mr. Mann is simply a disgrace; full of personal wishful thinking, of make-believe, of sensational argumentation, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth that such rubbish has found its way to print. Applying the formula used by others (Lincoln, Baigent et al), together with the need to acquire a bit of heritage, Mr. Mann embarks on an self-embarassing journey that has nothing to do with the Knights Templars. No doubt there is merit in the theory that the Knights had landed on the shores of North America, however to apply sacred geometry in the manner described by Mr Mann stretches the patience of informed historians with sufficient cultural and intellectual depth. 
The deragatory manner with which Mr. Mann (on page 12) refers to an eminent authority like Mr. Laurence Gardner, just shows that he neither has the depth nor the intellectual maturity to make a worthwhile contribution to the Knights Templars, to the craft and to history
