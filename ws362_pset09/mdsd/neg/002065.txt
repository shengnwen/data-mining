Don't make the mistake of judging the entire Hard Case Crime series by this lackluster entry.

I can imagine the publishers being overjoyed when Stephen King agreed to write a novel for them and then cringing when they received this manuscript.  The writing is fine, as you'd expect from King, but there's nothing remotely hard-boiled or sexy in this novel.  (Don't let the cover fool you!)  It's simply the meandering story of an apparent murder that happened years before.  There are a couple of interesting hooks, but they certainly don't lead anywhere.  This one's for Stephen King completists only.
