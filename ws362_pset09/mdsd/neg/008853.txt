I have to agree with J. Seifert's review.  This book might be thought provoking, eye opening, or supposedly mind-blowing for some teenager who's never considered that technology might not be the meaning of life, but for any adult who's already thought way beyond Coupland's very obvious comments on modern society, the book had nothing new or interesting to say and wasn't all that entertaining along the way.  About the middle of the book, I was actually enjoying the plot and wanted to read more to see how things turned out for the self-obsessed whiners ("Oh, I'm so lonely."  "I have no one to love."  "What is the meaning of life?"  Boo hoo.) who were the central characters.  But then the end was SOOO preachy that it kind of ruined it for me.  The ending was bizarre and over-simplistic at the same time -- I felt like a 13-year-old could have written it.  In the end, I couldn't decide whether Coupland was advocating anarchy, religous fanatacism, or both.  I'm sure everyone who reads it must have their own interpretation, which is only fair.  But for me, the ending was silly, pointless, and had no clear or redeeming message.  Sorry Coupland fans.  I guess I won't join the club
