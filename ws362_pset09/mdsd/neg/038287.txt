I've read many, many books in my life. Good and bad. This leans towards the bad. I gave it two stars simply for the love of the game. That is the only reason I made it through this horrid attempt at literary adaptation. I read fall of reach and found it to be a fairly decent novel. I noticed they switched writers when they published this one. This was a huge mistake. Dietz is possibly the blandest writers I have ever forced myself to read. There is absolutely no feeling to what he is writing. He even makes grievous grammar errors throughout the entire book. I found myself reading sentences time and time again in order to mine the meaning from them. Simply put, this is a bad. Real bad. I don't even think the back story is worth it. I noticed they switched back to the previous writer for the next book so someone must have noticed. If you really feel the need to read a book you've probably already played, then go for it. If you want to skip the shudders and shakes that Dietz's writing style will induce, don't feel guilty; you're not missing much.
