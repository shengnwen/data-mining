After reading this book, it is so obvious that the author/s know nothing about chiropractic. Have they ever even been treated by a chiropractor? It is also not very professional for one doctor to condemn another. I am an orthopaedic surgeon and I refer many of my patients to be treated by a chiroractor before the final choice of surgery. After giving a lecture at a chiropractic college in Japan, I was amazed that the doctors know as much about my job as I do! But how much does the author know about chiropractic?  It is books like this that keeps modern medicine  in the dark ages. Some doctors are even ignorant about the fact that HIV is the cause of AIDS! I have a copy of this book at home which I bought for 5 Dollars in a second hand book shop; if anybody wants a good laugh at a doctors ignorance, you can have mine for a buck
