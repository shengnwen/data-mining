It should be kept in mind by the reader of this book that the writer's real name is Idries Shah, who is rather better known for his Sufi books.  His scholarship here is about as thorough as it is in his other works.  His  writings on the Isma'ilis are almost totally based on the accounts of Marco  Polo and are otherwise devoid of historical accuracy
