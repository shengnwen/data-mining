seriously, if you've read the joy luck club you've read them all. in case nobody noticed, her books are all the same. whoever said that the kitchen god's wife was a duller version of the joy luck club wasn't that far from the truth because it just WAS the joy luck club, only you've read it already so you knew what was coming. ie fights between mother and daughter. how profound/prosaic. really, read one of amy tan's books and you can talk about all of them with some kind of authority.
