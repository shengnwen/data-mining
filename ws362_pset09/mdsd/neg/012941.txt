I found this book quite unsatisfactory. The main focus is always on the Western Front (shockingly leaving out the Americans and their indispensable human and logistical support). The Eastern and Italian fronts are almost completely left out. The Author seem to ignore that millions of soldiers fought and died far from the Marne and the Somne (being Italian myself, I would like to remind the Author that the Italians had 600,000 dead and millions of wounded in the Great War). The sacrifice of Russian and Italian soldiers kept hundreds of German and Austrian divisions far from the Western front and the British troops. And what about the big blounder of the Peace of Versailles? Is still too embarassing for Mr Keegan to talk about it?
