Having enjoyed other books by Mr. White in the past, I was enthusiastic about ordering this book. Once into it, however, I was bored silly with the self-pitying Austin, much time is spent on his concern with being 50-something and increasingly fat; the girly whimpering princess-like Peter; and the neurotic, poorly adjusted, lecturing Julien. Not to mention the nauseous youngsters that early on make up Austin's Paris social group. Another negative was the revolting obsession of this book with the European bourgeois, always present with it's titled people, nobility and wannabes, creme-de-la-creme socialites and the gaseous Austin's attachment to all the above. Austin's character to me was weak and unbelievable, heaping gifts and adoration on everyone he had met in the past regardless of how they treated him. The only portion of this book I found interesting and in keeping with the quality writing style of Mr. White was the brief fling Austin had in Providence with the homeless man recently out of prison. I found the main love story sugary and mundane, the characters dull, and the constant berating of American culture overdone. To summarize this book, I would considering it the droning love lost lament of a middle-aged pedophile socialite absorbed with the lifestyle of the rich of Paris
