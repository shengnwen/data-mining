I have an only child and am always interested in learning more, the categories seem to be the same as what I have already read on.   I would not by this book, simply because of the title.  I do not think "sins" is appropriate and it is a big turn away to me.  Many parents of only children feel inadequate having only one child and to use this in the title just doesn't help much.
