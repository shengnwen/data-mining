If you are looking for a book on how to live on a limited income, this is not your book.  Nina Wildorf seems to live in a world that doesn't involve student loans, car payments, or the idea of a savings account.  Her rule of thimb for budgeting is 20% of your income towards clothes.  This is not fical responsibility. 

And only wash your jeans every 6 months so that they don't fade?  Really?  Am I the only one who thinks this is odd?

On the other hand, she does have some cute ideas for decorating on the cheap--I am glad to see that someone besides me goes dumpster diving!
