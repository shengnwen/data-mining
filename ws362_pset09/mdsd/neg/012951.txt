I bought this book sight unseen as a present for my niece, but gave it away to a local charity instead.  Much of the material is out of date (it predates the fall of the Soviet Union, and the explosion of archaeological discovery that has happened since then in Central Asia), and the book itself is poorly produced --- the printing is fuzzy, and many of the images look like third-generation photocopies
