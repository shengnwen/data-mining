Based upon the very good reviews, I was expecting something better. Someone said on "Lover Awakened" forum that it was a very good read, while waiting for J.R. Ward to produce her next opus. Very similar writing ...
Alas, I could not find anything similar ... I found the book boring. Could not finish it, stopped at page 100 and browsed until the last page to see what happened ... 
Even the cover is not OK (look at the PAWS of the male !)

Would have rated ZERO stars if possible ...
