The first few books in this series were so good - this one was dissappointing. I enjoyed the wholesome nature of the early books (and the last two), but this book was written entirely about the time when Ralph was lying to his family about his whereabouts and employment, hanging around with shady company and engaging in questionable activities. The author wrote about his own life, but some details about the lying and stealing could have been ommitted and made the book more consistent with the wholesome tone of the early books in the series. The book is interesting and more action-packed than most of the later books, but I would not recommend this one for family reading. The early emphasis on honesty and integrity are entirely lost in this book, with no apparant remorse over the loss. The series is often advertised as being perfect for families, but the later books are not materials I would endorse for young people. It's an entertaining book, but I don't feel I'm a better person for having read it. It does not come close to the standard set in the early books in the series
