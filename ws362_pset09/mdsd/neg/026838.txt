It seems absolutely amazing that almost every book of pseudo science on Amazon has an avid following of reviewers who, after reading the cited volume, have found the ultimate truth of the universe. This one is obviously no exception. 

I simply point to the review below mine written by Eric Tiller. In his review he points to 8 "well researched" points. The only one that really stands out to me is point #5. The rest of the list is simply a bunch of philosophical mumbo jumbo which might bring one to go "Hmmmm", but certainly shouldn't make anyone think they may have seen the hidden face of some creator. So there exist 7 points that say, "Wow, cool look at this isn't wild! You know science has no explanation why this happens the way it does. Therefore it must be the design of some unseen creator". 

It is the same old tired argument used by the Intelligent Design community. If you can't see how flimsy the argument is to begin with, I truly feel sorry for you. Trying to prop it up further with more pseudo science, hand waving and inferrence doesn't make it any more believable or substantial.
