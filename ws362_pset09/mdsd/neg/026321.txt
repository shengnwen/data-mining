As usual, this book ignores the 16-20 million non Jewish victims of the holocaust. This is very disappointing. The holocaust is not exclusively to Jews-as historians have portrayed it. What about the 7 million Ukraines? MIllions of Polish, prisoners of war, crippled, handicapped...I guess historians view their lives as less valuable
