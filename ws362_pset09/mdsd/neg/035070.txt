Contrary to what it says at the top of Amazon's page for the audiotape version of this book, Bill Bradley is NOT the &quot;reader.&quot;  Someone named John Randolph Jones is the reader.  This is a big issue for me, as I  wanted to be able to hear Bradley speak these well-worded essays on life.   Too bad HighBridge didn't get him to do that.  AND too bad Amazon.com  didn't cathch this fact and write &quot;read by other&quot; at the top of  the page for this product
