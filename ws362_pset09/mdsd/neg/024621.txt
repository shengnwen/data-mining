This book was a bad book.  One reason it was bad was that you can almost predict the whole story after reading three pages or so.  Also the book had a good plot,but ended up with a boring conclusion.  It was about a little boy named Egan who is visiting his Aunt and Uncle in the town of Instep.  The main attraction there is an old volcano called Kneeknock Rise.  There is a &quot;Megrimum&quot; at the top of the mountain.  It is a very scary ledgend.  The people of Instep are afraid of it. So Egan goes up to the top to slay the &quot;Megrimum&quot;.  This was the only exciting part of the book
