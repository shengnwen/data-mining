As someone thoroughly interested in Gregory of Nyssa and his promotion of Paul's idea of apokatastasis, I was disappointed to read that Danielou seems to be the only Nyssa scholar (living or not) that believes that Nyssa was not a proponent of universal salvation (read: restoration.) His exclusion of Nyssa's sections from The Life of Moses that support apokatastasis was especially disappointing.

Altogether, though, I felt that the compilation was simply not a coherent stream of thought. Jumping from Imago Dei to the Song of Solomon was too much for me...I like my compilations to make a little more sense as I'm reading them--or at least have transitions from topic to topic that make the entirety of the reading a little more cohesive
