I found this book awfully foolish.  Okay, there is the story about murdered math teachers - that gets Savich and Serlock into the story.  Then we have a kidnapped little boy who is found within the first 50 pages and the rest of the book is, of course, the love story - that's the sheriff (Katie) who found the boy and the boy's father (Miles).  Whoever wants the little boy keeps trying until he is found out and killed.  Of course to intertwine Savich and Sherlock in the books, they know Miles and they come out to help - I don't see where they really helped, their coming to "help" did not do anything for the mrudered math teach storyline or the little boy that is kidnapped.  They are just in the story. Of course, everything is settled in the end.

The books are becoming predictable.  Maybe since I haven't read any romance/thriller/FBI books before, I was looking for more of a story.

The Cove and the Maze put this book to shame.  I hope the next one is better
