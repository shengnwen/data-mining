Selfish is a word that quickly comes to mind as a good way to describe Rebecca Eckler. She's not a bad writer or storyteller, but she really paints herself into a corner here and makes herself almost impossible to like. She is self-oriented at a time when some thought might best be given to her child's welfare, and yes, as everyone surely noticed, she smoked during her pregnancy. This woman needs to mature. She likes to think she is a cool person, a woman in touch with the scene and one of those who defines her era, but I found her deluded and irresponsible through and through. Where was the deep maternal side to her? Her baby seemed to represent an annoying interruption to her "life of amazing hipness". If she is in any way a self-created role model wanna-be, then she adds to my fears for the future
