This book has an appealing title and author.  It does not deliver content.  The co-author Howard Cutler stumbles through endless interpretation of the Lama's ideas.  It seems as if Cutler is trying to filter eastern philosophy through a western filter while oversimplifying for the reader.  It is unclear if Cutler is "dumbing down" his analysis for the simple-minded reader or possibly just is not good at writing. The book would be far better without his aggravating interjections.  
"Ethics for a New Millenium" is a much better choice if your looking for a book by the Dalai Lama
