No. No, no, no, no, no.
Well, maybe.
At the library, this book was in the Young Adult section. I suppose it should be moved to the children's section, because as I read it, I felt like a child learning to read. The style was rather bland, and much like the stories I used to write when I was in the fifth grade. The style was the first thing to turn me away, as well as several cop-outs in the writing. 

Cop-outs how? Well, it wasn't very realistic. At all. While yes, most teens are overly dramatic, their parents and teachers aren't. It didn't seem realistic that a parent would leave once a child came out of the closet, rather than kicking him out. It didn't seem realistic that the parents ALL became so easily adjusted to it. It WAS realistic that some of the teens were so naive, but it didn't help at all. Things went exactly as the characters wanted them to, and it wasn't that interesting. It was rather obvious how everything was going to happen; when one character said they wanted something to happen at a certain place and time, it happened. There were hardly any obstacles, and the background characters were all really, really fake.

The plot to me, seemed a bit dry as well. Overall, the book didn't impress me. Yes, it may be aimed towards younger people, but hey, I AM a younger person. I wasn't impressed, however. Others may have been, but it just wasn't happening for me.

Hey, the guys on the cover are sorta cute. Sorta
