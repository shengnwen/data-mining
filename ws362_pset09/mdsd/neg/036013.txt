This is a repeat of the first 2 books for the most part. I do understand that the "Rich Dad Classics" aren't meant for tips and specific methods of making money, but rather a rich mindset.

Mineset, but ANY specifics? No. They are his best kept secrets. You would have to attend his money making seminars (i.e. spend more money) It's understandable to emphasize the importance of mindset in a book or two, and I did really enjoy the original "Rich dad, Poor dad," but it seems like ALL of his books are just about the mindset. What good is a mindset if there is no real direction in executing it. Don't waste your time reading this book, it's also the thickest of the three. If you haven't already done so however, read the original "Rich dad, Poor dad.
