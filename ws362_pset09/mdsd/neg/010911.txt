I am just 100 pages into this plotless story of falling down buildings.  I thought I would check the reviews to see if others thought it worth spending my time on to the end.  Since I have read 3 or 4 others by Nevada Barr, I don't know why I am having such a tough time with this one.   I have set it aside once and picked it up again.  This time I've managed to struggle thru 100 pages, but so far it hasn't hooked me.
