In a time when reformed theology is on the rise, Pinnock and his co-authors seek to provide an Arminian understanding of Scripture.  However, the book is strewn with problems.  The authors claim that God's love trumps other attributes like holiness and justice, but they give no scriptural support.  Their arguments are based simply on our western sense of fairness.  They make such appeals because they believe our moral sense reflects truth, instead of recognizing our fallen nature.  In addition, they advocate "making peace with the culture of modernity" (27).  Instead of letting God's Word shape our thinking, they allow our lost culture to shape our view of God's Word.  

The result is a presentation of a weak, helpless God.  In fact, the authors state "it is more important for God to give himself to his creation than to rule the world or to be worshipped" (35).  He is described not as ruling, but as "limited by humanity" (40) , vulnerable, and "the defenseless superior power" (175).  The book has weak, humanistic argumentation, little scriptural support, and a harsh tone toward those who embrace reformed views, views said to be "theologically repugnant" (84).  Do not waste your time with this book.  While there are legitimate differences between Arminian and Calvinistic views and a place for dialogue, this book does not give dialogue but instead gives unsubstantiated claims that leave you with a helpless God not in control and not worthy of worship.  

In case you do not know, the editor of this book embraces the view that God does not know the future.
