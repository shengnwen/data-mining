I shopped around a lot before I purchased this book from a used book dealer.  I needed more than one, so I had to shop around.  I ended up buying more than a few.  These books are in excellent shape, no highlighting, no writing in the books, and fantastic bindings.  The base price was less than most of the prices in the Amazon listing.  Even the publisher's price for a NEW book was less than most of the listings in Amazon.  I find it sad that folks are selling books with higher prices than the publisher is charging for a new one
