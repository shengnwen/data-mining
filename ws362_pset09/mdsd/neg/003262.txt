I'll admit this book contained some entertaining plot twists/intrigue/romance, but the fact that Orczy bases its plot on the incorrect assumption that all those involved with Republic of France in 1793 had the collective logical reasoning skills of a house plant does not add a thing to the book's entertainment quality. Though writing from the popular view that Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety were directly responsible for all violent, hateful, vengeful, destructive, deceitful, sinful, and corrupt behavior in Revolutionary France makes for an entertaining read, it is absolutely false, and detracts drastically from the book's appeal. "The Elusive Pimpernel," like many other Pimpernel books, has a simple one-dimensional plot with simple one-dimensional characters who are either very very Good or very very Bad all the time. If you want a quick and painless sensation novel in which very little thought is required, I heartily recommend "The Elusive Pimpernel.
