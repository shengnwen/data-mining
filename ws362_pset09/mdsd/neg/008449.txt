I tried to read this book.  Then I flipped ahead and read spots of the book.  I could not, as a young Black Anthropology student juggling several more forward thinking and socially relevant books this summer, bring myself to include this backward-thinking, embarrassing 200+ pages of pompous garbage.  I have old classmates and distant family members that were actually raised in this way and on a daily basis measure themselves and those around them by this pathetic, haughty litmus test. It disgusts me that this deluded ideology still exists to this day, and we are led through the grandeur of the Black elite by Graham, who justifies much of it as he admits to eventually feeling obligated to get a nose job.  This book was offensive at best and frustrating in this day and age to understand.  I will grant that the book was accurate in its historical value, but after reading what led to this intra-racism, there is simply no reason to me as to why this should be glorified and perpetuated within Black American culture.  Perhaps Graham would have been better off with a more well thought out, less repetitive historical text expounding on just the Introduction through Chapter 2, with research that would be actually useful and insightful from a more scholarly source as well as accounts from these early Black entrepreneurs and their families in ways that don't come off so self-aggrandizing
