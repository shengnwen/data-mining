While not the worst computer book that I have read; this one straddles the fence quite nicely. The author seems to know his subject, but is a bit scatter brained in places. In some instances I have to re-read paragraphs as if it were code itself. It only gets two stars, because grammar seems to be as important as content. It's an okay book otherwise, but the could have left out the xml primer, as it wasn't very meaningful. The overall content of the book is good, but nothing really seems to stand out here
