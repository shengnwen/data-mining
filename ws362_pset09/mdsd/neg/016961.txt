By my good fortune I happen to have had the pleasure of  working with Master Kwan, However briefly, in Boston last winter. Drawn to him by "The Wandering Taoist" I happened upon him in the Boston public garden, Teaching. After a couple of months, working together with his students and speaking with them about their experiences with him, I heard a few things that could be of use to the validity of Deng Ming-Dao's work. It turns out that when I once questioned Master Kwan's main student (of ten years) about Deng Ming-Dao's work, he said that he had met Deng Ming-Dao and was present while he was being tought. that said Master Kwan's student then stated that Ming-Dao was a  western man who had asked Master Kwan if he could write a book about him. Master Kwan agreed an told Ming-Dao a few stories and such. Afterwards Mister Ming-Dao proceeded to say that he had no further use for Master Kwan, and left.  To this day Master Kwan has never read any of the material published about him, nor has he recieved any kind of royalties from Mister Ming-Dao. That said, it must be understood that Master Kwan wouldn't trouble over such things as royalties, he leads a very humble life, but his students do find it frustrating. If you would like to see Mater Kwan for who he really is, I invite you to visit the site that I stumbled upon last winter at; www.easternheathpractices.org. I hate to slander anyone over such things but I feel very strongly about this. Thanks for your time and patience
