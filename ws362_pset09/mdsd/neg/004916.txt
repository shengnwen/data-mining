I have not read the book but tried to listen to the audiotape version and found it hopelessly tedious. Some of the problem may be as a reviewer of the CD version mentioned, that the author has no gift for narration. 

The mix of Buddhism and psychology, two subjects I usually find interesting, doesn't work, at least as far as I got - two tapes on - before I stopped listening. 

The Buddhism focused on the author's near obsession with the Zen tea ceremony, which she describes in a way that makes it sound about as spiritual as operating a Mister Coffee. Whatever she gets out of the tea ceremony, she is not communicating it here. And if you are not fascinated with the Zen tea ceremony this book may not be for you. 

Meanwhile, the psychological bits are mostly based on case studies of the type that an old newspaperman used to call the "suspicious anecdote." The author always seems to be a heroic therapist, and the patient seems to attain Buddha-like insights within minutes of their encounter. The stories sound like outtakes from a "can-you-top-this" contest in the bar of a psychotherapists' convention. 

In the end, listening to this book felt like having my teeth cleaned by a well-meaning but ham-handed dental hygienist. The best part was the Zen silence after I stopped listening.
