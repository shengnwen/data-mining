I have been making soap for about 3 years and I have had a lot of botched batches of soap along the way.  Most of my mistakes were by following the advice of &quot;experts&quot; who have written books about how to make soap.  At the beginning I bought Susuan Miller Cavitch's book on how to make Natural Soap and Herbal Soaps and I tried to follow her advice.  I couldn't figure out how to calculate the lye. You have to be a &quot;rocket scientist&quot; to figure it out if you try to do it her way.  I followed her advice on putting wax paper in the bottom of my box and the wax paper turned to mush and I couldn't get the soap out without mashing it all up.  I started out by making huge batches of soap like she said and I found that when a batch of soap doesn't turn out you have wasted huge amounts of time, effort and money.  And what do you do with all that soap unless you are in the business of selling soap?  And what beginner is? I think l-2 pound batches are much better.  You can experiment and learn your craft and not have huge amounts of money lost if it fails. She has no recipes for small batches.  Also I think 80 degrees is way too low for the fat temperature.  I have found that ll0 degrees works out for me every time.  Soap making is really easy, not nearly as scarey as she makes it look.  I did like the sources at the end of the book and have found some really good suppliers from it.  All in all, I think her book is interesting to read, but just don't take it too seriously if you are a beginner.  If you have been making soap for a while, then pick it up and read it
