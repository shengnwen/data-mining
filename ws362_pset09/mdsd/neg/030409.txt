Butterfly Stories is pretentious and overwritten creating a writing style that presents the reader with prose that is obscure for obscurity's sake.  This was a most annoying and unfulfilling reading experience.  Similar to some of Vollman's other work - this novel is primarily about a man developing unhealthy attachments to prostitutes with Vietnam and the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia as background.  Unfortunately the writing style is so overblown it gets in the way of good story telling.
