I very rarely put down a book before finishing it, even if I don't like it.  This one was impossible for me to read, though, and even though I tried, I could only get a quarter of the way through it (200 pages) before I decided life is just too short for such aggravation.  

I wanted this to be one of those books that you can get lost in and sticks with you once it's over...it's very long, spans many years in the lives of the characters, interesting plot idea, definitely seemed to fit the bill of a pleasurable read.  It didn't turn out to be one of those books, however.  To begin with, it's slow.  On top of that, the story unfolds through a narrator (the author I suppose) who goes off on tangents unrelated to the story, making personal observations on people and life and society in general that last for paragraphs and even pages. Very frustrating!  The book would have been half as long if the author had stuck to what we wanted to read about...the story.

I gave this book 2 stars instead of one because I can see how the story itself would be an engaging one.  Too bad the author's own voice torpedoed it.

Edited: I finally picked up Vanity Fair again and forced myself to finish it.  I hate leaving anything undone and couldn't leave the book unfinished. I still love the actual story and I still have no patience for the interminable narrative.
