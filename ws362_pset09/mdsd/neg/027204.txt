This book is about 100 pages of big type. Just a bunch of hearsay stories thrown together with no attempt made to validate them. It may be a good read for middleschool level reader; but it will never be worth the ... that I had to pay for it. This is a 3$ book that you buy at a book fair in a Junior High School
