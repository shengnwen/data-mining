What type of biographer gets the birthdate of his subject wrong? Roger Morris's angle on the Clintons was pretty obvious in the opening pages. The tale we were in for was one of compromised values, and unvarnished ambition  without any real ideals. I find the Clintons interesting, even fascinating.  I am not an apologist or even a fan;  I've read books that have both  praised and pilloried them. And certainly, every biographer is entitled to  their own point of view. But I lose all respect when I come across errors,  especially ones so obvious as that which appeared on page 109.  Morris  states that in January 1947 Dorothy Rodham gave birth to a good natured  baby girl. Anyone who has followed the Clintons -- least of all a  biographer who spent over 3 years studying his subjects -- knows that  Hillary Rodham Clinton was born on October 26th, 1947.   That's where I put  the book down, feeling a bit had.  After all, any biographer who could be  so carelessly cavalier with such a basic fact would have no problem bending  impressions, quotes, etc to make his case. Inexcusable. Speaks volumes  about the author, and about the sorry state of publishing right now.   ellenpward@aol.co
