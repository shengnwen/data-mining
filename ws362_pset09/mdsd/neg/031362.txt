There's nothing new in this book that haven't already been said. I was fairly disappointed, as I was hoping for a book that explained to the point what people want to spend money on, and how to technically go about to get those images. Instead, I get "advice" that is nothing more than common sense.

In my opinion, you can skip this book entirely
