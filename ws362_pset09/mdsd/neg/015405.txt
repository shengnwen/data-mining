  Let me just say I respect the NOI and it's leaders, particulary Mister Farrakhan.  However, the doctrine they are following is false.  Many former Christians and non-christians have been led astray by a religion that is supposedly the black man's religion, and the false pretense that Allah and Jehovah are the same God. However, just because something caters to a particular ethnic group doesn't mean it's right(liquor stores in black low income neighborhoods). In addition if the God of Islam is the same God of Christianity then their messages shouldn't contradict each other! The bible was written thousands of years before "Message to the Black Man". If Elijah Mohammed quotes the bible(which he does many times in this book) to prove his teachings then that means the bible has precedecence because it is the older source.  Therefore, if anything Elijah Mohammed says CONTRADICTS the bible (Farrad Mohammed was the Messiah who came in 1930????) you have to reject Elijah Mohammed, the latter source.  Judge Christianity by Jesus the Christ not so-called hypocritical Christian leaders from slavery times and beyond. If your tires go flat you fix not buy another car. Let's fix the Christian church so we all (black, white, red, )can go to heaven.
