Frankly, I was extremely disappointed with this book.  I originally bought it for a Data Structures class and soon found that it was never of any use.  The book is extremely hard to follow and, at times, fails to include enough information.  Such as Big-O notation.  I count a total of 5 pages that show no useful examples but constantly talk about Big-Oh (notice the &quot;h&quot;) while providing no solutions to finding the bounds
