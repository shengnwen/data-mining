First the book'll hook you up thinking that you'll read about some ruins in Yucatan. Then the main story changes to show us that the best US's spy just made mistake by mistake and they let him being a spy even if everybody knows all of his names. The book is too repetitive about how Buchanan changes his name and someone finds out his new name, made one mistake and one error until he blundered almost everything, but he is the only one to save his own situation. Meanwhile the book leaves you to nothing really interesting. Sincerely is a waste of time and trees
