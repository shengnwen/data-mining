This text is consistently unclear, convoluted, and confusing. Trying to learn biostatistics from this book alone would be like trying to learn violin by listening to the Rites of Spring.

When I ran into trouble with my stats homework, I had more luck finding answers with google than with this text. Reading the book actually made things worse. My first thought was that the index must be incomplete, until I realized that the entire book is incomplete. Coverage of basic topics is patchy and often completely absent. 

I hate to write a review without specifics, but this case is hopeless. Everything is bad. If this is your assigned text, I pity you. Go to class. Take lots of notes. Never look at this book
