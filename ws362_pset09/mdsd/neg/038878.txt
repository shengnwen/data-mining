No matter whether the reviewers here have liked ot disliked this book, they all agree that it's one you should pick up only if you are a Heinlein aficionado.  I can't disagree with that assessment.

Heinlein's political beliefs have always been very clear in his writing.  His characters often describe what is wrong with the world and how it should be.  However, in those stories it is a part of the narrative.  In this book, however, it is the main focus.  The story itself is thin, just a vehicle for long lectures on political and economic matters. I've read nearly everything Heinlein has written, so I'm used to his lectures, but when they last for dozens of pages, even I get bored and start flipping pages to see how much more I have to sit through.  The economy of his new world is novel enough to keep me reading through its explanation, but I do not believe the average reader would enjoy it.

If you are looking for science fiction, or any kind of fictional novel, this book will not satisfy you.  If you are interested enough in Heinlein's political and economic ideas to want to read over a hundred pages of them, then this is the book for you
