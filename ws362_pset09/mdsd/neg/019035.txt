Almost the entire book is written in question and answer format! I heard about this book on Janet Parcel's radio show and it sounds like the Dr. knows what he is talking about, but the book is not user friendly due to the format.  I was hoping for some in depth detail about herbs and supplements, but that is not what this book is about. Very disappointed...  :-
