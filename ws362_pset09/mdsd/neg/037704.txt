The Starter Wife started out promisingly vapid, in an entertaining way, but rapidly became more disgusting than anything else.  The narcissitic self obsession rang true (not surprising given the author's similar lifestyle), and the ways in which it was indulged were fascinatingly ridiculous.  However, those descriptions only hold interest for so long, and then the book digresses into an unrealistic, annoying conclusion.  The insight into an actual L.A. Wife Of lifestyle is unbelievable enough; to try to throw in a homeless guy that leads an exemplary lifestyle then reconciles with his family and inherits their billions... there's a limit to the willful suspension of disbelief.
