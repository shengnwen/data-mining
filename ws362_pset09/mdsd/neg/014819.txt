I'm not sure I quite understand the 5 star reviews here. My sister-in-law raved about this and, after reading the reviews here, I picked it for our book club. I read this in two days and I'm not sure just what we'll discuss when we meet. I found the writing to be totally juvenile, about on par with a teen novel. No depth of character anywhere - not one character was developed enough to make me care. The idea that the doctor and sheriff would continue to be best friends with, and socialize with, the judge and his wife, who are so totally without moral compass is ludicrous. Exactly what was it they were afraid of?? The story was predictable to the end, and disappointingly so at that. There - discussion done.
