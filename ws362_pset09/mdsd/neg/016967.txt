The advice he gives men and women is ludicrious.There again 
working off sterotypes.No one in this day and age should be 
told it's ok to have random sex.Of course he aims this at the
male because it his warped mind only men go on a ramage after 
a bad relationship.Women do too but it's left out of the book
because as we all know he believes women are love starved 
junkies only craving romantic attention and romance.He also
believes,wrongly,that women are the most hurt,oh yes,that 
self worth and waves coming again at the woman.He views women
as somehow half a person without a relationship while a man can
build up himself financially and socially,if not sexually after
a break up.Women are the downtrodden in his view,the victims.
Save the poor little women from themselves is what I hear coming
from him.When it comes to men,he is right there ready for an ego boost saying,you can do it.He comes across as an over
protective father with the women.He has some need to see women
as needy,pathetic love junkies
