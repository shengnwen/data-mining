It is an inspiring story of truly epic proportions. One problem though.

Bruce Olsen couldn't write to save his life. 

I am no stranger to books such as this, I have read dozens and all of them are interesting in their own way, this by no means is the worst of the pack but I had heard such good things about it, probably the only reason I am giving this two stars instead of at least a weak three is because of the dissapointment I faced in comparison to what I had heard.
