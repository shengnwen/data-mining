The authors have made a great effort writing this book, which is divided up in two parts: macro- and microeconomics. It gives insight of how we should understand current economic affairs on both the macronomical and micronomical levels. The book does serve this purpose quite well. I particularly liked the summary at the end of each chapter.
The book does however lack in solid economic theory, which makes this book inconsistent. If you are an economics student I would not recommend it for you to actually study economics (there are better books around for that), but merely as a reference to understand that theory is what you learn at univerity, and understanding the theory in practice comes usually afterwards.
The big lack of this book is that it is only based from an American point of view and thus is not very useful for anyone living outside the US. Even the international economics chapter won't satisfy your desire to really understand what's is actually going on (when you don't live in the US). What this book totally fails to point out is that the US economy is very different to most other economies in the world.
On the whole two stars were awarded for this book, as I think that it is very useful to  help your understand the current economic affairs. At the same time it fails in providing solid economic theory, it is based far too much on the US economy, and it is incomplete on other parts. Yet, if you live in the US, are studying economics and want to understand what it all means in practice, this book will help you! If not, don't bother
