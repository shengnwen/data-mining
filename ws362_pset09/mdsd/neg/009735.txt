I was forced to buy and read this book for an American History class and I KNOW some may say that I am biased because I was required to read this book, but I must say, it is absolutly horrible. As a journalism major I found this book very hard to read. Every chapter talks about the same thing.  The delegates can't decide on anything, everything is based on property and nothing is resolved. (well, until the end, obviously) Perhaps that is how the real constitutional convention happened, but i don't need to read the same thing over and over for 200 pages. Often, the author side tracks on little tid bits of personal information about the delegates that seem totally unrealted to the story at the time. Unless you are a seventy year old man, I don't think you will find this book interesting at all
