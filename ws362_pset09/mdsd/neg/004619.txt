  Billy Budd is a handsome, if slightly dense, young sailor aboard the sailing ship "Bellipotenet."  The other sailors look up to and respect him because of his beauty and naivete.  All, that is, except for the master-at-arms John Claggart.  He has some kind of grudge against Billy and does his best to make life at sea rough for him.  When talk of mutinies is heard through the fleet, Claggart gets his cronies together to frame poor Billy Budd. 
 
It's not a bad novella, but Melville's language is almost too wordy to keep the reader focused on the story at hand and bogs down the pacing.  Maybe that has to do with the time period in which it was written, but I found myself re-reading passages just to make sure I knew what was going on.  Also, you're never really sure why Claggart is envious of Billy: his good looks?  the fact that the crew prefers him to Claggart?  he has a crush on him?  Ideas are hinted at, but nothing is ever made concrete.  I felt dissatisfied with the conculsion, too, but don't want to give any spoliers.  Overall, a so-so book
