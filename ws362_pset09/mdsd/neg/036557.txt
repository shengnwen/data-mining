original? please. uninventive. the vampire hunter. the vampires taking over. same old, same old. and if you don't have a story, don't write. a good story be chetwynd-hayes. not so bad by Barker. other than that..... Like to add that i don't hate vampires. i just hate recycling, vampire clans, so-called exciting intrigues, and melodrama
