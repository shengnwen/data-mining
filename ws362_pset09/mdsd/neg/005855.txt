This is a hard book to finish. The good doctor belabors the material with a particularly annoying baby talk style. The book wears thin quickly after the first couple chapters. Most of the "revolutionary" material consists of concepts already espoused in many prior books on creativity. This book should be listed as an example of "literary fluff" in a dictionary. Don't bother
