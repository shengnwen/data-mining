I bought this book since it was the most up-to-date book discussing financial careers.  I have found it to be too simplistic to be useful in my search for a banking job.  Odds are that you too are looking for a book that gives helpful info on job hunting - so if this is your purpose I advise against the purchase of this book.   Spend the extra few bucks and get the HBS Careers in Finance book instead
