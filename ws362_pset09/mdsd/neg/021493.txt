I bought this one because I want to better research the subject of vaccination before I have kids, but I didn't find anything credible here. Allen simply wants to tell his opinion and skew stats toward his point of view. True, there's a good story here and it's actually entertaining, but I encountered so many half-truths and so much misinformation that I had to put the book down.

And I couldn't even recommend it for it's entertainment value because of the fact that so many things there are blatant lies. For instance, in a passage where he was talking about Franz Kafka meeting Rudolf Steiner he says, "Steiner picked his nose throughout the whole conversation and Kafka was disgusted." Well I own Kafka's diaries and here's what Kafka actually wrote, "At first a quiet head cold disturbed him (Steiner), his nose ran, he kept working his hankerchief deep into his nostril one finger at a time." (page 49) And that's it. Kafka says nothing else about it. 

So the guy had a head cold and was using a hankerchief, but because Rudolf Steiner had a different position on vaccines than Allen, he is portrayed as a nosepicker so as to lose credibility. There's soooo many pieces of data that he spins in order to support his position, but you know what,that's done by many people today who just want to sell a book. But it's a shame that even in the stories themselves the guy in not credible. Stay away from this one.

UPDATE 4/6/07: Arthur Allen himself left a comment for my review, and not only denied lying about what I called him on, but lied yet again (I'm not making this up...it's all readable on my comments page.)
