This book wasn't great. I don't like the format of this book the way it was written by several different contributors. I don't feel it has any particular flow or direction. It touches of some supplements and on the macro and micronutrients but doesn't outline any particular diets for anything. If you want to read a little about effervescent creatine, a little about protein, a little about calcium, and a little about a few other topics then I guess this book would be for you but you can find way better information in other books or online. I don't recommend this book
