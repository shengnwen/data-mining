Hitchens can be a very sharp, insightful writer. A good mind well-stocked with infomation, history, and taste. This book, however, seems to have been thrown or pasted together as a piece of pulp writng, not up to his often very high standards of erudition and wit. Try reading his "Why Orwell Matters" for a glimpse of the real Hitch.
