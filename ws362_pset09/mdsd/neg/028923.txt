Oh, boy...I've read some bad books; unfortunately, this is right up there with the books I've liked the least.

I read some of this book on the subway and I had to really struggle to keep going.  there is not much of a plot and what there is suggests the old saying "a book in which not much happens rather slowly."  as for the investigative reporting, well, my comment is that I've read an account of the real thing - a substance that kills people (see An Air That Kills about the asbestos poisoning of Libby, Montana) - and I mean really, this is beyond a bad joke.   Juvenile in the extreme.

And the sex scenes were disgusting.  I have no problem with explicit sex, but I don't like a "When Harry Met Sally"-type restaurant encounter in which Rebecca is concerned with whether Max had cut his toenails.  Yuck!

Rebecca was unable to say no to anyone.  She can't say no to her grandmother who insists she stay for a surprise dinner; she stands up Max to stay, and of course it works out.  In real life she might not get another chance with Max.  Lipstick and then Jess and the baby move in and commandeer the apartment and somehow, this is OK.  Of course it all works out in the end, this being chick-lit.

And the way the story was told: so much was told, and not shown, and so much of what was put in is unbelievably boring.  Trivial conversations and minute details of the characters' actions and emotions.
