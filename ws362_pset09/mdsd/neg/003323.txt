My first clue should have been the reviews on the back, which appear to all be quotes from people who owe Froelich a favor for having been mentioned in her column or who expect to get a mention for talking up her book.  If you want some interesting gossip, the inside scoop on some of yesterday's news, read this book.  It's a quick, easy read and has a few amusing and/or eye-popping moments (I don't think I'll ever be able to eat Altoids again).  The trouble is Froelich didn't narrow her focus enough.  Part of her wanted to dish on the NY gossip scene and tell you how to get a foot into the world of the glitterati, and part of her wanted to give practical advice to Joe Midwest who wants to know how to get good PR for his local business.  She slips in a few quick tips and examples for Joe (who, let's face it, is far more likely to be considering this book just by sheer virtue of the fact that we're all more likely to be him than up and coming glitterati), but not enough or in enough detail to make it truly worthwhile.  Meanwhile, the ending drops off like she suddenly got tired of the whole project or had to leave in a rush to cover the Pitt/Aniston divorce.  My advice: do like I did and check this one out of the local library if you're interested; don't spend your hard earned cash
