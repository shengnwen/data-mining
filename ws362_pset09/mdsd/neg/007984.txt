This slim book, prominently featured on Arab and Nazi websites, is a collection of fevered fulminations by a leftist idealogue who, though Jewish by birth, chose to align himself with those who wish the demise of the Jewish state.  His presentations of Judaism, in which he claims that Jews are actually polytheists, are pure fiction, as even an elementary student of Judaism will realize.  This volume is not so much a book as an axe-grinding exercise, lacking any scholarly merit. This book will find an audience among enemies of the Jewish people and leftist cranks.
