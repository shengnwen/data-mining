I love to people watch.  I adore the human body and appreciate all the different forms and characters it comes in.  I bought the book because of it's promise to help show me How to Understand People And Predict Their Behavior.  I work with parents of young children (this ranges from beauty to the beast in character kingdom).  Parents come to me for help and I know that every person has a story behind him/her that presents itself as raw and unfriendly behavior at times.  I wanted to learn to be more empathetic to them.  Everything I learned about people, I learned on the job just by being attentive to people.  You probably know more than you think about reading people.  For example, a tanned face may reveal that the person's job or hobbies put him outdoors for considerable periods.  And people whose skin is very pale generally have few outdoor hobbies.  See, you probably can predict people already!  But if you want to see it put into lots and lots of words then this book will do that.   It could be fun to use the formulas to your advantage, you can derail the people-reader into thinking that you're happy just by humming!
