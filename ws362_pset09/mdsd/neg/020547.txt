Having worked in the mental health community for sometime, I was already familiar with this technique and have been using it already.  I felt the book was really droll and somewhat condescending in tone.  I wouldn't purchase it again.  His companion book "Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed to Do and What to Do about It" is a more practical read and enjoyable too--I would recommend that one
