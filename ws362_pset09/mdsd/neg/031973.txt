I truly disliked this biography, I thought it was poorly written & researched, melodramatic and frankly dull, given its subject matter.  I struggled to finish it.  Better books for insight into Alexandra are:  "Purple Secret" by John Rohl, et al. for its chapter on Alexandra's complex medical history; Robert Massie's "Nicholas & Alexandra" for its sympathetic understanding of Alix's traumatic childhood loss of her mother, and what it's like to be the parent of a hemophaelic (& despite Massie's inaccuracies, such as stating that Queen Victoria was strongly in favor of the marriage of Nicky & Alix & that she tried to talk Alix into it, when in fact she dreaded it), and, oddly enough, a biography of Alix's mother, "Princess Alice" by Gerard Noel, which gives excellent insight into Alix's parents and German background.  Also, "Advice to My Granddaughter" a collection of letters between Queen Victoria and Alix's oldest sister, Princess Victoria of Battenberg.  There is also "A Lifelong Passion", a collection of letters & diaries of Nicholas & Alexandra and the people around them. Any one of these has more value than Erickson's book.  I have not read Greg King's biography of Alexandra so cannot comment on it.  I've enjoyed Erickson's Tudor biographies, so I'm trying to be fair, but this one didn't cut it
