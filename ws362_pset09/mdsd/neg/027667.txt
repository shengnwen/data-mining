This book was too predicatable, I could see the plot coming miles ahead. A big dumb tough guy goes up against a bunch of bad guys and cops, and he doesn't even have a gun, all he has is his muscles and a strong tolerance for pain. You knew Goldie would turn out to be a hooker, and if that's a spoiler for you. You need to read more fiction and/or watch more sopa operas. The characters aren't that complex, rather two-dimensional and to make matters worse, Miller doesn't even give a twist in the plot. For the record, there have been a number of people who claim to work for God that has done evil deeds for there own selfish purposes. The Crusades for one. So, Miller you don't get any points from me on that one. Now for those of you that are saying. "Hey it's only a comic book, a big one but a comic nonetheless." I say, "That is BULLL!!" Read: watchmen, The Judas Contract, Future Imperfect, and The League part one and two. Oh and Elfquest and then tell me if a comic book can't be well, this no story piece of crap
