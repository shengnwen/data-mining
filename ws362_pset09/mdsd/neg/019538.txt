I have read one of theother books written by this author, and loved them, so I thought I would read this one as well.  The story was very good.  The wording was put a little too simply, but it was an overall good book.  It kept me interested, and I didn't put it down until I was done.  The only problem was that it was very short, and ended too abruptly.  The story didn't exactly end.  I would have liked to hear more about what happens to The Moochers.  Seeing some sort of conflict would have been nice
