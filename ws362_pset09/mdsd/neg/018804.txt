The entire book is rather predictable and leaves much to be desired, though in its defense the color complex is a ponderous subject. Don't get me wrong, there were parts of the book more interesting than others, but nothing whatsoever that encouraged a paradigm shift.  .  I didn't sense that the authors truly had the capacity to take on a subject of such magnitude. What was particularly disturbing, yet predictable was gross generalizations that are often used when referring to "the African culture".  Or that one of the authors offers that some black women simply look better with processed. Also the Color Complex didn't speak to the futility of Black Americans trading their birth names for  a African-based name within an ethnicity- or color-based context.  Too many clichés and colloquialism out of context.  Also thought it was strange that authors continuously referred to Jet, Essence and Ebony despite their [superficial] criticism of their perpetuating the light-skinned beauty ideal through advertisements.  It seemed strange that many large universities and sociologist that have collected statistically significant, qualitative data on the effects of color weren't really considered.  I thought the book could have benefited from a stronger black male, white female, white male experience, as well as an intelligent and dignified examination of how perceptions among African and Caribbean and other immigrants also plays a part in the color complex.
