I have lived in and travelled to Cuba several times over the past 45 years.  The author presents descriptions of Cuba: collapsing buildings, cockroaches, hunger, the young wishing to flee, her lover's father imprisioned and yet, never once does she ask or wonder why people are so poor and desperate.

How the author can be so oblivious to the suffering all around her and its causes (lack of human rights, due process, freedom of the press, freedom to associate, freedom to think) is sad, even pathetic.

So you have to wonder how Alfredo, the author's boyfriend, could love her unless he is a necrophiliac.  She must be dead from the neck up. 

In the book, she menations an American who is looking for weed.  The American tells her that she acts normally how he acts when he is stoned.  How fitting.

I couldn't bear reading past the first 100 pages.  The crime is that trees were cut down to print this drivel.
