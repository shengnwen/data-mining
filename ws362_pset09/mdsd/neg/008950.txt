Although I believe it was an honest effort, some of the information was misleading. A few of the authors views were in error as I know from experiance. (i.e. "a knife shorter than 3 inches is BS." I have seen people attacked and severely injured by screwdrivers and knives shorter than that.) There were some good points, and I'm sure that some people who have never been exposed to this will find the section on the use of a belt particularly interesting. Certainly NOT the holy grail of martial arts books though.
