I tried to read and love this book several times , and I have a degree from Columbia in Literature and I read a lot of Fantasy but I just can't get into this book!
Nothing HAPPENS! It just goes on and on and I can't like or identify with or wish to live vicariously through anybody!
Isn't that what the Fantasy genre is supposed to be about
