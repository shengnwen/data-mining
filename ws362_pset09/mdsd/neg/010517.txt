The begining of this book has lots of useful information including digging and diving for bottles. However, I was disappointed with the amount of pictures. The descriptions for most bottles were vague. I rated it a 2 because of the extensive listing of Jim Beam bottles. If you collect Jim Beam this would be a worthwhile book
