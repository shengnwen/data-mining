Loser by Jerry Spinelli could have been an interesting and overall good book but, in my opinion it was not because it was rushed and undeveloped.  The book chronicles the life of Donald Zinkoff from his first day of kindergarten to his last day of eighth grade in a mere two hundred pages.  Thus no grade is well developed and neither is any character but the loveable loser and main character Donald Zinkoff.  This book was attempting to give a good message about the life through school of a loser.  Because it is hard to go through your time in school with out true friends or any real interests to speak of let alone to be unatheletic on top of it.  But although the message was no doubt an outstanding one, it left much to be desired as a whole
