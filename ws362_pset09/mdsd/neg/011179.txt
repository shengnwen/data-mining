Why do authors do this to books. This book could have been really good but what does Linsey do she makes our hero a Cad. Nicholas and Regina have good chemistry and the story was rolling along just fine until after the wedding. Nicholas oh sweet Nicholas decides to dump his new wife at their estate and take off on a extended trip. How long you ask well as long as he sees fit. You see Nicholas has a secret. A stupid one at that. He was born on the wrong side of the blanket and he fears telling Regina. So takes another route and leaves. Wow he's a smart one. He thinks Regina won't understand. Hello her cousin Derick is illegitiment. You thinks she would accept it quite easily ,well that and she loves you. But you see Nicholas is a cad and not so bright. And when he decides to come back she has a little suprise for him. But does he get better, oh no that would be to easy for the author so he stays a cad alittle longer and finally at the end (know I won't tell you even tho it's not worth telling any how) he redeems himself. Yes its sad for this reader to tell you it only took our "HERO" 1 page to do all that redeeming. Even tho it was pages on end of him being a jerk. Don't bother with this one if you like your romance to be full of love, caring, deeper understanding of one another.
