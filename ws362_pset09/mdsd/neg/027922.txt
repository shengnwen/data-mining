Matthew 24:24 &quot;For there shall arise false Christs, insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.&quot;  I have met Glenda and read her first book, Love Without End, too.  She is sincere in describing her meetings with an amazing spirit of light.  The books are very New Age, and it is difficult to grasp what the point is.  The point is to contradict the Bible teachings of judgment and &quot;the good news&quot; of salvation.  Jesus continues talking in Matthew 24:23&amp;26 - &quot;Then if any man shall say unto you, lo, here is Christ, he is in the secret chambers, believe it not.&quot;  And, II Corinthians 11:14 - &quot;for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.&quot
