Overall, I was very dissapointed with Baker's approach and expected much more from someone with a good reputation for literary analysis.  I could accept his psychoanalytic speculative ventures about Booker T. Washington's personal biography, but as the major underpining of a judgement against Washington that he is intent on making, it is very thin.  Especially when there are no specific references from Up From Slavery, or testimony by students, acquaintances etc. to support such theorizing.  All in all I found it very unbalanced and unscholarly
