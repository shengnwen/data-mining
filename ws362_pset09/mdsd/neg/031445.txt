We purchased this and the second grade edition this year.  This is my first and last experience with these books and the author.  The only part of the books I found helpful was the math sections.  I feel the history was a bit over their heads and the study of Greek mythology for a second grader was rediculous.  In the fourth grade edition I was very dipleased to see evolution as a main source of study.  We are homeschoolers and I teach not only from the three R's but from the very Word of God.  No matter what your religious faith or lack thereof, I feel that placing an emphasis on one view being taught in in a broad spectrum is ludicrous.  I did not know the author's stand point before purchasing the books and will not line his wallet with my money again.
