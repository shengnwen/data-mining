This book does have lots of good information, but the author could have at least used spellcheck.  There are spelling errors on almost every page, as well as a few missing words spread around the book.  There are even a few places that the author copy and pasted an entire paragraph.  All of this left me thinking of this book as being cheap and I had to question the validity of the information if the author doesn't even bother to check for errors in his own book
