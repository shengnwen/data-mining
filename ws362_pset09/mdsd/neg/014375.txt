Where's the subtitle of this very effective book?  Did the modern editors simply take it away?  Darwin titled his book: "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" and subtitled it: "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."

When Hitler came to power in 1933, he had one overarching idea in mind: his radical Nazi racial philosophy built on the Darwinian principle of natural selection.  Hilter thought the Aryans were the fittest and he wanted to help speed up the "inevitability" of natural selection.  He first started off with the sterilization of nine categories of "the unfit" which were feebleminded, schizophrenia, manic depression, Huntington's chorea, epilepsy, hereditary body deformities, deafness, hereditary blindness and alcoholism.  He then worked his way up to attempting the complete extermination of entire categories and entire races of people.

Speaking of modern day little Hitlers, the Columbine High School shooters carried out their bloody rampage on Hilter's birthday, April 20th, and had planned on causing more than 500 deaths at the high school.  Shooter Eric Harris had written on his website, "YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE??? Natural SELECTION!  It's the best thing that ever happened to the Earth.  Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms."  After the bloody rampage, Harris' autopsy report revealed that he was wearing a T-shirt with the words "Natural Selection" emblazoned on the front.

Beware of those who hold this book dear to their hearts.  This book is not about man descending from the apes.  The ideas in this book have caused and continue to cause more deaths than any other notion in modern history
