This planner is pretty poorly organized.  For example, the section on announcing your engagement (which one might expect to be in the first chapter) isn't until Chapter 4.  Setting the date is in Chapter 3, after you've already read about selecting your wedding party in Chapter 2.  It doesn't make much sense to choose your attendants before you even have a date, so why organize the book that way?  There also wasn't much new information in the book that I hadn't read somewhere else before.  However, the checklists seem somewhat useful; I've only used the budget checklist so far.  There are no pockets to hold business cards or contracts or notes, a definite drawback. If you have State Farm insurance, you can get a special edition of this book for free through your insurance agent.  It sure beats paying 20 bucks for a mostly useless planner
