I have come to the conclusion that Ken Burns 
cannot make a documentary over 2 hours long.  
He is repetitious and on
a soap box throughout this documentary.  There are some
wonderful moments, but the east coast bias and the social
commentary get old very quick.  How many times, I groaned
at the screen, "not again"...I get it Ken, I get it...show
me some baseball already.  It is very apparent that
this documentary was made to be watched over the course of
2 1/2 months...it is unwatchable back to back.  Pick any one
disk and it is very enjoyable, but then put it away for a while
before you watch another one.  dissapointing
