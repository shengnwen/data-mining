I had high expectations for this book but I was let down after reading the book.  Power eating throws a lot of information at you in a very unorganized manner for the first 200 pages.  There are many times when the author contradicts herself especially in regards to how much protein should be eaten.  And in the end there is a diet plan that is very confusing and unclear.  This is not a very usefull book at all and I would not reccomend it
