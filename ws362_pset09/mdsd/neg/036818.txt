I think this book is an example of what sometimes happens when popularity overtakes quality.  This book is definitely popular.  Some might even call it a classic.  But it can't really compare with newer thermodynamics books that more closely follow the modern approach of teaching thermo.  It would not be fair to say that the book is incomplete, as it covers all of the necessary topics.  However, it does a fairly good job of making the subject more boring than it needs to be.  And to anyone who has learned thermodynamics must realize how serious a charge this is.  The single biggest obstacle to students struggling to learn thermodynamics is that they find the subject boring, and this book doesn't do anything to help the situation
