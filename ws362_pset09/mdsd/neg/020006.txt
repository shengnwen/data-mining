Reading this book is required for my school district's health course, and that is the only reason I read it. The Jarretts, a wealth suburban family, are torn apart when the older son dies in a boating accident. The frigid cow of a wife closes herself off from everyone else, while the son goes to see the 'wacky' psychotherapist Doctor Berger, who is incredibly irritating that I was tempted to skip every chapter he appeared in. Everything else in the book is just boring.

The characters are all obnoxious, with the possible exception of the father, and if I had the choice I would drown them all. If you want to read a novel about teen issues, there are others out there that are much more worthy of your money and attention
