I don't know about this book ~ it seemed awful confusing to me. Maybe you have to have a degree in math, geometry ~ trigonometry to figure these things out but ~ I have better quilt blocks to work on than these things. I took this book back to the store where I got it and told them to keep it. I like Jinny Beyer's books but this one ~ maybe at a garage sale when I have too much time on my hands. Pretty to look at but confusing layouts, confusing directions, confusing.. forget it.
