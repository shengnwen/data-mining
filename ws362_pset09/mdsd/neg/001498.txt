At first I thought this book was a wonderful learning tool and good story for my newborn son. However, the reference that some parents 'come the same' and the picture of a lesbian couple walking with a little girl was very inappropriate for an adoption book. Why do homosexual references need to be in a CHILDREN'S book??? This only opens up the opportunity for a young child to ask an awful lot of questions about same sex relationships, perhaps BEFORE a parent is ready to discuss. I will not be reading this book again
