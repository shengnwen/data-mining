I want to reinforce what other reviewers have implied but from a different angle. I'm sure this could be an excellent book for 1. someone who once had really great knowledge but has simply forgotten and for whom a memory refresher is sufficient, or 2. someone in a classroom environment at the same time (which is why you see all the students carrying it around) and even potentially is using another book or books at the same time.

But if you are looking to build your basic skills, it is not nearly explicit enough in walking the reader through everything required to make fundamental progress.  Much is implied or seemingly expected to be taught someplace else.  

I actually did have high-school French experience and thought reviewing & touching up would help, but even then have found not enough explicit fundamental instruction covering the details to be helpful.  The only way I ended up being able to work through it was with a dictionary and other references in one hand and this book in the other.  Ultimately I threw it away.
