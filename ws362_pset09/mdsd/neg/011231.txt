I bought this book as a text book for a college course. I was extremely dissappointed because the style in which Mr. Edwards writes is an excellent example of what a text book should not be.  I wondered if I had bought the clif note version. I felt this book was written like a cookbook.  It left a bad taste in my mouth, and I wanted to throw the recipe away.  I felt that Mr. Edwards book was an excellent example of &quot;easy way out&quot; management.  He limited the examples in the text to only the those he used, and left an impression that all of his decisions were correct. I would like to ask Mr. Edwards if he felt he was successful in running the PG County Fire Dept. using the discussed methods.  I would also ask if he felt the Dept. was in better shape after his tenure as Chief. If you are interested in learning to manage fire service personnel you may want to read this book, because of the limited information on the topic.  But if you set it down after the first ten pages dont be suprised, I have seen toast that wasnt as dry as this book
