The author does not contribute any new information in the book, you can easily get much more valuable information about dennis rader from the internet. 
Basically the author get the info from the news sources that everyone too have access freely.
Why buy the book if you can have much more comprehensive info from the net? This book is a total disappointment.

The author does not do much research on the subject, does not tell much about the monster's family history, no info about his daily life style, no testimonies from his neighbours, colleges or relatives. 

The book has 304 pages, with this much pages I expect much more info about dennis' life, in fact the author put pastor Clark as the centre of the story, not dennis rader as the monster.

The fotographs in the book are very minimal and boring as they are widely available on the net, anyone can have access to more pictures on the net.

The author seemed to have a quick interview with pastor Clark (dennis' pastor), but the info that he got from the pastor is totally not relevan with the crimes dennis commited.

I think the author should've put the title as "Pastor Clark", not the "BTK".

I am angry as hell and wish to have my money back, it is very very disappointing! DO NOT BUY!
