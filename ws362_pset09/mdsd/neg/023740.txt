I did not buy this book; I looked it over at the bookstore and decided against purchasing it.  The thing that didn't make sense to me is that praying the rosary is basically a christian thing. I agree with the other reviewer, he throws some new age stuff in there.  He also said that a friend of his who was Jewish prayed on the rosary, which really doesn't make sense to me, since In the book the prayer for the rosary is stating that Jesus Christ is your savior and Jewish people do not believe in Jesus as the son of God and savior. I don't know if that is the same prayer as the Catholics use or what.
