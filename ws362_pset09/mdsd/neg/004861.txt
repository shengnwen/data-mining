I'm pretty new in the trading world also but I have to go with the crowd and say that this was the absolute worst book ever on day trading. Whatever you do, don't buy this one! Get a toni turner book or something, but NOT this one. Alot has changed since 1999 so it's understood how some techniques can't be used anymore, but this was garbage even back then. 

He repeats everything hundreds of times throughout the book, "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread"

"you are the middleman" "you are the middleman"

In a bookstore read the first page of the foreword, it says that he was signed the book deal(1st one) even before he wrote it as a 23 year old. Proof enough that it's hot garbage
