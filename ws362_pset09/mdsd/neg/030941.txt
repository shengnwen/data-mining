Ph Miracle and Ph Miracle for Diabetes are pretty good books. But one thing to keep in mind is that you need to be Ph *balanced*. Don't take alkilinity too far. Just as there are negative effects from acidosis, there are also negative effects from alkalinosis, though it is much more difficult in western society to be over-alkaline than it is to be overly-acidic. 

The Ph of your saliva and urine should be slightly acidic at 6.4. That is what is balanced for humans. 

Read about acidity and alkilinity in the book "Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, and Food Supplements". This book is a wonderful reference for health and has never lied to me. After reading about those 2 topics in this book, you will be better able to tell the truth from a crock of raw meat in any Ph book.
