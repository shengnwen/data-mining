Boring.  That is the first word that comes to mind after reading this book.  After the first 100 pages-all I could think about was how much I would like to shake Marsali senseless!  What a selfish little snot! And the  rest of her clan is not much better.  For Duncan to have been this supposed  brilliant military leader - he really did not show much forcefullness or  leadership in this book - seemed more bemused than anything else. There was  also very little passion between these two.  If I had been Duncan - I  probably would have thrown Marsali into the dungeon and tossed out the key!  There was also very little suspense and too much harping over Duncan's  past. Get over it already Duncan - the past is over with!  I would love to  read a novel with a real man in it - one who has had past difficulties, but  has come to terms with them and doesn't have to &quot;deal with his  emotions&quot; before he can love someone! Too much of a 90's guy - getting  in touch with his emotions - not enough historical authenticity!   How  about a real MAN for a change - and no - I'm not talking about the caveman  type! Needless to say - this will be the last of this author's books that I  read - especially since this was supposed to have been one of her best
