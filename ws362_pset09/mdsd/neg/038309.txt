I had a very frustrating experience two times I tried to buy this book...each time I recieved book that had no illustrations or plates or diagrams that were listed in the contents...I had books with 174 pages when the book is supposed to have 300 pages...I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS ABOUT BUT I FINALLY CALLED BORDERS AND THEY HAVE THE BOOK WITH 300 PAGES WHICH I bought WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
