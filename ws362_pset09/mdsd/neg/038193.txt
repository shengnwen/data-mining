After having read this book as a relatively inexperienced trader, I recently re-read it as a more experienced one.  I found that I couldn't decipher the formulas for any one of the indicators presented during this most recent reading, so I called StatWare with the following questions: "Is the formula for the Kase PeakOscillator in the book or not?"  The answer was "No."  "Are any formulas in the book?"  The answer was "No."

Therefore, the book does, indeed, turn out to be a rather expensive advertisement for Cynthia's systems.  Don't expect to find much more in it.  If I am wrong, I would invite one of the reviewers who found these formulas in the book to share them with me through email
