I can see that this book has gotten many good reviews, but i think it is THE WORST textbook I've ever had.

Layout is extremely unprofessional. (often insufficient whitespace, inline numbers, symbols, parens and italics, very often flipping back and forth because text and exercise questions reference (poorly drawn) diagrams on other pages) like this is an example of bad layout. heh.

Exercise questions are poorly worded. (like Ex 11.5, 14.3)

General errors in main text, figures and solutions. (like pg320 last paragraph, Example 13.2 on pg 402, Fig 11.4 on pg 299, solution for Ex 13.6 on pg 641
