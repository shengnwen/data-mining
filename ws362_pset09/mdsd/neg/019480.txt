It's a shame that Rik Van Walleghem's abilities as a writer fall so far short of Eddy Merckx's brilliance on a bicycle. This book is flabby, repetitive, poorly edited and, in the end, not very informative. The only  other book I have read on bicycle racing is the equally dismal An Intimate  Portrait of The Tour de France by Phillippe Brunel. In my experience,  cyclists aren't stupid. They deserve better than this
