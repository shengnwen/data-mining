This would be a nice addition to the collection of a total Heinlein fan who just can't get enough of the works of a true SF master; otherwise it is merely a collection of cryptic sayings that are better understood in the context of the book(s) from which they are taken.

If you want to understand Heinlein's life philosophy, you should read a variety of his novels.

If you want to see his writing at its finest, read his short stories, especially "All You Zombies".

If you want pithy, useful sayings that give you helpful advice, you should consult to more time-tested sources such as The Book Of Proverbs (the lessons of Lazarus Long were, after all, put in the mouth of a fictional character who increasingly depended on friends with a time machine to pull him out of trouble ... not a resource available to most of you.)

But if you are a Trufan of Heinlein, you definitely need this
