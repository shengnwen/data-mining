To begin with, Nock makes an eloquent case for natural rights liberty and the criminality of the state.  His principles are wonderful, but his historical analysis is horrible.  He bases most of it off the perverted  works of &quot;Progressive&quot; historians, among them Charles A. Beard,  whose &quot;Economic Origins&quot; serves as the main basis of his  commentary on the Constitution.  Together with his mistaken history, he  also devolopes a misleading and destructive form of social class theory.   Despite this, the last chapter and essay in the appendix serve to redeem  the book somewhat.  I would recommend the work as a source of strong  libertarian principles and a solid indictment of the state( remember the  difference between the state and government).  However, I would suggest  that you might wish to supplement Nock's falacious historical view with  those of historians as  BernardBailyn, Gordon Wood, Pauline Maier, Carl  Bridenbaugh, and Forrest McDonald for a true analysis
