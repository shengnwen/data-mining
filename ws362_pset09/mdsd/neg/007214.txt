I have to agree with the previous poster.  This book just wasn't what I have grown to expect from Leigh.  I've read just about everything she's done and this is the first time I've walked away disappointed.  Anyone who knows of her August series would expect something of the same thing from her excerpt on her home page and from the back cover, sadly, there was none of that.  I fear that because Leigh is not writing under Ellora's Cave anymore that her books may continue to be toned down.  I do remember reading this book was pulled for revision last year.  I hope that is not the case, because her books are some of the best and hottest I've ever read.  However, if she continues to pull away from the less conventional I'm afraid she'll continue to disappoint some of her most loyal fans
