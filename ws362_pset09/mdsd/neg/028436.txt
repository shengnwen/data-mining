This is a discombobulated, disjointed piece of junk that has two redeeming features.  (1) It will cure insomnia, & (2) It is kind of fun if you live in one of the places where he traveled (Buffalo, in my case) to see how he disparaged it (not exactly inaccurately, in the case of Buffalo, but he did selectively write about the biggest eyesore in town, the Paderewski Dr. train station).  The "observations" are the sorts of things that would be made by a self-important college freshman, such as explaining to the benighted reader what is meant by the symbolic obesity of large malls.  That is, most of the stuff here strikes one as a big shovelful of malarkey, to put it politely, designed apparently to leave the impression that the author is intellectually superior, contrary to all objective evidence.
