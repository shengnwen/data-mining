I find this book slow, superficial, and dull. I keep waiting for something to happen, especially since a lot of people really really enjoy this book - am I missing something? 

I can't understand Chin's obsession with following Sarah around. I can't understand any of the characters' motivations and the plot doesn't flow, and neither do any descriptions or ideas. 

I can't wait to be finished with this book so I can start a new one (I don't like putting down books, especially since I've gotten so far)
