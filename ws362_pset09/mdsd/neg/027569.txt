   I found the first 50 pages or so to be intriguing, after that it became a grind to endure. Mr. Gardner makes very indirect references to the impact of the media on the vignettes that he recounts, yet seemingly asserts that the individuals involved acted in a vacuum.

  The author credits Bill Clinton with single handedly coming up with "mend it, don't end it" for welfare, yet does not explain how the Republican congress of 94 had any part in this course of action. 

   Darwin is treated as an infallible truth, yet Mr. Gardner does not address the lack of transitional forms, the various "truths" that are allowed to exist, like the stages of the human embryo [fish, primate with tail] and the lack of any new species.

   The author does have some interesting ideas, yet the simplistic characterization of the people or ideas that he analyzes [see the part on George Bush] fails to allow us, the readers, to form a realistic idea of the forces acting on them.

   So how do I change minds
