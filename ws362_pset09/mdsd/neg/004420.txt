That anyone can read this book and conclude that it is an intelligent presentation is, well, not very analytical. This book is about as deep as a thimble flattened by a steam roller. Save your money, don't throw it away. I wish that more evangelical Christians were using their education to write thoroughly researched books without borrowing from others like C.S. Lewis (who was not an evangelical). Giles is not original, but then neither is Rick Warren in his "Purpose Driven Life" (he just borrows from tried and true psychology and mixes Bible verses in with it). So I wonder, "Who is reading this stuff?" Maybe some of the kids (the ones who are doing any reading at all), or some who put Harry Pothead down for a minute to read something else?? The church has gone a long way in my lifetime and it looks like it's just about to jump off the intellectual cliff
