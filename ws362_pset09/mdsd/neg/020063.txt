While well-written and superbly organized, this book poorly met the needs of a recent graduate looking for work outside corporate world. A downright depressing read for those looking for a first job (treated as a &quot;special need&quot;), this book seems primarily designed for experienced sales and marketing professionals looking to move up in the corporate world. Those considering government work, having special needs other than &quot;too much experience&quot;, or with a short work history should consider a different guide. (Incidentally, while the book left the impression I was unemployable, after ditching Resumes for Dummies, I was called for an interview on the first job I applied for.)
