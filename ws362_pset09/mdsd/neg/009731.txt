This book assumes a lot of time is available to teach students civilized ways of treating others.  It does not serve those of us who teach middle or high school--we generally have 45 minutes per day, are required to complete the text in one year, and have students whose attitudes and habits are almost solidified.  This book has some great ideas which may work in elementary classrooms.  If you teach adolescents, I recommend books by Lee Canter or Randall Sprick
