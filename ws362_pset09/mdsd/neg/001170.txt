Ok, here's my journey with this book:

I watched the movie "The Notebook" and loved it
I read the book "The Notebook" and it was... alright
A friend told me "The Wedding" was better than "The Notebook"
I didn't see how it couldn't be
I started reading "The Wedding" and it was AWFUL
People kept telling me "oh, keep reading, it gets better"
The reviews on the back mentioned a surprising twist
I kept reading
It never got better
The "twist" occured with about 5 pages left and was lame

I have concluded that the people that read and liked this book must have been around 16 years old (unfortunately those who recommended it to me were older and should have known better) and haven't actually read a book that is well written and has a good storyline.  Easy read DOES NOT EQUAL good read.  This book was easy to read (in language, not interest)... it was short... but it was pointless.  There was no substance whatsoever and was really predictable and painfully drawn out (and it was only about 200ish pages... 50 would have sufficed)
