This book contains an interesting, but never really captivating story. All concepts that make this book worth reading are already present in the first third of the book. Subsequent developments are in line with the story, but I felt little value was added for most of the middle part of the book. Only in the very end, the pace picks up again into a dramatic conclusion.

If the book had been one third the size, I would have enjoyed reading it to the end. Now it just felt like a burden to complete it
