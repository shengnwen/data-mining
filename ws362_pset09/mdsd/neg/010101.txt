Interesting book, but more often than not the paragraph descriptions on relationships are pessimistic.  With an understanding that relationships are complex it would have been good to balance the summaries with the possible positive aspects should a relationship succeed. Theoretically more muddled than the previous books.   Not very uplifting but interesting.  Good conversation book
