Martha Grimes has had a good thing going with the Richard Jury series, until now.  Bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book.  More like muddled, drawn out, and difficult.  The story within a story is an intriguing idea, but it went nowhere.  The plot is weak, the characters' actions unbelievable, and the ending disappointing.  I have enjoyed reading this series, but to be honest, this book was a waste of time.  I think it's time for Jury, Plant, and pals to be put to rest.
