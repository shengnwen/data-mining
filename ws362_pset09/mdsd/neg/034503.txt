Although Katzenbach has become one of my favorite authors, you can tell that The Traveler is only his second book.While the story is interesting, his dialogue is weak and he doesn't move the story along at a fast enough  pace. He's come a long way since The Traveler. If you like really good  thrillers, try these books by Katzenbach--Hart's War (his latest), The  Shadow Man and Just Cause
