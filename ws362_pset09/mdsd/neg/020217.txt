First of all, I like to congratulate all the readers that read this book more than once.  That is quite a feat. ONE time is more than enough.  This book is so boring for a fictional read.  It reminded me of the movie, &quot;Solaris&quot;, which is about going back in time only it added another twist: if you could change the past, would you?  Anyway, that movie is just as boring, but I must say it is better than this book because the actress is hot.  I thought the author's concept of &quot;One&quot; is quite confusing.  For instance, the chapter when Leslie encourages her younger self to pursue playing the piano, a path she had not taken, this will affect her life and what she is now.  In any case, I don't think one decision can totally change a whole person's life as some readers suggest.  If this was the case, we would all be in deep trouble.  There are always exceptions, such as deciding to buy that lottery ticket and winning, but usually it takes many decisions to shape one's life.  I don't buy this decision-making plot or the plot that everything is &quot;One&quot;.  But two stars for the nice self-help pieces littered throughout the book and for the nice cover
