If you're familiar with Gerald May, you know he's spent the past couple of decades searching through the world's different spiritualities to find "authenticity" for life, so it's not surprising he's finally stumbled upon Catholic mystics. And it's also not surprising that he's worked hard to recast John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila in his own image, removing the most important aspects of their lives, which is Jesus crucified (he's called "John of the Cross" for a reason, you know).

This is not a book that portrays these two mystics accurately, nor does it put forth any form of orthodox Christianity, but is just one of the many dumbed down versions of New Age Christianity out there claiming that "God is nada, no-thing" (page 179) and that John of the Cross was not seeking "any specific image of God" for "It is neither the name (God, Allah, or Krishna) or the man (Jesus or Buddha) that is the final object of [man's] loving desire." (ibid)

And he concludes with the unhelpful advice "that's the devil of it; there is no way to know for sure. All we can do is hope for the dawn." In reality, John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila both knew for sure, even in their darkest nights - they couldn't see it, they couldn't experience it, they couldn't feel it, but they knew, and in faith continued on anyway.

Anyone really interested in these two saints' thoughts and experiences would be better off getting the Kavanaugh or the Peers translations of their works (available for free online or in cheap paperback editions) and working through them personally.
