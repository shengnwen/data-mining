What a rip off.  The recipes in this book seem like they were ripped right out of the pages of Ladies Home Journal.  And what's up ladies?  Is that what happened?  I mean, you can get better, simpler, tastier recipes than this online without having to buy the book.  As for the rest of the stuff that the book says, I agree with other reviewers that there is nothing new here.  Nothing at all.  It's as though it were written by someone taking a writing class for the first time.  "Okay class, we are going to write about what's in our refrigerator.  I'm going to need your composition to be 1000 words and you're going to talk about what might be in a refrigerator if you were trying to eat more healthy foods."  It's blather.  If one needs something like this to be healthier, they have many other issues that should be addressed first
