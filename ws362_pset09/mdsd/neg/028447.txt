 As my first exposure to Central Asia, this book was a soul-crushing experience; much of my inital enthusiasm quickly evaporated in the face of dry lists of succession, poor writing, and general lack of organization. The maps were worthless- I had to print and label my own in order to follow the obscure smatterings of geographic references. I can not comment on the accuracy of this piece; Frye throws enough arcane material at readers to appear informed, but nevertheless fails to bring the subject to life
