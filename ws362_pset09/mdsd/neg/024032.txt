The reason I decided to finish this book is because by time I had read to page 400, I figured I might as well keep going. This book is a real drag. The 700 pages are a classic Ludlum example of 'Quantity, not quality.' This book easily could have been 300 pages less.  Most of it is political talk in which Robert tries to keep your attention by adding exclamation points or italics within every sentence. 

After reading the Bourne series and Matarese Circle, this was way too long. I can't believe other reviewers when they claim this was 'action packed' and a 'page turning thriller'. One review said that the rescue in part one was so exciting they couldn't stand it. 

I am still waiting for this book to pick up and take me away with all the action that most reviewers have proclaimed, but it's too late for that because I have finished. Not even enough substance to keep my interest. I just wish I had it in me to take a book and stop reading it after I've gotten 2/3 of the way thru. The reviews that raved about this Kendrick guy being the next Bourne and that this book could have been 3 exciting books... One, not even close. Two, sorry but one drag is enough. One star because it has some similarities to today's war on terror in America and one star to me for somehow surviving this one= 2 stars
