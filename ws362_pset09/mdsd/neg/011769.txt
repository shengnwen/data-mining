Whoever edited this book should REALLY rethink their profession.  If you've already decided that you want to carry a handgun for self defense, you can skip the first 100 pages of this book.  If you already know something about handguns, there's almost another 100 pages you can skip.  All the information contained in this book on actually shooting a gun in self defense (tactics), you can fit into a pamphlet, while the most irrelevant, meaningless details of dozens of self-defense stories are elaborated on exhaustively.
Then there's the racist innuendos.  White criminals are simply "criminals".  Black and Hispanic criminals are specifically "black" and "Hispanic".  I find it very hard to take advice from small-minded or ignorant people.
The chapter on state regulations fell far short of my expectations.
The author may know a lot about defending himself with a handgun - but it's painfully obvious he's spent more time shooting than he ever has writing, or reading for that matter (beyond maybe Guns & Ammo).  While trying perhaps to be comprehensive, he totally loses focus.  The only thing this is a "manual" for is how to almost completely miss the point of your title in 500 pages or less
