While I very much enjoyed Cohan's writing style and command of the English language, I found the content disappointing.  This is NOT a book about Mexico -- it's a look into the author's very self-absorbed mind.  I suspect we would have gotten much the same book if he had been dropped in the middle of Cleveland
