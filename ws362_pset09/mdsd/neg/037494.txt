I am a decades-long lover of Southern Living publications. Whether we buy the magazines, the cookbooks, or the home products, many of us count on Southern Living for unsurpassed quality and creativity.

I am extremely disappointed with "Christmas with Southern Living 2005". This edition marks the 25th Anniversary of this regularly phenomenal book. I can hardly believe this belongs in the same category as the volumes from previous years. 

Certainly, the color photography remains true to form, wonderfully presented. But it's the sheer lack of creative craft ideas, and the fewer number of quality recipe ideas that mar this normally fantastic book. I was expecting a five-star product for the silver anniversary - what I fear I've received is far below what SL should have offered.

I expect CwSL 2006 to make up for what 2005's edition was lacking - this company will most certainly not let us down again. I'll continue to buy Southern Living books without hesitation - and with excitement! I'm simply disappointed that the 2005 book will find its way to the back of the bookcase
