Bill Adler has taken past interviews, articles, and speeches of Oprah  Winfrey and complied _his list_ of her best quotations. It's an  unauthorized book - meaning Oprah didn't write it nor was she involved in  the production. Some quotations show the source of information with a date  and some don't -- which makes it a bit disappointing not to have the  history or context pertaining to the quote. If you have an extensive Oprah  collection, you'll want this book just to say you have everything,  otherwise there are many other good Oprah biographies available
