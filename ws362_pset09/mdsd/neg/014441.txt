Two weeks before purchasing this book, I first read about the Montauk Project and the other conspiracy theories surrounding it.  However, I did not brush them off.  On the contrary, I was fascinated by the idea that something like this could have possibly happen.  For two weeks, almost daily I read more about Camp Hero and what supposedly went on there.  I saw pictures of the base, both before and after.  Interestingly enough, I began to believe in what I was reading.  

It was at this time that I purchased this book.  Shortly afterwards, I was convinced that any secret projects conducted by the US military at Montauk Point were completey fabricated within the minds of Preston Nichols and his constituants.  Nichols, who introduces his book as one that could be read by sci-fi fans and scientists alike, definitely throws around his scientific terms throughout the book.  But for someone who has spent the majority of his life working in a field that deals with subject matters most people can't even grasp, Nichols writings are surprisingly at a fifth grade level.  What's worse is that Nichols spends an unexcusable amount of time going on and on about his investigations into the Montauk Projects rather than his recollections of the project, which are supposedly so vivid that they warrant this book ever being published.  This book is unquestionably boring.  This comes from someone who was very very interested in the topic and who was starting to believe that the proported truths in this book were real.

They almost had me..
