"Coping with your Partner's jealousy" had some useful information pertaining to how jealousy is related to childhood and adult traumas and some effective coping strategies for their partners.  What I didn't like about the book is that the assumption the author took is that the partner of the jealous individual has absolutely no role in causing the jealous behavior.  The author flat out states this and presumes that the "target" of jealousy is neither flirtatious, innapropriate or unfaithful, which statistically makes up for high percentage of relationships failing.
I think the author may have had some negative experience in her life with a jealous person and is obviously biased in her observations despite her education and experience on the subject
