Based on her two previous books &quot;Beyond the Twelve Steps: Roadmap to a New Life&quot; &amp; &quot;Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting&quot; these were good books and fell within the bounds of my beliefs. But this book &quot;Earth II&quot; and the &quot;Dear God! What's Happening to Us?: Halting Eons of Manipulation&quot; Lynn has gone in a very different direction (or beyond what she hinted at previously). I am not saying the book is bad. I am just saying she has gone in a direction that is pretty far out there for me. So if you are buying the book based on the two previous ones I mentioned...you might want to reconsider or at least look for a used one on the cheap
