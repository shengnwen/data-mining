Being a big fan of Bradygames Guides over the years I find the quality and quantity of information in this product to be shockingly dismal! The guild for Final Fantasy XII is amazing; it's artwork and complete documentation of the game are supurb!

Reading this product is like being in a vast field of uncut hay with tractor that refuses to pull-start but has a 'Bentley' hood ornament. Sad.

A waste of money...free online resources are FAR more complete
