Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!

If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.

AMMENDMENT:
Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere
