I just finished The Best Litle Girl in the World..... I hated the stereotyping. For example I got the feeling he was trying to say that only middle to upper class white girls are anorexic. Also the whole hospital stay I did not like that there was even more sterotyping with her roommate being black and some of the comments she makes. I don't understand why the author seems so narrow-minded to me when he is supposed to be an "expert". His books The Best Little Girl and The Luckiest Little Girl are both written in a way that I don't really connect with even though I read both books in less than 7 or 8 hours total.  I don't think that this promotes eating disorders in any way and I don't understand why people say it does and I guess that is the only good thing about the book. Well anyway.... there have got to be better books out there...
