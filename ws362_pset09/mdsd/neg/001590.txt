I agree with the West Coast reviewer that this book is full of errors!  On the math section, answers for the questions are often wrong!  Wrong explanations are given, for THREE of the twenty questions in just one section I did (before throwing the book away).  Some of it is poor editing, as the problem they solve is different from the problem presented in the test.  Other errors just make no sense but are based on an incorrect understanding of the math concepts involved.  Put this one in the trash
