I know this author has a loyal following, but this novel didn't do anything for me. The premise was intriguing, but the execution didn't do it justice. The dialogue was hokey, the events implausible, and the characters uninteresting. And did they all have to be the victim of some man? The ultimate message of this book seemed to be that sisterhood rules and men are not only unnecessary--they're the source of every woman's problems. There are so many good books out there, don't waste your time with this one
