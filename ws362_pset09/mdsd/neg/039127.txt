The title of this book is the giveaway.  Apparently, the author has not read the Constitution FOR the United States of America.  It is NOT the Constitution of the United States of America.  "for" places the Constitution in proper context as the set of rules for the government.

Look for someone who knows that there is no Constitution "of" the United States of America but there is a Constitution "for" the United States of America
