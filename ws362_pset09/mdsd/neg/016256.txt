I picked up this book to read about intriguing English history. But I found the matter too sketchy. The thick book talks mainly about relationships using historical developments as a mere backdrop.

It did build a few characters including that of King - Henry Fitz Empress - quite impressively, but the rest characters appeared more like fillers.

It was sketchy and the episodes not tied well.

All in all - not worth the time I put into it
