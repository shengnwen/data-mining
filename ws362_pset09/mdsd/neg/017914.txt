    I can't remember when I was more angry at the ending of a book.  When I finished THE GRAVE MAURICE I swore that I would never read another Martha Grimes book, and so far I haven't.  I admit I miss Richard Jury and Melrose Plant as I would any other old friends, but I am tired of endings that feel like a kick in the stomach!  So, no more Martha.  I will find new friends elsewhere
