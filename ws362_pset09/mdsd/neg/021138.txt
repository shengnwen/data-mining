One of the reviewers below stated that admirers of Hurston "won't be disappointed" by this book. I beg to differ: I've read pretty much everything Hurston has written, and I think she is without a doubt one of the best American (and perhaps world) writers of the twentieth century. But "Seraph" was a great disappointment. Hurston simply overreached with this one. By the time I had finished reading it, I found myself wondering what the point of this book was. The story follows the marriage of a Florida couple over several decades. The husband is ambitious and forceful, yet also arrogant and sometimes violent, while the wife is timid and (overly) sensitive. Told from the wife's point of view, the problem with the story is that it essentially goes from a more or less realistic give-and-take between the two to an account of how she tries to prove herself worthy of her husband (there is little in the way of growth on his part by the way, e.g. he never expresses any regret for having acted like a brute during the early years of their marriage).
