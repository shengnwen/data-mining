Any book that encourages child abuse is not Christian.  People who have responded favorably to this book may have been looking for something that agreed with their already held convictions, or maybe they have scared their child into obeying because they are bigger and stronger and thus feel they have found something helpful.  There are many good books on strong-willed children that are helpful in learning how to parent them.  This is not one.  He is selling books today because he was recognized years ago with writing a decent book on parenting.  There has been some tremendous change.  I would recommend parents NOT read this book. There are other ways of disciplining children that are not humiliating, violent and abusive.  If you are Christian, would Jesus have dealth with children in this way
