An embarrassing waste of time. Disney publishing's latest insult to animation fans. The artwork, what there is of it is printed postage stamp size, and the text is the most juvenile drivel that you will ever read. I hated it so much, I donated my comp copy to the Library.
If you want  some animation books written with some respect for the reader as well as some beautiful artwork, look to the Chronicle publishing produced Pixar books.
  This goes for the sure to be lame Chicken Little Unplucked, too
