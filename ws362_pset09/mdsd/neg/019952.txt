There are a whole bunch of burger cookbooks out this spring and I bought three. This one came in third; pictures were kind of bland, and recipes seemed vaguely familiar. Nothing too original here. The others had ideas that I never would have thought of. Burgers Every Way and The Great Big Burger Book are better collections of new ways to make burgers
