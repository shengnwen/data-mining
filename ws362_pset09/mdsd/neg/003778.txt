The level of scholarship contained within this book is abysmal: there is very little up-to-date evidence for many of the claims made by Thapar. It is a shame when a "professor" loses track of the facts, and jettisons objectivity while preciously guarding personal prejudices. Some of the "facts" in this book are entirely manufactured and rather ludicrous to those who are familiar with recent discoveries in archeology and linguistics. 

I couln't be less interested in this person's private politics -Marxists, the RSS, Hindu Nationalism etc are not my concern (and, as I suspect, aren't the concerns of most of the readers of this book, either). However, when personal bias clearly colours the tone and "facts" of a work and obviously detracts from its objectivity, it is time to look elsewhere for a lucid, impartial account of history. It is unfortunate enough that personal politics and emotions subconsciously and inadvertently shade historians' works - the last thing we need is conscious and deliberate distortion.
