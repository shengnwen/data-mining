I teach a recording technology class at a community college, and we selected this book as a text based on the claims that it was a good beginner's manual.  It is quite the opposite-- by the second page, the authors are already throwing in equasions to represent the relationship between the frequency and wavelength of a sound-- crazy! The book is written by engineers, for engineers, and assumes that the reader is already well-read in electronics, physics, and advanced math!  Also know that the work is British-- so many of the terminologies are different than what we use in the States. Proximity effect is "bass tip-up". Shotgun mics are "rifle mics". TRS plugs are "GPO" plugs, etc.  The discussion of mixing boards focuses immediately on features found on very high-end studio boards, not the equipment a beginner would have access to. The discussion of impedance focuses on how to represent values mathematically, rather than clearly explaining what is meant by "impedance" and why it is important. This book has ended up being absolutely useless as a beginner's text, and the publisher should not be representing it as such. We are abandoning it for something more useful to students
