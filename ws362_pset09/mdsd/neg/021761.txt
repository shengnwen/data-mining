I am disappointed with this cookbook. I was looking for a basic cookbook to explain times and techniques to cook standard items in a Toaster Oven. What I call the "Nitty Gritty" of using a Toaster Oven. Obviously I am wrong, the book contains nothing basic, standard or instructional about using a toaster oven
