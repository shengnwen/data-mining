This is a field guide to the foreign land of our parents - a help &amp; resource as our elders age &amp; we must talk with them about medicine, hygiene, dependence, selling the car, loneliness &amp; love. This book jumped into my hand because it's all about what we're doing right now -  taking care of our Poppa in his final years. While Poppa's son speaks his  father's language &amp; can mostly get his frames of references, there are  over 40 unknown years before his son was a twinkle in his Poppa's eye.  Meanwhile I have only a smattering of references with this plodding  mischievous fellow who avoids saying yea or nay.  He also has an endless  well of stories about anything &amp; these should be told to a bevy of  youngsters at his knees. I also know now that we're not at fault for his  oldness nor is it our job to make him happy. Only he can do that. It is our  job, however, to keep ourselves happy! This book has some eminently useful  information, strategies &amp; ideas. Well done
