I thought this would be a list of adult grahic novels, like those of Harvey Pekar.  A few were, but many were for children or comic book collectors.  I do not think some of them really qualify as graphic novels.  From the term "your library" I understood my own personal library, but seems it is for public librarians serving a mixed public. Fine, but I did not see that in the editorial description
