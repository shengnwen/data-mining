I am a big fan of Rita Ciresi, so I went out of my way to find this one. This was her first literary work, a collection of short stories. It is just plain weird, and darkly sad. Awfully written. I can't imagine how it won the Flannery O'Connor award. Rita Ciresi's other books, especially Pink Slip and Blue Italian are so much better. I've been trying to unload this on ebay for a long time now and no one will buy it from me. Can't say I blame them
