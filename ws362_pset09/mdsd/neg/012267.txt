This book did not help me at all. I am a young teen actress and I did not find any good monologues. A lot of them were for older actresses and actors and were really religous, talked about sex, or were just really disturbing or boring. Even though it says student, it is more for adults. I really want to return this book. It was a waste of my parents money. If I could, I would give it no stars. The beginning does give some helpful information about monolgues, but it gets really boring to read. DONT make the same mistake I made. The other reviews said it was really good, but trust me, it's not
