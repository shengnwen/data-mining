I read this book for a college class on Social Work, and although Loeb tells many meaningful and powerful stories, this is the same text I have heard before.  If you read the first and last paragraph of each chapter you basically get the point.  It's an easy read, and some may find it powerful, but I just found it repetitive and over-told.
