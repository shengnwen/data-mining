I have never seen a book in my life that was so badly written.  They refer to Jack as "Jake" and even "Nack", have mismatched verb tenses, forget to finish sentences.  I don't think there was a single page without an error on it.  Each chapter starts with a plot synopsis that is basically the same as you can read on a million web sites.  That's followed by a few quotes, a theory from the fans - again which you can find everywhere online, a "Sawyerism" - which is a list of nicknames he uses for other characters in that episode, and then the "Seven Degrees of Lost" which reminds us of really important things like "Rose and Jack sat next to each other on the plane".  Really not worth the $, or the time to flip through the pages.
