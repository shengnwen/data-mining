I was very disappointed in this book...I am a big fan of Alton Browns TV show...I learn a lot from it.  In this volume, Alton spends too much time on jokes, and not enough time on useful information.  He has so much to teach, I think he is very knowledgable, at least that is how he comes across on TV...but I found myself skimming through the retoric, looking for cooking information.
