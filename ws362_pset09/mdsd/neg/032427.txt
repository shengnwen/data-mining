This book reflects the philosophy and practices of the former IP technology organization at AT&amp;T. The final outcome of the group was supposed to be a versatile middleware platform (code-named Geoplex) underlying and integrating data and voice operations in the AT&amp;T networks (and BT in England as well). Geoplex failed miserably for a variety of reasons (not least, ill-defined focus). If anything, that is a bad rap for the book and its approach. But credibility is not everything, and this could still be a well written book. Still, I found it too long and rich in technical details. What was up-to-date two years ago is now obsolete. My advice is to browse through the copy available at your library
