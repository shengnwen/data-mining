In the tsk, tsk being thrown on Pope Pius XII by this author, I'm amazed that he never discusses the complete absence of any condemnation of Communism by the bishops at Vatican II.  

Given that the initial Vatican II documents contained such a condemnation of Communism and given the widespread persecution and mass murder of Christians by communist regimes in Eastern Europe and China (in much larger numbers than any of Hitler's mass murders) during this time period, the ultimate decision to omit any reference to Communism from the Vatican II documents dwarfs any lapse of duty Pope Pius XII might have committed.

The failure of any of Pope Pius XII's critics to address this second betrayal at Vatican II should give objective readers pause to consider just where these critics sympathies lie
