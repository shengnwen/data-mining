This is a very basic book on clubfitting that intends to convince the reader that off-the-rack golf clubs have about as much chance of fitting you as an off-the-rack suit.  My experience is that he's probably right.  I found the narrative a little colloquial for my taste, but the information is pretty clear.  The book is intended as encouragement to potential club buyers.  Club builders, on the other hand, will find the book a little slim.  For them, there is just enough information to be interesting but not enough to be useful.  I probably should have increased the rating to 3 or 4 stars, but I don't know how.
