Gad!  Such a looooooong book!  This would better be called "A Year (or Maybe 5) in Only Part of the World" since most of the places visited were European.  Long-winded and loopy with adjectives, Mayes writes about food, literature, food, art, food, architecture, and food.  I'm surprised she and her husband don't roll around the places they visit - they must each weigh a ton or two by now.  I did enjoy the descriptions of the crazy Italian traffic HOWEVER I got a wee bit tired of hearing how fantastic European cities are compared to poor little ole' San Francisco.  Traffic bad in Portugal?  Look at San Francisco!  Beggars in Naples?  Just look at San Francisco!  No place is perfect, and I'd much rather read travel stuff written by someone who has a more balanced prospective.
