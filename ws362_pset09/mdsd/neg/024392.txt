It is amazing someone would spend so much time to translate a text like this only to not translate it in it's entirety.  I have seen this before with Conze's translations of Buddhist texts which are equally appalling.  This being a ancient religious text, it has repetition.  But it is there for a reason. One, often an important point is repeated so that you remember it.  Two, with Buddhist texts, many of them are meant to be a meditation, the repetition is part of that.  Third it is a poetic device.  But again when you buy a translation of a text don't you expect to get the WHOLE text and not have it edited at whim by the translator.  The Sutras are the equivalent of the Bible in Buddhism.  Wouldn't you think something is wrong if every time a translation of the Bible repeated itself (as the synoptic gospels do) that you just got a note instead of the actual text.  I can't believe Wisdom even published it, no one would publish a bible that way.  Worse still, Walshe doesn't note the majority of the items he leaves out but just gives you a ... to indicted he didn't feel the point was important enough to translate.  And these often come a point where it really interferes with the reading of the text.  I want my money back
