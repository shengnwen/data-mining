Unless you are a layperson and very new to bipolar disorder, this book is just a regurgitation of very old techniques.  What's more, the regurgitation is often wrong.  Anyone who has dealt with this illness for more than a year will know more than this book can teach them.

I would recommend almost any book over this one.  Dr. Fieve's book Moodswing is particularly good, as is anything by Kay Jamison.

If all you want is a feel-good, fast read, not particularly enlightening book, this might be for you.  Otherwise, keep looking.  Anyone you know with bipolar, or you, if you are afflicted, will be thankful for it
