I wanted to read the Japanese classic with some commentary, but mostly the Japanese classic. What I got with this book was "The Book of The Five Rings Greatest Hits" or "How to use Old Books to Make a Killing on Wall Street." I'm very disappointed in the book and if you are looking for Asian classics, read the description very carefully
