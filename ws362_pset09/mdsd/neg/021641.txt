A big disappointment after the reviews I had read!Rather shallow in its one-sided fixation on having to have a baby or descriptions of her manicures. Story-line sometimes doesn't add up, e.g., timing of her parents holidays to Italy which was supposed to coincide with her childbirth.But apparently there is a demand for books like that otherwise they would be published. Who needs the Reader's guide at the end?
