This book was used as a text in my philosophy of music class.  The professor chose the text because she knew that we would be opposed to his views.  He barely deals with vocal music at all, claiming that it is not "pure music" because it has text.  When dealing with opera, he feels the "problem with opera" is the fact that it is not cyclical.  He mentions that when opera was first introduced that emotions were thought to be cyclical, and opera to the best of it's ability tried to accomidate that.  However, it the mid 18th century that was discovered not to be the case and it was realized that emotions are linear.  Just because the history of music has cyclical background does not mean that with this discovery it should remain as such.  Linear and cyclical writing are tools used by a composer to convey certain emotions or to help define an event.  Overall I felt Kivy was too verbose.  If I were not a music major, I would have found it hard to truly understand what he was talking abou
