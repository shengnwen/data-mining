It's not really her fault, but Cynthia Lennon has written a fairly bland book. She obviously doesn't realize what is so interesting about the guy, and what' makes a decent memoir. Gossip, juicy stories etc. For me, one of  the most fascinating things about Lennon was that he was a Liverpool thug  who had to wear a Beatle suit. Cynthia Lennon really comes across as being  a bit dim. For my money, the most interesting part of a famous person's  life, is what they were like before they were famous -  she could have done  a better job on this early period. For a decent book, read Albert Goldman's  book or Pete Shotton's &quot;In My Life&quot;
