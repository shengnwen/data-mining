Understandably this is an action thriller only type of book and should not be expected to live to the works of Coyle or Clancy,  but there is little to zero development of any of the characters.  The plot is not one that anyone could take serious...how many Islamic carrier battlegroups were there???  Not to mention the relationship between the CO and XO leads towards an opinion that our Armed Forces are unprofessional.
The cover alone should have said something for what I was about to read...a bad digital picture blown-up even worse from some website.
Sorry people, I do not recommend this book,.  It was a disappointment even for someone who is into books for action alone
