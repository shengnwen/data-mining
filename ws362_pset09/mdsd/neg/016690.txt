Well, the title says it all.  Where was the editor on this?  The first rule of writing is always to keep your reader's interest.  I think major points of the book could be made less often to reduce repetitiveness.  And less written on points that are kind of obvious - like "Taxes impair wealth accumulation."  I tried reading just the summaries, but the book is more than just that.  I got it out of the library, but I ran out of renewals.

Even so, the ideas are VERY important to consider, so everyone should make an attempt at it
