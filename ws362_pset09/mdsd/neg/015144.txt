Dwyer evidently advocates abandonment of our constitutional rights to  freedom of religion, speech, and even thought within the family except as  it agrees with his profoundly held secularist dogma. This is an example of  the less than subtle propaganda available at the modern university. Arguing  from a decidedly elitist framework he proceeds to introduce a dichotomy  between parental and children's rights essentially substituting  &quot;Big&quot; and I mean really &quot;Big Brother&quot; as arbiter of the  child's best interest. It is fascinating to see the socialist mind at work  spinning arbitrary rights for the state elitists in a convoluted  destruction of private rights reminiscent of Bolshevik totalitarianism. The  fact that children are already suffering immensely in the hands of a  Kafkaesque bureacracratic welfare and foster care system hardly intrudes  the flowery idealism of the social engineer hard at work squandering our  tax dollars. After reading such a book all children and parents ought to  have increased appreciation for our Constitutional legal system which has  at least presently restrained such wild eyed extremism
