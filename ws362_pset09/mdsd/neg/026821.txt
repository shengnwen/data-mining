I can't discourage this book enough. It takes the interesting world of tattooing and makes it into a bland history lesson that doesnt even emphasize the more interesting aspects of its past. Tattooing is one subject that is generally vey interesting no matter how you study it but this book manages to make it boring. At times it gets so far off the subject you wonder why you dont just read a real history book instead. Very bland and reads like a medical journal
