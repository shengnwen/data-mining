First of all, I didn't think the book was very well written - it needed much tighter editing.  Many points are repeated over and over again, and I found several typos.  It is also heavily aimed at Americans with poor diets.

However, I did it, although I had to go to 3 doctors to find someone who would prescribe the necessary drugs, and then only reluctantly.  I have just finished 6 months on it and am going to stop now.  It has helped none of my health problems, and I have in fact had new fungal rashes develop while I was doing it.  The food restrictions make it very hard to lead a normal social life.

According to his questionnaires, I am a prime candidate for candidiasis, but this treatment did not make any difference.  No harm in trying it, but don't put too much hope into it
