My apologies to all the Hemingway fans, but I didn't really care for this book. I had a hard time understand what was going on throughout the book. One bright spot was when they were in the mountains fishing and it is always nice to read of another country that is not yours. The characters did not appeal to me, I wouldn't want to party with any of them. They seemed lost and spoiled. Grabbing a quick peek at the Cliff Notes in a book store for this book; I found some of my conclusions were valid. But unfortunately it just wasn't for me. If you try this book I wish you luck
