I believe Mr. Jenkins must have been paid by the exclamation point, so liberal is he with their use.  While his story should be interesting to the wanderers among us, his telling of it is so hamfisted that I just couldn't bear to continue.  Jenkins needs a harsher editor or better yet, a ghost-writer.  This book reads like a high-school senior's lengthy "personal narrative" for a college admissions essay.  But perhaps I'm being too generous.
