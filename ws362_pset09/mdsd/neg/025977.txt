We had to read this book for our critical reading writing and research class.  I found it very redundant and repetative.  I can see his point that something needs to be done about illiteracy, but after about 2 chapters hes saying the same thing over and over again.  Also, the statistics drove me nuts.  But I learned quite a bit.  Get this book if you are interested in this subject.  If you have to read it for a class, try not to fall asleep
