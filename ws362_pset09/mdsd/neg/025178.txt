Redneck? Git-er-done? First off, anyone who's from the South can tell you that Palm Beach, FL is HARDLY redneck territory. Second off, the dude went to private school! So unless he was a part of the voucher program - which a middle class child wouldn't qualify for anyway - I call BULL.

Mr. Whitney - as in Dan Whitney, as in his real name - I have known rednecks. You, sir, are no redneck. What you are is a racist fake who appeals to the lowest common denominator with a fan base full of nothing but bigoted bottom feeders who think that gay jokes (as well as Mexican jokes - I CRINGE to think of what he thinks about black people) and Muslim bashing is funny. Heck, if I was a southern white male, I'd be offended that this jerk was pushing the stereotypes that are made against so many good-hearted southern gentlemen. I knocked through this in about 45 minutes on a lunch break, and I'll never get that part of my life back.
