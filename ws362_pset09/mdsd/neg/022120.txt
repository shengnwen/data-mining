This book is great if you want to know what kind of rigging each
ship had. You will not get how many crewman it took to sail each ship unless its a galley then you can figure it out by how many oars it had. On some you will get the tonnage of a particular ship but not always. You don't get any idea the cargo it was able to hold in tonnage or what type of cargo it mainly shipped. Nothing about what kind of weaponary ie cannon
6pounder,12pounder etc. I did like the pictures. I did learn about ships that I never knew existed. Thats why I said fluff
in the title
