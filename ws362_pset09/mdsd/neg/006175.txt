So many words to say so little. This book could have been three pages long and that would have been sufficient. He goes on and on on the same topics of what its like to be oppressed and what the oppressed must do to brake free from oppression. This is all very much common sence, at least it seems so to me, having taken a college class here and there. Marx is taken far out of context and this book altogether preaches a utopian way of things thats as far fetched as communism functioning in a capitalist society
