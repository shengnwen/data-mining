Those who think Jack Welch is such a visionary should think again since in my opinion he cost the company billions. In the eighties I was involved in General Electric's GEnie which was the #3 online system online community with a very loyal customer base. AOL had not existed at the time. GEnie had a chance to dominate the online market because it had the knowledge and expertise at the time and a very loyal community. I remember one infamous meeting when I stood up and said basically "it's the Internet stupid." My comments went over like a lead balloon and basically the executives said ok any other questions and went on as if I had not made a statement at all. With just a few thousand dollars GEnie could have been one of the first to emphasize Internet access but GEnie was short-sighted with little or incorrect guidance from Jack Welch who supposedly was engaged in GEnie. With a very small capital infusion GEnie could have been the #1 online system. Where was Jack's six sigma? Make a long story short, GEnie never got real support from Jack just talk. The death knell for GEnie was when one infamous weekend the online resources were pulled to run some back office accounting program and thus denying online access to its GEnie customers. The customers weren't even informed why they couldn't access their email and never any apology. Where was Jack Welch? GEnie quietly faded away after that. Why haven't the hotshot investigated reporters reported this part of GE and Jack's history?
