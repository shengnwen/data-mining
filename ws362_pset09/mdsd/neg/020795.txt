And, if this is an illustration of the "joy" of writing sex, I would hate to see an illustration of the "horror" or writing sex.

One of the short-shorts in the version I purchased of this book details the experience of a male gas station clerk being highly aroused when another male enters his gas station and rapes him in the back room. Is this a sex scene worthy of a story to be sold as literature, or is it a transcribed version of something someone saw at a pay site on the Internet? Do we really want to be sending a message to the public that rape is an acceptable, exciting form of sexual intercourse? I can think of several victims I know who would not appreciate that, one of whom was killed by her attacker
