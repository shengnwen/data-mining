The book did hold my interest most of the way through; it definitely was a fast-moving story.  I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the setting and the characters.  It started out to be a pretty good mystery, but didn't deliver in the end, and here's where I differ from previous reviewers.  The blurbs describe the book as full of plot twists and surprise endings.  I didn't find this to be true.  I figured out fairly early on what Bridger was up to, and it didn't take a genius to guess who his secret accomplice was.  So much for surprise endings.  In addition, I found the dialogue to be clunky and awkward at times; AND, I wonder, does anyone proof the book drafts before they go to print?  Does the author get to see a proof of his book cover synopsis?  I wonder because on the back of this book it says, "When an explosion kills the NIGHT WATCHMAN at wealthy industrialist Karl Lindstrom's nearby lumber mill..."  As anyone who has actually read this book knows, it was NOT the night watchman who was killed, but another individual.  Just another example of shoddy editing..
