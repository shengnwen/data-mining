This book was dull and lifeless.  I found the story to be just plain irritating and could not wait to reach the end.  The only part of the book where I felt that there was at least something to grasp onto was the section written by Peter Singer.  Other than that small snippet, I found nothing else of interest.  It was like eagerly anticipating a lecture only to have it be really, really, really boring and nothing like you expected.  Only the book is worse than that because you have to read it, so you can't let your mind wander or do other things while the speaker is speaking.  I know I didn't have to finish it, but I always try to finish books in hopes that they get better.  This one didn't.  Perhaps it was because I was hoping to learn something new about animal rights and where it is heading, or at least to solidify the knowledge that I have, but instead it did nothing but waste my time.  I highly suggest getting a different book
