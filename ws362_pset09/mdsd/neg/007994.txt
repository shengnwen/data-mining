I was disappointed at the dismissal of social scientific evidence in favour of a priori conservative christian observations about deviation from an a priori normative basis. Disturbingly, this seemed to be on the basis  that some forms of cult or new religious movement had too much in common  with fundamentalism's own authoritarianism, failure to respect intellectual  freedom (or &quot;relativism&quot;. However, how else is one meant to  assess whether an NRM is harmful or not? Gomes fails to realise the  implications of social scientific or psychological studies that do show  such correspondences between authoritarian NRMs and fundamentalist  Christianity, while harmless and non-authoritarian religious traditions are  also included in this series solely on the basis of alleged philosophical  deviation, and no other reason. I don't think anyone outside fundamentalism  will be impressed with the latter criteria as sole basis. Moreover, it also  suffers from the relativist strawperson argument. And if the NRM is  politically conservative, it is interesting to note how much of that gets  let out of the Zondervan series, compared to liberal alternative religions  such as Unitarian Universalism
