This was a cute book, but enough with the detailed descriptions! It was as if the author couldn't come up with enough words to fill her  contract, so had to fill in with exhaustive lists of every food item Holly had for dinner, including how it was prepared. I found myself skipping over entire paragraphs of stuff because it added absolutely nothing to the story. In one part there was like a page and a half of her making SALAD for dinner! And reporting on EVERY.SINGLE.TIME she checked her e-mail? Give it a rest! I get that she checks her e-mail frequently!

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book. I managed to get through it to the extremly predictable ending by sheer stubborn will, but I won't be looking for this author's books again
