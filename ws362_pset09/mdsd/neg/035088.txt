I'm sorry to be the party pooper here, but this is an awful book, which might not be the writer's fault, since it's based on a terrible song.  The activities along the way are fun enough. But if a child's book is supposed to be fun, it's also supposed to teach little life lessons.  What does this one teach?  My 3 year old is terrified of the book.  He says the bear is mean.  I say, "Why?"  "Because he looks big and scary."  So my kid has learned that big, scary-looking, unknown things are mean (if you haven't read the book, the bear does nothing "mean"--he's just hanging out in his cave).  More--if they're provoked and they chase you, it's because they're mean (not because a bunch of kids provoked them).  At the same time, my kid loves Shrek, and I love the fact that it teaches him to look beyond surface appearance, to face a big, scary thing and learn about it--not to call it mean when you don't know it, not to bother it and run.  The book's just screwy.
