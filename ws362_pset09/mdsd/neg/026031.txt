The story is nice and entertaining. Some of the dialogues are funny, and we like a girl with spunk. But this one just don't get it. To much of a good thing is sickening, and she is. I really don't get why the hero falls for her. He seems so nice. Beurk ! Don't bye this one, just get it at the library if you really like the author (not one of my favorite). After 60 pages you just can't stand her anymore
