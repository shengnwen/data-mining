I found this book very biased, which is why I continued reading.  The history is horrible, but I was curious the extent to which Mr. Davis wants to cement his moral crusade view of history in lay people's minds.  At one point the comparison is made between the opporators of the underground railroad and the people who resisted the Nazis.  By extention Mr. Davis makes the implicit and fallacious argument, slavery is like the holocaust.  

The title should be "Don't know much about slavery:  How white men's stupidity continues in perpetuity.
