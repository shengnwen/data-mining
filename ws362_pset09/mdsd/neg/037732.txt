I'm a huge fan of the Ultimate lines of X-Men, Spiderman, Ultimate(Avengers), and of course the Fantastic Four.  For that reason, I am deeply upset with how UFF Vol. 4: Inhuman turned out.  First off, this cover is way too decieving.  Jae Lee, while an obviously talented artist, is definitely not the write person to be drawing for the Ultimate series.  It completely veered away from the amazing artwork done in the first 3 volumes, which is pretty much the uniform look for the entire Ultimate universe.
The stories definitely could have been better written and needed to be spanned out more.  2 issues is definitely not enough to fully tell the story with the Thinker.  Then you have that UFF Annuals #1 which was even worse than the Thinker story.  TOO SHORT, plus the artwork was just wrong.  It was all a rare miss in the Ultimate line and having seen the upcoming Vol. 5: Crossover, it doesn't appear to be one that's going to be repeated
