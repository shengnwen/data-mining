I was very confused by this book.  I bought it hoping to get a better understanding of Jewish practices and beliefs at the time of Jesus Christ's time on earth.  As a Christian, I have to admit that my knowledge of first century Judaism is very limited and I had hoped to gain additional knowledge from this book. I was very disappointed.  Rather than give clear insight into Jewish thinking the author makes statements such as, "not all Jews think this".  I am not interested in what "all" Jews were thinking, I am interested in what most were thinking. If there were different viewpoints then explain them.   The author seemed to be very defensive in explaining Jewish thinking. 

Too much of this book is concerned with the author's viewpoint that many Christians are anti-Semetic.  Most of the writers of the New Testament were former Jews.  When they were instructing the early Christians it was only natural that were trying to differenent themselves from Jewish thinking and practices.  They were not being anti-Semetic when they exlained how Jesus's teachings were different from Judaism.

A much better book on understanding Judaism is "Understanding Judaism" by Rabbi Benjamin Blech.  He gives a complete discription of Jewish practices and beliefs.  He explains the differences and similarities between the different kinds of Judaism. When I finished this book I had a much better understanding and appreciating of the differences, similarities and common heritage between the two religions.
