The Angolan conflict was my only area of interest in this book, and having read quite a few other books on the South African war in this region I sped quickly to this chapter.
If I didn't know any better I would suspect that the author had vested interests in keeping the Cuban military in a good light through this section of the book. Any serious historians would baulk at the drivel written about the South African 'defeats' and I for one felt enraged at this blatant pro-Cuban military propaganda...very disappointing.
