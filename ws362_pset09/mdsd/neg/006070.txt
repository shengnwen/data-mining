Let me tell you first - I did not finish the book. I got more than halfway and just gave it up. I was expecting more descriptions of the Amazon territory and peoples and, yes, more about the 'wife's' trip on the river. I came away from my attempt with lots of info I didn't need on the shape of the earth, latitude and longitude determinations, and scarcely a mention of the wife and her journey. It was mostly socio-political commentary for that period in history and, I'm sure, highly gratifying to some. I enjoy cartography, nature, etc. and was totally disappointed
