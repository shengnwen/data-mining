"This book aims to put killing back into military history."

no kidding!  that's like saying "I'm going to put the 'ball' back in 'football'!"  that line had me suspicious... other lines clearly suggest that the author is bringing more than a little of her own "gender" war into the scenario as well.  she makes no effort to be "objective" and easily and gleefully casts judgement on virtually every subject she bothers to discuss.  the following quote is revealing:

"Historians have been rightly cautious about passing judgement on people in the past, but this must be done if we are to grant servicemen and -women in the past an active, creative role in the making of their own histories"

my first reaction was "what the hell?"  so, by self-righteously passing judgement on people in the past (imagining ourselves to be better in the process) we're helping THEM play an active role in "making" their own histories?  that sentence alone proved the author's TRUE motives were not in producing a serious academic or scholarly work on the nature of warfare and killing.

since part of her focus is how the culture deals with warfare and killing--she feels at liberty to quote movie directors, military historians, novels, and soldiers with equal credibility!

Dave Grossman's book "On Killing" is more concise, more carefully documented, and better written.

her bibliographic references ARE impressive.  and yet she only scratches the surface on some issues.  particularly regarding fighter pilots (which is my area of pseudo-expertise).  the joy they took in "killing" was often merely a "sporting attitude" they had.  dehumanizing their "kills" or "victories" helped them do the job.  very few fighter pilots actively took joy in killing their victims.  again, Grossman does a better job of exploring this issue
