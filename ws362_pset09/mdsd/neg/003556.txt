This book claims to be written in a large font, however the font is barely larger than the paperback edition.  The large print edition is at most 2 points larger than the paperback, maybe a 12 or 13 point font.  What makes this book bigger is the extra space at the bottom of the page which is not all that usefull for making notes.  This edition is poorly laid out for enjoyable reading and useful notation.  Don't waste you money to get this so called "large print" edition, you should probably just buy the regular sized one.
