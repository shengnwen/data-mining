This is a first novel that has some of the usual first-novel faults:loose ends that are never tied up, over-plotting, and dialogue that doesn't always ring true.  But the larger fault is that the author doesn't seem to know what her book is really about.  At first, it seems like it's going to be a timely pro-choice thriller, one that follows the machinations of a group of anti-choice fanatics and their impact not only on an idealistic doctor who performs abortions, but also on his wife and children.  However, the title turns out to be misleading, since the doctor's wife is only one of a number of main characters, and in fact, "the artist's wife" might have been a better title, since the story becomes increasingly about the neurotic, deeply damaged wife of the artist who's having an affair with "the doctor's wife."  This deranged woman becomes part of an anti-abortion lunatic fringe group, with huge implications for the plot line.  The author tries to explore this woman's mind, and understand why she's drawn to the anti-abortion group, but with only limited success. 

Eventually, the abortion plot line disappears, overwhelmed by various melodramatics set in motion by the artist's wife.  The author is clearly pro-choice, so her efforts to be "fair" (if such a thing were possible!) to the nut-cases who think that killing doctors is OK, in the name of saving fetuses, fall flat. This is truly a debate that has only one side: and that side is whichever side you're on.  There is no common ground, not even a remote possibility of one side understanding the other's thinking and motivations, so the author has set herself an impossible task, one at which she's bound to fail. 

The ending is both too melodramatic and-- for this reader-- ideologically unsatisfying.  Without revealing the details of the ending, it seems to me that the pro-choice side loses this particularl battle, which is NOT the way I either expected or wanted the novel to end
