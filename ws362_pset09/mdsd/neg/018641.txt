Huge mistake, I bought this book before reading any review about it. I thought the mistakes and issues people were talking about regarding the 1st version would have been fixed in this 2nd edition. Well, I guess this 2nd is as bad as the 1st one. Anyway, it's about all the aspects of e-commerce but really really really lacks any kind of depth. It's 100% superficial, pure common-sense and is honestly, indeed, a waste of money. I could have said there are quite a lot of useful links, but when you see they still refer to USweb/CKS, that became marchfirst maybe 2 years ago, and that actually went bust a few months ago... forget it! And one more critic: it sounds like Steffano and Juanita have some problem with their ego... really, forget this book..
