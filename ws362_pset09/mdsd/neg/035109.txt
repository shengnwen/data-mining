Ok I started reading. It was pretty interesting. Until the middle. It was kinda confusing. There were too many characters. I read back through and got it. Next, I find out the main character's brother is a killer who never get sin trouble and who's parents don't care. The reason Paul has glasses is because his brother Erik sprayed white paint into his eyes. Nice huh? And of course, his parents keep all of this a secret, telling him he looked up at the sun during an eclipse. Paul is good at soccer, so his parents care? NO. All they care about is Erik's football career. It was depressing. Then Erik steals $1,000s of dollars worth of stuff and is responsible for two murders. Guess what? His parents don't punish him! Paul finally tells the Sheriff the stuff Erik did, and finally, Erik is caught and arrested. I was disappointed, they didn't tell what kind of punishment the jerk got. The parents still don't seem to care. How abusive?! The summary seems to make it seem like a happy and silly type of book. Well, it's not. It's dark, and evil. Don't read this if you hate violence, or are under 9. I could handle it just fine because I'm a mature 11 yr. old. It may deeply disturb and depress some younger children though
