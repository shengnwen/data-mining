This book was very disappointing.  Aside from the fact that the elements would be very expensive to produce, the designs lacked any strength.  Each project seemed to be more about the designer's ego than about the client.  Additionally, the book's  "icon" layout was cumbersome and meant having to refer to the legend much too often. Granted, some books are more useful than others, but I have never purchased a book that hasn't given me some bit of inspiration, no matter how small... until now.   I found the book and its designs to be much too self-indulgent to be useful.  This is the first book I have ever returned
