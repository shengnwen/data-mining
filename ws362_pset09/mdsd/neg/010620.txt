I used Perkin's book for a one sememester 500 level graduate course.  I honestly believe that of the 20+ books that I have used in undergrad and grad school, that this is the absolute worst text I have encountered.  The equations in the text are mearly thrown in without the slightest justification or hint of the possible method of derivation.  If you would truly understand the significance of the equations, then you would need a background knowledge that I can hardly believe anybody looking for an introduction to high energy physics could have.  However, this is far from its biggest pitfall.  The book is choppy to read.  There are almost no quantitative examples and yet the questions are mostly quantitative.  I am sure that I could think of more specifics dislikes, but I think that the reader has seen my opion.  To anybody considering buying this text I suggest instead purchasing griffiths &quot;introduction to elementary particles.&quot;  My class was so displeased with perkins text that our professor has promised to switch to griffiths next year.  To reiterate....  Perkins book is the epitome of bad writing.  I give my apologies to the author, but I don't want others to waste their time and money on this text.  Buy Griffiths Book, it is good
