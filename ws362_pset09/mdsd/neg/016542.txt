I read this book with great interest. I have known a few people that practiced these kata. This book does not present the real kata but instead a modified version of the first two pinan. The history is good but if you want these Kata get Funakoshi's Karate do Kyohan because the heian/pinan kata are there. I guess this wasn't a bad attempt just misguided. There are still a few that practice these Kata if you look hard enough
