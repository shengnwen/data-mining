First, I want to say that this is another book that tells you how to eat healthy.  Many of us who are overweight know how to eat healthy - we just don't do it.  We are addicted to our ice cream, sodas, sugar, etc.  Forget buying this book if you & your family like beef, pork, lamb, veal, etc.  On this "way of eating" you are allowed chicken, turkey & fish.  (Most of the people in my family are not fish eaters, including me, and especially talapia, which is the fish that is recommended in the recipe section of the book.  Talapia tastes like dirt to me.)  Therefore, if I were to follow the instructions, I'd be serving only chicken & turkey.  Dr. Katz's research seems sound, and I agree that the food industry has succeeded in "addicting" us to sugar and over-processed foods.  I intend to try some of the recipes (they look pretty good) and I also intend to cut the junk food out of my diet.  I've already cut out white bread.  Dr. Katz says that our appetites are lulled by flavor consistency.  So his theory is that if you eat the same flavor during the day, your brain will turn off the hunger and you will be satiated.  So, the first day you incorporate raisins & currants into your meals, the next day, apples, the next, pineapple, and so on.  I really would have tried it, but my family likes other things besides chicken & turkey!!
