Professor Gardner himself is an example of a learned person who has mastery, but lacks understanding. People, including bright persons, do apply their knowledge to reality. They are not all stuck in a time warp where the false values of their childhood control their "understanding."  Lawyers practice law. Physicists do physics. Historians write history.  Where is the gap between mastery and understanding that he opines? May it not be that there are levels of understanding? Is there really an opposition between knowing and understanding? Perhaps for Prof. Gardner, but not, I think, for the rest of us. Those who can think out of the box, so to speak, in their respective fields, the ones who can be creative are a limited number. They help and enlighten us all. Can a teacher show a child that he or she really doesn't understand what he claims to "know"? Of course. Children are malleable. Even adults can be persuaded to revise their thinking by a sufficiently persuasive speaker even if what that speaker proposes is false. We've seen it time and time again. He's riding that old hobby horse that rote learning is destroying society. It's not. It's reformers like Prof. Gardner that are driving sincere educators to despair as they drive more and more dictators of our schools to believe that the education we are giving and have been giving is inadequate through and through, based on too many false premises, and that we are all up a creek intellectually. It's the height of elitism, and hides a deeper lack of understanding
