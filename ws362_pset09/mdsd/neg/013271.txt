While I am a huge fan of Piers Anthony, I not only found this book very &quot;put down-able&quot; but offensive.  Between the gratuitous sex on every page and the consumption of human body parts as aphrodesiacs, there  was very little good story.  The history parts were very good and read  well, but the story part of the book was a definite turn-off for me and  several of my friends.  I'd stick to the other Anthony series for better  entertainment
