I found the explanations in the book seemed very uneven - some assumed not even an elementary grasp of science, while other parts skipped across wide swaths of info that, to be fully understood by a layman, should have expanded upon in much more detail.  Combine this with the authors' tendency to jump repeatedly and unexpectedly between proselytizing about mythology and other humanistic concepts in hard-to-follow terminology (and, admittedly, I am an engineer, not a liberal arts major, though I'm not an idiot - I did go to MIT) and description/interpretation of scientific facts and theories...made this very difficult reading for me.  I also thought that much of it was preachy and too much time was spent justifying the importance of the premise and the need for the authors' explanations.  It just didn't flow well.  Regardless, the content was good.  I just wish it had been presented in a more streamlined manner.  I was surprised to see all the high ratings.
