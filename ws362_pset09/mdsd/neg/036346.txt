Glib. While I feel for the suburban "lives of quiet desperation" angle, however shopworn, here it feels trite and slightly exploitative. Moody makes lists in lieu of description. Maybe this is a comment on the consumerism of the culture he's limning. But it comes off as lazy, as if he did a lot of research to come up with all these pop culture references and instead of integrating them just ticks them off. Even if he lived in that place and time he would have been younger than any of his characters. I was Wendy Hood's age in '73, living in a town next door to New Canaan, and I well remember that ice storm, when we were without power for a week, when a sofa caught fire in our house after using the fireplace non-stop for days. It's not that Moody gets the details wrong exactly, but they feel researched rather than lived, like the over-obvious production design of a mediocre movie. I don't remember key parties, I can't imagine my parents or their friends being remotely that adventurous. And the kids seem if anything a shade naive sexually. I came to the book long after the movie, which somehow did manage to get a lot of idiosyncratic details right. Little things like the mesmerizing patterns of the electrical wires along the train lines or white collar suburbanites using well worn trails to cut through the woods to  the neighbors'. The book was a disappointment
