On the Go with Baby contains many amusing anecdotes about Lutz's travels with her daughter.  However, as someone who resides overseas, and has already traveled to Hong Kong, Bali, and back and forth across the Pacific with an eight month old I was looking for more specific information.  Her book did not even contain something as simple and helpful as a travel checklist of items to bring for around town or for out of town trips--I found that on the Babies R Us website and modified it to my needs.  As someone who has, an will continue to take long flights with a little one I was also looking for ingenious ways to keep the little guy entertained on long hauls--no such luck.  The strategies for eating out are common sense and ones you are probably doing already.  There is really nothing new or enlightening in this book
