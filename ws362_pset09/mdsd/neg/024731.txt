The index in the version I have is completely inaccurate.  What's more, to obtain errata you're required to enter a code on the publisher's website.  This code is not stamped on the book but is on the packaging which I unfortunately threw away before I noticed the index was completely inaccurate.  

Save yourself the headache and get a different version
