Storytelling is an effective way to communicate ideas and gain buy-in, but the story has to be compelling enough to capture and hold attention.  This book fails to capture and hold your attention because the author's writing style makes his story of discovering the positive impact of storytelling uninteresting.

There are some positives in the book.  If you are involved in knowledge management, you may be able to follow the story a little better.  Also, the appendix tells you the essential elements of a springboard story and takes stories in the book and dissects them into those elements.  Finally, the book touches both on crafting the story and delivering the story, though neither is treated with a lot of depth.

If you already have experience with storytelling and want a reference on how to apply to business, this book could be useful.  However, I would first look for a used copy to purchase
