I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book, but was sorely disappointed. Granted, the language was challenging at times (I kept a dictionary close by), but I just couldn't empathize with the  main character, Max. The story dragged on. I couldn't wait to finish it (I swore I would). What a waste of time. I'll be giving this book away at the next yard sale
