While this book contains some good information about the effects of stress on the body and the body's biochemical response to stress, it mixes this up with a lot of pseudoscience: telling you that you can control your cortisol levels by taking vitamin supplements, which will then solve all your health problems and make you slim! As another reviewer has pointed out, Shawn Talbott sells a slimming aid called Corti-Slim, containing mostly vitamins, which seems to have no science behind it's claims.

If you are looking for a book based on science and fact, I would recommend "The Stress of Life" by Hans Selye, or "Mind-Body Health and Stress Tolerance" by David Jameson instead of this one
