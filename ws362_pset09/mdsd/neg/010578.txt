Copyrighted in 2001, the Cisco CCNP library has already been rendered obsolete by Cisco themselves.  Not only exam revisions, but a fundamental structural change to the CCNP examination series has taken place in the short time since these books were put on the market.  Unfortunately, I can see no other benefit to these books beyond providing a revenue stream to Cisco.  There are better books available if one is looking for truly educational technical books rather than exam-specific guides
