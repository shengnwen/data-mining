I liked this book very much when I started reading it.  The authors' characterizations of sailing were right on the money.  The characters and plot start out interesting but it seems the book was rushed to a sloppy and confusing ending that left me dissatisfied and wanting more.  I kept waiting for somthing to tie things together, but it never happened
