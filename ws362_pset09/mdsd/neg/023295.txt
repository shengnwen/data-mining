First of all, the recipes in this book are NOT especially "quick and easy, so you can spend more time on the beach."  Most of them looked pretty time-consuming to me.  Secondly, they're all recipes that you probably already have:  Gazpacho, grilled shrimp, lobster rolls, mango salsa, pasta salads with chicken, lemon-glazed poundcake with berries, apple crisp...  I have to confess that I didn't try any of them (because nothing seemed the slightest bit new or original).  The recipes may work fine for all I know -- but I think that if you already have cookbooks like Barefoot Contessa, Silver Palate or any of the other classics, you really don't need this one
