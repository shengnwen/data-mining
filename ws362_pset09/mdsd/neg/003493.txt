As part of a $250.00 order, I ordered the Michelin France Provence map in English, and the Michelin 2006 Red Guide France: Hotels and Restaurants in English - both Items they sent me were written in French, which are of no value to me.  I requested a shipping label to return the map and the book and asked they send me the English versions. The Amazon Outsourcing Desk in India refused both request.  I requested an American Amazon Customer Service Manager contact me on this Issue.  That has never happened.  I am also being asked my Satisfaction on a 3d book - Markets Of Provence - which they never sent me.  The remainder of my $250.00 order were the English Versions, as ordered.  My Overall Satisfaction:  Well below the 1 Star shown.  Actual Satisfaction "F Minus" for all departments in Amazon and far less for their very poor Customer Service and lack of ethical follow-up for their mistake
