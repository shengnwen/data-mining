I am also a biologist, and was not particularly thrilled with the book.  The drawings are decent, but the amateur key used to limit your choices is too amateur.  The distribution of covered species is strictly for the  Northeastern U.S., except for the occasional wide-spread grasses.  If your  not in the Northeast, another guide would be more benefical
