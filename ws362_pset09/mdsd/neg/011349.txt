This book was chosen by my office reading group.  It was generally felt to be a disappointment.  I for one really liked the writing style and prose but wondered why simpler words were not chosen.  Some felt, too, they required a dictionary by their side.  It was definitely a book one could easily put down.  There wasn't much in the way of character development and the story lacked intrigue.  The ending, too, was a disappointment
