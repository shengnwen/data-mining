This book by Timothy White is a shallow delve into the life of reggae legend Bob Marley. The book promises to deliver on details of his early life, his rise to stardom, and his death in the crushing grip of cancer. However, Mr. White spends far too much time on the small and irrelevant details of Marley's early years and leaves the reader wanting more and getting less. The book progresses with minor details loosely strung together with trival information and little 'meat' in the scope of the life of one of the most influential musicians of all time. Overall, I would have to say that this is one of the worst books about Marley that I have ever read and I think that though he began with good intentions, Mr. Timothy White did not deliver on his promises to fulfill the reader with knowledge about the life of Bob Marley
