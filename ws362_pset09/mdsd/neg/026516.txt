"You've got to be kidding me" is what I exclaimed when I received this book in the mail.  I was shocked that it had a solid 5 stars from all of the reviewers as I think this book is very outdated. If you are interested in current fashion and beauty trends, this book is not for you.  Although the copyright is 2001, it might as well be 1986 -- that's what the photos look like.  Yes, the diagrams are somewhat helpful but if you are a lover of current fashion photography, you won't be inspired by any of the photographs to actually use the techniques. I found the photographs and the art direction of the photographs to be a bit cheesy and tacky.
