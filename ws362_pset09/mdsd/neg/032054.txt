While I have an excellent understanding of the metaphysical philosopy, the idea that one can diagnose and cure disease such as HIV and Aids with diet, castor oil packs and the like, is absurd. As a registered nurse, my first and only encounter with this author, leaves me unsure, other than book sales, why she would make this claim.  
The early introduction of this holistic, and terribly simplistic approach to HIV treatment, instantly blows her credibility as any kind of holistic intuitive/healer. The book rambles and shows an overwhelming self-absorption of the author with her real or imagined skills.
