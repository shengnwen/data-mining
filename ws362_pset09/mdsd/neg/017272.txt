I am loathe to pan a book in the review section, but I can't help it here.  This is the first book of the series that I picked up.  I was hoping to find a new series of the whole "southern mystery/women" genre to devour.

First of all, the book starts off slamming you with about 800 different names of people you have no hope of keeping straight in your head.  Childs offers very little (if any) information to make each character memorable as they're introduced.  Just sort of tosses them all out pell-mell and helter-skelter.

Throughout the book, the murder plot is dry, the dialogue is irritating and sometimes simply pointless, and I just could not bring myself to care.  I want my two hours back.  If this is an example of this author's writing style, I won't be grabbin' any more of her stuff
