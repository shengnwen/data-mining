I knew it. The title should have warned me. . . .I don't mind the autor talking about her sex life interwoven with her (incredibly brief) photojournalism gig. Good for her, right? It was really inspiring at first. But then about half way through I realized. . . .what self obssesion, what compelete lack of understanding- this women is incredibly privlaged white girl who travels to war torn countries and can find nothing to write about but her sex life? Then, just as her career is taking off, she decideds to stay at home and be full time mommy? Well, a harvard educated, privlaged mommy, who lives on the upper west side w/ a full time brown skinned nanny. IT'S INSULTING TO ME AS A WOMEN AND AS A MINORITY. It's the 21st century -how about a women who sticks it out, with no regrets? How about a Christine Amanpour? Why doesn't her husband stay home, and she continue her career? Plenty of women have done just that. She's really lucky to have that choice, and the oppurtunities she gave up. . . . it's sort of sad. Why do the people who publish the books continue to promote this myth- women can either have a fufilling home life or a great carrear, but not both? I reccomend this book for an exciting, vacation read- but not much else.
