i am currently living in japan, studying japanese.  i bought this before coming in order to study kanji.  the book expressly advertises itself as a beginners book, but it isn't.  when studying any individual kanji, you are expected to remember many more difficult kanji for each "6 kanji" check test.  personally, i cannot remember kanji without writing it.  i have showed the book's check tests to japanese co-workers who say they are really difficult, and they are fluently bilingual.  i now study with kids drill books, grade one and two, and kanji power is useful as a dictionary with these drills, but as a stand alone book, it is incredibly intimidating
