I read this and not surprisingly found it rather shallow. Eric sees the downfall of the WCW brought about by the Merger of Turner and Time Warner, whereas in reality the WCW had been in decline for a long time when that happened. If you want a better read on the fall of the company read, The Death of WCW, a very good read and very informative book.
