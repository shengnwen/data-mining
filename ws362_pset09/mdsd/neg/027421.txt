Sorry to be extreme, but after dealing with infertility for two years I'm finally pregnant thanks to IVF. I am disgusted by her obsession with her thinness ( I was a size 6 when fertility treatments started two years ago - now I'm a size 10 or so and wouldn't trade it for anything because now I get to be a mommie). Her smoking was disgusting...Her declaration to "cram" for all her baby knowledge was appalling. What an idiot - I rarely feel so strongly about a book but this one pushed me over the edge. What an insult to pregnancy and the life process. I'm throwing it away...
