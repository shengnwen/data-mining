If you are a big David Sklansky follower do not buy this book. If you do, be ready for a big letdown. This is mostly a compilation book of ideas written about much more thoroughly in other of Sklansky's and Malmouth's other books. Because they touch on so many topics here, they could not discuss them in as great of detail as the books devoted primarily to those subjects-mostly poker and blackjack. When Two plus Two(their publishing company) started really taking off they put out several books that were riding the wave of their most popular and respected titles. This book has a sell-out feel to me; I felt like they were just trying to cash in on the publics' perception that anything they wrote was the definitive work on the subject. Stick with the poker titles and pass on this one
