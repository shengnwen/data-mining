I loved "Fargo Rock City" and "Sex and Drugs and Cocoa Puffs", but I was disappointed with "Killing Yourself to Live". It's like a Spin article--relatively entertaining while you're reading it, and then you completely forget about it when you're through. 

None of the characters were particularly likeable (including Chuck himself), which is something that can save a book if it's lacking in other areas. Plot? A very weak one that isn't even the main focus of the book. The subplot of the women in his life was also equally weak; he builds it up like he's going to have a revelation, or something's going to happen, yet nothing does. 

This book could have stopped halfway through or it could have kept on going and going... it wouldn't have made a difference. It would have been just as unforgettable
