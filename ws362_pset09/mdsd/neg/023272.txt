I was disappointed in this book.  I was expecting a Red Dress Ink book a little different from the other ones I had read.  This book jumps all over the place without being interesting in any one area.  I think this novel wasn't really about anything in particular.  I got quite annoyed with the character at times.  It was pretty obvious that she had misjudged the character she was in love with and it was just a matter of getting to the end of the book to finally see them get together.  I was glad to be done with this book and move on to another one.  I think the first 5 pages are intriguing and from then on it goes downhill.  I doubt I would recommend this book to anyone
