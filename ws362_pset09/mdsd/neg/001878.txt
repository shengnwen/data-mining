My toddler loves Caillou, but this book doesn't do much to help facilitate potty training.  My son never thought of wearing his potty chair on his head until we read it in this book.  Ugh.  It also isn't very clear about what Caillou is doing on the potty, and there is too much emphasis on his accidents.  I think we read this book twice before I donated it to our library - I figured that way at least a parent could read through it to decide if it would help them before spending money on it
