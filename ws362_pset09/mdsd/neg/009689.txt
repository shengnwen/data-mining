Borg is new and he is trendy...as Dr. Gardner alludes to in another review here, his interpretation of the Bible etc. almost totally disregards some of the core fundamentals of the Christian faith. It is yet another example of a flash in the pan perversion of Christianity...to claim that Jesus is not God flies against a most central belief...perhaps worth knowing about, but beware...  It continually amazes me how we are all so subject to becoming blind to the deeper truths of the Bible...for anyone interested in a relatively thorough critique of Borg, go to www.equip.org and do a search for Borg. You will find a review of his work which I highly recommend that you read before you buy any of Borgs books.  

I bought three of his books via Amazon on the advice of a good friend...anyone interested in getting three of his works real cheap?

By the way, I wish that Amazon would provide a rating of "0' for things that are totally worthless...I struggle to give this book even one star
