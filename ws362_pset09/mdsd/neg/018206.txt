I actually picked up this book in my church library.  While, I'm wary of christian romances, this one caught my eye.  And I loved it!  Dee Henderson's writing style is fun and her charachters are okay.  She deals much more honestly with the realities of the world then other romance novels.  Having read almost all of her books now though, I have to say that they are dangerous for young women.  Every book is a romance with God playing a distant second to the man and woman who are falling in love.  In all of them that I've read, the formula is exactly the same.  Man or Woman of God meets Woman or Man who is not a Christian with a personal battle to overcome.  Get them together through some sort of danger fall in love.  Even before the non-christian converts though, while the christian is saying that they can't date them, they still kiss and pursue each other.  This teaches young women 1. That it's good to pursue a non-christian-after all maybe you'll convert them. 2. That physical reletionships are okay with non-christians, even if you can't date them. 3. That a non-christian will inevitably fall in love with Jesus if you want them to.  I'm going to ask my church to remove it from our library.  A great alternative is Shaunti Feldhaun's two novels The Veritas Conflict, and the Lights of Tenth Street.
