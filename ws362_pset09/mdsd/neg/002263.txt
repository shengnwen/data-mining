This book is one goofy rumor after another.  With hardly any verifiable sources, Epstein goes crazy throwing out every possible conspiracy idea around.  He actually states that Hammer financed Al Gore's college education, and that the whole Gore family were his servants.  If you love the &quot;X Files&quot; you will love this book
