i bought this book/dvd in the hope it would actually take me through various pieces for the classicl guitar. instead it spends overlong on things like nails, scales  and arpeggios....having the lessons set in mocked up gym was so cheesy as to be embarrassing. all we got was the maestro zipping through some fine pieces...what i wanted was step by step instruction on how to play them!!! dont buy unless you have the intellectual capacity of a boiled potat
