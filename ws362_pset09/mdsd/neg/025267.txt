This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT
