I was so offended with this book. I agree with Bruce in regards to the conservatives and how they shape our image. But to put blame on the activist and the more eccentric gay people is just ridiculous.  I was both an activist and eccentric and let me tell you I fought for my rights every day of my life.  I am proud of this struggle because I never compromised myself to fit in and appear normal....and I know my example has played a small part in changing this world for the better.  Those so called mainstream and normal gays are enjoying life because of people like me.  We fought the fight while they sat back and pasted judgment...how dare they.  The reason the activist and eccentric gays appear to shape the gay image is because they are the brave souls! If you want the world to know that we all aren't that way then get your normal, mainstream ass out of the closet and do your part.....how can you expect the people to know that not every one gay is eccentric and an activist if you guys are always hiding behind closed doors in fear. In my opinion you normal wannabees are the real threat to gay freedom
