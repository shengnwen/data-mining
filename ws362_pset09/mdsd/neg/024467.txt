This book is entirely misleading. Paul Johnson employs one of the dirtiest tricks known to humanity and very common in the political world - he picks a triple handful of intellectuals he doesn't like or disagrees with and digs up the darkest or absurdest material about them he can find.  I would have been a bit more impressed if he had chosen intellects or historical figures he revered and subjected them to the same dirty treatment.  Where are Mr. Johnson's favorite writers, popes, theologians, political philosophers and what all.  But it still would've been a mugs game and not worth much more beyond entertainment value except, perhaps, to affirm what all mature readers ought to know by now - we are all sinners.  Big deal.  Welcome to the real world, folks.
Mr. Johnson does a singular disservice by his idiosyncratic use of the word "intellectual" by which he can push forward his smear campagain against intellectuals whose ideas bother him and white wash intellectuals he approves of.
His treatment of Evelyn Waugh is absurd.  Mr. Waugh, contra Mr. Johnson, was most definitely an intellectual and he had his own ideas about how the world should be run.  Mr. Johnson does not take seriously Waugh's roster of sins which include an almost overbearing arrogance, the basic innability to admit when he was wrong, discourteousy to friend and foe alike, and a callous and ostentatious flaunting of wealth which would have won him the censure of the writer of the Epistle of James.
I'll give Mr. Johnson's tabloid journalism two stars instead of one because it does have its entertainment value. Mere entertainment always has charm especially when wisdom is lacking
