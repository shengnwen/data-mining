This book struck me because it appears to address a wide issue in depth.  Unfortunately, the introduction only gives a few brief details about the authors of the book, who include mainly interested writers, as far as I can tell.  As a former history major, I have often come across examples of exhaustive research; unfortunately, this book cannot fall under that criterion.  Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln are not trained scholars and their mildly critical perspective leads to some interesting logical jumps.  Unfortunately, the authors will posit a claim with only one source to support their argument.  This sort of specious scholarship allows the writer many freedoms in terms of the conclusions he can come to, because of the lack of acknowledgment of conflicting sources which would heap contrary evidence on his weak claims.  Overall, the book is neither terribly interesting nor well-researched.  This is like if the Da Vinci Code were a restaurant and Holy Blood, Holy Grail were the menu.  It seems appetizing but there isn't any substance or sauce to entertain the taste-buds.
