Like other books in the "...for Dummies" series, this one is well written, informative and fun to read. Unfortunately, it is also very out of date. eBay has changed SO much since it was published that, for me, it was a waste of time and money. I had been an eBay member for about a month when I purchased the book. I had learned the basics simply by participating in the eBay community. What I wanted was not the most basic information, but rather some advanced knowledge, and that was completely lacking. So my advice would be if you understand the basic workings of eBay, go elsewhere for more subtle and/or advanced information.  If, on the other hand, you simply want to literally learn how to join, log on, bid or other extremely basic actions, this might be a good book for you. And did I mention I know where you can buy a barely used copy of this book for next to nothing
