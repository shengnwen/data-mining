This book was dreadful.  The author fails to flesh out the premise of the book--the title--and instead goes off on a series of tangents and non sequitirs.  Perhaps this book wouldn't have been so unsatisfying if the author had been more honest with its contents.   This is hardly a story of some great gamble taken by Jefferson.   Jefferson is at best a minor character in the story, and his infleuence is never credibly substantiated.  Even the &quot;good&quot; parts--those dealing with Livingston--seem to lack any sort of conviction.   Basically this book is series of partially interesting character portraits sandwiched by completely misleading introductory and closing chapters.  I can find no other way to say it than this book was very poorly written and was a huge disappointment
