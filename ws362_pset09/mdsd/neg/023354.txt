Why was this book written?  If this was an actual novel by Lord Byron, maybe the overstuffed mishmash of a plot (Doppelgangers!  Duels!  Zombies!  War!  Madness!) would have shed useful light on his life.  But, as a pastiche, all it really is is an overstuffed mishmash, interspersed with an epistolary novel about a not-terribly-interesting young woman forming a relationship with her not-terribly-interesting father, an expatriate Roman Polansky type.  

I kept comparing it, unfavorably, with another piece of mock-early-1800's writing, "Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell," which, at twice the length, is still by far the more engrossing read.  That, too, is overstuffed, but it gives the sense that all the many pieces have been carefully placed by an intelligent authorial hand.  Crowley, in "LBN," tries to take the sting out of his book's incoherence by passing it off as an uncorrected first draft.  

The one effect "LBN" had on me was to go and read some Byron-- but even that urge was blunted by the epistolary characters' repeated references to how opaque and unread Byron is.

I got this book as a present, which is the only reason I read it all the way through.  It's going to be a long time before I pick up anything else by Crowley.
