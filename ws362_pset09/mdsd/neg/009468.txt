This book could have been written in 1/4 the number of pages. The author repeats his information countless times. He has some good things to say, but saying them so many times is senseless. The layout is also counterproductive. Many times throughout the book the author refers to the Liver Detox Diet, but doesn't give that diet until toward the end of the book.
Summary of the book: Take a week or so and eat/drink nothing but juiced or pureed fruits and vegetables (organic preferred)
