i love music and i love making music, but i don't read music or study it.  to me, that would take all the fun out of it.  if you're like me, you might dislike this book.  this book is HUGE... excluding the appendices, it's about 440 large pages of instructions.. are you kidding me?  it says things like "do this one particular thing for 5 minutes, then this for 7 minutes" etc..  i would never try to follow so many detailed, lengthy instructions..  i like other OOBE books i've seen better.  maybe this is great for some people, but i need something easier, and more to the point.
