Tolle has managed to pull together the thoughts of the writers of present living and non duality and made the subject into his own. A good book for the beginner in this field. Anyone who has read widely will see it as just another self help book of which there are millions on the market. How do i know this book is useless. It made no difference to me. I have read this stuff years ago in a beginners guide to relaxation. As I say however it is a good start for beginners
