Please do not be fooled by the title of this book or by the fact that Kitwana is exploring an "unexplored" facet of American pop culture.  If you are seriously into hip hop this book is not for you.  If you have no preconceived notions and/or previous interest in hip hop Why White Kids... may prove to be mildly engaging, unless you choose to delve further into the culture and music.  As the Publishers Weekly review states, Kitwana races past the so-called "subject" of his book and when he does address young white involvement in HH culture his narratives are painfully dated.  X-Clan, Bambaataa, Public Enemy, Rakim, SugarHill Gang ("Rapper's Delight" as important a song as it is, it does not need to be referenced two million times in a 210pp book) are the groups and people that create the framework for his analysis.  N.W.A, 50 Cent, Dre, Kweli, etc. are swept by in passing.  The book seems like an addendum to The Hip Hop Generation, which IS groundbreaking-Are these the unused chapters?  The few pages on SoundScan are worthwhile and thoughtful.  Though Kitwana's ace has to be his use of Billy "Upski"-of Bomb the Suburbs fame-whose few quotes are predictable.  If you enjoy the music of any of these groups rest assured you will not find them in this book, and will probably walk away as frustrated as me: 

M.O.P.
All of Def Jux
All of Rhymesayers
Jean Grae
MF Doom
Das Efx
Mos Def (Yes! I swear Mos Def, is mos def M.IA.)
Immortal Technique
Cam'Ron
Tribe Called Quest
De La Soul
Blackalicious
Prince Paul
Gang Starr....		

However, don't get it twisted, I'm not making claims on what's "real HH," this just seems like the best way to summarize.
