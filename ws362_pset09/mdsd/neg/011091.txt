Not only do most of these stories follow the cop-out of "throw enough dysfunction at the wall and hope it's shocking and/or angsty enough to stick and seem meaningful and interesting" but they're also a tease. 

In writing workshop, I learned that every story has to have a problem (of which there are plenty in these), a climax (mostly lacking) and a resolution (of whatever kind, even if nothing really gets resolved. In this case, lacking in almost every story). 

Most of these stories just end, often when things just seem like they're about to happen. Most of the characters blend together. I didn't care about them, and the stories didn't feel finished. A bunch of kids in trouble, broken homes, drugs, sex, violence and incest doesn't make good writing unless the story is complete and compelling. To me it just felt like an angsty laundry list
