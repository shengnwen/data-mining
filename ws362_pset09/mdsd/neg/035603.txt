I have to admit I haven't read this book and perhaps never will. I have however, seen how the ideas in this book is applied by a believer of these authors (Protein Power) when working out. The mere concept of slowness that the title suggests is disturbing. 

"Results" has been the buzz word to getting healthy and fit. Yet, it is proving to be an obstacle to what people NEED more of - movement. People might want results in "30 minutes a week" but unfortunately only at the great expense or should I say excuse of moving less and believing this is best in their lifetime. 

We need to move more, not less. We all need to practice moderation in all things, not adhering to one extreme (e.g., short duration workouts) or the other (e.g., long duration workouts).
