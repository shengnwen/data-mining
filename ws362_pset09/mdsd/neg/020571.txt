This is a wistful collection of quotations garnered from a wide variety of artists, writers, politicians, &c who have contemplated or, at least made a side remark, on the nature of ennui. I got this book for free at a library sale, and honestly, I wouldn't pay that much more for it. I enjoy having it around just to flip through, particularly when suffering from ennui, but its utility is not much more. As with any book of quotations based on a theme, especially one as complex as ennui, it is hard to take the content too seriously because of the lack of context for each quotation--and without the context, it's hard to contemplate the nature of what's being said, which renders this book, more or less, a novelty item.
