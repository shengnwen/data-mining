I just didn't like this book.  I think that the racial overtones were over played. I've always thought that the human race would unite against a common enemy, especially a human killing ET.  Dietz did do a good job with the action sequences, but there were not enough of them.  The book waffled between an action book and a political book and did a poor job at both.

Pro- good action sequences, different plot and take on humanity

Con- too many alien names, personally, I just didn't like the plot. Story seemed very sterile with really no emotion.

It's a short book if you want to read, but i would take a pass on it
