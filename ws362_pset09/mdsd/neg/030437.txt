This is one of those math books where the authors enjoy making inexplicable leaps between equations that really don't follow in a smooth logical fashion one from another.  They are terrible at explaining things.  They like to boast that they are from Stanford, (subtext: implied: if you are not from Stanford you probably wouldn't understand it anyway, you poor pitiful low-income commoner).  I absolutely hate the tone of this book.  And the side comments in the margins are inane, weak and mostly irritating.  I threw it aside in disgust and went back to Warren Weaver.
