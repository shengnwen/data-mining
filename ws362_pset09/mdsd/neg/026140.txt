I thought the portions of the book dealing with makeup to be the most interesting. What some women put themselves through! I definitely saw some parallels to our society today. Yet when it came to the chapters about hair removal and clothing, I was bored senseless. Is it, however, fascinating to see how our definition of "beauty" has changed over the years. I especially like the old advertisements and pictures the author included.  Not bad, but those not specifically interested in women's clothing styles of years past may be a bit bored in some sections
