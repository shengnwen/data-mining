Being a big fan of information, I was very interested in the book. But the contents were a huge disappointment. The writer spends too much time about telling stories of personal relations to the people behind the models, and the role of "information" in various parts of the book is lost quite completely.

There are, however very interesting and informative (sic) parts of the book. Noise in the Shannon-Weaver -model is described in a way that really tells more about the concept, both in the respect if information theory and everyday life. The effects of noise are brought up in several parts of the book, in various fashions.

The book is well-written, and easy to read. But title is misleading, and the contents are quite thin for somebody interested in the subject
