So awful that if I could have given it a half star I would have--and even  that would have been overly generous. The heroine is a cop and a woman and seems to be totally stupid as both.Her lover -- someone investigating a case for which she's currently under suspension for--makes a pass at her virtually from their first meeting and she almost encourages his attention. She falls into bed with him at the first opportunity even though he has major questions about her innocence. The plotline is idiotic and predictable -- I knew who done it almost from chapter one. This wasn't worth the money it cost or the time it took to download it. Don't bother. This is a total embarrassment and gives books about interracial romance a really bad name
