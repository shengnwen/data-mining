As I started to read this book, I am alarmed with his love fest for Oklahoma.  Stating that 1 out of 10 Baseball players came out of Oklahoma?  The Deans for example were born and lived in Arkansas.  Warren Spahn was born and grew up in Buffalo NY.  Carl Hubell was born in Missouri.  I want to believe in the author and trust in his information but with his wild exageration about Oklahoma being the hotbed for baseball I begin to wonder if his research will be flawed as well.  I have been to Oklahoma and stayed the night many times but I am not from there!  For him to steal Paul and Dizzy Dean from Arkansas raises questions.  They always claimed Arkansas as home
