I liked Confessions of a Shopaholic and I like the main character Becky, but this book goes a little too far into la la land for any of it to be real.  In C of a S, I could follow Becky's reasoning and obsessive shopping mentality.  Throw that into wedding planning and the author seemed to be making up completely unrealistic situations.  I couldn't identify with Becky anymore and kept turning the page wanting it to end.  And after everything, of course it ends perfectly.  It was a quick read, but it lost that fun and identifiable-ness that the original book possessed
