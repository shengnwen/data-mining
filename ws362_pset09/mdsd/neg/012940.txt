Considering the reviews I've read thus far, this cookbook is comprable to eggplant: either you love it or you hate it. I am an avid cookbook user, and adventurous in my tastes. It seems as though every time I went to this book for a recipe, I ended up somewhere else. The recipes are just weird. I think in the five years I owned it, I only used it twice. I really gave it a shot. I find the title wildly ironic considering I received another slow cooker cookbook for Christmas and already see dozens of recipes I want to try. Never the case with this volume
