I have had nothing but problems with this book.  The practice problems in the chapter do not reflect the ones at the end of the chapter, which pretty much leaves it up to you to figure out what is going on.  The chapters are not well written in the first place!  Very hard to follow!  There is no supplemental solution manual to follow along with so you can see how the practice problems were solved.  I could go on and on.  In general, possibly the worst chemistry text I have ever had to use
