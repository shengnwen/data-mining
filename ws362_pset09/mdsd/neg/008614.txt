  Tens of thousands of books are published every year: few of them sell more than a couple of thousand copies at best. Sometimes you come across a book from a "name" publisher and wonder why the manuscript wasn't tossed into the wastbasket. This is one of those books.

  This book is filled with New Age nostrums. "Let's visit the cosmic sphere tht contains our neighborhood - the center of our visible universe." (By the way, Leo Tolstoi visited this neighborhood in the 19th Century in his "The Kingdom of God is Within You.") More great advice from Primack and Abrams, the husband-wife team that claims great new cosmological insights: "Movement becomes a mere idea. There is no visible way to detect it, only the tricky conciousness of time passing." Here's another gem: "The Cosmic Las Vegas metaphor illustrates trhe random, quantum nature of eternal inflation, but it gives no sense of what the theory of eternal inflation could mean if it is true." Yeah. Sure.

  Reciting every mawkish statement in this pretentious tome would take as much space as the book itself. As a final example, how about "We represent  an age on Earth comparable to the age of cosmic inflation at the beginning of the universe: brief, but about to set the pattern for the long-term future. . . . For our entire species, today matters."

  This New Age gruel is served up as a plea for scientific thinking. It is anything but. It is a feel-good tract on how special you are, much like the character in the classic Saturday Night Live sketch.

  Greater good could have been done by saving the trees sacrificed for the paper the nonsensical nostrums of Priamck and Abrams are printed on.
