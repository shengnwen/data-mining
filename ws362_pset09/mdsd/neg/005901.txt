I was absolutely horrified after reading the Fungi section in this book.  Most of the information is blatantly incorrect (mushrooms are not plants, the destroying angel does not cause death in six hours, etc).  Do NOT follow her belief that morels are a "safe and easy" mushroom to collect.  They have several poisonous look-alikes that the beginner can easily mistake for a morel.  The false morel can kill you if eaten raw or undercooked.  Worse, the very inaccurate drawings in the book look much more like a false morel or elfin saddle than a true morel.  As so many of the "facts" listed in the fungi section are wrong, I looked for more errors in the book and found them.  It made me very suspicious of the rest of the information it contains.  If you are looking for a good book on companion gardening get "Great Garden Companions, a Companion-Planting System for a Beautiful, Chemical-Free Vegetable Garden" by Sally Jean Cunningham
