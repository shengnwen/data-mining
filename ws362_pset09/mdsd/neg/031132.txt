I agree with Jodi (see her review further down) -- Teitelbaum is confused into thinking that the chronic fatigue he experienced as an overworked medical student is the same as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  True CFS (which involves neurologic, endocrine, cardiorespiratory and other abnormalities, not merely extreme fatigue) has far more symptoms than just fatigue.  It's generally a result of a virus, not "burn out".

For those who have real CFS, some of the advice can be hazardous. Experts concur that exercise is detrimental, especially to those in the advanced stages who have viral damage to their heart muscle ... I know several patients who've been rendered permanently bedridden after following misguided advice to exercise their way to health.  In fact, reaction to exercise is one of the ways the experts differentiate between CFS and depression.  (see www.cfsfacts.org for details on this diagnostic shortcut)

I've tried Teitelbaum's Fatigued to Fantastic formula; even at maximum dosage, it didn't put me to sleep.  It might help if you have chronic fatigue (the symptom) from insufficient sleep, but Chronic Fatigue SYNDROME is not sleeping too little, but not feeling refreshed when you wake up even if you've slept 20 hours.

See Jodi's list of good books about the Syndrome (not the symptom); I'd add David S. Bell's "Doctor's Guide to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" as one of my top picks
