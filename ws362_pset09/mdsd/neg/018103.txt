This book, although it covers a broad range of topics, does not adequately cover any of them.  I teach sewing and bough this book thinking it might be good to use as a text, and was very disappointed.  The pictures are hard to see, the directions vague.  If I did not know what they meant already, I never would have been able to figure it out from this text.  I do not recommend this book to any seamstress at any level
