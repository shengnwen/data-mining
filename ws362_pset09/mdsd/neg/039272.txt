I bought this book because my mother lives in the Alentejo. I intended to read it and then send it to her. But I'm struggling to even finish it. I'm a college graduate, and I've read plenty of complex novels, but this one leaves me feeling like I'm missing some skill necessary to decode it. I think I need an English Literature class in order to understand it, and frankly, I don't want to put that much work into reading for pleasure. There are too many characters, with too little to tie them together, and sentences thrown in at the end of paragraphs that leave me thinking "huh?"

Others clearly love this book, so I realize this is just a mismatch between reader and style of book. But I thought I should write a review so that others who want plenty of accessible plot in a book know to look elsewhere
