It is well known that the Chomskyans don't listen to criticism, however well taken.

The result is the 1995 Chomsky essays, in which relatively well known and primitive problems of English syntax are clothed in practically unreadable technical language, to lead to highly artificial pretentious solutions which are as counterintuitive as you please. Not as if simpler solutions weren't possible.

In the meanwhile, the entire ivory tower of MIT linguistics has become an impregnable fortress of sectarians who will only deal with the problem of the most perfect formal presentations of well known linguistic problems in their own narrow theoretical framework, regardless of new research in the facts of language, as discovered daily by the language statisticians and the sociolinguists for example. 

One cannot enter the fortress because they have made it inaccessible. But it is not uncomfortable to have the fortress in one's back, because nobody will come out, either, to meet criticism or to face new empirical evidence about language
