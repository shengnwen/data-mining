While there are many positive aspects to this diet (namely, increased fruit and vegetable consumption), I did NOT find it effective for weight loss. My sister and I both followed the menu plan for phase one...my sister stayed the same weight and I actually gained 1 pound! I believe that the foods were not filling/fibrous enough for the calories, since you use fruit juices and concentrates and some other relatively empty foods. I will say that I felt healthy otherwise and had less headaches than usual. This may be a good general way of eating for some, but it was ineffective for weight loss as it promises.

I would recommend "Eat to Live" by Dr. Joel Fuhrman instead of this book. Dr. Fuhrman uses medical evidence to back up his beliefs, and I truly believe that his medical background makes it trustworthy and revolutionary
