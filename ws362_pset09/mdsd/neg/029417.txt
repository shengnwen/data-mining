Truly amazing. Finally a book that captures the essence of disgusting. Words cannot describe the dullness that drifts from the pages of Black Rage, like the smoke from a factory. A thought that could have been condensed into a sentence or two the authors have managed to expand into 200 pages of nothingness.  Though it may have started off as a cute idea, it quickly turned into a nauseating yet boring book. If you enjoyed Black Rage you may also enjoy the encyclopedia, thesaurus, or just sitting in a room for hours doing nothing
