Personally, I am infuriated when an author deliberately writes obtusely to show off how "artsy" he is, or how vast a vocabulary he has.  The author here does that throughout this book.  Here's one example- "the halter of specificity has been imposed on heretofore disorderly concepts."

My other strong objection to this book is how the author takes an active voice asserting his own (incorrect, in my opinion) philosophy.  He does this in numerous ways in numerous places throughout the book.  For example, he indicates Aristotle's philosophy as something that Newton needed to overcome, instead of recognizing Aristotle's role as the originator of the scientific method.  As another example, the author states that Newton's religion, Arianism is "heresy."  He says this despite the fact he admits that Newton kept his religious views to himself.  How did the author determine Newton's religion?  For that matter how did the author determine anything?  The book has no bibliography, much less footnotes.

Finally even Newton's scientific work is undercut by the author's poor views on this subject.  For example, the author sees an arbitrariness in the fact that Newton's laws "favor" a straight line.  The author asks "why a straight line?" and claims Newton had no answer
