I have generally had excellent luck in ordering books based on Amazon's recommendation system. This is the first to really 'miss the mark' for me.

I had enjoyed both Sarah Durant's "In the Company of a Courtesan" and "The Birth of Venus", as well as "The Illuminator" by Brenda Vantrese. While this book was set during the same period as the three previous books, it lacked the captivating qualities they all embodied.

In addition, while I realize that the Renaissance was a troubled time, full of strife and prejudice, "The Rare and Curious Gift" was far too mean spirited. I really couldn't identify with the 'good' characters, and the reading itself was plodding and depressing.

It is my hope that other readers will pick one of the other books I've mentioned, and really enjoy the time period more fully
