Irving has lost his mind! This was sad to read as it just dragged on forever with no reward in sight. The taboo subjects were a little creepy but its main problem was that he wasted these developed characters on a dull, repetitive story. I think he is (was?) one of the greatest American writers alive. He must have a comeback novel next time out. If not, I think someone should check in on him
