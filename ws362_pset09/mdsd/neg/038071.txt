Leveen's book is much like the products he is famous for: slight, expensive, and possibly overblown.

Which isn't to say there aren't kernels of knowledge one can derive from the book.  Unlike many Levenger products, the book is about achieving a deeper relationship with reading and not about looking good while doing it.

To achieve a well-read life, Leveen suggests that you 1) make a list of books you want to read and keep them in categories (Leveen is fairly insistent that you buy the books you want to read - he obviously hasn't considered how expensive that might be); 2) practice the SQ3R method (survey, question, read, recite, review) and preferably write in your books; consider audio books as an addition to, but not replacement of, "reading"; join a reading group.

And that's the book in a nutshell.  There are no a-ha moments unless you're one of those people who doesn't believe in audiobooks, and shame on you if you are.  There is little here that anyone who has ever asked him or herself the question "how can I read more?" hasn't already considered.

In fact, the book made me a little uneasy for two reasons.  First, Leveen's overwhelming need to "possess" books he has or might want to read.  There is little discussion of public libraries and the value they provide to those who cannot afford personal libraries.  Second, Leveen's insistence that writing in one's books is important.  Yes, such an activity can improve one's understanding of the book, but frequently one can't write in a book (library) or would prefer not to (expensive/valuable, such as a first edition).  Writing marginalia is often not nearly as effective as taking real notes
