Obviously skilled in her practice, the author really gets her hands dirty with this book.  The only problem I have with this book is that, well, I just didn't understand what she was talking about.  I've read many books about general practice and little about theory and, as the name of the book suggests with the inclusion of the word &quot;theory,&quot; I expected to learn something about the theory of &quot;witchcraft.&quot;  I just didn't.  It seemed like she was trying to be abstract and mysterious while battling the need to be technical and explanatory.  I felt, throughout the book, that she was being creatively fictional (and not the inspirational kind) rather than paying attention to the mission of the book.  Teach the reader about theory in a way that invites the public rather than a way that nurtures a mere minority
