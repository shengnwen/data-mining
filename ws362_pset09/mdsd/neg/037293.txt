This is a stupid book.  I got about half way through and stopped reading.  Blech.  Stilted language and not one character to root for.  The main character (Jane McGuire) is petulant, rude and for all her "worldliness" is very childish.  She seems to be constantly stamping her beautiful little foot and uttering "Damn you!!!"  She insists on doing as she pleases and all the responsible adults around her roll over, declare that she knows best, and allow her to do it.  And she is such an irresistible "woman" that 34 year old Mark Trevor salivates over her (this part is just weird) as do almost all of the other male characters.  And she is portrayed to be so much older than 20 year old Jock and 23 or so Mario.  Puh-lease.  Oh, yeah.  Ya gotta love how the ridiculous plot includes ancient treasure, international terrorism, and numerous references to 9/11 and Homeland Security.  Ooohh.  This is my first IJ book and surely my last.  I got to page 250 before bailing on it.  What was the publisher thinking
