The book was a decent read but I found Bonanno to be quit repeatative at times.  He goes on and on about the Sicilian way of life, and how American's more or less don't understand it.  Furthermore he tiptoes around all violence that comes with being in the "Family" as he so eloquently puts it.  I found it to be a little dry, not so "tell all", and in the end I find Mr. Bonanno using his Sicilian background and way of life as justification for being in organized crime.  Although he himself would never admit that the "Family" he was apart of was organized crime, the crux of the book.  He calls himself a "Man of Honor" yet he admitly cheats on his wife and lived a life ingrossed in organized crime, hypocritical to say the least
