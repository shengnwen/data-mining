In scanning the book's index, I was surprised that there was no reference to Fred Waring and his musical organization, the Pennsylvanians, and their relationship with "Battle Hymn of the Republic."  Having been a member of the Pennsylvanians, I know for a fact that it was Waring and his choral arranger Roy Ringwald who are responsible for re-discovering this obscure Civil War hymn and featuring it on one of their Chesterfield Pleasure Time broadcasts in the early 1940's.  Singlehandedly, Waring brought this stirring patriotic anthem to the public consciousness, and from that point on he featured "Battle Hymn" as the closing song in all of his live concerts.  Yet, there is no hint that these accounts are even mentioned in the book, which makes me doubt the research done by the author.  I will pass on purchasing it.
