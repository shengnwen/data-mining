If the book's title and the story behind the title were typed on one sheet of paper, you could post it and read it often to remind yourself that life is short, so live every day. For a few of us, that is how shallow most of our problems really are and therefore we probably do not need this book, just that one story. For many, however, their problems are real, their stress is real, and they are looking for real answers to help them live every day. Unfortunately, they will not find them in this book. Little depth and even less understanding or acknowledement of the real pain in people's lives leaves a "cutesy" book but not much help
