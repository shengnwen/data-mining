Now, I'm a card-carrying progressive, and I watch every liberal documentary and read every progressive/leftie/ecological book that comes down the pike.  But this book is blazingly boring.  I bought it because it has great blurbs on the back, and it has a promising index (any book that has Herman Daly, Juliet Schor, and Kirkpatrick Sale in its index has to be good, right?).  But the content has no soul whatsoever.  I had never read anything by Alperovitz before, so I don't know if his prior work is any better. But this one is a yawner.  I mean, I never skip through passages of liberal policy books, but I just had to scan through significant portions of this stuff.  It's just that dry and uninspiring.  I guess maybe this is for policy wonks only.  But if you're a layperson, don't bother.  Pick up "Going Local," or the new annotated version of "Small is Beautiful" instead.  You'll find it much better going
