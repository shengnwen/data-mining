I used this book as a resource on a Global Warming paper I was doing in college. While some of the information in the book is useful, most of the book is a transparent attempt by a couple of democrats to bash the oppositions leader.  The authors often abondon intellect and quality prose for childish and mean spirited cheap shots at the Bush administration. I don't agree with Bush's environmental policies either but authors of a book should be more careful about how they let their emotions play out
