I like Gabriel Roth's music, but in her book she's full of herself, constantly congratulating herself for being hanging out in &quot;hip&quot; and &quot;funky&quot; clubs in East Village.  Seeming to recognize the  empty pompousness of her story, she awkwardly and unconvenciencly envokes  &quot;God&quot; has ghostwriting events.  Writing about dance is difficult.   I recommend Constance Schrader's &quot;A Sense of Dance&quot; for a  grounded discussion, free of image
