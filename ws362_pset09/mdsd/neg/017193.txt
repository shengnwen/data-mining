I was expecting a book weighted toward doodling; idea-generation; capturing thoughts on paper.  I was disappointed to find it more oriented toward graphic artists or illustrators.  Lots of topics like composition, perspective, etc.  And the sample sketches and examples are way way more professional than I could ever hope to be.  Bottom-line, I found it more oriented toward illustrators or artists than toward thinkers who want to doodle
