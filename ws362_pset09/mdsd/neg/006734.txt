An abundance of full-color plates and numerous black-and-white photographs made this book worth the modest price.  The text is awkward. It sounds as if English is not the author's first language and certain elements of carelessness in the writing suggest that the author was more concerned with the manuscript deadline than scholarship. Picasso's own words, appearing as blocked quotes in the margins are not dated, nor sources given. The reader is not able to chronologically trace the change in philosophy reflected in his words. The text also suffers from an inordinate number of typographical errors. Walther's poorly disguised gut reaction of disgust in describing some of Picasso's work may reflect the reaction his early critics felt in viewing some of his paintings. Walther uses words such as &quot;horror,&quot; &quot;grotesque,&quot; &quot;misshapen,&quot; and &quot;ugly,&quot; at one point writing, &quot;Picasso wanted to destroy absolutely everything.&quot
