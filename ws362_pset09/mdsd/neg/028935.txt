I've been trying to research Phoenix for some time and believed this book would shed some more light on the subject, but it really offered no profound insight over and above what I've picked up through various sources.  The book does not read like a "spy novel" as it was billed.  I'm hoping at some point in the future, with declassification of various operations, that more about Phoenix will become available.  What the author described about his experiences in Vietnam are actually pretty basic offensive counterintelligence activities.  Was hoping for more, but was ultimately dissapointed by the story he told
