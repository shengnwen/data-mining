This reads more like a textbook for an interior design course.  It has little to do with the psychology of your own choice of home/setting.  Like another reviewer said, the idea seemed fascinating, but the book disappoints right away, if not for the setup alone; the author overuses the same phrases and form to setup her next example. It is as though this were her thesis for design school.  It could also pass for a really good new age book, that's how problem-centered it is.  If you have watched "Designing for the Sexes" on HGTV, you have read this book.  This book is only interesting and appropriate for interior designers, not for anyone seeking insight into our needs and choices when it comes to home
