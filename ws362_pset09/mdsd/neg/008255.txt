The whole thing was just awful, I don't mind telling you.  I don't know why anyone would buy the book for the recipes to start with when there are so many "meals in 30 minutes" internet sites...all completely nutritional with different caloric contents. Then there's the advice...it was just as bad, I found. Well, bad in the sense that it was silly.  Really quite silly.  I must admit that I must agree with the reviewer that said if you are eating an entire plate of French Fries, or Freedom Fries, depending, and you don't know that you are eating something that is going to put some pounds on, then reading this book isn't going to help you.  It does kind of sound like the positive reviews are all written by people that know the author personally.  Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon's planted news stories in Iraq if you don't mind my saying
