My mom left this book at my house.
So I thought..."Hey, free book."
If you read quickly and frequently you should go ahead and give this a try.
If you are a slow reader. . .spend your time on something with more substance.
After a fairly long drawn-out story with little humor and not much suspense I was surprised to find the final chapters to be reasonably satisfying.  
Hence the two stars.
But I assure you there is zero "kung-fu" in this one
