This book deals exclusively with the theory of relativity.  It's funny that that theory was studied and expanded by many of the brightest minds in the world, such as Richard Feynman, Paul Dirac, and Steven Weinberg, all of them Nobel prize winners, some of them experts in the history of physics, and nobody noticed anything remotely similar to "plagiarism".  It took a complete unknown like the author, without academic qualifications of any kind, to "discover" the "plot".  

Something smells very fishy here.  I strongly suspect the problem is not with the author of the theory of relativity, but with the author of this book.  

Well, I guess everybody has to eat, and some people find ways of earning their beans with more dignity than others..............
