"Elvis Presley," by Bobbie Ann Mason, is an almost too intimate look into the conjectured feelings, rather than the events, shaping the life of "The King of Rock 'n' Roll."  I was disappointed by both the writing style, which reminded me of backroom "beauty shop-like" gossip, and the content, which contained psychoanalysis of Presley. The continuous message that the society he was raised in as a child was the blame for the his adult downfall became the focus of the narrative; so much so that it made such a significant contributor to music history and cultural icon seem pathetic and uninteresting.  The book is a good study for those interested in counseling or Freudian psychology; however, for those wanting a glimpse into the exciting and flamboyant life of Elvis Presley, this book is not recommended
