I wonder if Judith Miller's knowledge of Islam included actually learning the 99 names for God, which define the essence of God for Muslims.  If she had, I also wonder why it didn't give her reason to pause and then share the true core essence of this faith.  I also lived a number of years in the Middle East, not as a professional, but as the American daughter of a father who worked there.  I went to a local school, took public transportation, went to the markets, LEARNED ARABIC... in a nutshell, learned WHO the people are and WHAT they believe. Judith Miller's book betrays ANY knowledge of this sort.  It's easy to become blocked by the smog and dirt of Cairo and donkeys in the streets (so shocking for Americans).  She sounds like a tourist in her descriptions of the people and culture - and after so many years there.  Reminds me of so many U.S. Embassy personnel I met - shrouded by the Embassy and cultural center walls and private chauffeurs.  What a shame - she just didn't get it.  If anyone wants to learn more about the Middle East, don't limit yourself to this book - you'll be doing yourself a disservice
