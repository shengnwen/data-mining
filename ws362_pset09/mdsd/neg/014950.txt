We bought this book for our recent week-long visit back home to Oahu and were tremendously disappointed. We tried three different hikes from the book, but we would have probably been better off leaving it at home. The  hike descriptions lack some essential information like the estimated time  of travel and how long and how far each section of the hike takes. Not only  that, because the book was published in 1993, much of the information was  outdated. For example, directions to the hikes had been changed because of  things such as street reconfigurations and natural trail deterioration. The  only good thing that this book offered was the name and approximate  location of the hike. Our advice: If you want to have a pleasant and SAFE  hike, buy another book
