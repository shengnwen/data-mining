As far as I am concerned, '8 Minutes in the Morning to a Flat Belly' was a total waste of my money.  I've been following this workout and eating plan for over four months now and have seen no reduction in neither my belly size nor my weight.  Frankly, I was seeing more results from my old Denise Austin Low Impact Aerobic Workout tape than this, so it looks like I'm saying goodbye to Jorge and going back to Denise.  Sorry Jorge, I gave it my best shot but your plan just doesn't work for me
