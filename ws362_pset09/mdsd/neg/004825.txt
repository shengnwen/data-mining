Where to begin? First of all, this book is a century out of date. Americans do not play baseball in great numbers anymore hence the low TV ratings for the World Series (actually lowest ever in 2006). Also, look at the "international" aspect of MLB now--Japanese, Koreans, Chinese (via Taiwan) as well as the usual Latin Americans who are now greater in number.  

A more relevant comparison would be football (as in the NFL and college) and soccer. Anyway, more Americans play soccer than, say, the nation of Britain, if we are talking sheer numbers. It's just it's a recreational sport and always will be because soccer is flat-out too slow, low scoring and has too much diving in it. 

Personally, although the writing is there, the research isn't with this book. A far superior book that understands soccer and North American sports is: Offside by Markovitz and Hellerman. Buy that off amazon here not this misguided piece of junk.
