I haven't read any of the real Robert Ludlum before, but I don't think I will be starting if this is his style.
The action scenes, with their falling chandeliers and mexican shootouts, are perhaps better suited to a 90 minute movie instead of a 400 page book. The weapons-catalogue padding is comical at first, later frustrating.
The childishly cliched language is little help in distinguishing the myriad of characters and places. We know only the color of their hair before they are mercifully laid to rest.
Perhaps most disturbing is the book's overall 1950's style racism  in which the Americans are dashing, multi-skilled warriors for good and the Russians, Ukrainians, even Germans are all ugly, inhuman or quickly dead.
Whilst the premise for the story is promising and the plot is simple but water-tight, the reader is always a step-ahead of the characters. As other reviews have said, suspense and mystery are left absent
