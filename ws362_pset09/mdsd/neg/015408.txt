I read the reviews here and on other sites before I read the book.  Seems relatively split between those who love the book and those not liking it at all.  Interestingly, with people who would seemingly be in the know giving it the lower marks.  I received a copy from a friend, and was disappointed at the foreword. (I was even more disappointed when I later learned it was not part of the original printing, but had to be added later in an effort to satisfy complaints... and then read newspaper articles questioning the credibility of this book).  Reading between the lines, this foreword basically states that the stories in the book are her version, giving her license to embellish and twist facts at will, similar to the author's quotes in the local newspapers. All in all, this foreword lends much credibility to the reviews that say this book is embellished and over-dramatic.  Admittedly, a lot of the details are a bit of a stretch to be considered believable.  So bottom line is that I found this `memoir' to not be that honest of a look or genuine tapestry of small town life, and, as the foreword states, not really telling it like it is.  In my opinion this book is a collection of stories loosely based on actual events.  Probably too loosely to be considered a memoir, and definitely too loosely to be part of the Minnesota Historical Society.  At the end of the day, I'm embarrassed my tax dollars helped fund this book
