This is my second Daniel Silva reading, having read The Marching Season first.  This book spends far too much time and energy on character development and overly-detailed visuals.  There's way too much "atmosphere."  I'm halfway through it, and it is truly trying my patience.  I've checked out A Death in Vienna and Prince of Fire from the library, and have better hopes for them.  Marching Season was more action-packed than this one..
