I don't read many comic books, but I enjoy Batman and I enjoy talented artists.  The artwork in this comic book is awesome ... great drawings, great use of color.  The storyline, however, is amateurish.  Admittedly, you must approach all fictional writing with a degree of "suspension of disbelief", however this pushes the bounds of what is tollerable.  Spoiler: c'mon ... a 10 year old boy wants his parents to die so he can be an orphan?  And then plots his revenge against Bruce Wayne for 25+ years after his Bruce's dad was able to save the mother?  DESPITE now himself being a world famous physician?  The plot brings every villan into suspicion ... seems like a weak attempt to get all of Batman's most famous enemies on the cover to sell more comics.  The writer gave us no sense of the torment of the antagonist, no real motive.  Were his parents abusive?  Why the displaced agression towards Bruce?  The writer wasted valuable storyline on dead ends rather than building real suspense and drama.  I am going to continue to read Batman graphic novels in hopes that there is something better than this out there.  I wished the writing lived up to the art work
