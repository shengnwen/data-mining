I just finished this novel and I have to say it was not as good as I thought it would be. Caleb Carr takes the Holmes novels and puts his own spin on recreating a new adventure. For Caleb his writing style is both intricate and deft, but that was all. The Mystery was neither hard to crack or exciting. This is a novel dealing with the residence of the Queen of Scots in the 1870's, Holmes and Watson are summoned to solve to murders and along the way we find out clues and interesting characters as to why the murders occurred, even thought he novel was short is seemed endless. I know many people will like the Holmes atmosphere which this novel is strong with, but I just didn't think there was enough here to satisfy my interest.
