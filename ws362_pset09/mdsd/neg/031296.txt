I actually returned this book it was so bad.  The selection criteria seemed reasonable, but they don't match the premise: supposedly a book about self-employed millionaire business women, the anecdotes are all about those who have made their money by saving while working in typical to low-paying jobs -- hardly any insight into the personalities of women who have managed to succeed in spite of cultural attitudes that steer them to lower earning careers. Clipping grocery coupons and setting goals get equal mention in this "analysis". 

Then the writing and organization is simply sloppy:  women are divided into alpha and beta types that are never defined.  One chapter was about someone named Brian -- I thought maybe this was a new androgenous nickname, but the pronoun was "he" -- so what is this doing in a book about women?

Maybe this improved -- I wouldn't know, I gave up in disgust.
