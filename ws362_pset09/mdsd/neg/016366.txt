In her section about Lakewood, the author tries to create a connection between Lakewood, the spur posse, and the military-industrial complex that does not exist.  She regards Lakewood as a breeder town, built to supply human labor for the aerospace industry.  Here are the facts:  1.  Lakewood was created in 1948 by real estate investors to provide housing for returning WW2 veterans.  2.  The LB Naval Shipyard, Douglas Aircraft, Lockheed, Northrop, and North American Aviation were all in operation long before Lakewood was built.  3.  The spur posse was given way too much publicity by the tabloid TV vultures to a National audience.  I emphasize the word National.  The market for those kind of unhealty tv shows goes beyond southern Calif.

Lakewood home values are very good, and the neighborhood infrasturcture is a lot more organized than most southern Calif housing projects built in the same era.  If she wants to bash a southern Calif. neighborhood, Long Beach would be an easier target.  There, you have many nice one-home lots that were destroyed by investors who built 8-unit apartments on a one-home lot.

Anyone who has not actually lived in Lakewood might believe her essay...but it is not reality.  In the end, she thinks So. Calif is headed over the cliff.  I would say the idyllic "Calif. Golden Fantasy" is no more...but whatever changes that occur here will have to be dealt with in a positive manner, instead of just being given an obituary
