I've read and enjoyed other Elizabeth George mysteries and I like the smart but pathetic and hopelessly unfashionable detective Barbara Havers.  However, after struggling through the interminable interior monologue of a 3-year old violin player that opens this book, I thought: why in the world am I reading an over-stuffed mystery novel that is 700 pages long?  Don't I have something better to do with my time?  Well, I do -- I'll read a biography of Jesse James who was at least a real person and a criminal of some note.      

Take this review as a protest against 700 page mystery novels.  A mystery should be brief and tight -- capable of being read and enjoyed in a day or two.
