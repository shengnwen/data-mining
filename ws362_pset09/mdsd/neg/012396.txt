Considering I actually finished this book I was generous to give it 2 stars.  I found the book to be dull and I could not connect with the main characters.  I could not relate to the characters because they did not allow you to.  The characters are somewhat thrown at you with no real background story to them.  I noticed that the authors jumped from scenario to scenario as well without a real flow.  I only finished it since I wanted to see if it ended how I predicted (and it did). If your looking for a good summer read this is not it.
