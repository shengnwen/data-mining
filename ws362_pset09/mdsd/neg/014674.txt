I perused the book. Tetlock colors everything through his prejudices - hedgehog vs. fox, an arbitrary  partitioning among his respondants! He only exhibits heavily processed data. Plots graphs with coordinate labels that even the figure captions can't explain succinctly. The graphs offer no intuitive insights. He gathered questionaires from respondants but doesn't tell us the questions - only their nature! Never shows distribution plots of number of respondants vs their predictions. An obtuse, wordy and irrelevant book.
