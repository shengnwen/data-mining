I bought Riddle Walker along with a few other books here on amazon.  Being only 200 pages, I thought I'd read this one first. 3weeks later, I am 3/4 of the way through the book and Im just about fed up!

This book is an acquired taste. It's a salty oyster waiting to be devoured by the right person. Im not that person. I struggled through the first chapters, and Im pretty much completey lost. 
To say the semi-literate language is a hurdle at first is an understatement! 

Every darn line is a riddle
And im not in the mood to play
...heck im ready to walk away

This is certainly not a night time read for relaxing. It needs every bit of your concentration. Wise man once said, the easier the read the better the read, and this is surely an example of "when reads go wrong".

aye teal ye waht... I cant wait to dig into a page that is readable! 

Too bad, I liked the thought provoking ideas behind it. Someone give me a yell when they reprint it in english.
Arggga wargga my ass!
