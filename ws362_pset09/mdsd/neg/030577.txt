The publisher of this book should be sued for false advertising.  This book is not about hacking XP, but just some very rudimentary customization of XP.  (Any lawyer willing to take up this case?)

Written by a college student who runs a popular (but disorganized and misinformed) website for tweaking XP, the book is printed in tiny fonts on some low-quality paper.  Reading through the book is no more fun than reading through the Bible for most of us.  The text is poorly written with very few screenshots.  This is a total waste of money.  The author's website is equally poorly organized but at least it's free and has all the information contained in this book.

Don't buy this book.  If you are interested in customizing Windows, get "Windows XP Hacks" from O'Reilly Books, which has both basic and power-user tips that will help you more
