This book is nothing but a compilation of decorating magazines' photos, and photos from other books.  Charles Faudree lends his photos out to everyone, including this book.  His are the best, however.  If you read the high end decorating magazines, don't bother with this book.  I recognized every photo.  What a waste of my time and money
