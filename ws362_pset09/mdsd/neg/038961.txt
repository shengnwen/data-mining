I am a very health concious person who pays close attention to what I ingest at all times.  This book is absolutely horrible and filled with critical misunderstandings.  I have never read anything so abviously trying to fit an agenda(Dr. Hulls book sales I think) in my entire life.  Any science she actually quotes is taken out of context completely.  She uses examples that quote results from experiments using more splenda in a small animal than a human will consume in a lifetime.  From the information I read after this book, Splenda has completed 20 years worth of experiments and for the most part, except in HUGE quantities, it has been determined safe to use.  Why and what she is trying to accomplish is a mystery to me, but I feel safer about eating Splenda after reading this junk. I suggest if you do read this book to at least look at other sources for your information so you get the whole picture.  I would save my $20 though...
