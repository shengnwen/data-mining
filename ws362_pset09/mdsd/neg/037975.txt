The book concentrates mainly on the chemical breakdown of various common essential oils, and does not go into any kind of depth on the use of oils.  It does not address the title:  Healing with Essential Oils.  I found it useless and returned it.  The Complete Book of Essential Oils and Aromatherapy is a much better text.  Also consult Valnet's books for better information
