I was drawn to this book by reading the back cover.  How could anything revolving the story about William Wallace and Robert the Bruce be anything but good.  I didn't even mind the battle between christian and pagan religions.  It just seemed that whenever the Templars got in trouble they pulled out their Celtic stone, said some prayers and all was well.  I was given the second book and will attempt to slog my way through it as I travel, however, I am so far not impressed 57 pages into it.  I wish that the execution of this story and plot could have been done better as the idea was fantastic.  I enjoyed some of the historical points of the book, but as written in earlier reviews they were repeated entirely too many times!  I wouldn't buy this book if your looking for a fun, romping tale of the Knights Templar.  Could have been much better
