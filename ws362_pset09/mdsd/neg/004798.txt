The faith of George Bush is in what? Money? Oil? His dad?

My Lord said Love thy enemy and do good to those who harm you
Not kill a million iraqis for oil fields

My Lord said it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven

Not give all our national treasury and indebtedness to the wealthiest corporations while impoverishing our people and leaving our elderly and infirm to drown in a rainstorm

My Lord said Blessed are the peacemakers
not those who keep changing their lies about going to war.

What is his faith again?
My Lord said: Not all those who cry Lord, Lor shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

My Lord said it. I believe it. Case closed.

What his faith all about?
Material possession does not prove election anymore than faked vote counts


SEll all that you have and give the money to the poor and then come follow me, said the Lord, and you will have riches in heaven.

Blessed are the POOR reads his Sermon on the MOunt in Saint Luke

Anyway what's that cover photo supposed to be? Mr. Jim Beam make him nauseous again? Or does he hang his head in shame for the one million dead for their oil fileds in Iraq? FOr our stolen elections? For the dead of KAtrina? For murdering our US Consitution and Bill of Rights? No, it's gas. Hoping no one notices he cut it. No, looks like he's controlling a leak into his Depends.
