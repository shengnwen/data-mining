Quite amateur, really.

The author should have also focused on women who form cliques in environments such at work etc, but sadly, this was omitted from the book.  Cliques are found within adult environments too!  Therefore, the book is not really aimed for adults, and yet, adults would be the main purchasers.

In addition, the author did not attempt to explain why girls behave in this fashion, and could have used psychological and sociological perspectives to aid her.  Instead, personal experiences were told by girls which did not really explain any real type of behaviour.

Furthermore, the proof-reader did not do a very good job in finding errors, hence the poor quality of the text.

I would not recommend this book, I am confident a buyer can find better elsewhere
