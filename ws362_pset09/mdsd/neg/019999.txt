After killing off Gwen Stacey in the last trade arc, Bendis drops the ball with three weak story lines, starting with a truly insipid "Freaky Friday" body switch between Spider-Man and Wolverine, with Mr. Bendis stroking his ego by adding his image to apologia introductions. Next, the Human Torch still needs half a semester to get his high school diploma; no No-Prizes for correctly guessing which school he picks in this mushy tale that reads more like a Marvel After School Special. The Ultimates and Dr. Stephen Strange phone in appearances in our final story, a wordy, half-baked attempt to place Strange in the Ultimate universe. "Superstars" marks a new low in the USM trade collections. Readers on a budget and those with some standards can safely give this one a pass.
