This is not a book you can use to rigourously  learn the fundamentals of image processing.  It's a good reference book for the techniques, giving formulas and some hand waving to accompany them - little is motivated, ir doesn't flow, is more a compendium of techniques used in the field accompanied by some text just to make the formulas less dry : the format formula/paragraph is repeated throughout; everything is treated at the same level hence the disjointed structure that doesn't flow.  Low on rigourous analysis; may be good as a collection of magazine articles but fails as a textbook on fundamentals - reading this book you'll know the how but it won't help you grasp the why
