I actually returned this book because it had very little , if anything, to do with WHY you actually compulsively eat. it did not go into or even explained the psychological factors that influence C.O. all this book talk about is how women's self-image is polluted with diet ads etc, etc. it does not deal at all with how to actually stop, in an effective way. 

same thing as Overcoming Overeating. the whole point of the book is to stop dieting and to stop having a dieting mentality. also it doe snot deal with the actual cause of you overeating ( which is not dieting) 

if you really want to overcome overeating and end your obsession with food, you need to know why you are physiologically addicted to food. why you find so much pleasure in it. and for that you have to read books with substantial research, not just a feminist sound-off. 

read : the pleasure trap, LIfe is hard- food is easy , to name a few good ones. 

but this one and her other one won't help you at all.
