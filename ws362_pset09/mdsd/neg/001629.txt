Arcadia dually covers a historical event turgid with substance and contemporary historians who would wish to piecemeal it back together into the whole that it was. In reading it, we find that something is lost and regained. The emotional content of the past, in its particularity, is lost, but it remains the subject of, and emerges around, the heat of the present; the gaps are filled in, old controversies become renewed, and old ideas are reborn in contemporary counterparts. In that sense, Arcadia is a masterwork. Stoppard goes so far as to craft an extraordinarily well-written drama out of platonic and romantic ideas that are so banal and intellectualy innocuous simply because they, themselves, have long since passed their due. 

I believe that Stoppard writes very well, and Arcadia is another exemplification of that fact, but I can't believe that anyone will be reading him in fifty years. His modern acclaim can only be a testament to his reaffication of already accepted modes of dramatic structure and content. He is simply the prophet of our dramatic yesterday.
