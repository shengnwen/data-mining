By setting her story in Manhattan, among the literary elite, Claire Messud might have imagined she was giving her readers an updated version of Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities," which described upper-class life in Manhattan among the Wall Street elite, so exquisitely that character descriptions from his 1987 book ("master of the universe" and "social skeleton") became part of our vocabulary.  
Claire Messud is no Tom Wolfe.
"The Emperor's Children" describes a circle of ambitious young adults who alternately worship and plot the overthrow of "The Emperor," a famous writer.  Unlike "Bonfire of the Vanities," this book has no compelling narrative - the "voice" shifts from one character to the next and the story ambles along as these young adults try to figure out what they want, who they need and who they love or hate and why.  Trust me, you won't care.  Meanwhile, the "Emperor" lopes along as a literary lion past his prime.  The characters become entangled in a mess of betrayals (the "Emperor" betrays his wife with his daughter's best friend, the daughter betrays her father by marrying the man who would dethrone the "Emperor" etc. etc.) -- and all the mess just goes away after the attacks on September 11, 2001.  But we never learn how September 11 affected Messud's characters - she uses that fateful day as an excuse to bring the curtain down on this stupid story going nowhere.
