would you buy a used contra from this man?

Newt, genocidal maniac against brave little Nicaragua in the Eighties, driven from DC in disgrace, now wants to be our President and so comes up with this self-serving and shamelessly hypocritical piece of electioneering and political campaigning.

Newsflash: GOd does NOT approve of Newt.

Newt takes us like a pervert uncle pointing out the word God on monuments around the NAtional Mall. But Newt's policies and practices have denied and ignored the meaning of these very words there inscribed.

GOd said Thou Shalt Not Kill. Newt's dirty little wars from the eighties onwards have killed uncounted thousands of innocent people worlwide.

Newt is a shameless liar now to claim the mighty name of God, and has much to answer for.

For a more true theologian and truly prayerful Christian reading, please consult with the Reverend John Dear, SJ, in particular his Disarming the Heart, and the God of Peace.

Leave Newt for the gullible and eagerly deceived. Newt is an apocalyptic false prophet spitting toads. Nothing more. Trying to get back into national office the most shameless way.
