The author gives false information to back up his case. In propounding the idea of metis as a Greek virtue equating to some kind of mystical cunning, he wrongly states that this is the name by which Odysseus identifies himself to the cyclops in book nine of the Odyssey, making it a pun on 'no man'. The name Odysseus actually uses is 'outis', which means that Kingsley's identification of a pun is a fiction, and that this supposed Greek virtue has nothing like the kind of biblical sanction for the Greeks that a place in the Odyssey would have granted it. In other places in the book, wherever the textual evidence directly contradicts his thesis, he baldly claims that this is the result of subsequent tamperings by ancient scholars who wanted it to better fit their interpretation (a little rich).
Kingsley's first book on Empedocles and the Pythagoreans was inspired, but 'Reality' is too much filled with spurious conjecture disguised as hard fact to be of lasting worth. 'New Age' was a concept foreign to the Greeks, not the lost essence of their culture
