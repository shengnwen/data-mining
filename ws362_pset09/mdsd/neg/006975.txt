I enjoy reading TV and movie critics to see how a good movie works or a bad show doesn't. In this collection of opinions, Mr. Tucker has no information on why a show does or doesn't succeed. Also, few things are black and white. He either hates or loves a program, period. If he hates it, the show has no merit. If he loves it, it can do no wrong. It appears this book was thrown together overnight after he looked at the TV Guide for titles of shows and just gave his hate/love of it. Worthless unless you think Mr. Tucker's opinion is the best. Also, it is painfully unfunny
