There is no doubting the credentials of the author of this work; a bona fide mystical saint but the way this book is written in a very difficult to understand translation into English (on purpose!)suggests to me that this is more for the scholar or academician than for the lay believer.  

There are footnotes that are longer than the main texts on many pages!  This makes for difficult reading and in sticking religiously (sorry)to authenticity, reading for the average Joe is excruciatingly painful.  Perhaps this is part of the purgation one has to tolerate to achieve purity or at least gives us some idea of how difficult it is to be so pure.  

Thank goodness for Jesus who shows now why He had to come and save us and to bring us to the Father because the average Joe who I'm sure God wants saved as well would struggle to understand the text as written here.  Don't despair, maybe someone like a Scott Hahn with his brilliant gift of simplifying the vastly difficult scholarly texts will one day try his hand at interpreting this for us.  

Reading through this, one can't help but feel brow beaten by someone eager to show how much more scholarly he is to us.  I'm sure that was not St. John's intention so let's hope his message is eventually simplified for mass digestion instead of the indigestion this version promotes.
