Even accepting that this book is targeted at very young readers, ABUELITA'S SECRET MATZAHS is sketchy in the way its story is told. 

In fact, it is so sketchy that it virtually is worthless in conveying the history of those Jews who had hidden from Spain's Inquisition by concealing their religion.

There's a story here, an important story, but this author does not tell it.
