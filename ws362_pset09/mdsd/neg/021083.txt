This book is available from just about every book club out there, so I thought there must be something to it, but no.  It's interesting to read, and you gain an appreciation for warfare of that era, but there's nothing you can take from it an apply your life (beyond some common sense you should already have).  This version is nice in that it gives you historical information too.  If you're just curious about SunTzu's words - that section actually isn't very big at all, and you could probably get through it quickly in a bookstore/library
