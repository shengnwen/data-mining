This book was helpful as far as hotel info, and attraction info goes, However, there were more than a couple of errors that made it a little frustrating. We ordered this book because we wanted a good idea of what rides would be appropriate for our children's ages and heights, etc. There were a few rides that had one height requirement on one page, and then a different height requirement on another. This book was helpful in some aspects of planning our trip, but the discrepencies with ride information was not a help. I now wish I had ordered something else
