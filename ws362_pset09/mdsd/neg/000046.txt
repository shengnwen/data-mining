This book surprised me very much.. when i read a book I expect to learn something or at least be entertained... I kept looking for the purpose and/or message of this book...I found it meaningless/pointless and not even based on truth.  I guess the authors were trying to be clever.... it did not strike me as clever. 
I am sorry to say I found no value... not for kids, not for adults... not for anyone.
