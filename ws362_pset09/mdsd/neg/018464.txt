This book is entertaining and filled with a lot of useful recipes if you don't particularly care about what the final product tastes like--that is, if you aren't interested in trying to make a reasonably serious wine. If making something possibly drinkable out of a variety of fruits and vegetables interests you, this will be useful. If you want to make what most people think of as "wine" (i.e., fermented grape juice) the book is not of much interest.
