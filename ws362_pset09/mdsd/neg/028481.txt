This book was the required textbook for my organic I and II class...and it didn't help with either. If you didn't understands something the way the professor explained it, the book provided no help. The explainations in it were very short and were of no help at all. Most of the time the examples were too simple to really teach you anything. This is a very elementary textbook, that doesn't seem worthy to me of a place in any college or university
