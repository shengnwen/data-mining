Other reviewers baffle me.  

The metaphors are syrupy, the advice either obvious or suspect, and everything a dash too cute.  Anecdotes bore, ramble, though some of the quotes are interesting.  What use the technical advice may have had is probably gone with time, and what remains handy is rather obvious.  

Some of the discussion on particular pieces may be useful for those actually playing them at present; I'm not, but even if I were, I'm not sure I could stomach the prose again.  I love the piano, too, truly, and it's always nice to share thoughts with someone with similar feelings, but Cooke's fondness for the instrument verges on the pedophilic
