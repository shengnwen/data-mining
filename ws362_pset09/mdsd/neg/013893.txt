This is the first in the Shopaholic series. Rebecca Bloomwood has a very serious problem. She can't stop shopping. She has crazy money issues, and literally just hides her bills in a drawer and goes and shops more to make herself feel better. This novel takes place in Britain, where Bex (her nickname) spends all of her money earned as a financial journalist on the latest designer clothes. PS she knows nothing about finance, which adds humor as she bumbles her way through the work day in order to attend another press meeting that serves free champagne. The irony of her job and compulsion are cute, and Bex really means well, but honestly, can't you just cut up the credit card? How hard is it to not buy more sweaters? I'd only recommend this book if you're a big shopper, because that's the fun part. Otherwise, it's hard to like Rebecca because she comes across as irresponsible, endlessly without any willpower, and materialistic as they come. That said, I still must confess that I also read Shopaholic Ties the Knot and Shopaholic & Sister
