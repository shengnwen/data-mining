The guy has a few good ideas but, reader, beware; this is the transciption  of several different lectures over several years.  I use the term  &quot;different&quot; loosely because each appears to be a regurgitation of  the others.  The book desperately needs an editor, preferably one who isn't  getting paid by the page
