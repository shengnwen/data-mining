If you look at the first except page, T.S. Eliot's last name is misspelled.  Hollywood supposedly demands that every spec script be free of misspelled words and bad grammar, yet I've seen shooting scripts with "He could care less" instead of "He couldn't care less" (not dialogue, mind you) and frequent misspellings.  Much like the literary agent industry, professionalism is demanded (agent name, book proposal, nice paper, SASE), but often not reciprocated (e.g., they'll send you a photocopied form letter [Dear Author . . .]).  

What we need to see are published versions of original speculation scripts.  Shane Black's first release of "Lethal Weapon" would be more beneficial a read than these shooting scripts.  

Sorry, got off on a rant.  It's not that these shooting scripts aren't worth reading for new screenwriters, but there's a market out there for actual spec script versions.  If your spec has as many SUPERs in it as this shooting script, Hollywood might throw your stuff in the bin . . . unless you're established, of course
