I wonder if Pat mentions his diamond mine in Zaire in his book? The African Development Co., based in Zaire, was established by Robertson during the rule of the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Mobutu was a sadistic, murderous, dictator who kept his country's people in poverty while he becomming one the richest men in the world. In April, 1997 two pilots who worked for Operation Blessing, Robertson's African relief organization, charged that planes linked to Robertson and his ministry flew mostly to haul equipment for ADC's private diamond operation. Robert Hinkle, the chief pilot told reporter Bill Sizemore that of about 40 flights within Zaire during the half-year period he was there, "Only one or at most two" were related to the humanitarian mission of Operation Blessing. The rest were "mining-related." So much for humanitarian aid given by Robertson's followers to relieve African hunger. 

Man of God? More like man of money. Robertson is merely another snake-oil selling scumb@g bilking his "flock" for personal enrichment. Mobutu Sese Seco is not the only brutal dicator Robby is/was pals with. Others include Jorge Serrano, former dictator of Guatemala, and Frederick Chiluba, the ruler of Zambia who brutally enforced christianity as Zambia's state religion despite sizable minorities of other religious beliefs. And let's not forget Robertson's gold mine in Liberia and his friendship with now owsted president Charles Taylor, a warlord blamed for torture, killings, forced labor, and extortion. Taylor is a partial bankroller of al-Qaeda and was indicted by a U.N. war crimes tribunal for arming Sierra Leoneon rebels who specialize in mass rape and in hacking off the limbs of civilians including many children below the age of 12. He's one of Pat's special friends who he supports to this day. I'm not going to go so far as to say Pat is the antichrist, but he sure meets a lot of the criteria
