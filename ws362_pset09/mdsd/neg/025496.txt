I was going to be open minded when reading this book. After reading the "student" part, knew that somethings were not right in this book. Any Christian book I have ever read quotes scriptures from the Holy Bible, this one did not. There was just enough truth to keep a Christian still reading. The bible says in the end times there will be false doctorine. This is a very good example. When I got to the back of the book, the teacher section, then the truth of the book came out. Anytime subjects like, "psychic," "magic," and "reincarnation," are talked about and viewed in a positive light,as was the case in the back of this book, then be very careful. If you know the Holy Bible, God's word, then you know that this is of the enemy, Satan. I am not a "holy roller" a "fanatic" I am a Christian that has a personal relationship with Jesus. Ask God what he thinks of this book and its content. How deceptive this book is, just like the enemy. It has just enough truth and then in the very back after you have read all of the things in it, the bomb is dropped and the real stuff comes through loud and clear, or not so clear to those who do not read and know The Bible themselves. Always read God's word, the Holy Bible for yourself. You need to know the truth so you will not be deceived by books and things such as these that are in this book.
I really hope people read this and find the truth out for themselves.
