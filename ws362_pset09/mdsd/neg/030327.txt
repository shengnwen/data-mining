I went out of my way to find this book.  Boy, am I ever sorry.  Can I give this book zero stars?  This book contains all of the illumination of a 10 watt bulb.  Schneider's main environmental concern in this little text is global cooling!  Yikes!  Now he's an authority on global warming; so much for credibility.  Either Schnieder's an environmental schizophrenic or someone that lives at the public money trough.  The former hypothesis is the more paletable of the two possibilities.  This book is nothing more than the "nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind."  Don't waste your time.  The most positive environmental thing you can do is save a tree by using this book's pages as toilet paper
