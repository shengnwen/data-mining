I just finished reading The Book Of Lost Books and must admit that I am disappointed. A great premise is bungled by unfocused writing and the author's tendency to go off on long tangents that have nothing to do with the lost books he's supposed to be writing about. This book is very boring in places. I was also disappointed that the works by Vladimir Nabokov, Malcolm Lowry, and Robert Louis Stevenson mentioned on the book's dust jacket are never actually discussed in the book itself. Sure, The Book Of Lost Books is subtitled "An Incomplete History Of All The Great Books You'll Never Read", but Stuart Kelly could have atleast included the books mentioned in the flap copy. 

There are some interesting anecdotes in The Book Of Lost Books. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Menander and Charles Dickens. Stuart Kelly has a biting sense of humor and is downright funny in places. Unfortunately, most of the book is unfocused and it makes for a very tedious read.
