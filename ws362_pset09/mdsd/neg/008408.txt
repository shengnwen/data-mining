DBF once again uses the plot device of returning home to reclaim yourself and your life.  That part of the story was good, but other parts of it suffered.  She wrote strange dialog for her teen daugter (no high school girl talks like that) and the "romance" was rushed and pulled out at the finish line in a very few pages.  I was never convinced it was Linda that Brad loved or just the idea of being in a loving family.  DBF's a great writer and I look forward to other works from her, but this one just didn't measure up.
