The story itself is fairly benign, but when you have to start explaining the what, why, and wherefore of spin-the-bottle to your 4-year-old, things get a little sticky. Why would the author and publisher want to insert such content--which would resonate more with the 12-14 year-old crowd--into a book for 4-8 year olds?
