This guide is OK if you're rich and want to only hit the big touristy areas.  If you don't like sitting on a tour bus and don't mind sleeping at a hostel and want to see the little towns then avoid this one and get the Lonely Planet guide instead.  I just got back from New Zealand and basically didn't use this book at all.  Not a great investment.  Couldn't find most of the small towns in this book at all.
