I'm from Calabria and also found myself upset at the lack of any books regarding my region, so I decided to read this one considering it was the only one of its kind. After reading I was thoroughly disgusted and plan on emailing Mark Rotella personally letting him know, that maybe the reason he couldnt quite figure some things out is because he traveled with a guy he just met and the fact that he's not even full Italian certainly dosent help matters. Not to mention, he claims to be connecting with his roots but is clearly 100% Americanised and coming from parents who quite honestly seemed to shun thier past for the luxuries of the states. Some of the sentences were accurate, however most were not and after actively reading this book and have more than a few things to tell this author, and i think i speak for the entire Calabrese population when I say, if you're not from here don't try to write a book about here, especially one riddled with generalizations and ignorant statements. 

P.S. The whole fica vs. fico thing was completely unnnecessary as well as crude, and that goes for comparing the name of Calabria to a prostitute, if thats the magnitude of your descriptive writing I suggest you find another job
