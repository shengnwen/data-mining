What a waste of ink!!! I wish there was a way to give this book a review of a negative 5 stars. This author is terrible. The words are mispelled there are sentence fragments riddled throughout all the paragraphs. Most of the time I had to re-read the sentence because I thought it was me. The author left me hanging many times throughout the book. I was like "What the F$%^? Who wrote this garbage?" He must have graduated with his Associates Degree from Essex County College in Newark, NJ. It probably wouldn't have been a bad read if it was written properly. I am surprised no one wacked him for writing so terribly. Geeeze
