This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????

Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.  

Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.  

The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.
