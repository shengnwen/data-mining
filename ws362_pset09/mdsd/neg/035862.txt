Even though Don Peppers and Martha Rodgers have seized and even created opportunities to promote CRM and 1 to 1 marketing, this book provides no true thought leadership.  The only redeemable aspect of the writing are  some real world high level examples of proactive customer relationship  building.  Not anything extraordinary, but enough from some large company  top execs. to get an understanding that a customer-focused business can  only be successful if the culture is nutured from the top down.  The book  does one thing very well; it promotes future Peppers and Rodgers writings  that hopefully have more pratical application.  The fact that the authors  ask the readers to send their thoughts and ideas on specific topics to  unique addresses, of the 1to1 Peppers and Rodgers web site, definitely  follows the CRM philosophy.  Not to mention, gives them a bank of  real-world experience to draw from for their next project. I recommend  looking elsewhere for any &quot;real meat&quot; relevant to CRM strategy  lessons
