I purchased this book because the subject matter sounded interesting. It was poorly written, badly researched, and very disappointing. I am not sure what book the other reviewers read but 1 star seemed excessive. A well written, adequately researched book on the subject would be fascinating. Don't waste your hard earned money on this puerile fluff
