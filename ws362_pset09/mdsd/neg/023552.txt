WARNING!  My Oxford World's Classics paperback copy had pages of Thoreau's "Walden"  inserted after p.158 of the story "The Room in the Dragon Volant."  Missing are approx. 50 pages of the LeFanu story, so it's not like it's a bonus.  I'm letting Amazon know about it, but check your copy on receipt!! Very disappointing to not know what happens, kind of like watching a thriller on TV and then the power goes out, but the broadcast stays on so you miss the middle.

I do rate LeFanu's stories 4-5 stars though.  Really well-written page turners
