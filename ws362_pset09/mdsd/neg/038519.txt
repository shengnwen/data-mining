After reading this book, I'm convinced that philosophy and baseball don't mix. Reading each chapter, I felt that there could've have been more in depth discussion about philosophy and baseball. Some chapters were unbearable - (e.g. why steriods should be legal.)  Not only because the result is antithetical to my own thinking but the way it was argued.
