I stumbled across this entry while searching for pig-related paraphernalia for my wife (she adores pigs), and I was amazed to see that the book is still on the market.  I read this "deliverance" manual when I was a new Christian back in '87.  

The authors blame nearly every kind of persistent sin on demonic activity, going so far as to claim that they hadn't met a Christian yet who didn't need to be freed of demonic influence.  (Possession/ oppression... whatever you want to call it).

Frankly, this book terrified me as an impressionable young convert.  I was convinced that my own fleshly appetites must be the result of demons inside of me.  Then a remarkable thing happened: I began to open the Bible and read for myself what God has to say about the sin nature.  

In particular, I stumbled across Romans 8:13-14 (ESV): "For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, "Abba! Father!"

The Holy Spirit, the divine Agent who makes us children of God, does not share the temple of our bodies with demons.  Moreover, as the above passage makes clear, the believer is commanded to "put to death the deeds of the body," an idea hardly consistent with demons making Christians act in unseemly ways.  In Christ we have been given the spiritual resources we need for sanctification.

I would suggest steering far away from this kind of literature that gives our defeated enemy way too much credit for what can be explained by human depravity.  This book doesn't provide deliverance from anything, for the book itself IS bondage
