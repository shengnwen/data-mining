This is quite the typical Computer Science textbook, vastly overpriced and lacking any real information. Veteran CS students will be happy to find that even the most simple concepts have been reduced to pure math, this to make sure that creative students who have no passion for math do not have an unfair advantage.

If you can only read math (or prefer that everything in life is described purely in equation form), this is the best book on the market!
