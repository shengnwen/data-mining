The learning revolution presents a lot of soundbites about super learning, effective teaching, and world-class schools.  However, there isn't much to hang on to here as methods and techniques aren't fully elaborated.

Lots of spurious claims about  the role of music are also included despite the fact that most of the early  research in this area is proving weak.  The book also seems to equate  learning with knowledge acquisition.  Seldom are issues of understanding  and transfer addressed
