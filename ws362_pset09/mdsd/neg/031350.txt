If you have a previous edition of this book, save your money.  I read a handful of school descriptions and they were-- verbatim-- the same as in the last edition.

If you want to get a survey of private schools in NYC, you probably will need this book.  However, I take issue with the idea that this book is an "independent" view of the school.  Clearly the authors have relied, to some degree, on the school's own literature-- you can tell if you compare the writeups to brochures.  Also, they use a lot of parent interviews, and the parents themselves clearly are biased to a point that their input is not at all useful on some topics.  For example, all the parents describe themselves as "an easy going community" and "friendly."  Why include this information when it is clearly impossible to do it well?

Another category of information is clearly problematic here.  The parents reading this book care a lot about "exmissions."  They want to know which colleges the graduates were admitted.  The authors often offer up what seems a short list of college acceptances they were able to cull.  So one school might say "Yale, Harvard, UVA" and another might say "Oberlin, Princeton, Bard."  Clearly this information is anecdotal at best, I just hope the readers realize this.  Many parents want hard data about exmissions and they will not find it here.

The best information given is the most concrete-- application procedures, physical location descriptions, etc.  This is, of course, the same information you can retrieve for free from the schools themselves, but there is an argument to be made for the convenience of having it all in one place
