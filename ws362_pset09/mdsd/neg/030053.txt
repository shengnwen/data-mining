Sounds like a great mix, based on a novel by Philip Roth. Mixed race ex-boxer prof (Hopkins) marries out into white community. Pretends he is Jewish. In later life meets screwed up younger white woman (Kidman) with whom he vainly tries to expunge his past. It takes more than eggs to make an omelette, however, and Robert Benton's dreary direction ruins any prospect of a good film. Worst part, Nathan Zuckerman - what on earth was the point of this character - (Gary Sinise). The scene in which Hopkins and Sinise try to dance the slow foxtrot together is one of the daftest and most pointless I have seen in any movie. Best character Ed Harris (Lester Farley) though badly underwritten - why had his relationship with Kidman broken down ? Because he was nuts or she had driven him nuts. She would have me
