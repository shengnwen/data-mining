This (text)book is difficult to understand -not just because of many typos and grammatical errors. The content summarises the concepts introduced in Goldratts novels. Half the book looks like a reprint of The Goal -and yet Goldratt recommends on more than one occasions to re-read the novel.... I enjoyed the novels, but this book looks more like a marketing gag for Goldratts seminars or the journal he writes, publishes and sells
