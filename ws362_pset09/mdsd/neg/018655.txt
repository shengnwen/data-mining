I was sadly disappointed to find I did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here.  The characters were flat and the author gave me no reason to care about any of them.  Everything was very 2 dimensional for me.  I bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here, then a copy for myself so I could get in on the fun.  I forced myself through half the book before I just tossed it and promised my father a replacement - something I'd read already and knew he would enjoy.  But that's just my opinion - obviously not shared by many
