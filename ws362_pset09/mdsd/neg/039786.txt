You could hardly find a greater betrayal of the Situationist movement in all of its aspects, than this book, which translates a chaotic, exciting and iconoclastic movement into a boring and platitudinous addition to the obligatory academic discourse about everything.

Throw this thing in the trash, don't even resell it, certainly don't donate it to any charities or libraries.  Go right now instead and find "The Situationist International: A User's Guide" by Simon Ford, you won't regret it.  I swear to God I am not lying and I have no institutional or other affiliation that would conflict with this judgment
