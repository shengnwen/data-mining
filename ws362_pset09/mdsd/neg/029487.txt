Mr. Miller of Canada has said it well and thoroughly.  Apparently, according to Granger, he never met a beautiful woman that he did not fall in love.  On the other hand, the three men in his life appear to have been accidents, from the naval officer in Hawaii who seduced him after Granger noted he had already had sex twice with a prostitute.  he encountered Arthur Laurents and only ended up living with him for the lack of other accommodations.  And the man we assume he has been with for how many years (?) was like an afterthought and if the reader is not careful you might miss him entirely although he is listed as a co-author.  At least Granger was a star in his own eyes.
