Lee Child is one of the best action-suspense novelists out there.  He is a writer of immense talent.  He normally writes in a very terse, no-nonsense style that really motivates the reader to turn the pages.  His hero Jack Reacher has become an inconic character, kind of an American James Bond.

DIE TRYING, however, is one of Child's lesser efforts.  The plot of this book is, quite simply, ludicrous.  All of Child's stories are admittedly implausable, but this one really strains credibility.  Much of what happens in this novel is statistically impossible, and I found myself rolling my eyes at much of it.  I've seen dumb action movies with better constructed plots than DIE TRYING.

Characterization is also quite weak here.  There are too many characters and Child keeps on shifting the reader's perspective from one secondary character to another.  All the villains in DIE TRYING are silly right-wing militia types.  Many of them are too buffoonish to be truly threatening.  Many of the action scenes lack emotional punch because you don't really care about any of the players.  

Child also has an unfortunate tendency to describe every scene in minute detail, so that a straightforward action scene is drawn out to an interminable length.  In this book, this writing style really bogs down the narrative and made it difficult for me to finish this novel.  I skimmed this novel toward the end, which is too bad, because Child is a very smart writer overall.

My advice is to skip this poorly structured effort and devote your time to Child's better books like KILLING FLOOR and ECHO BURNING.
