I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!!
