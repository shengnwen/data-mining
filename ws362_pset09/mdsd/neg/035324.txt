I work for a book summary company.  One of the books selected for summary is this book.

When you have the world famous author who made the startling expose on the Watergate scandal and Assistant Managing Editor of Washington Post, write about the eventful hours following the 9/11 attack at the World Trade Center, your expectations are naturally very high.  But Woodward lets you down, as this book leans heavily on transcripts of National Security Council meetings and extended interviews including over 4 hours of interview with George Bush, to reveal the layers of decision making process that followed the cataclysmic incident.  By providing the details of the close-door meetings amongst the key central players, we do get to size up partially on the personality of those involved.  We are privy to the arguments and ideological differences amongst the principal leaders as President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, CIA Director George Tenet, and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, forcefully put their weight and power behind their viewpoints and decisions.  We are treated to how the CIA successfully waged an intelligence war against Afghanistan leading to the fall of the Taliban.  Beyond that we get precious little in terms of clear opinion on the dynamics of the decision making or the wisdom behind it.  A mere reportage of the collection of meetings and interviews are best served in a newspaper, and thus could ideally have found its way into Washington Post.  In the publication of a book, we expect a renowned media investigator as Woodward to undertake a more serious study such as on policy matters or the depth of leadership involved or an incisive analysis of personalities and so forth.  This is a rather tame book and hardly adds anything of great value, and much less so to the trailblazing work that Woodward is capable of.
