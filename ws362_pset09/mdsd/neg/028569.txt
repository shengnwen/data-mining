I was more than disappointed in this book. I bought it because it said "Edgar Cayce" on Soulmates, but in reality it is Kevin J. Todeschi on Soulmates. 
I love to read Edgar Cayce's readings because of the truths it contains, the wisdom, so much said in so little words... his readings don't confuse me (like many psyhoclogy books do) but help me define what it is I already know... but very few readings were in the book - it was mostly Kevin J. Todeschi.
