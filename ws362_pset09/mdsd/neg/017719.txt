I was under the impression that this book would help me get unstuck from my current career. This book is primarily for teams, and even that  it is very weak in creating a formula to help solving complex problems. The suggestions that it does give are so basic and simple that the author was either wanting just to sell a book of random "nice" thoughts, or has not been in the private sector to realize the complexities of doing business. The last comment in the book is what pushed me over the edge, it recommended buying a copy of this for everyone that I know in the business world to help them. The only money I would waste is buying a copy for the authors, they obviously haven't listened to their own advice
