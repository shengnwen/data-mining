I just tried to read this book but I had to put it down. Unfortunately, the author, Joshua M. Greene is not a particularly good writer. The stilted prose reads like it was written for 11-year-olds.

I wanted to learn more about George Harrison and his spirituality - honestly, I did. George Harrison was a huge influence on me when I was young, and he helped steer me onto a spirtual path.

But I started reading this book and it opened with the same Beatles biographical information that I've already read 100 times. Paul met John and George met Paul and John thought George was a pain and he was young and he had big ears and John's mother was killed and he was raised by his Aunt Mimi and the music from America came to Liverpool before the rest of England...WHO NEEDS TO READ THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN???

Not me. I don't have the time. I returned the book to the library
