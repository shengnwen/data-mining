Out of Place : A Memoir is one long whining session.  All Said does is whine and bellyache.  

But then again, all the Palestinians do is complain and whine.  When given their own territory, all the Palestinians do is complain and whine

It is the Palestinians that gave the world suicide bombers, and they have the gall to complain.  Said defends those very bombers.  The ones who kill Americans.

This book is a lot of fiction.  

I spoke with Eddy Said once.  He admitted the Palestinians were wrong and the Israeli's right.  But he said that any Arab who publicly admits that is a dead man.

Said had a lot of freedom in Israel.  If only the Arab states would have given them that same level of freedom.
