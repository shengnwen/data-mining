It's been a while since I read this, but my most vivid memory of the story is the weak ending.  Dekker makes his villain seem like the ultimate evil this side of Satan, but then dispatches him with a yawn.

I did think that the scenes in the concentration camp were tense and riveting, but the 70's part of the story struck me as odd.  The protagonist's attempts to retrieve the objects of his obsession were so nutty that they played like black comedy.  Dressing up like a woman to sneak into a building?  What is this, "Mrs. Doubtfire"?

As with much recent "Christian" fiction, there's not much here in the way of insight or edification.  "Love conquers all" is just about the only spiritual message here.  Bottom line, "Obsessed" isn't horrible, but there are better books out there
