I wonder if they'll have the guts to print this...

I ordered this book April 30th, and it is now almost June.  They keep pushing back the estimated delivery date - which is now June 18th, SIX WEEKS after I purchased the book.  And I purchased it from Amazon - not one of their vendors.  I wouldn't be so upset if they simply sent me an explanation for the delay.  

Ever wonder why there is no way of contacting Amazon.com?  There's no phone number, no address, and no email.  It's because they don't want to hear from you.  Once they get your money, you're on your own.

Edit:
Ok, so I thought I had found a back door way to send Amazon an email.  Under review guidelines (under FINE PRINT when you are writing a review) there is a button for "contact us."  This must be an attempt to keep people from writing reviews full of Amazon hate.  But after writing a lengthy yet respectful email to Amazon, it simply bounced back "sorry there was a problem with your order - please try again later."  Oh well, I should have known it was too good to be true.  I'm sure they'll be in a big hurry to get that one fixed.

If the BOOK ever shows up, maybe I'll get a chance to review IT.  Or maybe I should just go support my local bookstore instead of another Home Depot/McDonalds/Starbucks/Wal-Mart
