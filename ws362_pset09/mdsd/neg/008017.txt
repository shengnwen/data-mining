The only reason I finished this book was it was a book club pick - I read a lot and it takes a really bad book for me to quit. This book is just never ending - no plot and a useless read. I can't believe so many people are giving it a good review. The constant narrative sounded like a neat way to write but it turned out very exhausting to read. Don't bother
