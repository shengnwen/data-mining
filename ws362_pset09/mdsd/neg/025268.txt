I saw a bit of an interview with the author on Book TV and got this. I really WANTED to like this book. The (stated) premise of the book is strong, and bringing Epaminondas's exploits to a wide audience seemed pretty interesting to me.

My problem was that right from the get-go it seemed to me the author had a pretty weird tendency to draw political parallels between ancient Greece and today which just aren't appropriate or realistic. They weren't key to what he was trying to say, either, so I probably could have soldiered through the book. I put it down, though, since it was distracting trying to figure out where he was really coming from. 

I admit that his dismissiveness toward Alexander and Grant seemed borderline childish to me, the way it was written. Perhaps that also made it hard for me to take the good parts of the book seriously
