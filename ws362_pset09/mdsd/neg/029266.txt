If you haven't read Adele Davis's groundbreaking work Let's Eat Right To Keep Fit, have not come across other low glycemic, whole food diets and aren't familiar with Dr. Christian Northrup's work, I suppose this book is helpful. Otherwise, I'd put my money elsewhere.

The book is written well enough and it does have alot of information. The problem is that the information has been around a long time.  Most of us are now quite familiar with the benefits of low glycemic impact, whole foods, "good" fat, etc. I don't see the value of yet another book on the subject.

One of my main problems with the work, however, is the large number of supplements (which Dr. Perricone sells, of course) that one is supposed to take in order to reap the full benefits of his "promises." While each may offer some benefit, just the logistics of taking all of them in the proper combination (some need to be taken with food, some not) at the proper time (some can't be taken after a certain time because they interfere with sleep) would daunt even the most determined. 

Not to mention the expense! They can be purchased at discount stores but they're still extremely expensive. 

But perhaps I'm prejudiced. I prefer books that offer information without the contamination of vested interest. This one comes across as much less informational than infomercial, heavy on the "mercial", light on the "info."

A much better choice in my opinion would be Peter D'Adamo's Eat Right 4 Your Type. Published in 1996 it's as valid today as it was 10 years ago. It's an interesting read and a good all-around book on individualized nutrition.
