I was on my way out of town and pick this book up on a whim as I breezed through a book store...I love western romance, but I had a hard time finishing this one!
I did'nt realize it was a reissue, and after checking other reveiws after I returned home..I can see now why this rancher was such a demanding man (I am glad times have changed!).
Anyway...this paperback was a waste of paper...I didn't care for the way Jason treated Kate and I felt it was borderline abusive and Kate just put up with it! Half of the book was spent describing what everyone was wearing, do you really need to know what someone has on everytime they enter the room? or when they light a cigarette?  The romance was hard to find in this novel..at least the heart pounding kind I was looking for! I will be more careful when I grab a Diana Palmer book in the future..
