This book is very disappointing and not up to the usual scholarly standards one associates with Cambridge University Press. The argument is a simplistic polemic (West bad, East good) that does not progress beyond the secondary sources that the author relies on. It cannot be compared to serious works of world history by Mcneill, Wallerstein, etc
