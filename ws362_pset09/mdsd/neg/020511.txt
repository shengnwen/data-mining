This book is so old it should not be sold anymore.  The so called &quot;updates&quot; are simply token and the whole book is too old to be of help. Also, the people are so spartan they really don,t relate to the modern cruiser..ie.. they spend time on the merits of kerosene lights.  When they finally retire to land I sure they will end up in a trailer park
