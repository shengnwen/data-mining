All I can say is that if and when this novel is made into a movie, expect a lot of changes. A screenwriter will certainly not go with such a slow, dragging pace. Also, there will need to be many more actual confrontations with Dracula, not just infinitesimal accretions of knowledge boringly gained through research about the vampire. There will need to be more horryfing scenes and far less looking through dry manuscripts. And that pretty much sums up my objections to the book
