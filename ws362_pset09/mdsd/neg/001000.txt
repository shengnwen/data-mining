The author of this book describes it as &quot;Lots of fun&quot; but forgot to continue the phrase and include &quot;for the demented&quot; because personally for me this book was no fun at all. I mean compared to some of her other books this book is really bad. I liked Catherine Coulter and i like most of her books but this one...well i regret having wasted money on this one. so boring i didnt even finish it! The main trouble with this book is the dialogue..long and silly. the characters are realy not likeable at all -jack and Grey. Grey's reaction to JAck's stealing his horse was way too exagerated and hard to believe. I would have liked to finish this book but, frankly after threee attempts i gave up because its so boring and childish. Yes childish and if you read if for yourself you will surely agreee. The author clearly tries to be humourous...but, in my opinion does not succeed in doing so. A book is not made humourous just by putting stupid dialogue and a silly storyline. I made a mistake because i chose to ignore the other reviews which were posted here and bought it anyway :
