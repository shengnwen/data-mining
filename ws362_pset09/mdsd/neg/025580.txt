I agree with those that say this book would be more useful if it came with solutions.  Right off in the first chapter, hypothetical situations are presented without any background information in the text.  If you haven't had some experience in Accounting, you are going to be left scratching your head.  The instructor in my class says that it causes you to think.  Hard to think if you have never come close to experiencing anything that is being discussed.  Some guidance would be helpful
