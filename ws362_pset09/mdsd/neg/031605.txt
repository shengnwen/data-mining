Purists will argue that once an author has died then his output has finished. Others will argue that there's no compelling reason not play in someone else's imaginary universe if there are good new stories to be told. Certainly there's a thriving market for new Sherlock Holmes stories. I myself don't mind a continuation novel or pastiche if it's well written and captures the flavour of the original.

This book fails on both counts for me. Ultimately this is just a mystery with robots in it. Without Asimov's name to spruik it I doubt most of us would bother picking it up. Tiedemann is not a bad author but this is dry, technical stuff for the most part. His characters aren't badly drawn and there's some mildly interesting discussion of new aspects of the Three Laws but there's long, dense passages of technobabble that simply beg to be skimmed.

Some will like the dense, convoluted conspiracy, I found it tedious. 

Bottom line is I'm not inspired to read the other two books in the series, which about sums up my indifference to this one
