I'm no prude, but some of the actions described in this book go beyond crude to disgusting and repulsive.  Who needs to waste time reading about such behavior?  Don't we see enough of the depths of human depravity on the news? I would have expected a huge protest from families of middle class black people, who are portayed with every variety of perversion and obsession...the only ones who are shown as decent human beings are strange in their own ways, nonformist to the extreme.
