I was disappointed with this after reading My Sister's Keeper (which I loved).

There are too many plot holes in this story, too many inconsistencies. Like how the semen on Gilly's thigh was never explained - that's the most major one. The characters don't seem realistic. Addie and Jack's relationship annoyed me - the scenes with them seemed very contrived. The dialogue, most of the time, comes off as cheesy. Its the only way to describe it. Cheesy, cheesy, cheesy and cliched. The story only picked up its pace during the courtroom scenes (the best scenes out of the entire book) but still the ending was very unsatisfying as it did not explain a whole lot of things. And also, Picoult ends nearly *every* scene with a character dropping a one-liner. I found this rather irritating. Maybe its just me.

Addie misunderstands Jack so many times and overreacts again and again -the reader can only tolerate so much up to a certain point. The worst scene, I think, was when Jack tried to clear out Addie's dead daughter's room to get Addie to move on. It was so unoriginal.

The plot is not believable. It just doesn't work. The portrayal of Gilly was inconsistent and one-dimensional. Why did she try to poison her father? What would it have achieved? Why was she so angry at him in the beginning? Her motives were never clear from the start and Picoult does not satisfyingly explain them.

I'll say one good thing though. She can write courtroom scenes pretty well
