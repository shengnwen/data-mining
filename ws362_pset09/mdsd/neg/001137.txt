I don't want to waste a lot of time reviewing this book, nor do I recommend you waste yours reading it.  I must admit, I couldn't get any further than the introduction, but when I hit the end of the introduction where it said, "The book (China Streetsmart) can be summed up in a single sentence: "The biggest secret of doing business in China is - there is no secret; it's just plain common sense," I realized I had also come to the end of my interest in this book. I agree with other reviewers who note there are much better guides out there to doing business in China
