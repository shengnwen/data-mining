This book is the worst form of psuedo-intellectualism I have read in a long time.  It is chock full of unexamined philosophical pretensions that anyone even remotely schooled in philosophy let alone educational theory would shudder before. This is a book of jargon for people that want philosophy without tears.  Fundamental distinctions between cognition, learning, information, knowledge etc. are just thrown out onto the page like onions chipped into a frying pan. Unabashed by history, the book blithely sails past whole continents of philosophical work.  The work seems torn between recommending more online interaction (information retrieval) and less of it with a few chants about the importance social contact slipped in as a chorus.  Overall it fails by trying to be all things to all people while never offering an proper critique of technology and its social impact. Can't afford to offend the multinationals here. Possibly goood journalism
