I am a retired teacher and work part-time in a school library.  I read the Newberry Winners each year.  For the second year in a row, I am disappointed in the choice!  Last year's "Kira-Kira" was a disappointment as is this year's "Criss-Cross." I'm not certain of the standards by which the books are chosen.  "Criss-Cross" remains a mystery to me because I see no outstanding literary value in the writing or the story itself.
