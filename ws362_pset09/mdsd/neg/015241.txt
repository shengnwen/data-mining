I was on a website reading about the current Mid East happenings
(I am working in Kuwait now), and a banner ad talked about Nostradamus and world war 3 starting in 2007. Well I came to Amazon and came across this book, its one of the few that have reader comments on it. Then I read the excerpt : "Whereas prophecies up until this century have claimed that Israel and the Promised Land would be settled seven years prior to the arrival of the Messiah, this book proves that the advent period is, in fact, forty-two years, not seven. This discovery dates the settlement to the end of the Six-Day War in 1967, and indicates that the Messiah will therefore come in the year 2009." Does any of that passage raise an eyebrow? It does for me. Israel was made a country around 1947/8 I thought so where does this writer come up with using 1967? Well there's one explanation that I would believe, IT'S TO SELL A BOOK! Another comment, someone here said the world will be at war if our US leaders have their way, HUH? So our current leaders WANT world war 3? Please take a deep breath and go out of your apartment (maybe find a big park and walk around and look around, you've been cooped up on fringe web sites too long bouncing hate against others and its magnifying inside you). Did you think that the trade center bombing in 1993 was done by people who had a right to do it, and that the 9/11 attacks were a conspiracy by Bush? I really hope that your all talk and don't vote because the leaders you would put in power will probably empower more of this terror upon our western society. As for the book, I'll pass, thanks.
