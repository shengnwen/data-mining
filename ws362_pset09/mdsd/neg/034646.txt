I agree a lot with Wolf's review of this book. It just dosent add up. I think that generally, people throw around the word Karma carelessly. Before your born, you choose the experiences you were going to have, the signigigant relationships, life mission etc. You choose the way your going to grow on your spiritual path. To write a book that says you can bypass this is misleading. However, I do believe there are certain cellular and DNA memories from past lives and current lives that CAN be released. I suggest others interested in Karma and other related books search for the Matthew books "Matthew tell me about Heaven" by suzy ward
Botton line, nomatter what, your here to grow on this planet Earth, otherwise why would we come?
