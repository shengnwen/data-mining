I have been practicing and teaching yoga for over 30 years, and enjoy all the many varieties of yoga disciplines. Unfortunately, I cannot find any actual intrinsic value to this book, and literally all of the information contained there-in is nothing more than a simple regurgitation of various basic yoga techiques, with some simple children's gymnastic stretches thrown-in, and the label "partner yoga" slapped onto it. There is no original thinking here, and the author clearly is not an experienced nor interesting writer; the real purpose of this work is revealed unfortunately as really just being about the author. As I true dedicated yoga evangelist, I have grown tired of "posers" who attach themselves to spirituality and emerging and established practices simply for personal gain rather than authentic genuine value-added contributions and passion that enhance and further all of the great and wonderful work that is being and has been done by some remarkable pioneers out in our global community
