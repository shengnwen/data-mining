I really disliked this book's portrayal of a woman so desperate for a baby that she would jump head first into the first adoption &quot;opportunity&quot; that came her way and then bemoan the constant difficulties she got herself and her shell-shocked, though supportive, husband into.  A much better look at international adoption can be found in A World of Love by Maggie Francis Conroy.  I definately do not recommend this book
