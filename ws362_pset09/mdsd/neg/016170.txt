This is the second Myss product I've purchased so far.  I love her spin on reinterpreting our reality.  Though I wouldn't consider her a guru, her work carries much wisdom to it.  There is so much I KNOW I can glean from her studies.

That's the plus side.  The down-side is that she loses me, and frustrates me.  An awful lot.  Any time she has an aside, or a tangent story, she runs on into it without so much as a pause.  It's distracting and downright annoying, so much so that I could NOT finish listening to the last few hours of "Archetypes."  And I love her sense of humor, I really do, but I find myself saying "huh?" to things like this:

"Your own child archetype is critical for you to take a look at, for you to identify.  Are you a magical child, are you a Tarzan is a nature child for example.  There's very much of that need of of I have a friend in Scotland--hoof, you're not going to believe this, but this is absolutely true: they're very eccentric actually, but their son, this is so preposterous you are not going to believe this, I don't know why I'm going to share this story."

My head began spinning on that second sentence and I. Just. Got. Lost. I had NOTHING concrete to latch on to as a listener.  Maybe her rapport with the studio audience was *spot on*, or maybe it's just a physical thing (maybe you need to see her face to get those pauses).  But I CANNOT RECOMMEND the audio format of her talks.  I suggest anyone who is interested in the treasures Myss has to offer to read the text versions if possible.

I'm sorry to be so critical of the way someone SPEAKS, but I blame it on the fact that I purchased something that communicates its value through SPEECH.
