A really quite awful book from a once-quite good author (witness 'Oranges  are not the Only Fruit', an inspiring and insightful novel later turned  into an equally good television programme). Layers of pretentious prose  tumble over each other whilst blindingly fatuous 'points' are made with all  the subtlety of, well, any of Jeanette Winterson's other, later works. As  Emerson, Lake and Palmer once found out, basing a work around an epic  subject does not make the work epic. It merely throws the paucity of ideas  into relief
