This book is not about est.  It is a fraud, and Mr. Frederick is a thief.  It contains a recently and poorly written forward that mentions est - otherwise it is not mentioned in the book.  This is fraud and theft. So much for enlightenment.  Don't misunderstand, it's not that it's a critical book about est, it isn't about it at all.  Shame on Mr. Frederick and anyone associated with this.  They are theives.  I will be asking Amazon for my money back.  The reference in the title is to get those legitimately looking to explore something about est to order it - and be ripped off
