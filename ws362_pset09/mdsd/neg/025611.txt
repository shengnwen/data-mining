I was dissapointed in the book.  I found his argument for a coming Antichrist at the end of the age to be very weak.  It appeared more as an opinion rather than supported with good, solid Biblical rationale.  I would not recommend it as a source for anyone looking to understand the Spirit of the Antichrist.
