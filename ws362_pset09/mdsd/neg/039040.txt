This book will appeal greatly to psuedointellectuals, who will invariably write mealymouthed reviews on Amazon with the word "Timely" in the title. But for a book ostensibly about our relation to the suffering of others, this is an incredibly dispassionate and overanalytical book which, despite the title, is really just a book about photography. In fact, as far as I can tell, Sontag just retreads her ideas on photography that have been published elsewhere. I have great respect for her, but this isn't her best work, especially given the subject she claims to be addressing. Only a hardened intellectual could write a book consisting of a series of disconnected, clever observations on the nature of photography and call it "Regarding the Pain of Others." This is exactly why people accuse modern academia as being so devoid of relevence and meaning.

In the end, I found the individual arguments interesting, and she is clearly very smart, but the book ultimately adds up to very little more than a souless disappointment
