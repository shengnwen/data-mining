This is a very intriguing look into the lives of Southerners at the beginning of the 20th century. The characters are authentically human, and the reader will connect with them easily. That's why it's such a shame the author had to waste this carefully constructed setting on a story with virtually no plot whatsoever. The story toys with several relational conflicts as it plods along, but there is never any gripping suspense, and I didn't pick up an overarching theme to tie the story together. The novel as a whole often seems fragmented, jumping from one group of characters to the next, especially toward the end. I read all the way through the book because I became attatched to the characters, but the end of the story left me with an incomplete feeling, as there is never any satisfying resolution. I would only recommend this book if you are studying what it was like to live in the South a century ago, or if you're into tragic soap operas
