I usually only feel compelled to write reviews for books that move me. Well, this one certainly did--to the bathroom to THROW UP! This insultingly unintelligent book is chock-full of every cliche known to man (or should I say woman). From leg-humping dogs to French dreamboats, The Botox Diaries is about as cleverly written as a fart joke. As an avid reader, I try to finish a book even if I don't like it. Well, there is an exception to every rule! What a waste of time
