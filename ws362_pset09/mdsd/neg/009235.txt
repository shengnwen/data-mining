I think people who know nothing about love should avoid writing books about it. Hooks knows a bit more about hate. This is obvious from her own words. 
Quote:
Bell Hooks (black professor of English at City College of New York) 
"I am writing this essay sitting beside an anonymous white male that I long to murder." [From her book A Killing Rage, quoted by David Horowitz in Hating Whitey, Spence Publishing, 1999, p. 31.]
Hooks needs to understand that hate is wrong no matter where or who it issues forth from...black or white or anyone. Hate isn't right. I think anyone who hates someone, especially an anonymous, innocent person, should seriously consider adequate professional counseling for an extended period of time. 
I think there are disorders which include the definition of hating strangers as one of their markers. We should never encourage or condone this kind of sick behavior. Thank you for your time.
