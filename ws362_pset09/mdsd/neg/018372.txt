I wanted to like this book: but often asking writers such questions brings on words that are not spontaneous and that though they may be competent in intellectualism, they are impoverished in beauty and in gutsiness, which is the kind of writing that truly sings. Since time to read is limited for most persons, it might be good to read the original materials and forget about the rehashed commentary. I would far rather see a diamond than read about one
