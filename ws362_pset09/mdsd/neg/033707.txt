I've read many of ghost books and I must say this one isn't the best. The book is vague...It seems as though having the content fit a specific page range or word limit was more important than the actual stories themselves. I found myself asking for better examples or more elaboration on the parts that seemed promising. It's as if it's enough to make you curious but not curious enough to really give the book a second thought. The book could really be better, have more "meat" in each of the stories instead of just a broad generalization that is an urban legend. Any how, if you really want to get chills or read a better written stories about abondaned and curious places that you'd swear are haunted.
