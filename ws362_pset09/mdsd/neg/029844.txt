I read this book when I was in grade school, and I have to say that it is pretty warped. This isn't just about children playing with toys that come to life when they are not around. Despite the impression you might have gotten from other reviews, this is NOT like "Toy Story." The dolls have their own personalities, yes, but they are not all nice. Marchpane is not just spoiled and "delicate" she is evil. She is a sociopath who goads the little boy doll into literally playing with fire. The boy's mother, Birdie, sacrifices her own life to save her son. The book plays it up as some great moral maternal thing, but for all intents and purposes, Marchpane murders her. The death is gruesome, with Birdie burning alive into a pile of dust while her husband and son look on with horror and Marchpane remarks remorselessly that if Birdie had been made of more quality materials, like Marchpane herself, she would not have died. This book really affected me as a child, and not in a good way. I scarcely remember the rest of the plot, but Birdie's death is an image that will always stay with me. If I could rate it with zero stars, I would. DO NOT buy this for a child
