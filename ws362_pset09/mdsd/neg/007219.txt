I found the picture by picture style of this book not only anoying, but void of in-depth information. Premiere is phenomenally complicated. This book's &quot;Simple Simon&quot; approach shows how to do the basics step by step without explaining the fundamentals and technical information necessary to master video editing basics. My advice to someone who actually wants to LEARN Premiere? Don't try to take a short cut. If you need a picture book with step by step instructions to work through a software program, Adobe Priemiere is probably not the best video editing tool for you to learn. This book fails to explain the importance of the &quot;Render&quot; command thus confusing the begginer who can't understand why none of the technical tricks of the book are not working. In a nutshell, buy another book
