I picked up this book almost by mistake when travelling.  I usually read enough of a book before purchasing to understand enough about the sytle and bias of the author.  Unfortunately, while I expected a biography - what I actually got was the author's very left wing views about how Paine is beining interpretted in later years.  

I guess you could say I am guilty of reading a lot of "Founder's Chic" books- but this was by far the worst I've read.  His Excellency, George Washington", "Alexander Hamilton", "Benjamin Franklin- an American Life", "1776" were infinitely better books. This book belongs with the political opinion books on a different shelf.
