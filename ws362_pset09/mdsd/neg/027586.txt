This book is a bitter and gloomy snapshot in time that unfairly presents West Point through the prism of the Vietnam War era. The Oct 26, 2003 review "A Reviewer From That Era", and the June 6, 2003 review "From an Ordinary Vet" are both right on the mark. This book ends up being quite off the mark. I don't wish to take anything away from Rick Atkinson who is a wonderful writer. But, judging officers, the military, and West Point by this book, and using this as a book to decide whether you are interested in attending West Point, is misleading and an unwise choice. If I were in Admissions at West Point, I certainly would not recommend this book. If I were teaching a course that is narrow in scope on the history of the Vietnam Era ...  perhaps. It's way past time to put Vietnam aside.
