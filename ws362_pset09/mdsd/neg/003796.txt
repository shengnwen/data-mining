This book has some useful information on fasting and natural hygiene, but I found it extremely difficult to read through the book to get to it.  For those who are devout Christians, the book is probably wonderful.  For those  who are of other faiths, or who prefer books in which God is not referenced  in literally every sentence, this is not a great choice
