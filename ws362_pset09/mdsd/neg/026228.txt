Not only are the things listed in this book cheap trinkets but most everything in the book you have to pay $1.00 or $2.00 for. The stuff you do not have to pay shipping for are useless pamphlets and literature. There are a few things that are pretty cool and possibly some useful information for some folks but most everything is Junk. Plus a lot of the things listed are repeated through the book. Its like the author needed to add stuff and thought nobody would notice that several of the things were repeated. Overall this 31 page booklet was not worth the paper it was printed on. If you are interested in getting free things I would suggest finding "freebie" message boards on the internet
