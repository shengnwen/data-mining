I was very disappointed with this book.  The storyline is illogical, shallow and completely unbelievable.  The characters and dialogue are ridiculous and stilted. The two storylines never come together leaving the reader to wonder what was the point?  Having read other Catherine Coulter books, I cannot fathom why her editor ever allowed this book to get into print unless it was to meet some contractual deadline.
