I really didn't enjoy this piece. I had to read it for school. I complained alot every night I had to read it. It is really very confusing and I think that the overall book was pretty horible. It was probably on the list of the top ten books that I DIDN'T like. Others may have different feelings but I really didn't like it at all.
