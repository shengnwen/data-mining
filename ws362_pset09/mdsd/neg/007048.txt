Ravi Zacharias never adequately addresses the core question of atheism.  How do we know that God exists or does not exist?  Atheism argues that God does not exist.  According to atheists, there is no conclusive evidence for the existence of God, unicorns, or other supernatural entities.  The only remaining argument for the existence of the supernatural is FAITH that unicorns and God exist.  

From what I've read about atheism, this philosophical stance does not espouse any particular moral system anymore than the belief in God espouses a specific moral system.  If a person claims that the supernatural (or God) exists, then that person has to choose a moral system such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and so forth (and a particular sect within that religion).  If a person claims that the supernatural does not exist (atheism), then that person must pick or develop a moral system.  Examples of secular (without God) moral systems are as follows: (a) secular humanism; (b) the philosophies of Peter Singer, Bertrand Russell, or John Dewey; (c) the morality of your family or community if these people are secular and (d) so forth.
