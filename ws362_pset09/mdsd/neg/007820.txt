most of it is funny as hell, and it's hard to argue with the vast majority of the don'ts.  the thing is, most of it is also racist, homophobic, transphobic and generally hateful. that will probably encourage people to get it, but whatever. i don't know who told hipsters it's OK to be evil as long as you pretend it's just irony and sarcasm, but if i did, i would have to administer a beatdown.  borrow it or steal it if you must, but don't buy it.  sheesh
