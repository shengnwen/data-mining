The authors no doubt know Investment analysis. Unfortunately they don't communicate that information too well. Frequently happens when Phd's forget they are writing to students, not other Phd's. Bought this book for a senior level finance course, required to complete my major in finance. 
Even my Prof. started the course with, "the textbook is difficult to read but just follow my notes and you should do ok". Not too good of an endorsement for a textbook. Now, after completing the course, I am searching for another text on the subject to keep as a reference. Even after the lectures, this book's explinations of the same topics are difficult to follow
