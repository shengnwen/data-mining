I have read the book "Just Say No" and I liked it, I also brought the Audio book, however I did not like the reading of the book as well as I liked reading it. Perhaps if it would have been read by someone other than the Author I would have liked it; I found Omar's reading to hyped and gave you no time to really enjoy the flow of what was going on. In my opinion he made the people in the book sound to over acted. He read the book like he was talking to someone...and the singing, well let's just say I'm glad he a writer. If he should ever want to put one of his books on Audio again....please get someone else to read it for you.
