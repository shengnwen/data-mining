This book has the same format as the other "What to Expect" books, but some of the information is out of date.  This is not a book to read if you are breastfeeding, or if you are practicing any version of attachment parenting.  The breastfeeding section quotes studies that have since been proven wrong, and will make you feel guilty for breastfeeding your child past their first birthday.  I returned this book, and am looking for a more up to date toddler reference
