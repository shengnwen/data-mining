In many ways, Yungen's book is good.  It rasies serious questions about the influence of Eastern thought and metaphysics in modern Christianity, and some of his points are quite valid.  However the conclusions that he draws regarding cnetering prayer eventually become very tenuous and downright tangential.  To be blunt, his reasoning goes like this: 
   A: Eastern mystics chant mantras ("om")
   B: Contemplative prayer sometimes involves repeating a word or phrase ("Jesus")
   C: A=B, therefore contemplative prayer is un-Christian
Another form of his reasoning:
   A: Eastern religion influenced the Desert Fathers
   B: the Desert Fathers influenced Thomas Merton
   C: Thomas Merton influenced Richard Foster
   D: Richard Foster influenced Rick Warren
   E: therefore Rick Warren believes in Eastern religion

Please read this book critically if you read it at all
