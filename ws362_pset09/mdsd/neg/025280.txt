It's a funny thing to me... that every one of these gurus... has the exact problem with the modern church.

And yet... all of these experts only refer to their own skewed opinions or the opinions of other fallible men and never the pure words of God.

A prime example would be this book.

This man believes that all the ills of the modern church is linked to the one thing that this man thinks he has straight. And what is that? That churches no longer meet in homes.

Book, chapter and verse?

This man cannot give you book, chapter and verse... because he doesn't know the scriptures nor the power of God.

If the fact that churches not meeting in homes is the culprit for the apostasy within the body of Christ... surely God would have warned of such danger in the pages of holy scripture.

Amen?

But the truth of the matter is... HE DIDN'T! So the best this man can do... is point out the fact that the early church met in homes. Which is obviously true. However, where is the New Testament injunction against meeting in a building designated for fellowship?

I'll help you out. There isn't one.

What we have here is a modern day Pharisee who is straining at a gnat while swallowing a camel.

Please save the Lord's money and just read your Bible
