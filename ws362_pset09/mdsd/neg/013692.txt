I have read several of Mr. Dickey's books and really enjoy them, however this one sas a disappiontment. A friend whom read this book said it was a great read but I would have to disagree. I was expecting it to end differemtly than it did because I already had a idea about how it would end before it did. I really found the ending boring, but i still intend on reading Mr. Dickey's other books
