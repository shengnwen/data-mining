This book was by far one of the... WEIRDEST books I have ever read!! My fellow youth and I (a bunch of 14 year olds) all agree that we would never under any circumstances find joy in POKING someone else's pee bag! Nor would I find joy urinating with my enemy in a plant!
     Also, they describe Mars like it was real. These kids were pretending, and really BELIEVEING that they were on the planet mars! I found it sad and a bit sickening! And heck, I'm only a few years older then this Samir character!
     Aside from the main story plot, I found tons of grammatical errors. Lots of "Me and Yonatons"s were thrown in there, and many of the sentences were quite awkward. "Yes." IS NOT A SENTANCE. On the other hand "yes," would be correct! And yes, I do know that this was a translated book, and I understand that it's not going to be perfect, but at least TRY so that a 7th grader doesn't notice!? 
     So, for all of you adults saying that this is a great "Children/teen book" I really hope that I have made it clear in this review, that us youngin's DO NOT enjoy reading about pee-touching children! And the topic that it's focusing on is very important! (Arab/Jew conflict)
   To sum it all up, this book was "Dumber than my shoes."
