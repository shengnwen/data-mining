In the preamble to readers, Miss Malkin bangs on about how her essay defends the relocation and internment of ethnic Japanese and enemy aliens during World War II, rattling on to write "her work is by no means all-encompassing; my aim is to provoke a debate on a sacrosanct subject that has remained undebatable for far too long."

Further on, however, in her own words, she says it's about "correcting the record," which doesn't quite jibe with "provoke a debate."

Nope.

This work plays out as a revisionist view of how the U.S. government interred over 100,000 aliens and U.S. citizens of Japanese descent, based not on hysteria, paranoia or racism, but on intelligence gained from classified Japanese originated telexes sent to its ministries around the world, before being forwarded to US-based (Japanese to a person) spies of the Japanese government.

She bases this statement on indepth research conducted through (but not limited to) original documents from the FBI, Justice Department, Office of Naval Intelligence, numerous offices within the War Department, State Department, Military Intelligence Division, President Roosevelt's own communications and the aforementioned telexes.

And, she accomplished all this within twelve months - the same twelve months she continued to hack out an ongoing newspaper column and bask in the glories of childbirth.

I doubt it.

To get this issue right - if that's even possible - she'd have to trawl through a lifetime of documentation, interview witnesses, survivors, etc, with which to form her hypothesis.

Not the Michelle Malkin I'm familiar with.  A day spent on Google perhaps.  FOXNews transcripts, maybe.  Nope, there's something dodgy, if not outright incredible about this 'work.
