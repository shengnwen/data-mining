Although I am a fan of this series, I found Adams' writing style to be monotonous, convoluted, and dull. It's a shame that the disorganized style of the writer prevents readers from being able to truly enjoy the half way interesting concepts addressed in his book. I think this is a fascinating topic, but unfortunately Adams was not able to pull of this type of book due to his ostentatious writing style. I doubt I would read another Adams book again, but if someone else wrote on this subject I would be interested
