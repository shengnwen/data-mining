I read 1/2 of this book and loved it. What an incredible adventure.

I then googled the author and found several stories, including a special BBC investigative piece, that showed evidence that the author completely fabricated the story. Polish soliders were given a general amnesty and released from gulags in order to assist the Russians in fighting the Germans.

Very dissapointing
