If I could have given this book zero stars, I would have.  This book is nothing more than liberal propaganda, promoting the Freudian ways that have invaded our classrooms, and ensuring that our nation's teachers-to-be will be as clueless and incompetant as to how to actually teach children.  Of all the varying standpoints on issues in education, the book only briefly talks about conservative opinions, and goes at length about liberal ones; it doesn't even try to be middle of the road.  If you want to ensure that our children will continue to fail in school, go ahead and buy this book, if not, save your money
