I know too little to critique this book - a book is like a painting as we turn the pages the picture gets brighter and brighter. Most of the time the picture is incomplete and then it is our job to imagine the completion. In this canvas there are the back ground colors (in musical terms these are noises) and there are the primary characters over that background. It is important that the artiste do not mix up too much of the back ground with the primary focuses. In this book the back ground overpowers the focused characters. 
We use examples to reinforce our ideas and thought and not to divert the actual discussion - in all the five stories the examples fudge the primary discussions. I never question the fact that Edmund Wilson is extremely knowledgeable but that does not mean I have to get a dose of that in every page. Hemingway's book "the old man and the sea" is not thick and there are no examples but it still captures our imagination while these five stories do not. May be this book was not for me - my recommendation is try one story and then plan for the rest of the book.
