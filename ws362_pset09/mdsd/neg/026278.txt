Stephen L. Carter needs to trust his readers a bit more. He seems to think he is writing for people with the memory dysfunction dramatized in the movie Memento. He almost never introduces the Sally character without reminding us of her lifelong love for her cousin Addison. He reminds us endlessly of Mariah's obsession with conspiracy theories and her journalistic doggedness. Every time he mentions the character John Brown he reminds us that Brown is an electrical engineer. Almost every time he mentions Pastor Young we are reminded that the Pastor is a fat man and a slave to his appetites. Every time Dear Dana's ex-husband is mentioned we are reminded that he used to be married to Dana. We are reminded over and over again that Dana's lesbian relationship has gone sour. Every time Addison Garland reappears we have to be reminded of his reputation as a Casanova. Every time Lionel Eldridge appears we are reminded that he owes the narrator a term paper and is an ex-NBA star. Carter never mentions anything once. The book has a lot of characters and Carter clearly knows that they are largely indistinguishable from each other, or else so stereotypical as to be unmemorable, so he feels the constant need to remind us of which stereotype he happens to be ushering onstage at any particular point in the story. But a chart listing the large cast of characters at the beginning of the book would have been a much easier way to solve this problem. And if he could have avoided repeating the same bits of information over and over again (every five pages there is some lament for the narrator's failed marriage, some reminder of Judge Garland's bitterness, some mention of Jack Zeigler's promise to protect Misha and his family) this 660-novel could easily have been reduced to 300 pages or so. It still wouldn't have been a great novel, but it might at least have succeeded as a good fast-paced summer thriller
