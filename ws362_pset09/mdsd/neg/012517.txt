This book contains some of the worst exegesis I have ever read (and I've read some bad stuff from time to time).  This author has such a poor approach to the text and draws such ridiculous conclusions that I am astounded.  It is books like this that kept me away from Christianity for many years, and even now that I have gone back to the church and consider myself a Christian, books like this make me want to run screaming away again.  Argh!  

A few examples: she thinks the washing of Jesus' feet by a prostitute's hair was an erotic act (it was actually the act of a slave and similar to what Jesus later did for his disciples).  She also links this prostitute with Mary Magdalene, a common but unbiblical error (Mary Magdalene was possessed by seven demons; she was not a prostitute).

Also, I know that Christians often disparage the Tanakh (Hebrews scriptures, dismissively called the Old Testament) but her treatment of these scriptures is unusually (shockingly, appallingly) anti-Semitic.  She also twists herself in knots trying to show that she doesn't agree with the Catholic honoring of Mary (ironically using the same verses that Catholics use to show that Mary is the mother of the Church to mean somehow that Jesus disowned Mary as his physical mother!).

This kind of bizarre, twisted exegesis is the very reason millions of people are leaving Christianity.  Honestly, this author went into the Bible with an idea of what she wanted to prove and then twisted the text to fit her points.  This would not convince anyone with even a basic education, and as people become more educated, they leave the church over just this type of mishandling of the text.

Unless you enjoy reading things with such tangled reasoning that you need Tylenol afterwards and a cool cloth over your forehead, I'd suggest avoiding this one
