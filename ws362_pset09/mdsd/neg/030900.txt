Although I read this book a year or two ago, I recently received it for Christmas and decided to look at the reviews, because frankly, I thought it was a terrible book. First, the main character's family is so superstitious that it seems unrealistic. After she "causes her sister's infertility," she paddles down a river, and frankly, the rest was so boring, I forgot what happens next.
