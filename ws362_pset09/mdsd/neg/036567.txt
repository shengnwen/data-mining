Years ago, the trainer of my 3-months old coonhound recommended staying away from this book, describing it as "the best way to get your dog to be afraid of you and mess up your relationship forever!".  But I wanted to read it, to know what it was all about... I cannot tell you how many times I was fuming realizing how ignorantly these Monks approach dogs' psychology and the physical and psychological violence they use. The temptation of throwing that piece of junk out the window was strong, but I read it through to make sure I could talk about it as bad as I can with the knowledge of its contents.
I am saddened to find out that they are still out there... This is the training philosophy for frustrated humans that need to dominate to compensate their own insecurities. 
Meanwhile I am a trainer myself and I support a more constructive approach to dog training based on positive reinforcement.  If you know nothing about dogs' psychology, and want to learn more from "The Voice" in dog behavior I suggest "The Other End of the Leash" by Patricia McConnell or "Culture Clash" 
by Jean Donaldson or "The Power of Positive Dog Training" by Pat Miller.
If you would like to become a benevolent leader of the pack without imposing yourself to your dog with violence or fear, I suggest "How to be the Leader of the Pack...And have Your Dog Love You for It" ("How to" booklets from Dog's Best Friend) by Patricia B. McConnell.
All these books are written by professionals that have been working with dogs and studying dogs' behaviors, but they are very entertaining and easy to read and comprehend. Patricia McConnell also wrote a number of other books addressing specific behavioral issues.
