I had high hopes for this guide, as I generally respect the reviews of A.O. Scott and the New York Times movie review crew.  However, this book disappoints in several ways:

1) The movies are heavily skewed towards those released in the last 10 years.  The more recent a movie, the less likely I am to have "almost forgotten" it.  Sure, Metropolis is in here, but very few other movies until the 1990s.  What I'm looking for in a book of this title is more older movies that I am more likely to never have heard fo.

2) Some of the recommended movies are pretty questionable, in my book.  I understand there is bound to be difference of opinion, but I doubt that flicks like "Drumline", and "Freddy got Fingered", rank amoung the best movies I've never seen
