This book was drudgery to get through. It has got to be the worse thing I ever read. The only thing it stimulated was my gag reflex. If people see this book as some great work of art filled with profound truth then   we are all in trouble. I have never posted a book review here but I felt compelled to warn others to SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME. I only read it because it was chosen by my book club.
