I should have known that decorating "Martha-style" would not be my style.  Her passion in finding the "old" at bargain prices and making it "work" for her is not what I call decorating.  She loves to re-furbish, re-store and re-model ... I don't.  However, my expectations were really dashed after completion of the book and realized there was no valid reason for her publisher to classify it as a decorating book.  If you like to read about Martha's homes, her anecdotes and her convoluted names of Martha-labled paint colors, you will enjoy it ... maybe.  I've seen and heard it all before.
