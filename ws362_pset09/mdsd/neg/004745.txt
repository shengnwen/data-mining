The author belies a hostility towards his subject early on in the book by referring to him as &quot;Charlie&quot; as though he was the cop on &quot;Bad Boys&quot; who had caught the guy in the video who had obviously  done something which gave him the right to speak condescendingly to him.   In Clark's own mind Olson has become an unworthy father who he has to beat  down.  Wierd !  Totally misses the point of Olson's art which is that each  page is different and a unique attempt at truth.   Shows too how the  Thruway West (oh Gunslinger) has obliterated belief in an actual earth of  value. Which Olson's actual text does manage to keep alive
