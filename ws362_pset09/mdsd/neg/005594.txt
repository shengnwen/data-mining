Just finished the book. It was, in a word: er, okay. Well, that's two words. And I promised only one, and in a typical Austerian world, these sorts of contradictions not only exist, but flourish. It's why I liked his "The Book of Illusions" and "Mr. Vertigo" so much, and to a lesser extent "Oracle Night". But in "The Brooklyn Follies", Auster seems to take a step back from reality that transcends and focuses instead on just plain old reality. Which could be interesting if the prose were more lively (see his Leviathan), but frankly, except for a few spare moments of beauty, much of the narrative is flat and riddled with, dare I say it, clichés. This is surprising because Auster is so much better than this---I've always thought him exceptional at capturing man's lonely core and the subtle way life transforms lives.

There are hints at this throughout the book, and there is also the eternal Auster ode to the power of story, to wit:

"She has the story, and when a person is lucky enough to live inside a story, to live inside an imaginary world, the pains of this world disappear. For as long as the story goes on, reality no longer exists."

But overall, to hijack Jonathan Antin, "It just wasn't happening for me, man." Here's hoping his forthcoming Travels in Scriptorium: A Novel regains the Auster magic
