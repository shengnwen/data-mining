This text book is very bad.  My professor for this class was almost as bad as this book.  I can't believe that Amazon.com sells this book due to the low quality of it.  Don't even buy it used because the authors made this up while they were on drugs because none of the chapters flow and they are lazy and make you refer to other examples that do not even pertain to the question.  I wish Amazon.com let you score lower than a 1 star because this book doesn't even deserve that
