Watch the mini series, skip the book.

If you are a fan of history, and I'm certain you are if you're reading this review, skip this book.  Read Rick Atkinson, or Dick Winters' account, anything, just skip this book.

The writing was high school quality, a poor job by the editors (apparently the atomic bomb was "dripped" on Hiroshima), and the story is short on the details that make reading historical accounts interesting.

Enjoy the mini series, but if you're interested in this topic, find another book
