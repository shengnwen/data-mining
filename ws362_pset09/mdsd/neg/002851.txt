Being a successful manager , and being an avid reader, I was expecting this book to go a bit further than it did.  I have read a number of project management books, and a number of management books, and I would have to say that this book is at best a rudimentary management book.  If you are completely new to management then maybe this book would be useful.  If you are an existing manager and are looking for practical advice on how to manage, track, and report on multiple projects, this book is not for you
