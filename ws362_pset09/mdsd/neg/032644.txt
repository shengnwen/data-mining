This is only the second Anne Tyler book I've read and I'm not impressed. The book was depressing. I had hope as the book progressed that the main character would &quot;triumph&quot; over her circumstances but instead she subsumed her own dreams for her husband's wants and needs. Anne Tyler implies that this is a noble sacrifice but I thought it was weak. She should have left her loser husband
