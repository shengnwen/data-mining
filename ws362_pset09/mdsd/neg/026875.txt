This book is not for a novice. I have been making soap for family and friends and I have quite an array of fixed and essential oils but I find many of the key ingredients are hard to find or are very expensive. She uses absolutes, hydrosals, and expensive essential oils like roman chamomile.  

If you don't want to spend a lot of money or are new to making homemade cosmetics, do not buy this book
