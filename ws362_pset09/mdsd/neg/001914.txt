This lab manual is bad. Because the the person who wrote the lab manual I don't think has a clue what level of difficulty on the questions and situations ina real network should be. A lot of the questions where too advanced for the scope of the textbook was trying to get across. The textbook was great. Mike Meyers should have wrote the lab book like he did when he wrote the A+ Textbook and Lab Manual, those were great tools
