Even the world's greatest living military historian admits to being "mystified" by the Iraq war in his opening chapter.  The following chapters are more in the Keegan style and provide a solid background on Iraq and its place in the region.  Iraq did not provide the sustained episodes of combat that Mr. Keegan may be used to detailing, and hence his work is brought up significantly short, as there are no great tank or infantry battles for him to cover.  His analysis of the war's aftermath is brief and unsatisfactory, especially when that is where the real war began.  Mr. Keegan wrote about his subject too early in its history and the results leave the reader as equally mystified as the author.  Far more highly recommended would be Yossef Bodansky's "The Secret History of the Iraq War", David Zucchino's "Thunder Run", or "Generation Kill" by Evan Wright.
