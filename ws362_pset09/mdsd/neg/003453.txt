This was my least favorite. I took three guides over, this one, the Maui for Dummies and a Lonely Planet guide.  The Dummie guides assumed I was in search of a paradise island. Well, I'm not a cocktail toting romanticist and all I wanted the guidebook to reveal was uncommercial untouristy places to go.  Zilcho.  I'm sticking with Lonely Planet for real reporting of all the important and offbeat places
