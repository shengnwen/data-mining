This is a "sweet" book that is very reassuring 
and interesting to read if you don't have anything better to do.  
But as a mom, who has time for this?  
Don't we all look up things in a state of diress, hoping to find concrete useful information delivered rapidly in the least words possible?
Well, you won't find that here.  
This book is full of very nonspecific, sometimes outdated information delivered in a very wordy style.
The whole book is written in long paragraphs.  There are very few tables or charts.  IT's VERY wordy.  
Just to give you an example, I looked up Fluoride supplementation.
It addresses the topic using nearly a FULL page, but never tells you the actual amount your baby should have depending on his age!
More concise and concrete information is available in pediatrician Dr. Ari Brown's "Baby 411"! 
I gave this book one star because aside from being too general, some of the information in it is outdated, or in the category of "old wives tales" !
Save your money and skip the "what to expect" book
