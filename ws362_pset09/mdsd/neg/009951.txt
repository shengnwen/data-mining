I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort
