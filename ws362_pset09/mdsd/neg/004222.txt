This book is by far my least favorite of the one's that I have read.  I couldn't connect with the characters at all through the book and really didn't care what happened to them.  They were all pretty dull and boring. The most interesting character was the cat. Midnight Rain is by far the author's best book.  Check that one out if you want something good to read, skip this one.
