This book read like a cheap afterthought. The sexual scenes were a put off and felt as if they were stuck in the book to spice up a dismal effort. Thank goodness the book is short. The Last Picture Show was great, Texasville was not great but good and the rest of the Duane saga sputters out. This book was not what I expect of a writer of McMurtry's caliber. I honestly felt I was ripped off. Sorry to see it. Skip ahead to another book
