I bought this book when my son was 18 months old, figuring I could still get about 3 more years of info out of it.  Instead I found myself wondering and even worrying whether I did the "best" thing back while I was pregnant and during his first year of life, as the "perfect parent" would.  While interesting and informative, this is not a reference book you can easily look up, by age, what's going on in there for the first five years of life. The majority of the book deals with baby development, with very little info beyond the first year.   For me the title was very misleading
