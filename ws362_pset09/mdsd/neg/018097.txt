This guy chastises society for throwing away perfectly good oven knobs, pictures of people we dont have a clue to as to who they are and the like.  Imagine us!  Not respecting and saving perfectly good items like that!  Puh-leeeze.  This guy finds it sinful that people throw pictures out! The only redeeming thing about this book are the stories about the ultra-wealthy's waste.  Which I even admit were eye-opening.  But other than that it is just another case of one of the U.S.'s uber-liberal college professors ranting against capitalism and consumerism.  What most of these clowns fail to realize is that time is money and garbage is garbage.  That and the fact that he himslef seems to have no use for much of the junk he himself collects.  He stores a huge assortment of these gee-gaws in a storage shed in his backyard with no idea of when or if he'll ever use them. These types like to force recycling on everyone without regards to if anyone even wants or needs the trash we are now being forced to recycle.  Most dont realize that there is no real market for most of the paper goods we are forced to recycle in most cities nowadays and it ends up in the landfill anyway
