Since I had never played a WWII shooter before, I thought it would be a good idea to pick this up when I bought Call of Duty 2.  I've gotten hooked on strategy guides in recent years anyway and generally find the maps and other info very helpful.  Unfortunately, the Call of Duty 2 Official Strategy Guide is the first one I've ever purchased that I consider a total waste of money.

To begin with, the game itself is actually very straightforward and easy to figure out.  The strategy required to finish a given scenario is generally obvious.  While I often died during missions, I knew what to try next in order to succeed.  

On those few occasions when I felt more challenged, I found the book to be no help at all.  They tend to give a very general walk through of the mission along with maps that were very difficult to follow.  There was never enough detail to be of any real help.  In the end, I figured out how to survive and complete all of the missions on my own just as I would have without the book.

In the final analysis, this book will not justify the money you would spend on it.  Call of Duty 2 is challenging in its own way, but it is not a game that demands a clue book.  The manual itself is attractive but is ultimately filled with useless filler.  Save the money and use it to buy the expansion pack for Call of Duty 2 that will doubtless be released in the coming months
