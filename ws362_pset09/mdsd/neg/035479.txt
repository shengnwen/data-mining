overpriced and overrated.

too many candid celeb shots - wasted pages that couldve been filled by more fashion spreads or images.

and i got really annoyed by too many images of his stark, boring homes. can anybody honestly live in places like that? so devoid of any kind of color or creativity that he brings to his clothes.

i am in love with tom ford as the next fashionista, for he is a great talent, but for someone who is going to put out a book about himself and his work - where are the pics of the countless people behind the scenes who helped propel him to his superstar status. maybe pics of him hangin out with the seamstresses, i dont know -- something that would show that Tom is indeed human...instead i thought the book, although did present some fantastic images of campaigns and such, was lacking -- straight runway shots are so boring - papparazzi shots of celebs are boring also - im sure there were arty photographers out there at his shows taking pics all those seasons.. i am glad all the image campaign ads were included
