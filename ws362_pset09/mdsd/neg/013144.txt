I can add this book to the list of books that I have started to read and cannot bring myself to finish.  I ordered this book because the author was compared to David Sedaris (an author that I read because he was compared to Augusten Burroughs - who is the funniest) but found out that she is nothing like Sedaris unless you compare her to one of his earlier works-which are not funny either.

Not only did I find this author unable to make me laugh, I did not smile once or even find a mildy amusing sentence.  I cannot even give you an instance of a stupid anecdote because they are ALL so boring that I cannot remember one.  

Save your money - borrow from the library.  I picked up "The Other Boleyn Girl" the other day and find it extremely interesting and well written - not funny but worth a look
