Here's the deal:

Janet Evanovich is writing for the money.

The series hit its climax at To the Nines. Ten Big Ones was a disappointment, and Eleven on Top had none of the fun its racy title promised. 

The Barnaby series are manufactured pop romps (though I'll still read them), and are bound to burnout soon. 

The thing is, I think Evanovich knows this. I think she understands that her writing style has become stale, trite, and disappointing. Looking for inspiration, she has turned back to her early work.

Evanovich published 10+ wonderful suspense/mystery/action/ROMANCE novels that pop up on Ebay occasionally. I've read some of them, and they really are quite fun. Even better, she is rereleasing them for the mass audiences. 

Anyway, the first of these books was Full House. She repackaged this with fairly disappointing conclusions, but continued the series with (in the wrong order) Full Tilt, Full Blast, Full Speed, and now, Full Bloom.

These novels were fun, exciting, silly, and fresh. This may be because Evanovich teamed up with Charlotte Hughes. Anywhichway, with Full Bloom, Evanovich has slipped back into her old writing style: the twenty page setup, the quick burnout, and two hundred extra pages of nothing. 

I ended up skimming the end part of this book, and it was still slow and painful. Try and guess the mystery by reading the summary! You probably will. Try the other Full series, and get her old romances: The Rocky Road to Romance, Love Overboard, and Back to the Bedroom
