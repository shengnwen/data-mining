Too much outdated irrelevant information.  Watkinson IS extremely knowledgable on the subject of digital audio.  I guess I expected something different.  Too much esoteric (and much outdated) theory and very little if any practical information, unless maybe your job is to service 1980's digital audio systems.  

Want to know about revectoring, soft sectoring, and rotary positioners as they pertain to magnetic disk drives?  How about DASH-M and DASH-S interleaving in stationary head recorders?  If so then BUY THIS BOOK.  Interesting reading to be sure, but don't expect your "art" to benefit.  This review is based on the second edition
