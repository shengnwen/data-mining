Perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug, "aren't I hilarious?" tone of this book. Note: It is entirely possible that I am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book.  Or even to IDENTIFY the humor in the book.

The story of the two families competing with each other - to the point of handing over their children to be abused by a beggar, and donating various organs - was the train wreck of the Holiday tales.  (Although it may have been the story about the preacher, I can't say for sure because I gave that deadly tale five minutes to redeem itself before skipping it entirely.  So, in fact, perhaps the story is not about a preacher.  I'll never know.  Neither should you.) 

I think it's fair to say that the self-satisfied, condescending narrator of these tales simply couldn't bring himself to care about his characters.  They're simply dimensionless, cliched props - the self-centered suburban woman, the socially competitive neighbors - that should immediately journey to Oz so that they can collect the hearts and brains of which Sedaris has seen fit to deprive them.  

Speaking of hearts and brains, this book could use a hefty dose of those, too.
