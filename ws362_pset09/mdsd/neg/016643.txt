I had high hopes for this book.  It starts out with a very interesting theory for why cognitive therapy can fail: because it attempts to bypass the (vastly powerful) subconscious.  It then goes on to explain that, when we were children, our subconscious created "stories" to help us explain the hurtful behavior of our parents.  By adulthood, these stories have outgrow their usefulness and can start to create problems.  To really get at the heart of our problems and change our lives, we have to shed these "stories" from our past and "become real," i.e. live freely and unhindered by these old stories.  

That's an interesting and powerful opening.  However, the book lost me after this point.  First of all, it is extremely repetitive.  The author probably repeated her explanation of how and why our subconscious creates these "stories" over 200 times.  Second, she outlines 5 generic stories (the "greatest hits" of the unconscious) and explains that all of us fit into one or more of these categories.  I don't know about you, but I am very suspicious of any book that tries to put fit all of humanity into so few categorizations.  Lastly, the author, who is a real-life therapist, lost me on some of her analysis of the real life experiences of her patients.  Although the stories of people's sometimes illogical behavior were interesting--for example, a woman who is so afraid of rejection that she rejects others first or a woman who shows loyalty for her abusive father by dating abusive men--I did not always follow the author's analysis of just how and why they developed the way they did.

Overall, this was an interesting but very flawed book
