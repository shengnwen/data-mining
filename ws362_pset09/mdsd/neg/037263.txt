I have enjoyed several books by Anna Quindlen and looked forward to her latest offering. I settled down for an evening of reading 3 nights in a row before I finally gave up. I found the writing trite and boring. I didn't care about the characters as it took too long for them to become something. I'm wondering if this was something she wrote earlier in her career and tried to make a silk purse from a sow's ear. Rise and Shine? Not this time
