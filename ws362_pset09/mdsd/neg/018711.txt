I agree completely with D.Tjoa's review.  I bought it because of Amazon's 'If you like David Sedaris,...', but this is not humor writing.  Short stories yes, but if there is humor it is very dark and I couldn't find it.  Even irony would have been acceptable...  I'll define it as odd and mostly depressing
