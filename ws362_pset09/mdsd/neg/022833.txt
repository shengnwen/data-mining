If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!

You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!"
