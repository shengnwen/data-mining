This is by far the worst textbook I have had for any class.  As a graduate student in mechanical engineering I suggust anyone who thinks to use this book to avoid it.  Bejan is the most arrogant writer I have ever seen.  He cuts the most complex areas of his proofs out of the book, plus there is not a single example in it.  THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE
