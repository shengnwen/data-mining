If you want a decent book about bike fit, this might be a book for you. But I have mixed feelings about this book, and overall wouldn't recommend it if you're expecting a complete medical guide for cyclists. Despite its title, this book is not "complete," as claimed. It doesn't touch on a lot of issues for riders, like riding in cold weather, for instance. Arnie Baker's book is more complete ("Bicycling Medicine"). Pruitt's main focus seems to be on bike fit, and here he seems to know what he's talking about, even if his ideal approach is inaccessible to readers of the book (you have to go to his lab and get reflectors put on you and a movie made). The book is very thin. At its best, this means the author is concise, and some of his insights are great. At its worst, the book seems superficial. The section on supplements is most troublesome. Here, the author seems compromised and conflicted. He allows a physician who has a particular view of hormones, supplementation, and athletics to essentially write in the book, and even to push his products. I was a little insulted by this. Overall, this book probably wasn't worth the money for me -- it isn't complete, and has a lot of internal deficiencies
