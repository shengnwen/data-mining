Howard Stamp was convicted of murdering his grandmother in 1970. Many people, including George Gardener, believed that Howard Stamp was railroaded. Unfortunately, Stamp commited suicide in prison, but Gardener still wants to clear his name. She enlists the help of Jonathan Hughes, an anthropologist who had previously written about Stamp. Hughes and Gardener stumble across evidence that leads them down a dangerous path towards the real killer.

This book was terrible. This was my first encounter with Minette Walters and I am not sure if I will be giving her another try. The plot was boring, the characters were flat, the first 150 pages of the book were spent on an argument between Hughes and Gardener...It was just terrible. I wish I hadn't spent my money on it, it was that poor.

I can definitely say I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless they were holding a book burning and then I would toss this one on the pile. I would give this novel 0 stars if Amazon allowed it
