This book has a lot of information in it, however it was information that I already had heard.  There are no really juicy inside stories but if you've heard nothing about the relationships of the actors then you'll like  it.  You can relive every Lucy episode and learn some of the technical  aspects of the show but chances are you know most of what is in this book.   Then again, to some, the pictures of Lucille Ball might be worth the price  anyway
