Having read the first 3 Women's Murder Club books, this fourth in the series didn't even come close to the previously set standard.  The two unrelated story lines felt gimmicky, but would've been tolerable if each of the plots had been better designed.
The court scenes needed to be better researched.  Look, I'm NOT a lawyer, but even I know that civil court is different.  And I also know enough about procedures to know you don't do any "I Object!"s during opening statements.  And by the way, can you even sue a cop for doing her job?  Don't you have to sue the city, and/or the Police Department?  And on, and on.  I don't know if James Patterson or Maxine Paetro wrote that part of the book, but his/her/their ignorance was pretty glaring.
As to the serial murders, that wasn't bad, but it felt like this story line was simply tacked on and hurriedly resolved - not very satisfying.
And finally, this wasn't a Women's Murder Club mystery.  It was a Lindsay Boxer mystery.  The other club members had cameo roles and zero participation in the crime solving
