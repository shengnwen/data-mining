While this book is billed as an introductory text, there are far better texts available (see, for example &quot;The Story of Christianity&quot; by Justo Gonsalez).  I found this book to be poorly organized, with scattered thoughts and a serious lack of detail where there should have been some (even in an introductory book).  As an added book in a collection, this book is fine, but it should not be the first overview book you buy
