I am re-reading parts of the book now, as I intend to write something on Reagan comparing Copjec with Massumi's account. Or did I say compare? there is nothing to compare, in fact. Massumi accomplishes with bravado what no psychoanalyst could ever dream of doing. and not because of a lack of intelligence.

Let me only say, I find the book to be frustratingly pretentious, symptomatically reductive and overall such a poor poor account of much more complex realities. to begin a text by quoting the famous critique of structuralism that 'structures don't walk in the streets', and then to cite favorably Lacan's offensively "academic" presentation to students who, at least for a while, we finally getting involved in something important - that in itself is such a telling start. or to say later that Decartes caused the democratic revolution, or that without him psychoanalysis would not have been possible - check your history books people!!!

I keep reading and I get more and more upset - what is this psychoanalytic disease that is spreading everywhere, I thought D&G had already killed it. apparently not. only look at Zizek's popularity these days, with all the ridiculous things he has said about Lenin (who after all is so much larger than any Lacanian psychoanalyst). Lacan should have said it to his own students: all that you want is another master...

A bad book to read, even though as good as they make them in lacanian circles these days. read some deleuze, or better guattari. that's going to take you to a different planet
