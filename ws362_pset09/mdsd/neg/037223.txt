This is a rehash of Charles Tart, Wayne Dyer, and a host of others.
Nothing at all new.  What is new is that someone can put out something the length of an article and call it a book.  And charge for the price of a book.  Just for the heck of it I let a friend read it, who hasn't read this stuff before and NO it did not turn her world inside out.  If you have never heard this stuff before it  is way to short to convince you.  If you have read it before, no need to read it again.  Many other people have said it better
