Bryson is certainly witty. But any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author's snotty and obnoxious tone. I can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits; there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self-image. What a whining, immature, mean jerk. And by the way, there's a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book.
