This book is a course requirement; otherwise it would not have been purchased.  In my opinion this is unquestionably the worst textbook I have every read.  I have read a lot of textbooks, over 60 boxes worth, both as a student and a professor.  Some have been a good read, others not.  In all of them I have found at least something worthwhile.  Not this time.  
This is the most confusing, redundant, turgid, and poorly edited book I have ever read.  There seems to be an inverse relation between the amount of text devoted to a topic and its' complexity, e.g. "percentaging (sic) a table".  The discussion, in chapter 16, on correlation and regression is without a doubt the single worst presentation on the topic I have ever seen.  Since this is the 10th edition, you would think Babbie and the publisher would have gotten it right.  They didn't.  I think a more appropriate description is a first edition repeated nine times.  
Babbie may be a fine instructor and a prominent researcher, but this is a terrible piece of babble and banality.  
I would give the book a zero if the system allowed it.
