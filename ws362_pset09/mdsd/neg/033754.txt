Most of the frugal tips in this book are really quite obvious to anyone with any financial sense.  There is nothing new or revolutionary about what the author is saying and most of her suggestions fall into the basic financial planning category.  She also repeats herself constantly.  The book could have been about half as long if she didn't rehash the same points over and over.  This is not a good book if you are serious about finding ways to save money.  The religious overtones throughout the book are a bit offensive, as well.
