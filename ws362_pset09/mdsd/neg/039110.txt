My wife and I were REALLY dissappointed in this book.  We finally gave up after the first chapter.

She rambles on and on.  She uses a lot of words and terms that the average reader won't know.  If you have ever heard her speak on TV, then you know what the book is like.  She talks fast and that is conveyed into the book.

What is really sad is that she curses in it.  For being a "Christian" she uses a lot of BAD words.

We DO NOT recommend this book at all
