I'm afraid I'm with most of the other reviewers. jPod is not up to scratch.

The plot's ludicrous (and really rather dull).

The characters are barely two-dimensional. I think the relationship between the main narrator, Ethan, and Kaitlin sums it up [SPOILER]: Early in the book Ethan lets on he's interested in Kaitlin (with no real detail). There are a few exchanges; he says "I like you" and in the next chapter they're boyfriend and girlfriend. A little later they're living together. Just like that. I'm afraid I didn't believe in a single character, so I didn't care what happened to them.

There are too many technical errors to have any tech-cred (I spotted three or four high-school-science-level stuffups and I'm no coder, so I have no idea whether the code bits are legit).

There are a few bits of clever dialogue, which are really the only redeeming features. 

And I'd so enjoyed Douglas' blog on the NY Times..
