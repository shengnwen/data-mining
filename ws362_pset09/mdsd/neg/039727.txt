There is very little information in this book regarding how to win at gin  rummy.  For example, the chapter called &quot;The Card Gods&quot;  encourages the player to mentally concentrate on the card they need so that  their opponent will give it to them; how's that for mumbo-jumbo.  Then  there is the &quot;Percentages&quot; chapter where the first sentence reads  &quot;I'm not going to bore you with a bunch of numbers showing  percentages&quot;; the obvious question is why then did the author include  a chapter on percentages?  You are better off saving your money on this  book
