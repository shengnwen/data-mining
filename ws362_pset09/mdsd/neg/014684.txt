I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food
