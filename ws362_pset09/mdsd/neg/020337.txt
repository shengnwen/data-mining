"Oh, if only America didn't exist, or at least didn't act in its own best interests" whines the Left.  "Then we'd have an international Communist utopia!"

It's not our fault that liberty, rather than totalitarianism, is the answer to the human condition.  That's just the way the world works.  

That's why so many people are willing to risk their lives, facing pirates, sharks, drowning, and being shot by their homelands' armies to get here.  And it's amazing how well they do once they arrive!  

Other countries put up walls to keep people in -- communist countries, most of which collapsed because their "democratic" economies couldn't create wealth.  We, on the other hand, live in a country that needs walls to keep people _out_.  And leftist whining about it won't change a thing
