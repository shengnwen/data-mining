Somebody get this guy an editor!  By the time I got to the end of this book if I read "You wouldn't be wrong ..." or about someone  lighting up a cigarette one more time, I was ready to throw the damn book out.  Turtledove used to be great but if this book is any indication you wouldn't be wrong if you lit this book on fire with the match you used to light your cigarette and never picked up another Turtledove book.
