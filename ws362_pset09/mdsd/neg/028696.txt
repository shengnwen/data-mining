I read this book only after my wife of 20 years took a new job and then announced she wanted a separation. (she had been reading it in the month prior; so I read it too to get a clue as to what she was thinking) Our children are devastated. This book has advised her to abandon all responsibility and do what feels good. Newage (rhymes with sewage)touchy feely claptrap as this may look benign but for every life touched in a positive way by such radical changes there are many others left to pick up the pieces. Victims. This book leaves victims in it's woo-woo touchy-feely wake. Even the most cynical "psychic advisors" such as Sylvia Browne do not give purposefully destructive advice in so cavalier a manner. 

The woman who wrote this has much to answer for. I have lost a woman I loved for 20 years. But that's not such a big deal eh Martha? My wife however (the first victim of your book) has lost much of the love and respect of her children, and is currently financially in freefall. She will no doubt land in a dependent relationship with a man who can support her as she tries so hard to follow your inane advice. 

After what she did to me I'm not having her back. You see; I read your book too. I'm on a "vision quest" of my own now. If anyone actually benefited from your book...strangely enough it looks like it will be me. Go figure.

If anyone sees their signifigant other holding this book you'd better get it away from them and try to talk some sense quick. My wife was very suggestable...and I obviously made my mistake in taking her for granted. At least I won't in my next relationship!
