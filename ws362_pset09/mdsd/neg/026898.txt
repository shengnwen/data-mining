Sorry to part company with the crowd here.
THe author's thesis -- that our "news" and ad media severely blur the distinction between Real and Unreal -- was wonderful, and I wanted to see how the author developed it. Unfortunately, after a few dozen pages, it seemed like the book was a good EXAMPLE of that thesis, and not an elucidation of it.  It reminded me of James Joyce, and while Joyce's style can be wonderful for a novel, it kind of stinks for an expository work.  My second thought is that publishers have got to stop paying people by the word.  
The author made a good and obvious point -- my only quarrel was that he could have made it more succinctly, with better support, and with less verbosity.
Oh well, enough said
