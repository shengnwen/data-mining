Some of the recipes are healthy, some are a good way to get quick sick. If it were just J.R. and his recipes and food pics, okay, but no, on the cover is a picture of two famous women who help glorify violence and who act lascivious in front of the world and on the cover. This book glorifies the WWE, and the WWE glorifies violence and sensuality. It's also an insult to women. Anyone claiming to be a Christian, do not support this book, don't be a hypocrite, "Be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect." - Jesus
