With all respect to Mr. Hawking - this book should never been published. I'm not blaming him, but all others who are responsible it went to market.

Let me explain a little bit

Most of buyers of this book, are buying based on Hawking reputation from "Brief history of time" (which is excellent book).
What we have here - pictures which doesn't have any relation with text (at least not valuable and are far to big - taking space in other words, you'll not buy book of 60 pages for 35 USD), changing from one subject to another, explaining the basic things somebody who is reading such a book should already know (spin - 2 pages) and then jumping to complicated things (M-theory - mentioned in 1 row) without explanation. Some jokes and comments I don't understand.

I bought this book 6 months age and came to approx 1/3 of book (poker between Hawking, Newton and I think Einstein). I didn't have nerves to read more ... this is first book in my life I didn't finish.

I never thought I'll write review, especially not like this and especially not for book of Mr. Hawking, but I felt cheated. There are so many other excellent books on same thematic, try them, forget this one.

But anyway, my 3 year old son was extremely happy by disintegrating this book to more then 1000 small pages ... lucky him.
