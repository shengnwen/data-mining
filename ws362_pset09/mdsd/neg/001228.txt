Ms Morrison truely puts the Craft back in Witchraft. She has a peculiar style here that I keep missing out on. I really wished the editor/publisher would give someone else a chance at this great holiday. 

The historical inaccuracies were unforgivable to say the least. There are many other qualified authors out there to present this teaching when light is needed most. All I find here is more confused darkness. Utter rubbish!
