I cannot begin to tell you the disappointment I felt upon completing this  book. Expecting another Kinsella masterpiece, I was disappointed, to say  the least. The book was just overly repetitive and the plot was horrible.  While the IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY kept me interested, BOX SOCIALS had me  wishing it was finished already. If I read about hot-blooded girls and the  Little American Soldier one more time, I think I was going to go postal.  Mr. Kinsella, will you refund the cover price for me?? And if this is the  best you can do, it's about time to head out to pasture
