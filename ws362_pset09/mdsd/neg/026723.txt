Do not buy this book.. The information was very repetetive and worthless. The main advice in this book was to get a group of manufacturing, marketing, and patenting &quot;experts&quot; that would guide you through the whole process of product development ..!! The whole book keeps referring to these &quot;experts&quot; numerous times in almost all the chapters. I also didn't like the side quotes found on each page. They were distracting and offered no real useful information
