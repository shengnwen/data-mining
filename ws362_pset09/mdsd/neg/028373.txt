After reading so many chick books, I was really expecting something really good out of Carole Matthews, unfortunately I didn't. I thought she put way too much detail into everything, which seemed to drag everything too much. I got bored of all the detail, ad it didn't seem like she was focused on the story. There were no twist to this story it was just plain. I wouldn't recommend this book, and not to mention the last page was the worst.. Bad ending, bad book, period
