Other reviewers have said it, but it bears repeating.  The book really doesn't answer How Good Teams Become Great Ones.  Rather it's a list of TRENDS that good teams have in common and a series of essays about those teams, some of their players, and a number of recent statistical principles.

Much of the analysis is pretty poor and contradictory.  Perry writes that ERA isn't a good measure of pitcher performance then repeatedly talks about pitchers' ERAs and their ERAs relative to league average. Why bother once you show that ERA is flawed?

I really like the statistical analysis of baseball and have read and enjoyed a number of books in this vein.  If you want something along those lines, read the Baseball Prospectus or Hardball Times Annual.  If you want good reading on interesting baseball questions backed up by numerical analysis, read Baseball Between the Numbers.  And if you want to find out how to go from Good to Great, read Jim Collins book;  it's about business not baseball but it has better scientific analysis and actually covers how "teams" IMPROVE over time
