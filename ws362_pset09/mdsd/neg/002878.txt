A big portion of this book is literally a cut and paste version of eagle manual and screen snapshots. If you have slightly ECE and chemistry background, you will find this is an almost useless book. I give it one star because this book collected some useful URLs. However, you can always find those links through online search engines. Don't waste your money on it.

In addition, the preface of this book contains some inappropriete politics story that ruins a technical title.
