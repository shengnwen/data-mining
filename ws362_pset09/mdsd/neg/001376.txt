R917L@aol.com aus Köln, Deutschland   Good beginning--but the plot falls apart Vienna Blood begins very promisingly, with rich description and an  intriguing premise, but the plot disintegrates in the last third. Vienna Blood ultimately fails to live up to its initial promise, as an intriguing premise falls apart in the later stages of the story, leaving a lot of potential unrealized. Instead of questioning the morality of genetic and racial engineering, Mathews plumps for a pat ending where, suddenly, every villian turns out to be not so bad after all, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste lingering with the obligatory happy end that seems to endorse the very premise the author purports to attack. Given a re-write or two, this might have been a brilliant book, but, as it is, it seems to be a near-miss at best
