I am having to use this book for an Accounting Grad class and it is perhaps one of the worst txt books I have ever laid my eyes on!  Wordy doesn't begin to describe how bad this book is, did this go through an editor or straight to press?  It just goes on and on and on throwing in examples that come later in the chapter, the examples are poor never follwing a simple path, and the questions at the end of each section are as bad as the book.  This book reminds me of someone who decides to teach you something off of the top of their head, they didn't bother to make any notes or set a goal for how they wanted to approach the subject.  Avoid at all costs!!
