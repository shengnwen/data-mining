I was very disappointed by this novel. Roth is a talented writer, and I had hoped that he would be able to create a truly compelling novel out of such a promising idea. However, the novel just didn't work for me. The characters felt something like cardboard cut outs and seemed inconsistent in their behavior. The plot spun out of control and became completely fantastic and quite unbelievable. Read something else by Roth - I think you'll enjoy one of his earlier works more than this
