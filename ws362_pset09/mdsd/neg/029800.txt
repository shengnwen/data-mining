Probably not a good book for anyone interested in greenhouse gardening in the Northern US or Canada. The book dwells mainly on the use of unheated greenhouses during the season when northern gardeners would have their plants outside. Nothing about over winter greenhouse use (snow, subzero temps).  However, if you are interested in how someone in the UK utilizes their greenhouse, then this is the book for you.
