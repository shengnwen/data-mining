I found this timetable difficult to use.  When the description called it encyclopedic they must have been talking about its size and weight. One might find it informative to just thumb thru and see what was happening in different areas of the world at different time.  But to use the book to trace a particular development (like "movable type," or "domesticated dairy animals,") or to compare progressive periods of history between civilizations (like Central and South America, China, or Egypt) is awkward with lots of bookmarks and notes.
