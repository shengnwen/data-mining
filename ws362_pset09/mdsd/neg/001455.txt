Oh man... this book was absolutely terrible. I was expecting to learn a little bit about the lives of homeless people-- you know-- all of the suffering that they endure etc., etc. Instead, what you get here is a story about a homeless man and how he works for a newspaper. He goes on and on discussing his position at the newspaper and never really elaborates on anything else. At first, I couldn't put the book down. I was patiently waiting for some intriguing stories about life as a homeless man. Then I decided to put the book down about 3/4 of the way through. I gave up. Boring, boring, boring. This book will cure anyone's insomnia-- it put me to sleep- that's for sure. ZZZzzzzzz....
