I bought this book based on the good reviews, but after reading it myself it's not worth the money.  The activities she comes up with are too simple- fingerpaint or play ball. I thought of them on my own!! I was hoping for ideas that were not so obvious. She also has alot of ideas that use toothpicks?! not a toddler friendly item!!
