Ok, well maybe I'm a cookbook snob, but I couldn't fathom some of these &quot;recipes&quot;. Baked Brie?  I mean come on... who needs a recipe to put a wheel of Brie into the oven??  Or putting sausage in the oven with mustard slathered all over it, or rolling up some chicken and mustard in a lettuce leaf.  These are more IDEAS but RECIPES???  I will admit to loving Bon Appetit and Jacques and Julia, so you'll need to relate there to get me.  Plus, most of their recipes call for &quot;teriyaki sauce&quot;???  It's like my grandma making hundreds of recipe that call for Mrs. Dash.  What do they mean &quot;teriyaki sauce&quot;?  If they really mean that , it has sugar or corn syrup in it.  If not, is this meaning soy sauce?  If so, why is it in EVERYTHING???  I love low carb food, but this cookbook did not help me come to that love
