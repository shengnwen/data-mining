This book could have been an interesting novel, but that's about it. Way too many inconsistencies...like the carbon monoxide incident. Yes, carbon monoxide is an odorless gas, but the exhaust of a "Briggs and Stratton" engine is far from odorless. The fact that his daughter suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning and was rushed to the hospital, (her lips were blue), yet the firemen allowed the rest of them to remain in the house while they "aired" it out. Six hours later (after being delayed from the hospital for an hour and a half) David went to pick up his wife and daughter...YEAH RIGHT!!! As a diesel mechanic I know all too well the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning...it takes a long time to get over it.
His whole mission was to reveal remote viewing to "save mankind", and can now be learned from him at $1,200 a class. What a humanitarian!!!
Also his mentor and good friend, Mel Riley, is working with Lyn Buchanan instead of Mr. Morehouse. In this book 5 + 5 = 12.
