This dreadful anthology was once the standard English edition of Plato.  I  had to assign it when I taught courses on Plato because there was nothing  else.  Many of the translations are bad.  Even the decent ones often are  quite old, and their flowery Victorian diction is off-putting.  The  collection isn't complete, as it leaves out a number of important dialogues  from the Platonic corpus.  And the introductions are uniformly ghastly; the  editors have little understnding of philosophy, and keep saying horrible  things like &quot;There's a lot of boring logic-chopping in this dialogue,  but at least the personality of Socrates is engaging.&quot;      There is  no longer any need to be subject to the tyranny of Hamilton &amp; Cairns!   There is now a far better edition, with excellent introductions, excellent  translations, and including all the dialogues.  It's the COMPLETE WORKS  from Hackett Pub., edited by John Cooper.  It will be the standard edition  from now on.  Go get that one!  Don't get this one
