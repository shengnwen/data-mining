I am a professional artist, and figure drawing is a favorite subject. I have collected many 'how-to" books on figure drawing over the years, and, therefore, have seen many systems of innovative anatomical figure construction. With that said, I must say that Muscles In Motion is a disappointment.
Although there are some quite good individual drawings by the author,Glenn Fabry,the vast majority of the book is drawings from photographs of female bodybuilders in posing or exercise routines. Fabry draws well, but his approach shows little to no
insight into the constructive nature of the figure, which I see as the main reason for purchasing a 'how-to" book on this subject in the first place. Also, I find it strange that the author has used, almost exclusively, female bodybuilders as his prime models for this subject. Yes, men and women do have the same basic muscular system, with the skeletal structure accounting for the greater differences. However, in a treatise on the human muscular system in motion, I feel that using a more traditional approach with the male physique as the primary example would be more appropriate for the subject, while using to a lesser degree,female examples to show the similarities.The female form is absolutely beautiful, but using drawings of the female form in its muscular extreme to illustrate muscular motion in general, I find quite atypical for the subject matter.Had I been able to see an excerpt from this book first, I would not have been interested.
