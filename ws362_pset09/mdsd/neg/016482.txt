I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me
