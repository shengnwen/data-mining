This book is a laugh a minute, mainly because of the author's total inattention to detail.  His 'German' is appalling, the plot a farce (including a dead mobile phone suddenly springing into life) and as for 'villages' in Australia being destroyed - that is the worst because we DO NOT have any villages in this country.  Large and small towns, yes, but no villages.  As for the two boring heroines beating the best hitmen ever ... oh well.  Some people might like it.
