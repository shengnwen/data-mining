Expecting a more humor-oriented book, I picked this up for a friend of mine who has a Japanese girlfriend.  We shared a laugh at the title, but the next time we crossed paths, he told me that he simply could not finish reading.

I decided to complete the book myself, and much to my chagrin, I found that it was more about the average white "loser" foreigner who goes crazy in Japan playing off Japanese misconceptions of white men.  He then simulteously manages to shamefully depict the current status of Japanese culture and further objectify the Japanese people as static, monolithic entity, which I personally find offensive.  Furthermore, in his tiring, sarcastic style he tries at times to elicit sympathy from the reader, but fails utterly, drowned by his own exploded ego.

His exploits as an unqualified, cynical, semi-pedophiliac English teacher will be sure to make any educated or well-traveled reader livid.

Pick up Edward Said's Orientalism or even Sheridan Prasso's The Asian Mystique (which is a little lighter) instead unless you, like the author, are also an uneducated, immature white male who has had little or no success with women
