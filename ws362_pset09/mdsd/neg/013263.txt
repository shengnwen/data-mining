I'll give this book a well deserved 2 stars for showing the identical patterns of a passive-agressive man. They make it all your fault, and refuse to take responsibility for their own words or actions, everything is blamed on you, their stories are twisted with convenient amnesia over events that happened, and you begin to wonder if you are losing your mind, or if there is something wrong that YOU did!

NO, there is nothing wrong with YOU, and the part of this book that is completely missing is how to GET AWAY from a PA man, rather, it tells you to stay with it. Sure, just hang in there and go insane! No Way! I lived this issue, "accomodating" the other person, forgiving, allowing it all to go over my head, only to find myself feeling like I was going insane!

I recommend this book to see the signs if perhaps you are a parent, or a relative, but there is nothing you can do to heal a PA, they have to get professional help and heal themselves!

It's NOT your job to "hang in there" as this book suggests. It is your job to get out of the relationship to save whatever sanity you might have left! 

There are other books out there that can help you with finding the courage to see it all, and positively do something about it, just read my reviews for that. 

You can see the signs, and when you do, don't waste another moment of your life only to make yourself feel even worse day after day, get out of the relationship and give yourself the permission to make the fresh start that you deserve!
