This is another wooden, easily solved Krentz book.  What has happened to the author who wrote such classics as Absolutely, Positively or Trust Me?  These last few years have been nothing but one formulaic, clunky novel after another, with tiresome characters and easily-predicted plotlines.  I want the excitement and energy of her ealier novels, not some rehashed pulp with her name attached to boost sales.  I hate to say it, but I think I'm about ready to stop reading Krentz and look elsewhere for my romance jollies.  Don't waste your time with this book--go back and read some of her stuff from the nineties & see what a really well-written, exciting, and romantic novel can be like when it's done as well as Ms. Krentz can do
