I mistakenly read Falling Liberty before any of the other Ana Pigeon series. This one is poor example of Barr's skill and story telling finesse. She tosses out several over-ripe cliches that made me cringe in agony. Luckily, my wife persisted I read Track of the Cat and now I'm almost through the series.

This one is regrettable
