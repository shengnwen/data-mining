The book is good, but $130 dollars!!!!  You still need to buy a 3 ring binder to put the sheets in, it's not even a paperback, meaning the publisher didn't even spend the money for binding. Who owns this company, Shell?  Exxon?  Enron?!?  There are other accounting books for a fraction of the cost, but the organized crime (my community college) requires this particular one.  I wonder what their incentive might be??
