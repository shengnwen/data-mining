Rice tries to pull all the lose ends together in the third book of her Beauty Trilogy but she honestly seems out of steam and spankings. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they have read the other two books in the trilogy. Beauty and Tristan are kidnapped by a Sultan and his court, but the sexual games remain much the same with spanking as the primary focus of obedience and submission. The sex scenes remain repetitive and thus border on boring. Even after three books, Beauty remains very one dimensional, almost mentally retarded. There really is no plot, only situations for sexual encounters. The ending, where Beauty and Tristan are finally joined as husband and wife, King and Queen, is extremely weak and contrived. This series is the weakest product produced by Anne Rice. She should have trusted her characters to have some internal growth and change, some intelligence.
