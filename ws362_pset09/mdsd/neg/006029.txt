Maybe i'm not as cultured as some of the people who rated this book, but i have read the likes of Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott and i think it is safe for this to be a true review. Please, please don't put yourself through the torment of reading this book, it is probably the worst book i have ever read. It goes on and on about the littlest of details which don't have anything to do with the book. I read this when i was 11 and it is safe to say i wasn't too immature to read it. Everyone in my class read it and i'm pretty sure we all had the same opinions, it really sucked. I would tell you the worst part of the book, but that would ruin the story. But let me just tell you a little tip, don't read it. Don't read it, don't read it, don't read it. I tried to read it again last year and i couldn't put myself through the pain and torment of reading the worlds worst book. Don't waste your money or waste a part of your life reading a book about nothing
