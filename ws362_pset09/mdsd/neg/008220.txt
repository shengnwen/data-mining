I was very excited when I read the title for this book and ordered it. Upon its arrival I read through the whole thing in about 20 minutes and was very disappointed. Her "tips" for texture techniques will work only if you are what I would call a very loose artist with no desire for detail or realism. Most of her examples look like she used a set of crayolas to paint them. I would not recommend this book to anyone except maybe an absolute beginner
