Stephen King does some great works.  I loved Hearts In Atlantis, and was rivetted with The Shining.  But the pressure from the publisher to put out paper pulp has finally caught up with Mr. King.  This had to be one of the most boring novels I've read in years.  The only reason I finished was because my wife bought the book for me as a gift.  I HAD to read the book.

The extraterrestial Buick serves as a conduit to another world.  It's an intriguing start to what could be a great plot.  But somewhere in the middle of the book, this car starts spitting out alien organisms from another world.  And while the first creature was kind of original, I found the 9th and 10th creature to be strikingly like the first.  And not wanting to miss the punchline, I kept wading through these gruesome descriptions that were just page after page of the same old thing.  OKAY ALREADY, I got the picture!  Let's get on with the story!!!
It might have worked as a short story.  But then, who would pay $30 bucks for a 36 page short story?  I think King will wish that he hadn't released this one, because it will be many readers last purchase from the King genre.
If you insist that you are a Stephen King fan, just be sure to buy the paperback version to limit your investment.  Don't check it out from the library, because it will take you so long for finish the darn thing, the late fines will kill you.
