This book is hard to find things in and doesn't seem extremely well-organized. Besides that, it's annoying because it looks like it was done on an old school typewriter. I thought I'd need it because I need to write a lot of papers for my classes, but it turns out I can just look in the journals I'm using for the citation style for the most part.
