Nothing in Nazneen's life has ever been under her control.  Even her birth itself was left to fate: she seemed to be stillborn but then she finally took her first breath and fate allowed her to live.  This story was told to her throughout her childhood in Bangladesh, and she learned that it was futile to fight against fate.  When her father announces that she, at eighteen, is to go to London to marry a forty-year-old man named Chanu, Nazneen doesn't argue.

London is lonely.  Nazneen doesn't speak English, is discouraged from making many friends and can't really relate to her husband, a selfish and pompous man who seems to think himself overly kind because he doesn't beat his wife.  She tries being passive and going along with her life.  Then she tries rebelling in small ways but is frustrated when Chanu doesn't seem to notice she's neglected her housekeeping duties.  It is only when Nazneen and Chanu's baby boy is in the hospital that Nazneen begins to appreciate her husband's good qualities and she also experiences some moments of pure happiness.

Throughout the next twenty years or so, though, Nazneen is unable to hold onto that happiness.  It is only when she finds out that her husband finally has taken steps to put into action one of his long-discussed plans that she is spurred to action.

This book, for me, was one long and depressing chore to read.  Nazneen allowed herself to be a slave to her fate, but the entire book was a detailed list of all of the ways in which her life was completely unbearable.  I found it agonizing to read about someone who was so thoroughly unhappy all of the time, and it made me anxious to read about the ways in which Chanu continued to mess up the lives of Nazneen and their children.  The book had an uplifting ending, but it was so abrupt that it seemed unrealistic and jarring, instead of the relief it should have been.
