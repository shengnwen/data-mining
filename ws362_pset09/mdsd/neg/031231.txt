O'reilly has a grudge against CBS and Dan Rather. After, GI -Joeing it, standing eye-to-eye with the "bad guys" in El Salvador and Argentina, he gets no airplay. Then  with moral righteousness, he goes to a gay vacation place in Provincetown, convinced a "showdown"  was in the making between gays and het families. He gets no airplay. Too bad. Good for CBS. 
O'Reilly's "morality" is psycho anachronistic. (e.g. Hollywood directors & celebrities, unless you look like Halle Berry.)Does a Johnny Depp movie really have to have a *moral* message? 
He glosses over social and racial issues, and suggests that Al Sharpton, Susan Sarandon and Puff Daddy are misguided &/or dangerous,dishonest rabble rousers. Aside from the Tawana Brawley debacle, I'd have to disagree.
The tone is turgid. The writing, junior high. The book is arranged so that O'Reilly always gets the last word after each interview--which is kind of sad-- especially when he interviews his intellectual superiors, like Mario Cuomo. Bill can't play a game without fixing the odds in his favor. 
He fantasizes about Hilary Clinton & that's even sadder: "Each night while lying in bed I visualize the interview. At last we are together in the Zone. Her pansuit is peach, her hair is perfect. . ." He tells the reader he has this dream over & over . . .(Quick someone notify the secret service!) 
He dares to invoke Jefferson in one sentence, and then decry "secularists" in another. He reacts violently when he thinks someone is not telling the truth, but he doesn't even give credit to his cowriters, or even acknowledge what's shady an dishonest about himself.
