This book is full of a lot of great scientific information, however the author's real purpose is to fudge both science and the Bible so that it appears they are one in the same. The author says in the first chapter that he will not try to fudge the Bible so it fits with science yet that's all he does throughout the entire book. His connections are unlikely to convince the average intelligent reader. But don't take my word for it, if you chose to read this book then try this: After every conclusion he makes about the Bible and Science ask yourself 'Does this evidence support the idea that the Bible is true, or is it merely a way of reading the Bible so that it loosely fits scientific fact'
