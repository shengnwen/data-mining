Curiously, though the event has rated an HBO documentary, a made-for-TV movie, and a full-blown theatrical retelling, the complete story of the "Miracle on Ice" has never been put between covers in a real, live book (as opposed to a tome of the "instant paperback" variety).  Unfortunately, it still hasn't.  Coffey does a good enough job of telling the only story that people seem to care about anymore - the February 22, 1980, shocker that the U.S. hockey team pulled off against the unbeatable Soviets - but he reproduces each and every hockey movement of the game to such an excruciating degree that it's all the harder to forgive him for paying scant attention to the rest of the games that the Americans played to cop the gold.  The interstitital mini-biographies of the various players and Coach Herb Brooks (whose 2003 funeral following a fatal car crash serves as the book's curtain-raiser) break the game narrative up to the point that the book is a bit confusing to read.  It's an OK effort, but "Do You Believe in Miracles?" (the HBO documentary) and "Miracle" (the Disney feature flick) remain the best reminiscences of this epochal moment in sports history
