This very detailed history suffers from several omissions:
1.  While describing complicated military maneuvers, there are no maps to enable the reader to follow what is happening.
2.  There are no notes to the text despite numerous references to obscure events.
3.  The author seems obsessed with his own erudtion, leaving the reader to flounder amongst the excessive and superfluous details
