While the mere availability of this text in english is certainly extraordinary and invaluable, the translation and writing will obstruct some of its benefit for most readers.  The author's reliance on latin terminology, as well as an unwillingness to use conventional and/or literal tranlations of sanskrit and tibetan terms, makes this a difficult read. I would never describe this book as &quot;readable&quot;- just the opposite.  As noted in other reviews, there is a wealth of information in the chapters leading up to the translation, but they suffer from the same faults. While I am grateful to Dr. Pettit for publishing this work, I look forward to the release of a new translation
