Pierre Bourdieu is a tremendous intellect, and has produced far superior  work to this book.  _Distinction_ is a fascinating book, particularly for  those interested in French society.  Yet its relevance cannot really extend  to America, which has a markedly different system of class.  The French  have deeply entrenched class consciousness, in both a pragmatic sense and a  Marxist sense, whereas 90% of Americans consider themselves &quot;middle  class.&quot;   	Bourdieu shows that the French are at pains to  symbolically express their class differences, and he does so with aplomb.   He compiles statistics and data which show ways in which the French produce  their own class position through consumption, education, and taste.   	      But his observations are less applicable to the vast American  &quot;middle class.&quot;  Class mobility, education, and stylistic  expression are much more democratically distributed in America.  So while  many French are content with their class position, vocation, and  traditions, most Americans see themselves as &quot;middle class,&quot;  striving for better, and free from tradition.   	    _Distinction_ is  an interesting and accesible book, but those looking for Bourdieu's  contributions to social theory will be better served by some of his other  works
