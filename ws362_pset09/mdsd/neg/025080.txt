After hearing so much about the book, I must admit to a disappointment in its contents.  As a Belgian that has immigrated to the USA, I am well familiar with the many contrasts between Europe and the US and found Mr. Reid's observations to be lacking both in perspective and completeness.  For example, Mr Reid appears enamored with the European welfare state, vaunts its many virtues and describes it as a central pillar of the new "European identity" that is superior to the barbarous American model, but admits in small print in its Appendix that the European welfare state faces a crisis that far surpasses the US social security system in magnitude and will not survive in its present form.  I felt that a fair discussion on the topic should have included a discussion on the countless challenges to the welfare state. 
I thought that many of his other observations lacked the same kind of roundness.

I felt that the book lack depths and was primarily suitable to a reader in search of a caricature on the relationship between Europe and America.
