The book COOKING ON A STICK is an intriguing title and may hint at being a simple book - but it's not.  The recipes call for a can of non-stick cooking spray along with perishable foods such as hotdogs, fruit, eggs, etc.  The recipe ideas are only suitable if one is camping next to a grocery store!  There is even a recipe which suggests you let your child make a necklace out of dried fruit and cereal and that the child wear it around their neck for snack food.  If you're trying to attract a bear this might be a great idea.  

I would not recommend this book for anything but the backyard camper.  It is also not written at a level that your kids can read the recipes themselves, although the pictures suggest it is a children's book
