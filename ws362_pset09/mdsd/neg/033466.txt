This is one of the few instances that I have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself.  This is a contrived work through and through, and one can understand why Bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie.  Moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm-chair psychology that is truly laughable....and this is probably his best novel
