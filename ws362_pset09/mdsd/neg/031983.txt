A nice enough book, as a book to read before you read a practical book about renovating your home. The anecdotes are interesting to read, but I came away from the book with little to go on for my own upcoming renovation. This is not a book I highlighted, or where I turned corners down. A much better book, with practical help in the renovation process, is "What the Experts May Not Tell You about Building or Renovating Your Home". Similar titles, but while "What No One Ever Tells You" is full of anecdotes, "What the Experts May Not Tell You" is full of concrete and practical, step by step processes for handling renovation as an owner, including insights into relationships between the parties (owner, contractor, architect, inspectors, lenders, etc.)
