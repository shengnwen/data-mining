Let me preface this by saying I picked up a "Dark" series book a few years ago, as I'd heard of the author, and I do love the paranormal genre.  It was garbage.  I accidently picked up "Oceans of Fire" recently, realized who wrote it, but read it anyway, and found it above par. So, desperate for a read, skimming the stacks at the bookstore, I picked up Dark Magic.

Big mistake.  Again-garbage.

The female lead creeps me out-The classic romance 'feisty but with nothing to back it up "Don't tell me what to do, you are not the boss of me," type- then two minutes later is meek passive chick. Bah.  "I want to live my own life, leave me alone.....oh, dear you are so strong and manly, I cannot resist you!"   I am not quoting the book...just giving a feel of the dialogue.  Why do author's think a female lead that can manage to say no once or twice, or has an occasional clever retort, but actually has no backbone, is appealing?

This type of behavior went on and on and on......until, of course, the conditioning sets in, and the female lead gives up.

The male lead is the classic semi abusive control freak slash father figure who basically rapes the female lead, tells her what to do because it is for her own good, and she of course, falls right in line.

Why in hades do women readers like these type of male leads?

I absolutely loathe both of these kind of male and female characters.

The bad guys were kinda of lame, and so was the big battle against the baddy.

Save your money.  Since the Anita Blake series hit the skids about three books past, I'm starving for a good vampy paranormal. After reading this, I'm kinda barfy.
