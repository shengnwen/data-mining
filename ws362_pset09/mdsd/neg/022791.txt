An poorly written portrayal of life on Oahu involving a 17 year old gay, conflicted surfer and his neurotic, obsessive 16 year old hopeful friend (?), this book drags us into the terminally boring life of teenage Oahu.  Full of shallow character development, cliches, plus narrative and dialogue that is painful, this book deserves the bottom of the the gay adolescent book pile.  For those teenagers that resonate with this book and its characters, take a very hard look in the mirror.  If this is life, God, any God, help us all.
