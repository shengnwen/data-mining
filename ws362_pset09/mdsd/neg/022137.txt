The other readers pegged it nicely: this book is self-loathing and superior. I read this when I was fourteen and, fourteen years later, found myself rereading it when I cleaned out my closet. I can't believe the arrogance and myopia of its WASP narrator. This book is internalized homophobia coupled with upper middle class snobbery at its worst. No doubt if the author was born in Nazi Germany sixty years ago, he would be Hitler's right hand man in his pink triangle quest to oppress homosexuals, or at least, those too limp wristed and "icky" for Andrew Tobias' liking. I'm aghast other readers are recommending his book for those coming out of the closet.
