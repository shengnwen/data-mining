I happened upon this book because a friend of mine suggested a book called "Motherless Daughters". This book came up in the search and I thought a workbook would be a great idea. What the description does not tell you is that this book is targeted solely to women that lost their mothers when they were children or teens. It is not geared towards women that lost their mothers as adults. In the forward, Gail Eisenberg states she responded to an add that specifically wanted women who lost their mothers during childhood and adolescence for this book. In chapter 2 the book states whether you were a young child or a college student..."  This book may be great for women who lost mothers during childhood or adolescence but it does not address nor is it designed to address the needs of women like myself who lost mothers after our 20's - adult women . If you lost your mother when you were an adult, this book was not intended for you. The authors or amazon probably should have noted that somewhere for grieving women in seek of help
