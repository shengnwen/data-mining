I find it interesting that the author would make such a wonderful effort to help children, after having murdered parents. I wonder if he sent autographed free copies to the children of the people he murdered. 

I also find it interesting, that in over 20 years on death row, he was only able to write a handful of "children's books". 

That these books would find their way into our public school systems, where this man takes on the role of Martyr and Folk Hero, speaks volumes about our schools.

The book is as shallow as the man who wrote it
