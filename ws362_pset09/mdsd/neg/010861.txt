I get the feeling this could be one of those books people look back on 5-10 years from now and ask "Did we actually think this was the direction technology was going?" It's always risky writing about the future of technology, so credit to the author for giving it a try. I'm just cautious of academic-type books that consistently have to invent words to make their point (e.g. findability, everyware, wayfinding). The book is written well and interesting in parts (hence no 1 star rating), but not nearly as interesting or useful as the author's Information Architecture book (hence no 3+ rating)
