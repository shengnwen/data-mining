I love biographies of historical figures but this one was a disappointment from the beginning...and a plodding read, to boot.

All it really manages to confirm is that politics is a dirty business and that corruption & deception are part and parcel of it all.  The more things change, unfortunately, the more they stay the same.

As for Mrs. Wilson, she wouldn't be the only First Lady in history who was more of a WIFE than a politician
