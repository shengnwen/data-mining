This is another book that implies it's for power users, yet most of what's in here can be found in any garden variety book on how to run Linux.  Only part of this book is aimed at "geeks". 

The promotional text on the back cover implies that it's aimed at sysadmins. And while *some* of it is, most of it is stuff that a system administrator would already be familiar with.

Much of what's in this book is the same stuff aimed at beginning to intermediate Linux desktop users.  It's not for real "geeks" or sysadmins by any means.

If only the truly useful stuff for sysadmins/geeks were included, the book would be 1/3 it's size.

It's not that it's a bad book; it's just not marketed well at all and has a very misleading title.

I found it a complete waste of money.  It's hard to find books for "intermediate to advanced" users. I figured this would be one of them. It's not.

I was quite disappointed
