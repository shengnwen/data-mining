If you are looking for a sweet love story, I think this is a decent book. The typos are annoying and do detract some from the story some, but its forgivable. I think the best audience for it is teenage boys.

If you are looking for a realistic story though, do not get this book. It is fluffy and totally unrealistic. It is also very repetetive and states the obvious. I had to skim through a few sections because it was just saying the same thing over and over again.

So it really depends on what you want. If want a light cute love story get it. But if you want something real and deep, DO NOT READ.
