The title is eye-catching and the synopsis promised somerealistic suggestions for getting ahead in the land of the glassceiling.  What I found, however, was an insipid piece of writing which offers nothing more than an ego boost for the author.  Her "aren't I witty?" approach is tedious, at best.  Unfortunately, books such as this are part of the problem.  No woman will be taken seriously if she follows this tripe as the way up the career ladder
