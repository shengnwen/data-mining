I had three problems with this particular entry to the Buffyverse:
1. It's short. 193 pages in large print, so you really aren't getting your money's worth.  It's a novella at best.
2. The author doesn't capture the voice of the characters nearly as well as some of the other contributors, and some items are just wrong (e.g., especially in this Season 3 chronology,  Buffy doesn't drive.) The dialogue is lame, with Buffy occasionally sounding like Giles, Anya never sounding like Anya, and a villian that doesn't even acheive the insightful repartee of your cheesy comic book. Try Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder for far superior characterizations and voices that "get" the Buffy tone.
3. The story, which had potential in theory, is just plain lame in execution. The characters do stupid things, the conclusion is artificial, and you are left with the thought that these people are no better than the various teenagers offed in any B grade horror flick. Don't waste your money.
