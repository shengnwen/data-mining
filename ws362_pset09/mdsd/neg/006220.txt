Loved the show.  Hate the book.  I bought this to read on the plane during a recent trip because it had short passages that could be read seperately and still be enjoyed.

However, I didn't find most of them funny, even when I imagined him on stage telling them.  I don't recommend this book but suggest the DVD's of the show instead
