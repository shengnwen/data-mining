This was originally a fabulous 4-color printed book, but, it has been reprinted with very poor quality black & white photocopy looking pages. I contacted the "publisher" who basically said tough luck, this is business, and this is how we make our money. Buy it used!!! Because as you may have figured out, an art education book with low quality black and white examples is worth it's weight in beans
