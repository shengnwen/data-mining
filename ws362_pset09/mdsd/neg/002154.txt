I've read other titles by Carlton Smith and have enjoyed most of them. However, "Reckless" is by far the worst book I've read in quite some time. In fact, I had to force myself to finish it.
One is led to believe by the back cover of the book that the story is about the murder of Lana Clarkson. Don't be misled. It really isn't about Lana Clarkson at all. It's almost entirely about Phil Spector and his life as a record producer. Smith quotes heavily from two other books in this story. It's almost as if he wrote a repeat of what has already been written before by someone else. Save your time and money
