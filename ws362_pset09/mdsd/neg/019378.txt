I read this (after reading Karen Hancock's Christy Award-winning series Legends of the Guardian-King) and enjoyed it at first. After reading the second book, DragonQuest, I realized that these books were influencing me wrongly. The wizardry is cloaked in Christianity, so it makes it seem ok at first. But once I'd read the second book, I saw that where it was going was somewhere I didn't want to go.

I would recommend many other books before recommending this book
