In fourth grade we were read this book by our teacher, after lunch (!) for about 2 weeks. I really think this had everything to do with my now phobia of worms, which sounds stupid and a little crazy but believe me not a mild problem when it rains. Thanks, Thomas Rockwell and Miss Maroon, the nightmares continue!

(I gave it one star reluctantly because the review wouldn't post with no stars selected)
