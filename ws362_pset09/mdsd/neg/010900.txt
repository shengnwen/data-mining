In the Urban Crucible, Nash attempts to demonstrate that the American Revolution was a duel revolution against England and the traditional ruling  classes. He shows how the economic effects of the boom and bust cycles  following the various wars of the 18th century affected the colonies,  specifically the port cities. The result of these increasingly disruptive  economic cycles--especially after the French and Indian War--caused the  colonists in the port cities to rebel against England and the American  elites because of economic concerns. However, Nash offers very little  evidence that socioeconomics was indeed the main motivation for revolution, and he offers no evidence that class warfare really existed
