Having read many different variations of these books, it is my humble opinion that this particular edition tends to treat the reader as a layman, rather than as a pilot, or at least someone versed in the aviation lingo. The author also includes unhealthy doses of vulgarity in the transcripts, which does occur in cockpits from time to time, but I wouldn't want the pilot's next of kin to know their loved-one's 'salty' mode of speech is being read by total strangers. There are better, more informational offerings of this type. "Aftermath", published by the editors of Flying Magazine, is a good example. "Air Disasters" by Stanley Stewart is a very thorough, technically precise treatise on several major aircraft accidents. Mr. Stewart is an actual aircraft accident investigator, and his personal knowledge of the field greatly enhances the accuracy of his published mishap investigations and findings. "Black Box" is entertaining, and the inclusion of the Space Shuttle Challenger voice transcripts is a welcome addition to the considerable list of entries. Nevertheless, the salient theme of this volume is to relate aviation data to the non-flying public.
