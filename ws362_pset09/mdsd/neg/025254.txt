First, I'll preface this review in stating that I'm reviewing the abridged audio version of this book.  I avoid abridged versions of any book, but this one was given me by a friend to read.

As the story unfolded in the beginning it was quite interesting.  After awhile though the story line became quite predictable.  Consistancy was lacking in the leading characters.  Their personalities and responses were modified to fit, what seemed to be, a greatly contrived and simplistic story line.  After getting two-thirds through the book my interest was no longer in what happened to the characters, but whether my theories on what will happen was correct.

Most people seemed to really like the book and again I can only relate to the heavily abridged CD version.  I suspect that so much was chopped out of the story that the summary of events not told gave too many clues to future events.  Stay away from abridgements because even if a story is good, they will most often disappoint!
