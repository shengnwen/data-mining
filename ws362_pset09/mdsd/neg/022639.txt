I enjoyed this book and very much "empathized" with the subject matter, but was so surprized when the book just ended and I had not really learned much about further strategies in dealing with empathetic ability. I was amazed that flower essences were the first strategy given by this professional, but still trying to keep an open mind. I was quite annoyed the book just ended and now I will need to search more for more advanced handling of this topic. I would suggest that anyone who reads the book, identifies with this trait, has to remember that this ability is a great gift. The best strategy I have found to accept, live with and really enjoy this ability, is to spend alot of time and effort in increasing your spiritual identities (NOT RELIGIOUS !!!). Spirituality is YOUR relationship with God, and Religion is experienceing someone else's relationship with God....quite a difference. The flower essenses therapy I feel is a way to mute the empathy that needs to be accepted, nurtured and not medicated out of your life. I cannot imagine taking anything foreign that would mute this most precious gift....like taking an anti-depressant or anti-anxiety pill. Sure, if you can't handle this gift, maybe you need these aids, but once embraced, you really can't get through the day without that wonderful guidance your own spirit is providing you. So, this book is OK for the beginning on their quest for self-understanding, but it certainly does not present enough strategies to help empathic veterans
