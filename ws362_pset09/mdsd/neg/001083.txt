If you are interested in a book that outlines Androgen Disorders in Women, purchase &quot;The Good News About Women's Hormones...by Geoffrey Redmond instead.  Cheung's books reminded me of a college term paper, just a lot of  citing other sources, and the source that is cited to back all the major  points is... &quot;The Good News About Women's Hormones...by Geoffery  Redmond, M.D.  Not only is the information in Redmond's book more   comprehensive and objective, it gives a much more understandable  explanation of androgen disorders.  Stick with the M.D
