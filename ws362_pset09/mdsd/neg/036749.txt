I'm not so sure of the content, beyond Peters and Barletta repeating what any trendster or most any person in business knows -- women and seniors are IT.  But was impossible for me to read much of the text.  I tried hard to read the black on hot pink background on one page, then black on lime green the next, and black text on deep angry red on the next. My eyes were fatigued by page 12 - seriously.  I skipped to later chapters in the book, and found text in such teeny font that I was unable to read (to the publisher, should you care: examples: pp. 102-103, 132, 147 and many more.)

And Mr. Peters says seniors are the big trend? Does he know that even for the youngsters with strong eyes, this book was so impossible [for me] to read that I returned it to the bookstore same day.  Seriously - headache from the strain of adjusting my eyes to the sharp colors and teeny tiny print. And I rarely have head pain.  Gosh, don't buy it. Find something else that's readable, legible on trends, and needn't hide it's thin, shallow content with funky colors, many phrases with annoying ALL CAPS, and paragraphs including DIFFERENT FONT SIZES and FONTS throughout.

The worst pages were those with the ten "To-Dos" at beginning of chapters. Background was faded from sharp red to near white; couldn't read a complete sentence without eye strain. And then the "cool friends" segments ...light blue print on all black background...  

If there's great content, all this cheesy, goofy, I'm-trying-to-be-so-hip-and-cool, off-putting act will be completely unnecessary.
