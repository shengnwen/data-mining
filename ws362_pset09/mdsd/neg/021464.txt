as other reviewers have noted, the author seems to have some very real conflicts with being a sexual human being.  that seems reasonable enough, human sexuality is full of conflicts, but people expecting this book to help resolve theirs will be disappointed.  it's like the author of some 1950s hygiene manual woke up, read a couple of pop-metaphysics books and spit this little tome out in a coffee-binge weekend.  the author equates thinking about someone while masturbating to raping them.  (to my 8th grade girlfriend, i apologize, i swear i had no idea!)  he also displays a fascinating preoccupation with the acroynms D.I.C.K. and A.S.S.  hmm, curious. . .
