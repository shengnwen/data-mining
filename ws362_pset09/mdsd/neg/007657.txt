If you like repetition...read this book.  If you like repetition...read this book.  If you like repetition...read this book.  Did you get the point?  IF Steel is one of the best, THIS is one of her worst!  Starting out, I truly felt she was identifying with a struggle many women experience as children grow up and memories of early career goals start to resurface.  After a couple chapters we had rehashed the issue so many times, we became bored with our own memories!  The book could have been written in three chapters. The only thing that keeps you reading is the fact that you want it to be over!  (I literally took almost two months to read the book because there was no point to hurry through.  The ending is contrived, the characters are either too 'good' or too 'bad'.  In order to finish I had to put space between redings so I wasn't bored beyond belief!)  Can we please bring LaVyrle Spencer out of retirement?  Note to Amazon...don't invest in many copies of this one.  There will be too many copies people will want to unload so they don't have to dust another tome
