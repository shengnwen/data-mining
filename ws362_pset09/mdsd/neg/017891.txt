I am very familiar with the courts in Santa Clara County (CA), having myself been caught up in a nasty custody battle (and other attendant battles) for 18 years.

I am also familiar with the work of Judge Stewart, (having sat in on many of his sessions) and the work of Terry Johnston (personal experience).  Below is my opinion garnered by my own personal, and extensive, experience in the very court system the two authors have 'served'.  

I am not impressed.  Let me put it this way, I retained sole custody of my daughter IN SPITE OF Ms. Johnston (who was directly involved in my case), her special Masters Program and other agenda's that are at work in this County Court system.  

Fortunately for me, I had a good judge who was able to see past the prejudicial treatment of my case.  Not so fortunate for others.  I had some excellent representation for about one year of my on going battles, for the other 17 I largely represented myself, so trust me, I understand what goes on.  Single mom, low income, victim of domestic violence (25 police documented incidents), vs. ex police officer husband, (remarried with 8 kids and enough money to hire many lawyers).  If Dr. Johnston had had her way, my daughter would have eventually wound up in the custody of my violent ex.  I fought against some of the best attorneys in the county, and I prevailed.  

You can too.  Read the book, but if something doesn't quite feel right, follow that intuition.  If you need to know more, check out the National Coalition for Justice.  They have some very good information re: The Authors of this book.  I never joined this organization, so I have no particular agenda re: their organization, therefore I can objectively reccommend this as a good and reliable source.
