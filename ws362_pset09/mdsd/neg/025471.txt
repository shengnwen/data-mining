I was looking for a series of charts that would combine people and historical dates.  For example, in Daniel, how do the various prophets line up with the various rulers?  When do Daniel's dreams take place chronologically?

This book didn't come close.  This book has outlines of each of the books.  I can get that in almost any commentary.  This book gave cursory discriptions and discussion about each Bible book.  But, the authors did not provide enough detail to make the reading worthwhile.  That level of detail made reading a waste of time.

This book is supposed to be a "Complete Book of Bible Charts and Maps!"  It's NOT.  Even the drawings of things like to ark of the covenant are small, roughly drawn and basically unuseable.

I was VERY disappointed with this book
