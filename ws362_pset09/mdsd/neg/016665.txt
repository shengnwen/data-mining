I liked CIDE a lot, so I looked forward to the American version with CD-Rom.  More than half of CIDE was removed, though.  The definitions and usages are clear, so I would recommend this book for anyone seeking a small  dictionary.  For those searching for more, either get CIDE (Cambridge Int  Dict of English) or Merriam Webster Tenth Collegiate.  The CD-Rom is a  simple compilation of the text, with a word lookup.  No frills at all.  The  Random House 2nd CD is much superior, as is the MW 10C CD
