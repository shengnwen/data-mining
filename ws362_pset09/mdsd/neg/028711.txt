I was very upset by this book. I stopped reading  it after three chapters. Norman Mailer is a deeply disturbed, dirty old man. The book had less to do with Hitler than with Mailer's bizarre imagination. While no one would dispute the fact that Hitler was a horrible man, Mr. Mailer mind seems to dwell in a sick and twisted world. This book does nothing to enlighten us. It is demeaning to the human spirit. I benefited not at all and felt that if I had continued reading I would be "dirtied".
