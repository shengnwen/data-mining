Nothing special and the point of the book is never clear. There's a mission, but then we get a primer on the Spanish Inquisition [which I didn't expect ;-)], courtly behavior in Spain, and a prim look at sexual relations. Add all that up and you get a pretty boring book from the writer of the Flanders Panel, which was a good book. Oh well. Everybook can't be a good book, can it
