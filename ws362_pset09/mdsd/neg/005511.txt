This is Rehash of the first edition - same boring material regurgitated back at you. It's like taking ugly red-headed step-child and trying to dye his hair black but the roots and the freckles show through the disguise - still ugly and red-headed - like this book. This author can't take any critisism - don't worry - he'll cry like a little baby to amazon offical and this will get taken down. I try to warn you that this book won't be loved to dog ears - it sit on shelf and become dust bunny catcher because the circuits are wrongness and the most don't go well
