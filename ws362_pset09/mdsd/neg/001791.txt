Okay, I'm going to go against the grain here and say that Suttree really isn't all that good.  Maybe it's fine literature -- although personally I don't think so; I think literature should engage and tell a story that the reader can feel part of, absorbed into with a pathos for its characters, good or bad.  Here we get only snatches of that.  *At times* we feel akin to Suttree.  For example the prison segment is good; there is a sense of purpose and pace here absent from the rest of the book; but on the whole Suttree is a rambling and confusing mess.  Why struggle so much with a book?  It's not that the ideas are so incredibly complex -- sure, at times it's sublime -- but it has a purposefully disconnected storyline.  The reader is meant to feel in the dark and only slowly pick up on the context and setting of the scenes.  The relationship between Suttree and Harrogate is great, but there needs to be more of it -- I feel like saying "yeah, yeah, yeah, just bring me back to the friendship between those two and give us more development of Suttree's mysterious past."  If you want to read this, you have been warned.  You will probably be bored and frustrated a good deal of the time.  Page after page of how someone shaves or combs their hair sound interesting?  If you think it's worth it "in the name of literature", then that's up to you.  

Note: I have read Blood Meridian and thought it was an excellent book: definitely go read that one first.  And I read A Child of God, which was also great.  I was hoping to become more of a Cormac McCarthy fan reading this one, but I think I've gotten to the point where I'd rather read the back of my shampoo bottle or peruse my way through a stack of disclaimer forms.  McCarthy is a master of the language, no doubt.  But in order to make us read the book he ought to at least make it interesting
