I'm a fan of Barrow's, but this book is repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. It's a collection of pieces he did for various publications and everything in it is said more clearly in Impossibility or Pi in  the Sky or  others of his stimulating books. Save  your money and buy one of those  rather than this  deflationary rehash
