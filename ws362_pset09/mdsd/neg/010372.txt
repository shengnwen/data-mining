Hesiod was a bit of a disappointment for me.  The Works and Days was full of agriculture tips and his advice on how you should live your life.  There was very little to do with the ancient Greek Gods and was just the advice of one man on how an individual should conduct themselves.  Theogony was more of what I was looking for with a version of the origin of the ancient gods.  Hesiod spells out the beginnings of the gods very well and it was the most enjoyable part of this book.  I would recommend Homer or Virgil before trying this work
