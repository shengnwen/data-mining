I don't know quite what to say about this book... This is the second book in the trilogy and while I found the first book to be a bit hokey, at least it was somewhat different and readable. This book is all over the place. There are so many holes in the story that it left me feeling frustrated. Also, the author has an annoying habit of just repeating the same facts ad nauseam instead of developing the storyline and working on character development.

I like this author (or at least did) and I was looking forward to something new from her. Unfortunately, this book felt like a complete a waste of time
