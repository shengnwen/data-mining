I grew up in the Seattle area and have been a Nirvana fan since first hearing them back in 1990.  I thought the book had a lot of exaggerations in it to paint Kurt Cobain as being a punk rocker since his birth in 1967.  It was also very 'Courtney friendly'.  The author was obviously a huge Nirvana fan and I think the book was written from that perspective rather than from an objective one.  Biographies are usually better coming from an unbiased biographer
