In &quot;Culture &amp; Consumption&quot;, McCracken takes the view that we are all beholden to our culture and that it is nearly impossible to break out of it.  Unlike the reviewer who gave this volume 5 stars, I feel as though it is overly determinstic in its' approach.  There is almost no room for any type of individual behavior, as this does not really exist for McCracken.  The book is also heavy on a kind of behavioral pop psych dogma and he does not take any other modern consumption ideas into account.  In the end, check this book out from the library if you really want to read it, otherwise you're just throwing your money away on overused dogmatic tripe
