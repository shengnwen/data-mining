This book is horrid; there are so many that are better reading and better advice.  The answer to "why" is simple:  everyone is out for their best interest, and only advances yours if it achieves their objective.  And here Mooney is pretending to advance your objective by selling you a bad book.

Get over the sisterhood myth and move on to better researched, better written books, such as Lois Frankel's "Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office" and Gail Evans' "Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman".
