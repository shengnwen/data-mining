This book might -- MIGHT -- be of use to the beginner or the casual practitioner, but anyone who has been involved in paganism or wicca for any length of time will not find much here that hasn't been covered elsewhere.   And, I am sorry to say, covered in more depth. The illustrations are nice,  though, and for someone who is not very familiar with wicca or paganism  this might be helpful, but ONLY as a start down the path.  If you're  further on down the Way, there's not much of any interest here, sad to say.   And what is it with Llewellyn and spelling errors?  This book is loaded  down with them.  People, Microsoft Word includes a spellcheck function -  USE IT
