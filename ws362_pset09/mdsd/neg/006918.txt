   Diamond spends twenty one laughable pages on male lactation.  What's next?  How about implanting a uterus?  After all, men are stronger and could probably carry babies better.
   Big game hunting by the males of indigenous tribes was probably more effective when there was more game.  But, for Diamond, it leaves the question open as to "What are men good for?"  
   My question is "What is Jared Diamond good for?"
