Simple fact:  This is a text book.  This is the book that we're using in my Pro Chef/baking & pastry course, and we've discovered that many of the recipes/formula's in this book are NOT the proper ones (case in point:  ever hear of tiramisu without the alcohol???) 
I've been told by one pastry chef to only do the formula's in blue, not the red - so might give that a shot - other than that, the recipe/formula's in this book are NOT easy to follow- but they're not meant to be - it's *really* not meant for the home cook at all - those looking at the book thinking of buying it need to remember that - it's called Professional Baking for a reason.  That said, I wouldn't suggest it to professional bakers/chefs, either
