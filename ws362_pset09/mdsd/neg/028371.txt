... is the question my girls asked me.  I was looking for an empowering book for my 4 yr old twin girls and this title caught my eye.  The second page of this book shows the king crying at the bedside of his pale wife who has just died giving birth to her one and only daughter!!  Not something I expected from a book that has an empowering title and leaves me asking why oh why does the mommy have to die in order for the girl to grow up brave and strong??  So sad.  This book went in the trash pile
