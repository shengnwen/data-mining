the plot is a little bit superficial and has, like the film industry, not really some depth to think about. it's a discworld book with all this nice highlights of writing style but as the main red line is not a very interesting one to me, i find this book one of the lower quality discworld ones... if you are a discworld fan, then it's of course for you, but if you are looking for a first discworld book, then make sure it's not this but instead e.g. Small Gods or Monstrous Regiment or Pyramid
