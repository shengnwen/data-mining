I don't always give low ratings.  However, this book is long overdue a 2nd edition, and as it stands, it should not be relied upon as a "state of the art" book on childrens' eyewitness testimony.

The progenitor of most of the scientific research on the subject, Elizabeth Loftus, has come under fire two years after the publication of this book, as the detractors (or uncritical believers) mounted a resurgent challenge to her work.  A revision ought to include a critical reanalysis of these challenges, as well as another decade of subsequent psychological, experimental, and legal work in the area.

The book is therefore of historical interest, but cannot stand alone in any clinic library
