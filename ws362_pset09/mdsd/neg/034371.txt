This book only gets two stars because of the gorgeousness of the pictures.  The actual science content is shoddy, and the writing is horrific.  Don't be fooled:  Kingfisher is owned by a public school curriculum company, and it shares all the same flaws that a text book has.

Bitterly disappointing
