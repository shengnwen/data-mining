It starts off confusing from Chapter One and continues in that manner.  Multiple times I was unable to work homework problems from the sections using only the text in this book, relying instead on the internet or a friend's old physics book to help me figure out the matieral that was either glossed over or not covered in this book.

The wording is often  imprecise, misleading, or generally obfuscated.  Useful tables were few and far between, and the math was a confusing mix of Pre-Calc through Complex Analysis (though they never seem to quite spell out exactly what they are getting at, so I feel sorry for anyone using this book before at least Calc II).

The book is paced so that it can be taught to students currently enroled in Calc 1, so if you know more advanced math you should skim it at least once before your class starts to figure out where the material is.

If you have to suffer through a class that uses this wretched book like I just did I strongly recommend getting another calculus based classical physics book to actually explain things, using this book in loose association with your real reference.  Note that this book has a love of polar vectors.

If you bother to read through this book as a learning tool, I recommend taking notes as you go because the book is a horrible reference.

The only reason I give this book two stars is I did not spot any actual errors in the book.  I give them a point for at least knowing the subject.   They however should not be writing textbooks
