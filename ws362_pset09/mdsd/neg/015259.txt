The tobacco industry has been called callous and cynical for profiting from harmful products,but is the tobacco industry any less cynical than an industry of lawyers,pedants and assorted getting-money-under-the-table "advocates" who play off the public's gullibility and penchant for overemotionalism and blameshifting?This book infuriated me.I am not a smoker,though I did try tobacco in my youth.I didn't like cigs,so I decided not to smoke them.Common sense ought to tell a 6 year old that smoking is bad for you,yet somehow this country has come to the conclusion that our own decisions,if incurring negative consequences,are someone else's fault.This is a very frightening road we are headed down.What industry will be targeted next?Alcohol?Automotive(40,000 deaths a year)?Fast food?What angers me most about the great tobacco crusades of recent years is that people are blind to the fact that the only beneficiaries of the lawsuit settlements are a bunch of lawyers,and those who are getting royally shafted are smokers themselves,who are paying more and more for a pack of cigarettes.The tobacco companies aren't going to lose any money or sleep over these settlements;they'll just pass on the costs.So while the public congratulates itself on bringing down the "BIG&lt;BAD&lt;EVIL Corporations" what has really occured is that a handfull of lawyers and cohorts have made billions off of the public and smoker's habits have become a lot more expensive.And this great racket has all been carried out in the name of "compassion"!Congrats America,you've been suckered again
