From reading the other reviews on Amazon, it seems you either love or hate this novel.   I'm falling on the disappointed side.  I was hoping for a novel similar to what W. Somerset Maugham would write.  Instead, this novel turned out to be painfully  s-l-o-w and boring.  After reading half the novel, I couldn't take it anymore.  I had to bail out.   I can't remember the last time that I quit a novel because it was so unreadable.   It's apparant that Alan Furst is no W. Somerset Maugham.
