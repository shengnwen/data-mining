This book goes into the hearts and minds of the ancient Greeks led by Odysseus and Achilles, who are guided by their gods. The Trojan War is brewing for the Greeks and thoughts of slaughtering their enemy, The Trojans are very strong. Can the Trojans survive? Will they all live to tell the tale of the Trojan War or will they all be killed?  On both sides, it's life or death on their minds. Have you ever heard of the Trojan horse and the victory for Odysseus? This book includes the story of Odysseus and why his son set out to find his father. The journey of the ancient Greeks to the Trojan homeland is included. Will they return or will they lie in the blood stained desert of the Trojan homeland? The book also includes Odysseusis treacherous journey home past a six headed serpent and right across an evil king's door step. Will he survive? 
Personally I didn't like the book at all. The way it was written it didn't really pull the reader in very well and the battle sequences are O.K. but not the best. Personally I don't really enjoy some types of myths and legends. I think if you are just about to branch out and read Greek myths you shouldn't read this book first because it really turns you off to Greek myths in general, so don't think all Greek myth's are like this.
