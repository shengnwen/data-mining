Ms. McClure has discovered a teasure trove of revolting recipes all developed to help people lose weight. I thought the photographs were a hoot and her descriptions witty. I too could have done without the foul language in a few of the commentaries. Not necessary at all. I think my biggest disappointment is that there are NO recipes for any of this nasty looking food. Some of the best haha's in old recipes are found in ingredients and preparation. Just pictures of the WW cards and comments was ok but not very satisfying. Even one or two recipes would have assuaged me. Was there a copyright issue with Weight Watcher's? Who knows. There was no real introduction in the book... just back page notes
