For years the Sporting News has produced a Baseball Register, but in later years, TSN has collaborated with Stats Inc. and has turned to Fantasy fans with more info. The ratings from last year are gone this year, however. And it's still the only book of its kind.  In the distant past, photos of each player, a list of hobbies, marital status and facsimile autographs were included.  Those are long gone, to the detriment of the publication. A couple of years ago some idiot decided to drop info about family ties to the game.  Fortunately they came back 2 years ago.  This year's effort, however, contains numerous errors and omissions that I don't recall seeing before.  I tried to call the publisher to ask what happened, but got no response.  For many players, the positions they played in the minors are missing for some years.  For others, a year out of their career is simply omitted.  It's not just one or two mistakes, either.  I don't know if this is the result of a fight over who keeps minor league stats or what, but it's badly in need of fixing.
