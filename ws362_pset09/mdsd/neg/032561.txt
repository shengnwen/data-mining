I skimmed John Gray's &quot;Practical Miracles for Mars &amp; Venus,&quot; but couldn't stomach the hype.  The first 150 pages are about the power of positive thinking and of belief in miracles.  (Gray claims that the world has matured to the point that miracles are now available to anyone, at any time.  Democracy and religious tolerance are two of the enabling changes.)  Gray then sketches some simple techniques for physical and emotional healing: eat right; breath deeply; use a Chi Gong exercise to &quot;recharge healing energy&quot; and &quot;decharge excess or negative energy&quot; (or stress and negative thoughts); imagine that people have treated you better than they actually did; write yourself a letter expressing your frustrations; cultivate gratitude, confidence, joy, etc.; envision the world you want; believe in yourself and your power to heal.  I gather that the techniques are more completely described in Gray's &quot;How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have.&quot;  &quot;Practical Miracles&quot; reads like an ad for Gray's seminars, or like a verbatim trancript of a stage presentation.  (On page 239 he says &quot;Now I have written twelve bestsellers and tend to be a speed writer. ... After many years of developing my thoughts, it takes me only a few months to write them down and create a book.&quot;)  Positive thinking is all well and good, but the seminar must be more inspiring than the book
