This book is pretty lame compared to other texts on the market today. The YI Jin Jing description is terrible and of no use what so ever. Neither is the Shaolin 5 animals forms that are discribed in minute proportions. I don't care what the history of the manuscripts are, this book offers no definitive information. It is very vague and elementary, a lot like Smith's other books. The fighting methods shown are a poor representation of Shaolin skills. The true essence of Shaolin is beyond any manuscript, let alone a hoax manuscrpit from Taiwan, which is the inspiration for this book
