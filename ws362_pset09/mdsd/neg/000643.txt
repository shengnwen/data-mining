These dumb girls don't realize how much they degrade themselves all in the name of the almighty ME, and self-indulgence. Of course guys are going to applaud their "liberating" efforts to become little village bicycles--why buy the cow if the milk's for free? In the spirit of simply doing what feels good and pursuing "happiness" why not simply take it a step further? How about we develop a continuous IV drip of the morning after pill so that these girls can go on with their body-bartering transactions all the while ensuring that "no one gets hurt" in the process? Maybe we could teach them how to properly excise their genital warts in the privacy of their own home...or better yet, how about we provide girls with abortion vacuums so that they don't have to be burdened by an inconvenient trip to planned parenthood--now I think were looking at a seriously un-tapped market, all! So long as these girls keep popping anti-depressants and convincing themselves that all sluttiness is a suitable choice as long as it conforms to the will of the almighty ME, we will have broken lives, decimated fetuses, suicidal & alcoholic girls, and a slew of men who see us as nothing more than a means to an orgasm.
