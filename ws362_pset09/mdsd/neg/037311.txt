Ask questions. The book and the movie that followed were both attempts to glorify the WRONG people. I'll admit that the Rangers had their hand in this rescue mission. But the REAL heroes are those of the Alamo Scouts. Look it up.

I won't buy this book, nor will I support the movie...because the only reason the Rangers could participate in this mission was due to the help, and highly skilled Alamo Scouts. There is one book out on them, and their missions: Silent Warriors of World War II: The Alamo Scouts Behind Japanese Lines
