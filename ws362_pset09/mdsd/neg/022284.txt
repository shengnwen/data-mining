I used this book in an MBA International Marketing course.  The text is a very cumbersome read.  While the book contains adequate anecdotal information, the information is poorly organized and often fails to engage the reader.  I routinely found myself searching for more concise supplemental materials for concepts the book failed to develop.  The narratives are extremely wordy and consistently obfuscate salient points.  If I were using the book as an instructor, I would use the country notebook section as a course guide and scrap the rest.
