This book looked like it may be pretty funny to read, but unfortunately it was not.  I generally try to be kind in my reviews but I found this book to be so nauseating that I just had to write a negative review.  Mr.Stuever may be a talented writer technically, but the content of his articles is pretty pathetic.  He spends so much of his time being critical of others, that it leads me to wonder why he feels it is necessary to degrade others to help his own cause.  If you enjoy reading articles that are a constant derision and mockery of others, then this is the book for you.  If not, there are plenty of other funny reads out there.
