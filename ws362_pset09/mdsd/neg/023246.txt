I bought this book because I became curious after reading the various posted reviews. I do Yoga occasionally, and I was lucky enough to find an excellent book when I was 14 (over 25 years ago...), which was written by a Briton who was extremely balanced, pleasant, and clear in his writing. I cannot say that this book had the same effect on me. I found the author of the secret art rather pompous and arrogant and, in the circumstances, this made it harder for me to take seriously the whole book. While the movements make a nice workout, which I have no doubt can be healthy and cleansing of both mind and body, the messenger is not a very good advertisement. Making fun and speaking with such superiority about everything that is not the secret art, and accusing just about everybody of being superficial and stupid (unless, of course, one practices the art) suggests to me that the art in question has not really worked its magic on this teacher. Giving advice about being tolerant and well-disposed towards others sounds pretty moot, coming from this source. I gave the book two stars because of the practical part, even though I found some of the explanations of the movements rather wanting, although overall clear enough
