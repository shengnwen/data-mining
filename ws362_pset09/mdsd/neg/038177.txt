I have tried to stomach this book with no success.  For a while I carried it around in the car to read waiting for kids or appointments, but finally brought it back into the house.  This morning I read a few of the reviews of other readers and made one more pass through the book, but have decided to send it on the next trip to the landfill- it is not even something I would donate to the free shelf at the library- the only positive thing I can say is that the author appears to have done a lot of research- a lot of which is unbearably tedious and just takes up space. The title which is what caught my interest, is deceivingly clever- I see now there are several books that use the same play on words. With so many good books that one cannot possibly hope to find time to read them all, don't waste your time- or integrity- on this.  I spent $6.99 on this and I'm throwing it in the garbage where it belongs.  I gave this book a star because that was the lowest rating available, a kindness
on behalf of Amazon.
