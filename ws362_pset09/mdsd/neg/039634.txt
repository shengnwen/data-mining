the shrinky dinks refill packet only comes with 8 sheets of shrinky dink paper.  there are no extra project ideas nor are there any extra doo dads like findings or blank magnets, nothing that makes the refill pack worth buying.  you can go to the shrinky dinks website at shrinky dinks dot com or to dick blick dot com and order shrink film in greater quantities for A LOT cheaper.  for instance dick blick has 50 sheets of shrink film for sixteen ninety nine.  twice as much as this refill pack but significantly greater value.  this refill pack is totally a rip off.  only good if you are trying to give a gift and want everything to match nicely
