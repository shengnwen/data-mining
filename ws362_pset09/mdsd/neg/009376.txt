There is just one or two (not new) interesting concepts in this book and on top of it, the author could have captured them all in a few pages only. There was not really a good reason to write a this book except for letting us know how incredible IDEO is.

In comparison, "Ten faces of Innovation" is much more informative. Both books are easy to read and entertaining, but lack pragmatic advice. If you have to choose one of them, read "ten faces" only.
