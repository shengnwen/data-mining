The preview of this book made no mention that it's focus is on women who placed their children for adoption in the 70's and were coerced into it. 

I placed my child for adoption in the 90's under no one's influence. It was a painful, yet positive experience.I am in search of a book that can help a person in my situation. 

This book was not it.
