This isn't a kids book at all. The message behind it is one of choice, making reference to a woman's right to choose through horton and the planet. I don't care what your views on abortion are (anti or pro), you shouldn't let young children read and decyfer the hidden meaning. Dr. Seuss was a nut job and a child corrupter, don't support his work.
