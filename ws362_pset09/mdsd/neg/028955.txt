There are much better books on management out there than this collection of unorganized work.  Don't read this book if you're looking for new insight on management techniques.  If you're already a seasoned manager, you'll find more value in your real work environment.  This was a text for one of my MBA courses, and the rest of my MBA team (which consists of seasoned management professionals) has the same sentiments.

Spend your time elsewhere.
