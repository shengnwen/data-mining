You will not learn anything new in this book that you don't already know.  The book consists of 4 or 5 different essays written by 4 or 5 different authors.  It isn't a clear book describing the civil war. I was looking for  a book that described each of the reasons for the start of the civil war.   This book didn't do that.  Each essay tried to make a different point - but  it was not clear.  The book was too scattered for me. So if you want a more  in depth, and more straight forward book about the start of the civil war -  try another author
