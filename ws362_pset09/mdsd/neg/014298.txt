I really enjoyed the first volume in this series of fan written stories, but am now asking myself what went wrong with volume II !  Gone is much of the excitement, gone are the engrossing characters, and almost gone are the  &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;. Instead the bulk of stories in this volume  are the kind of insipid, weak, soap opera drivel, that has turned many fans  away from Star Trek over the years. I realise that a certain percentage of  the market buy into that but I don't accept that it is the majority. If  things continue down this road the stories are likely to begin with :  &quot;Like tribbles through a transporter beam ... so are the days of our  lives ! &quot
