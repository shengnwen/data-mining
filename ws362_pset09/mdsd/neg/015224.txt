Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling.
