Just read the 7th edition--it only took a couple of hours to go through it.  It is a schill for AOL and Geo-Cities.  It also pushes Netscape Composer which is probably an out of date web design package.  Briefly describes HTML in a very very basic manner.  You will not be able to get a web page up with what is published in this book.  The book convinced me to get a copy of Frontpage.
