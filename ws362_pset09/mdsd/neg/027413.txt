This book is a great example of the problem with the contemporary left: a paralysis by analysis by academics too comfortable in their lofty ivory tower to actually take any political action. There was a time when left intellectuals were more concerned class struggle than making tenure or getting published in the most trendy post-modern theory journal. Try to imagine the look on the face of any working class Joe sipping beer at a sports bar when confronted with the language this book is couched in. Ivory tower Marxist serve as an "outlet" for revolutionary energy in a capitalist society. The ivory tower radicalism espoused by this book is nothing but another system of control.
