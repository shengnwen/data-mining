Though reasonably well written it is really just a tutorial that I could have found as easily online.  Note quite what I had hoped for in a book on Problem, Design and programming.  I had hoped for better detail on the design approaches and methodologies than were gotten here.

In short, not a book that I expect to open a lot if ever again
