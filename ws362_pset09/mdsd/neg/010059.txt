I really enjoyed The Perfect Storm.  So, I gave Ms. Greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book.  I was less than impressed.  I lasted till page 53 where I just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story.
This is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of Junger's book.

Sebastian Junger's blurb on the cover was "Anyone who loves the sea will love this book"  I think not
