What is this book about? Whale revenge? What is that? I read the whole book and all they do is ride around in a boat. And there's a whale. And they kill it. This is basically Moby Dick for kids. I'm guessing the whale is the main character as none of the characters are memorable. I don't fault the author, but what editor allowed this book to sneak by? I guess somebody who likes whales a real lot
