This book is one of the funniest I have ever read because it is truly "Progressive liberalism". Absolutely nothing new. Bash, bash, bash Conservatives. Use of hate speech, which liberals go crazy over if it is use against one of their sacred cows. Trying and trying to rewrite the Constitution, something they have never studied or learned what the framing fathers thought when they wrote it.
     I offer no excuse for George W. who is no conservative, but if liberals offer no more than this which they don't, Republican's will keep getting elected. I like most Conservative's long for another true Reagan
