This book is not a biography but rather a littany of volatile slurs.  So much mis-information when in print seems to count for the truth.  This book is the furthest thing from the truth or from Barbra Streisand.  I recommend you buy the double CD The Essential Barbra Streisand instead.  You'll get far more than your money's worth and more hours of enjoyment than the pain it takes to read this book
