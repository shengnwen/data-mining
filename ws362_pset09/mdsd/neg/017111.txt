    Our class read Soft Rain when we were studying The Trail Of Tears, a forced march taken by the Cherokee people in 1838.
    In the beginning, a girl named Soft Rain lived peacefully with with her family and dog. Then, a horrible letter comes.
    Next, Soft Rain and Mama were taken away by soldiers and had to leave. They were kept in a stockade.
    Finally, they were sent west and reunited with their family. They started a new life.
    I thought the book was O.K. and had good details. I think people should read this book because it is suspenseful. It was a good book!
