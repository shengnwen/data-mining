I knew there were two aliens/UFO camps: those who believe we're being visited by aliens, and those who don't believe we are. I hadn't realised there was a third camp: those who believe these "aliens" are demons. For those willing to swallow the existence of demons in the first place, I guess this is great news for them.

For a rational treatment of the alien abduction phenomenon in modern society, read "Abducted: How People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped by Aliens" by Susan A. Clancy, and of course Carl Sagan's "The Demon-Haunted World"
