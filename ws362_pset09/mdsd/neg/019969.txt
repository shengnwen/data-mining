I've just finished this book and found it rather annoying. Though I have enjoyed the Pitt series along the way, it seems that Anne Perry plays fast and loose with historical facts and, in this story, contrives an entirely unlikely key to resolve the plot.

Although no date for the story is given it appears to be set about 1880. The fact that Pitt and other characters have telephones at home, when the telephone was first invented in 1876 and not in general use until much later, is one problem. Another is a reference to someone's having seen another character's photograph in the newspaper, when photos were not used in newspapers until considerably later.

The chief bad guy in this story, police inspector Wetron, supposedly knows that one of his underlings is trying to catch him in illegal acts. So Perry has him leave a clue in his office that will lead the underling to his home, where apparently Wetron is planning on catching him. But the clue he leaves in his office is the real thing - a link to his criminal activity. How dumb can that be? And then he allows the underling to spirit him off on a wild goose chase in the middle of the night while his house is searched. The ridiculousness of this ruined the story for me.
