I returned this book after briefly thumbing through it.  The subject matter is almost identical to Larry Dean Olsen's "Outdoor Survival Skills".  In particular many of the drawings are renderings of the exact same photos in Larry's book.

Perhaps the authors worked together; if not, is is a shameless copy of the earlier book.
