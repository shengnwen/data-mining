After reading all the 5 star reviews for this book, I guess I was expecting more than what was delivered.  Most of what the author brings to light is not new.  There have been dozens if not hundreds of books describing out-of-body experiences, the Hall of Records, auras, the Astral plane, etc. This book does offer a slightly different perspective though, in that we experience these things through the eyes of a young girl.  Yet, when someone says that they have met with Jesus, it sets off my "b.s." meter.  What did Jesus have to say to the author?  Well, here again, nothing new.  He quoted from the Bible and He said things like "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and His righteousness..".  And how does the 7 year old respond?  Like no 7 year old I have ever met. She kisses the feet of Jesus, at which time she hears "the angels singing about the blood of the lamb". Huh? How does the blood of the lamb fit in with astral travel? The author seems torn between her Baptist upbringing and her more unorthodox spiritual experiences.  The result is a confusing mix of beliefs that may leave readers scratching their heads
