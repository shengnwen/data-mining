Perhaps in the first time in the publishing industry, a former president had to refund a portion of the advance for his memoirs due to its falling short of expectations of the publisher. That is all that needs to be said about A Time To Heal.

Gerald R. Ford stumbled into the presidency in the same way comic Chevy Chase panned him in skits on SNL. Embattled Pres. Richard Nixon needed a mark to make sure he could shuffle out of the Oval Office without the threat of being prosecuted for crimes & misdemeanors, and Ford was the man.

The book is short on detailed facts concerning the issue of the pardon and staggers through the key points of the times - the fall of Saigon and the 1976 Republican primary that basically undid his presidency - like a running back on a soggy field and wearing the wrong cleats for proper traction.

Ford should have had the courage to take a pen in hand and truly write a major piece on the tumolt that defined his brief presidency. The book publisher certainly expected more. But I guess that sketches short on facts are what should have been expected from an individual who truly defined the term, "Beltway Insider."
