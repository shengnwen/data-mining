I was actually fairly disappointed by this book, though it does merit very high marks on the technical issues, i.e. the reproductions are of high quality, and the photographer knew his tools. It's just that I didn't care  for the choice of images.  Most of the images are very contrasty, moving  quickly between almost oily highlights and deep shadows.  The poses, while  visually interesting, were very artificial and to me, unappealing.  I guess  the photographer was going for presenting the structure of the body and  different kinds of lines you could generate with it.  In that regard, he  did a good job, but it was not a goal that appealed to me.  And one final  FYI, the book is black and white -- no value judgement on that, just  information that I didn't see elsewhere on this page
