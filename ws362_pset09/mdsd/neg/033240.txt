You can bet that if Peter David had lifted a cliche as hoary as the "I am Spartacus" moment for one of his stories, he would have at least given a nod to his source! Spock as messiah became fairly tedious, as did the rehash of 'old codger from OST becoming a liability and then proving himself' plot line from RELICS. Dry, humorless, with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick. I just don't get why Mr. Friedman is so popular. I've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the ST fiction offerings in the last few years - Kevin Ryan, Peter David, Greg Cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit, heart and intelligence. Like another reviewer here, I keep trying to like this author's books since he is so prolific, but damn it, Jim, Star Trek fiction should never be a chore
