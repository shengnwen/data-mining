I bought this book because I need it for my His. class. From chap. # 1, I wanted to drop the class JUST BECAUSE THIS TBOOK.

Chapter 1: Referring to slaves and Native Americans "Within their own families and COMMUNITIES they made choices..." 
My questions are 
How many Slaves had choices??? What community of slaves?? Welcome to the Black Slave Community. The book is a joke

Slaves were not human for their owners. They were an expensive item. If the owner wanted to sell a Black baby, they were able to do it because the baby was the owner's property. The parents of this baby didn't have the "CHOICE" to say THIS IS MY CHILD. HE/SHE DOESN'T BELONGS TO YOU, SO YOU CAN NOT SELL HER/HIM. I think that this book and the authors do not respect Native Americans, African Americans and the history.

Also, the trade of Europeans with Native Americans . The book reads, "that the Indian was 'making sport of us Europeans.'" We, the people from America (the whole continent), lost everything we had in our trades. We didn't know the value of our gold, and we traded it for glass beads. So, What sport are we talking here? How this author want us to believe that we, people from America, fooled the Europeans
