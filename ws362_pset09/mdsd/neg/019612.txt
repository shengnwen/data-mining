It doesn't seem like the other reviewers read the same book that I did.  The book I read consisted of a lot of self-congratulatory essays on Asimov's creation of the Three Laws of Robotics (which aren't really laws, but that's a topic for a different rant) punctuated by a bunch of shaggy-dog stories (MAYBE they were funny in 1955) and a couple of lame science-fiction stories.  I know Dr. Asimov was a brilliant man, but this book in no way offers him tribute to his genius.  For fans only.  Maybe.
