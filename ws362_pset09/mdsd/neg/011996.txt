I have purchased many books on the U.S. Constitution. This book was okay,  but compared to others it only deserves one star. My two favorite books  which I would give five stars are The U.S. Constitution for Everyone, and  The U.S. Constitution &amp; Fascinating Facts About It. Read the reviews  for those books and you'll see that many people share my opinion
