The information in this book is the same recycled misinformation that the general mainstream public believes about credit.  Paying old debts does not help your credit score much at all.  A paid charge off is just as poor as the charge off in the first place.  If you have severely poor credit, nothing in this book is going to help make it better unless you are cool with waiting 10 years to rent a car, book a hotel room or be able to start a bar tab at half decent restaurant without being treated like a leper.  You need to start a new credit file which is 100% legal and works very well.  Then you need to have seasoned aged credit added to your file which will dramatically boost your score and allow you to get on with your life.  All the money management skills in the world won't help you if your credit has already been damaged severely.  That time has passed.  The author's view that a new credit file is illegal is totally false.  My attorney charged me $3000 to create a Credit Privacy Number for me and it is totally 100% legal and was worth it even if I had to pay her $10,000 because it is perfect and prestine.  Then my aunt added me to her 10 year old Amex account as an "authorized user" and 60 days later, I had a credit score of 790.  The only thing illegal about credit is when you borrow money with the intent of never paying it back.  Period.  You don't have to give your Social Security Number to ANYONE but the IRS, your employer and the SSA. That is not my opinion, that is FEDERAL LAW.  If you think this book contains your only credit options, good luck staying poor.......:)  The title of this book should be "What Average Consumers THINK About Credit
