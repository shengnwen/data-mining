Rachel and Darcy. Best friends since grade school. Rachel is the average-looking one with good grades; Darcy is the good-looking one with average grades. Rachel has worked hard all her life and is a lawyer at a NY law firm (a very unhappy, overworked lawyer...). Darcy learned early on in life that thanks to her great looks, she doesn't have to work as hard to get what she wants. Therefore she has become a bit shallow and still has a lot of growing up to do. On Rachel's 30th birthday, Darcy throws her a party and Rachel gets drunk and sleeps with Darcy's handsome fianc�, Dex. After sleeping together, Rachel and Dex realize they have loved each other all these 7 years . . .  now they are torn. Can they pursue their love and risk loosing Darcy?

I found this book fun to read in the beginning. Giffin is a vivid writer and I chuckled out loud because I could relate to many of the flashbacks of Rachel and Darcy growing up in the Midwest. But as the book progressed I started to loose respect for Rachel. Not only because she was completely betraying her best friend, but also because she lacked character and self esteem. In all aspects of her life (with Darcy, at her job and even with Dex) she was extremely insecure and meek. She lets others dominate her and is unable to stand up for herself. Even though I disagreed with her sleeping with her best friends fianc� I kept wondering why she wouldn't just tell Dex to leave Darcy and be with her (after all Dex kept telling her how much he loved her). I realize not everyone can have great self esteem and be secure in every aspect of his or her life but sleeping with your best friends fianc� is a very slimy way of gaining confidence.  I also think Giffin could have done a better job developing Dexter. His character lacked charisma and appeal. He is a lawyer and he's hot. OK. So what else made him so great that Rachel was willing to loose her life-long best friend for?
 
I read the sequel "Something Blue" to see what happens to Darcy and I liked that one better!!!! I also HIGHLY recommend Giffin's third and best book "Baby Proof" (that one is not about Rachel or Darcy!).   

***spoiler ahead****
My biggest gripe is that the author took the easy way out in the end with what happens with Darcy and Marcus. It was a cheap cop-out way to make Darcy the villain so you excuse Rachel and Dex's deceit.  Didn't work with me! Two wrongs don't make a right.
