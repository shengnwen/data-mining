I haven't read this book. I ordered it as a gift. When it arrived chapter 35 was removed and a slip of paper was inserted where the chapter should be stating, &quot;A chapter was removed from this book because of the cost of litigation. Free speech is free as long as you have the money to defend it.&quot; If you order this book, expect to receive it without a chapter. The website doesn't say anything about this so beware. Amazon sent me another book after the first one and this one also is missing the chapter. Keep this in mind before purchasing this book
