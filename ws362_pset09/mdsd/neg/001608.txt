With so many serious perspectives available on "peak oil", there is no reason to waste time on this screed, which only uses peak oil as a platform to cast aspersions on everything the author hates (and he hates, of course, all that which he does not understand).

He hates: the American south and its culture, Wal-Mart, interstates, strip malls, the Arab nations, and most of all, suburbs and the people who live in them. He loves: Israel, the liberal Northeast as it was fifty years ago, Israel, hateful rants, and Israel.

Peak oil lets him indulge in wishful thinking about how the Arab states will lose their power along with their oil, how the suburbs and Wal-Mart will collapse without cheap motoring, and the greatest reach of all: how the South and West will, for some reason, suffer more than the northern tier states in an energy scarce environment that he is certain is inevitable. Despite the fact that it is the northern tier states that are most dependent on cheap natural gas and heating oil, and have the least access to alternatives: solar, wind, biofuels. This last is thus little more than a transparent rationalization that allows him to imagine the reversal of the loss of economic and political clout of the north due to the inexorable flow of the American population from the dying Rust Belt cities to the more pleasant climes of the suburbs and the south.

Of course, he said all the same things before he ever heard of peak oil; back then he was making the same arguments about how Y2K was going to destroy all those things he despises. As were a lot of the other peak oilers.

Everywhere Kunstler goes, he sees only ugliness. This is to be expected. The ugliness lies within him, so he will never escape it. 

Give this one a wide berth and learn something about Austrian economics. You'll be glad you did
