A friend gave me the first four volumes of The Walking Dead as a birthday gift, knowing that I loved good zombie stories.

The story starts by completely lifting the beginning of the film 28 Days Later.  This book started only a few months after that film came out, so I guess Robert Kirkman figured people who enjoy this genre would just forget about it.

Kirkman's writing is presentational, convoluted, and overly worded.  Big shock that he's a huge fan of commas.  He has his characters speak about what they're going to do at length, then complete the action in no time; no doubt to leave more panels in the book for Kirkman's brillant (in his mind) dialogue.

The pacing is poor.  The characters are trite.  This is nothing new.  You've seen it before and done much better.  How this writer sells books amazes me.  Wake up, people.  The real zombies are the ones who continually read this guy's stuff
