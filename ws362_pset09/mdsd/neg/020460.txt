If you are a spiritual person this is NOT the book for you!!!  Some suggestions include casual sex, smoking pot, acting as if you are someone else, wearing clevage showing clothes, putting Hustler and Playboy on the coffee table, watching Deep Throat,whispering "I feel like I'm being raped" in your lover's ear, you get the picture !  I found myself laughing out loud.  They can't be serious.  Get yourself a book on meditation instead !!!
