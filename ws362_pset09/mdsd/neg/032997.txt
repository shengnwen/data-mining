BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, the textbook currently used in my Introduction to Management class, does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management.  The book is structured around eight 'roles' of an effective manager, and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role.  While I appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject, I do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow.  The reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency, and while meant well, they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper.  Furthermore, BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER stresses models and theories of management that I find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management, which are not adequately presented in the textbook.  Some of the models and theories have merit and should be discussed more in depth, but in a more advanced level of business management.  And while BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER is the official textbook for my management class, I have relied heavily on a different textbook for my information, and only the eve of a test do I bother to look over BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, I do not recommend this textbook for an introductory class at all
