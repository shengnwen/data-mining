This was a bit of a disappointment for me:  the writing is not inspiring, structure is a bit haphazard.  It IS useful for learning a basic--very basic--grounding in how Toyota, GM, and Volkswagen came to be and a bit about what happened to them in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  She is appropriately tough on GM--which I suspect is her real field of expertise.  She understands VWs problems pretty well--they are, after all, well documented.  She seems to understand Toyota far less well--perhaps understandably; it's clear that it's just a lot harder to understand what's going on over there.  Of course with the benefit of hindsight the clearest flaw in the book becomes obvious:  she equates Toyota's problems with those of the other companies.  And seems to predict that General Motors will come out on top.  13 years after the book was published--today--I read that GM's bonds had been lowered to junk bond status.  Volkswagen had a decent run in the 90s though things don't look so great now; Toyota is utterly dominant.  Unfortunately the fact that she got that so very wrong--who'd come out on top was the subject of the book--makes me question almost everything else she wrote.  Too bad
