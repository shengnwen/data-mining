If you're looking for writing that is as clever or as witty as Dean Koontz's, take one pace back away from this book. If you're expecting storyytelling on par with John Grisham, take another step back. If you're hoping for a story loaded with interesting tidbits and facts on par with Dan Brown, take another step back. 

This book was unoriginal, boring, predictable, and very cliche. Don't waste your time or your money like I did.
