I thought I'd like this book because it sounded sexy, funny, imaginative.  It was....in some parts of the book, but as a whole, it was predictable.  The story line was cute, but the whole "mom and boss" romance was a let down.  I gave this book two stars because some of it took me by surprise, but not much
