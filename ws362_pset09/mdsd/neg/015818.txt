Let me also say that I have read all of Sitchin's books and found most, the first 3 or 4 at least, to be fascinating. I anxiously awaited this "Enki" book, because it was billed as a narrative that would fill in a lot of the gaps and answer a lot of my questions. It failed. It is written in a poetic style that is tedious and irritating; the reverse sentence structure in particular (think Yoda). 

Rather than give any depth, insight, or fill in the gaps, it glosses over things as if they are a given. The ME for example. Mainly it just puts the story and information we already know from Sitchin's previous books in another format. 

Rather than rehash all of his existing theories and information, I would hope that Sitchin would move on to explore other areas or at least uncover new info on his existing subjects.  He could look into the manifestations of God in the Koran or Christian sacred texts, for example.


Something a lot of the reviewers/readers seem to be confused about: this is a hypothetical story; Sitchins idea of how it might have happened. Hello! The book makes that clear in the introduction. This is the Anunnaki story written AS IF it were translated from ancient Sumerian tablets, not translated from actual ancient Sumerian tablets. 

One thing that I have always wondered about and that I hoped this book would adequately address is how Nibiru survives a long eliptical orbit around the sun. This books seems to explain it away by saying that Nibiru has a dense atmosphere which protects it from the variations in solar intensity that such an orbit would cause. We know that even the change of of a fraction of a degree can have major effects on the earth's climate. It is hard to believe that life could survive on Nibiru as it is defined.  There may be some good explanation for this, but I have yet to read one.
