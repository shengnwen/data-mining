This book was worthless to me and would be to anyone other than a Yoga instructor.  I have been doing Yoga for a year and was looking for a book that displayed a wider range of &quot;exercises&quot; with descriptions of each.  While this book does in fact show 608 poses, it does not provide any instruction on positioning.  I use Yoga to complement my weight lifting and long distance running and this book does not do this.  Having said this, a professional Yoga instructor probably would know exactly how to do each pose and just having a visual representation may be quite helpful.  I highly recommend &quot;Journey into Power, How to shape your body, free your self, and transform your life&quot; by Baron Baptiste.  Don't be scared by the esoteric nature of the title, for me it was very thorough on the exercise part of Yoga.  I don't know why these people insist on attempting to inculcate this psycho-babble on people that may just be looking for exercise and the benefits of the relaxation.  No offense intended
