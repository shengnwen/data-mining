The book shows how innocent and peace-loving the Israeli government has been since the beginning of time, to only be "balanced" by how cruel and war-mongering the Palestinians have been.  If you are a fan of Israel, you will love this book.  If you are a fan of Palestine, you will hate it.  If you are in the middle, I only hope you will be able to sort out where the truth ends and the fiction begins before forming an opinion of the Middle East.  Bottom line, the "settlers" and Hamas are exactly the same mentality, while the remaining 80% of both populations are caught in the endless trap of -- "He hit me!!" "Yeah, but he hit me first!!"
