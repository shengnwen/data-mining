Unfortunately, not much good to say.  I ordered this book with great anticipation, given my familiarity with the European and Middle Eastern high-end property markets.  The title lends itself to expecting a sense of a dynamic portrayal of the true passion, power and property of Manhattan.  However, the book read like stale bread.  I could almost smell the mothballs and the pungent cedar scent of the endless characters who are from an age gone by.  Where is the extended perspective and insight into the more recent property upheaval, the characters behind the scenes who pull the strings and truly make things happen.  

Instead, were are taken through the hallowed halls of bygone era that smacks of a quasi-historical view of Manhattan's historical roots.  Why stop at going as far back as the 19th Century?  Perhaps Gaines would have done best to investigate the true Dutch and pilgrim roots of New York City.  When taking us into the present, or at least the recent past, there is only a very limited perspective of the very top 1% of the players, the movers and the shakers.  There is no intermixing of the various industries that together help shape the property market, nor of the machinations that inevitably get lost amidst the official stories that tend to make it to the social pages of the newspapers.

As a last note, Gaines, has failed to write a compelling book, written in an engaging manner that incites the reader to read further, with the excitement of getting a glimpse at the true Passion of Property in Manhattan.  Gaines has written a bland account that reads more like a tired summary of dates, events, names, and buildings
