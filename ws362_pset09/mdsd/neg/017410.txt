I understand the fascination with this 'book.' People want to make changes in their lives, find love, money, family, happiness etc - but people want to do it the cheapest way possible! Come on guys, are you kidding me? What do you actually expect for $5 dollars?
This book attempts to show you how to use goal setting to change things in your life, but there are so few pages, each with a tiny amount of information. I have seen one extended review here on amazon by a man called Brad Jenson. The pamphlet isnt much longer!

If you want to change your life then you have to INVEST in your future. Two books i have to recommend are 'THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO COSMIC ORDERING' by Andronicos Andronicou. Its expensive, but its worth it. A really fantastic book that expects you to go 'out there' but trust in it and you will get some amazing results. The other book is 'ASK AND IT IS GIVEN' by Ester and Jerry Hicks. The book will help you to find balance in your life.

If you are still wondering if this pamphlet will work for you let me give you a little bit of advice. Go outside, take a 5 dollar bill from your wallet, and set it on fire with a cigarette lighter. You may wonder 'what is the point in that?' my answer is that i just saved you a 2 day wait for an amazon delivery.

There is so much better stuff out there, go find what interest you, buy it, and change your life
