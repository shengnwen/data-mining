I purchased this book a few years ago, and I was disappointed for the most part.  It does give a little insight into some pressure points, but not much real application or specific angles at which the pressure points should be struck.  If you want some suggestions on some very excellent videos and books on very useful self-defense with pressure points, email me at toelio@aol.co
