This book is very disappointing. My main complaint is that many of the recipes call for ingredients such as frozen vegetables, canned soup, mayonnaise, and one which actually calls for an entire bottle of Catalina salad dressing. This really is not my style of cooking. Another reviewer commented that a lot of recipes need something done throughout the cooking process or are partially cooked on the stove before being put into the Crockpot. This was a big turn off for me too. I suggest trying a different book
