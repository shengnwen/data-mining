We bought this book for our 2 year old daughter, and even I had trouble putting the valentines into the slots.  The valentine was not very durable, and was starting to rip already after the first time we read it together.  I was very disappointed and returned the book.  It was not up to Sesame Street standards.  Try "Elmo Loves You" instead
