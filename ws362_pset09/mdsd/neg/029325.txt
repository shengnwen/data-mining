...because I have! In his book on ACC basketball. In some cases, he  didn't change a word....just repeated the same anecdotes. I am really glad that I didn't pay for this book because I would have been really angry about re-reading old material.

If you like reading about ACC basketball, and you haven't read Feinstein's verrrry similar book, you will probably like it.

If you like reading about Big East basketball when you're not reading about ACC basketball...you might like it.

If you think that the basketball universe is bigger than the ACC, the Big East, and Feinstein's apparent obsession with Bob Knight, save your money for another book.

It's too bad, really. Feinstein is a good writer. I guess the big buckets of cash he gets from each book he writes has finally caused him to lower his standards
