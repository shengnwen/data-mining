Reviewer Tad Griffin (above) presents an interesting dialogue between himself and a generic Evangelical, concluding that since they both believe in a literal, physical return of Christ to earth, they therefore should embrace each other as Christian brothers. "We understand the same Jesus differently" is the way he concludes it. The interesting thing is that a devout Muslim who's well educated in Christianity might make exactly the same argument (I should know, I'm a missionary in a Muslim country, and I've heard it before). It's not sufficient to point out a single area of agreement and conclude that all other differences are therefore irrelevant.

The fact is, yes, there are elements at which Mormons, Catholics, Muslims, and Evangelicals agree to greater or lesser extents (we all believe in angels, judgment day, heaven & hell, etc.). But it is where we disagree that defines the boundaries of our beliefs and affects the way we interrelate.

As a hospital chaplain years ago I met a Mormon who was visiting with a patient of mine. She claimed that we believed exactly the same thing - a lie I quickly, and graciously, refuted. The problem with her, and Tad, and Millet is that they focus our attention on the areas where we agree and gloss over the topics where we don't. "As man now is, god once was; as god now is, man may yet become." (B. Young) is NOT Christianity. The Mormon god's begetting Christ by assuming a male body and having sex with the Virgin Mary is NOT Christianity. Posthumous conversion into the Mormon religion is NOT Christianity. These are not trivial disagreements, and to write a book as Millet has done is a PR job, nothing more
