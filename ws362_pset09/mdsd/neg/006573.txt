I'll preface this by saying that I'm a university teacher who cares deeply about teaching, which I guess must be why this book was recommended to me in the first place. The early chapters I found simply intolerable, heavily reliant on unexamined truistic claptrap about self-knowledge, the soul, etc, etc. The whole book is overwritten and florid, like the inside of a greetings card. It is hard to be genuinely profound in that sort of prose, and I wished that Parker, who is clearly a wonderful and thoughtful teacher, had had the courage to write in something approximating the language of normal speech.

I said the book gets better as it goes: the chapter on subject-centered learning is absolutely first-rate, if you make it that far
