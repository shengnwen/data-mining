Firstly, this is a really quick read. I read the entire book on my lunchbreak. IMHO anytime one can do that there wasn't lots of thought behind the writing and this book holds true to that rule. 

I thought the book smacked of a huge ego with a touch of arrogance. Mr. Vincent mentions his most famous line "Go home and get your shinebox" from Goodfellas, at least eight times over the course of a few hundred pages. Do we really need to hear it again and again? I think not.

He also talks down to his audience in such a way that if you are not spending $25 for your Double R Davidoff cigar or dropping $250 on flowers for your date then you are not a "man's man". Not all of us are working actors who earn six figure incomes and can afford such luxuries. Most of us are regular guys making $40-60K per year who are in need of a few tips hear and there. 

I know it is a tongue in cheek kinda book but Mr Vincent should come back to reality when it comes to how much you need to spend in order to impress your date. If all it takes is money to impress then most of us are out of luck. And if all she is looking for anyway is a sugar daddy then who really wants to be with her in the first place? 

Save your money and wait for the paperback or better yet, get it from the library
