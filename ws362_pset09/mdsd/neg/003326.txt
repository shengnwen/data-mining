     First off, Desperation and The Regulators is not the same story. Yes certain characters are used, (some in name only) but that's all apart of the pun involved. The Regulators is supposedly the discovered manuscript of Richard Bachman, about an evil entity named Tak, who telepathically terrorizes a small suburban Ohio town through the use of a child's television heroes. Desperation, on the other hand, is about a mistakenly discovered tommyknocker, (not to be confused with the SK novel by the same name) who can manipulate and posses other living beings in the fictitious town of Desperation, NV. (Tak is also the antagonist in this prose.) 
     Without rehashing the synopsis of either book, this Stephen King fan enjoyed Desperation to a higher degree than The Regulators. In my opinion, the latter seems more of an extended short story and at no time did I find myself even remotely attached to any character presented in the material. Desperation however, was a more enjoyable read with a deeper plot line and thoroughly developed characters. If you happen to read The Regulators before Desperation don't fret. Neither book is in any kind of sequential order. Read one and think of the other as some sort of parallel universe.
