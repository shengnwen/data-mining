I read this book almost 20 years ago, but my feelings about it have dimmed not at all:  THIS WAS EXCRUCIATING TO READ!!!

From overdone prose to long-winded sentences that go nowhere, from punchless dialogue to non-existent suspense, this was the worst book I have ever read. I don't recommend this over-praised book to anyone unless they're having trouble inducing a headache for themself to suffer
