Many differences between Christianity and the religions that the author has studied are not mentioned in this book, and even further, some of the religious accounts that the author talks about are disputed. 

For example, take the Krishna-Christ comparison. Here, the author fails to note that Krishna was never worshipped alone; in fact, his female counterpart Radha is often worshipped with, and even before him. This is a huge difference in relation to Chist's story. In addition to this, the Krishna story that is used, including possible cruxifiction, is not widely accepted. The more widely known version is that Krishna died when an arrow pierced his foot, similarly to the later Greek legend of Achilles.

This is just a small drop of a pool of other similar examples.
In other words, read with reservation
