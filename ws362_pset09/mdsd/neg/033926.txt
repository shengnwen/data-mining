after anticipating this book to be published. I rushed to the store as soon as it was out I bought it. It doesn't come near as interesting, funny, up to the usual standards of Janet's writing. It left me flat you ask yourself what happened to the interesting quick thinking brassy talking characters from metro girl? I would not reccomend this book. When I read Janet's books I usually laugh out loud. Nothing to laugh in this book all old dialogue
