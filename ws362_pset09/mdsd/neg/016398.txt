Burke's most important work "Reflections on the Revolution in France" is reduced from nearly 200 pages to 60 pages in this volume.  Yet nowhere in the book does the editor describe what he selected or what he dropped, or the basis for his decisions. 

Comparing my copy of "Reflections.." to this chopped version I found that Kramnick had dropped passages that were highly insightful.  

When I discovered this, I could no longer be confident that the other works were not similarly mangled.  I will now search for an anthology of works that is more respectful of the originals (or at least one where the editor is more open about his approach)
