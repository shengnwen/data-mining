I pulled this book off the library shelf because the author's name is so close to Austen.  I was a bit skeptical because I knew she could never measure up, but this was even worse than I expected.  

Darcy and Elizabeth would have never raised their kids to have such a lack of propriety.  We all know how proper Darcy was and Elizabeth was so disgusted by her younger sisters, at times, she never would have raised clones.

Also, Jane Austen never wrote anything sexual in her books and there was plenty of it in this one, not harlequin romance sexual, but sexual all the same.  It just doesn't ring true for a period piece like this one.

If you are a true Jane Austen fan, you won't enjoy this book; it just bothers the soul
