Let's face it, not all reviews are going to be written by people that know the author, or will give him the benefit of the doubt.  We had to read this for a library information science class, and most of my peers hated it.  I showed it to my boss at our library and she thought it was ridiculous.  The author says the same thing over and over, in what could have been a 20 page essay.  I recommend looking elsewhere.
