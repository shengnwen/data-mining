Well, it seems anti-catholicism is everywhere these days.  First John Cornwell's "Hitler's Pope" now this wonderful book.  I guess the "enlightened" people of the Nobel Prize commitee must not be as smart as we thought.  After all, they actually gave Mother a Nobel Peace Prize. I suppose Martin King and Albert Einstein must have been frauds too, or perhaps Hitchens (like Cornwell) may a few facts crossed.  I'm just glad there is a generation of Catholic Apologists who can shed light on this type of "investigative jouirnalism"
