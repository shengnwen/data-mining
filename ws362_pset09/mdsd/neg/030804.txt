This book is fine for someone who is already organized, knows where everything is, and just wants a more streamlined approach to schedules and time management.  I may use some tips for organizing closets, etc, but  there was very little useful information to help me get motivated. Just  reading the book lets you know that Emilie Barnes is born organized
