This was my first book I read by Gertrude Stein, and frankly, it will probably be my last.  Her subject matter is bland and uninteresting.   I understand her rejection of conventional prose, and she does have a unique  style of writing, but I just don't like it.  I can understand and  appreciate why she wrote it the way she did, but it barely kept my  attention.  And her use of stereotypes was extremely blatant
