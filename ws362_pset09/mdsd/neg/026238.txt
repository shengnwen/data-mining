Good book. However,  it can be a lot better.


Pros:  Good recommendation on posing and lighting. He also talks about things you have to look for when shooting a wedding. He provides you a list of all the important shoots you must take for a wedding. 

Cons: Today you may find this book out of date. He talks about film photography and shooting Polaroid's to make sure the image is in correct exposure.

There are some pictures that are great samples and other ones that are terrible and embarrassing to show it on a photo book. there are some recommendations that I don't I agree with. For example he recommends using 1000 ISO. if so, pictures will look grainy in film and high color noise in digital. He recommends no to shoot with flash at churches even if they let you use a flash. NO WAY!!.  His sample pictures looks grainy and terrible because he didn't use a flash.  

The bottom line is: 
Intermediate and professionals may want to avoid this one. 
Beginners good to have it for posing recommendations, lighting, and a shooting list
