I appreciate that this book has a listing of all of the obscure desserts from the last thirty years.  However some of them should have been lost.  Some of the directions are quite detailed on plate presentation but vague when it comes to the execution of the item.  My other pet with this book is the lack of consistency in portion size.  But can someone tell me what is the deal with the pigs?  For the professional borrow someonelse's, for the novice walk away, for the scientist; good luck cause not all of the recipes have worked.
