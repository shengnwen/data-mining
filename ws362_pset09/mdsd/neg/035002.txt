I couldn't find a lot of real information for buying and selling on e-bay with this book. The book seems to have more on common sense than on laws and regulations. I admit that I bought the book to learn more about buying and selling as a hobby and I find it more directed at first time buyers or buyers only interested in buying or selling once. He gives no references to state laws or regulations. I found that in order to make the book work I had to find majority of the important information online. 

This book is good for people that are looking for an overview of what to look for in cars on e-bay motors. It's an easy read with large print (much how the Dummies books are written). If you're looking for e-bay "know how" experience, it's not here, so if you are new to e-bay, you should buy a separate book.

Overall, I think the book could have been better. It seemed to be a fill in the blanks kind of book when I was looking for answers
