This book is little or no use unless you have a very strong background in
field theoretical methods. If you are a seasoned pro.  you might find it
useful but if you want to teach yourself.... you  will soon get frustrated.
Still my hat's off to the authors who pioneered the area.
Conclusion: if you are a PhD student, get Fetter & Walecka instead
