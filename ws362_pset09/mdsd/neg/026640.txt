Too general to be useful.  Too trite to be tolerated.  I read the whole thing in about an hour, and realized it was geared mostly to non-fiction writers, held dubious advice about calling editors directly (against a mountain of evidence to the contrary about how much editors do not want to receive phone calls), and was really only a superficial glossing over the topic.  The 'Sell-Your-Novel Toolkit' by Elizabeth Lyon seems more helpful
