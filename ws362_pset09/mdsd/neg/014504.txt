This may be one of the most unsatisfying books I have read, which is a disappointment because I have enjoyed a couple of other Capote books, written before he succumbed to his own excesses and ego. This is so disjointed and lightweight that parts of it had me sighing in disgust, rueing the waste of a great talent. Capote seems to wear his crassness as a badge of honour, and while there is certainly nothing wrong with being proudly gay or even proudly wierd, he flaunts his strangeness in a way that becomes less endearing and more towards the annoying. It strikes me that Capote would have been a very frustrating person to know in real life - aloof and supremely selfish, a state most likely exacerbated by his addictions. The foreword to this "novel", written by its editor, hints at how difficult Capote was to deal with. Those points aside, all would have been forgiven if this had been a coherent, or at least interesting, piece of work. I found it self-indulgent, lazy and pretty much a waste of time. Its only value is perhaps as a cautionary tale for those who feel like wasting their talent.
