If people want to read a book that is more objective about this case please read, "Unplugged, Reclaiming Our Right to Die in America" by William Colby.  Mr. Colby is the lawyer for Nancy Cruzan, a case very similar to Terri Schiavo's, so he is very knowledgable about this topic.  He does not denigrate either family and approaches the subject of dying very even-handedly.  Reading either the book by  Michael Schiavo or the book by the Schindlers is an exercise in futility to me.  Both sides have their own opinion of what happened and are obviously very biased to their own point of view. This is a very dysfunctional family that will never agree with anything the other says simply because they do not like each other, and readers should understand this when they read their books. In between all this name-calling and accusations lies the real truth, as it usually does, and no one, especially the public, knows that real truth.

This is a case that should have never been so highly publicized, it just brought out the kooks and all those people who like to hear and see themselves proselytize on TV (including politicians) These difficult decisions are quietly made every day in this country (since the Quinlan and Cruzan cases) without any fanfare and this case should have been no different. And anyone who thinks "starving" Terri could cause the massive brain damage seen on autopsy is just plain stupid.  

Anyway, don't bother with this book or any of the other family-versions unless you want reinforced what you already believe is the truth......read something that is unbiased, objective, and neutral.
