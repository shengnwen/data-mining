I have read some of Meg Cabot's other work, and while a little entertaining, I keep hoping that the author will surprise me and come out with a good read.  I know chik lit is big right now, and so are mystery series.   So I assume that she was out to mesh the two together.  But she failed horribly.  The heroine's dialogue with other characters and with herself is so childish and unbelievable.  The circumstances surrounding the character and throughout the whole book are very generic and flat.  I really wanted to like this book, but it was just soooo boring and ridiculous.  There was not one redeeming thing in this.  If you are wanting a GOOD mystery/romance/chik read then I highly recommend reading Kasey Michael's Maggie series, or Charlaine Harris's several series or Carolyn Haines's Bones series.  And I recommend the author Jane Green for just a good fun Chik Lit read.   All which are much more entertaining, worth the time, and better written.
