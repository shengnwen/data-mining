This is a very self centered account. I got tired of hearing how great Ed Viesturs was and then I got really tired of all of the quotations from other sources about how great Ed was. I didn't get much insight into mountaineering or climbing philosophy. Somewhat of a shill for his commercial sponsor. Every time he mentioned leaving his tent, he had to name the make and model - repeatedly.
