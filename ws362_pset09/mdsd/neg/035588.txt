This is not scholarship, this is bad science fiction. If it was possible to give a book less than one star, I would--preferably minus five. All of Gardner's books are ridiculous, but this one goes even further than most. If anyone thinks this is scholarship, I suggest they actually read the footnotes and follow up. They will find there's nothing scholarly about it. I am all for alternative history, if it IS history. I'm also for identifying fiction as fiction
