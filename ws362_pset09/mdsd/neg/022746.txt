Starting with the good, this book has a lot of research that I found interesting. It is one of my favorite ideas for a book and maybe Stilgoe will rewrite it and make it as awesome as it should have been.

Now for the not so good. Unfortunately I wouldn't have been able to read past the first chapter if this book wasn't recommended to me in the Practical Spying Handbook.  I admit I had high hopes.  I thought this book would be about what I enjoy most in life, wandering around.  And somehow it was and still incredibly disappointing.  I was able to read the whole thing, but haven't recommended it to a single friend because it is written in an insulting tone.  Maybe Stilgoe can blame the editor for not laying down the law, don't insult the reader, they are the only ones listening.   

I was also annoyed how often the logic of "general people do general things, specific people do specific things" was violated. Stilgoe keep talking about the "explorer" or "bicyclist".  I assumed he was more often referring to himself.  The "explorer", a general term, did specific things like prefer to drink coke. I wouldn't have minded one bit if he just came out and said that is what he did, but that's not how it was written.

My recommendation for the rewrite of this book is to make it more like Folk Song U.S.A. by John and Alan Lomax, which tells great stories with a lot of historical facts.  Outside Lies Magic could really uses a little more adventure.  If Stilgoe decided to write another book and could combine the Lomax style with his research and ideas of our present world I would be interested.  But life is short and unless you read fast, I wouldn't recommend reading Outside Lie Magic.
