I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books and love them all. Except this one.  I just liked it.  It was okay.  Not what I've come to expect from one of my favorite authors.  I was excited to see that there were new characters and I did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them.  However the whole story did not develop very well, and it left me feeling like I missed a whole bunch of the 'potential' story.  I ended the book feeling like Ms. Cornwell was trying to make a statement to someone with this book rather than telling a story.  Very disappointed.
