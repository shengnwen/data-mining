It's not just that this book is written horribly (it's nothing but extreme excerpts from people who've obviously made therapy their personal hobby).  It's not just that this book fails to offer actual constructive ideas about dealing with trust issues (although it does explain, ad nauseum, all the ways you might see trust issues).  The real problem is that it sounds like the most old-school, formulaic psycho-babble you could possible imagine.

In a nutshell, here's what this book will tell you:  1.  it's all because of your parents and 2.  it's all because of your gender.  Helpful?  NO!

I really have no idea where all the good reviews on this book are coming from.  Seriously, if I didn't have such extreme trust issues, I'd wonder if the author didn't pay a couple of his friends to drop Amazon a note..
