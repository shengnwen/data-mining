This book was terrible and I put it down after the 4th chapter.  I've read some of these authors before and expected much more than they delivered.  The story is hokey, there are too many dull, unlikeable characters, and it was just a really unenjoyable read.

This type of writing exercise rarely works outside of a classroom, and it definitely didn't work here
