This book is an outdated snapshot of Wicca in the 1970's. It does not accurately reflect Wicca now, has some incorrect history (especially in regards to the genesis of certain traditions), and is completely impractical. 

If you are trying to learn about modern Wicca/Paganism and how to become involved and how to practice...this book will not help you. There is nothing here that shows you HOW to practice, nothing on how to learn, how to study, how to work ritual, and nothing here that gives a clear picture of the basic parameters of the Wiccan/Pagan Religions. It is overly long, too dry, and uninspiring. Completely impractical.

It gets two stars because of a great chapter on the Radical Faeries Movement and Men's Spirituality (wow, there's actually a God in Wicca?) and some interesting photos within.

This book was not for me, I don't recommend it for beginners or old-timers or even in-betweens like myself. It's "okay" but nothing special. Just...boring, and not helpful.

Far more practical, applicable and helpful (and in the same vein timewise and politically) is The Spiral Dance by Starhawk, it gives a much clearer picture and doesn't seem to ramble as much.
