This book is totally focussed on troubleshooting serger problems. It has good pictures and great solutions to correct all types of problems. It is a wonderful resource to have on hand because it addresses many situations that other books might not. I am glad I bought it and highly recommend this book. Also keep in mind that this book is a great supplement for your other serger books
