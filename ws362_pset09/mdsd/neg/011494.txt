First of all, I have to say Alice Adams is (was, alas) one of my favorite writers. Of short stories. Not novels. I was thrilled to have won a short story competition to be in one of her workshops. To me, almost all of her stories are perfect. I can read them over and over. Her novels, however, are a different story. Rich Rewards has its rewards and there is something intriguing about Second Chances. But all the others left me disappointed.  A disaster.  Which is how I saw "After the War" from page one. Ridiculous characters. A mess. I would rather that my memories of Alice Adams did not include this awful work
