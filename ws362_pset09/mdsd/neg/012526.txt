I have been non-recommending this book as much as possible to everyone I know. I was interviewed as a family member and former colleague of one of the fallen. 

I guess what bothers me the most about the book is the fact that he went out to everyone and told us he planned to write a book about what sort of boy grows up to be a man who would do that kind of work and make that kind of sacrifice...the environment in which he was raised...the family, town, etc. For this reason, we assumed this is why he wanted to come to his hometown: to see firsthand the environment in which he was raised. 

Then...out comes the book...and yes, there are bits and pieces in there about some of the men, but let's face it, it's mostly about the battle of Takur Ghar. Enough had been written already about that. 

My take: He told everyone that crap about his intentions and as a result, he was able to get access to people that no other author who'd wrote about Takur Ghar prior to that ever had...no one would talk about it, especially from special ops. However, when people heard he was going to write about some of the guys and their inner character and personality and not focus on the battle, people were willing to open up and talk about their sons, siblings, teammates, and friends. So, I was a extremely disappointed when the book came out and it wasn't what at all what he said it would be. In my mind, he used everyone. 

I too, did not finish reading it. I read the part about my brother, then looked at the mistakes he made in names and timelines and just put it right down. He even painted his hometown to seem like some dreary blue-collar town where no one would want to live and even portrayed his dad to sound like some brainless dude with a low self-esteem that did meaningless work to support his family...even his dad was much much more than this.
