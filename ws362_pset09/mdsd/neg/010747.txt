"Redesigning Humans" is an attempt to deal with the growing debate about whether or not science and genetic manipulation should be used to try to "improve" on our species. As several other reviewers pointed out, this book can be summarized as "Genetic manipulation of the human race will happen, it's a good thing, we'll all be better off, and although there are moral considerations, we won't bother mentioning any of them here". The book is essentially this arguement, repeated over and over. There is very little concerning the science behind genetic manipulation and absolutely nothing on the ethics of undertaking the redesigning our species. This book could easily be compressed into a three page article without significant loss of content. As one who has spent the last twelve years in medical research (including gene therapy), I found the book to contain almost no science, nothing pertaining to the ethics of what is propossed, and to really have almost no content. I do not recommend it
