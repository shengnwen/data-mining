The title of this book is misleading, as it is not at all about reading and writing Chinese language.  This book is about recognizing and writing Chinese characters.  This book is basically a list of single syllable words.  It is about as useful for learning to read Chinese as a brief dictionary of single syllable English words would be for learning to read English.  

The authors do include a very limited number of words of two or more syllables, but these are only needles in the haystacks of compounds in common use - as a glance at any Chinese-English dictionary quickly reveals.  According to John DeFrancis (The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy), only 30-44% of Chinese characters are intelligible in isolation.  Thus: the meanings of well over half of Chinese characters depend on their combination with other characters (as in English, a significant percentage of words are multi-syllabic).  Add to this additional shifts in meaning due to grammatical positioning and semantic context.  This means that even if you memorize all the characters in this book you will still not be able to decode the meaning of most sentences, phrases, or even compound words.  

This is not to disparage the book's value as a reference for recognizing and writing isolated characters, but it is to say that if you want to learn to read and write Chinese language you will need to take your learning in a different direction than you can derive from this book.  Shaum's Outline of Chinese Grammar (McGraw Hill, 2004) is one I would recommend for both reading and speaking.
