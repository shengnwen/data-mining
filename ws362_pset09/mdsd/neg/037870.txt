I love Sandra Boynton books, and have purchased each and every one.  I pre-ordered this book a few months ago, and was very excited to receive it.  After reading it, I was very disappointed.  It lacks the spark, wit, and imagination of her previous works, and I doubt I'll even read it to my kids.  It contains a nice sentiment, but I could spend a couple of dollars on a greeting card and get the same message.  I'll think twice before pre-ordering another of her books
