Let me first say, I have always loved Mary Higgins Clark.    Mostly because the plots are great and the reading is quick, generally comfortable, easy reading.

For some reason, I am having a horrible time getting through this book.  I have been reading it for a week now, off and on, and it still hasn't grabbed me.  I think I have figured out the ending and as I am 2/3's of the way through, I will go ahead and finish it.

If you are a true Mary Higgins Clark fan, you WILL be disappointed with this one.

Final note:  I couldn't finish the book.  It went to the recycle bin.  Ugh
