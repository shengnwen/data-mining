While you are all busy spitting at one another, Bill Maher is probably off cavorting with Hugh Hefner and his little bunnies.  Maher's association with Hefner is telling on many levels.

All of that said I think that people should view Maher(and read him so that his comments can be considered naked, without the veil of cuteness). He is an example to behold. Of what?
