Too bad that the last of the Ripley books was a bit of a let-down.  A great set up and interesting premise, the book is marred by its poor resolution.  What potential - two vulgar Americans who become Ripley's neighbors with a hidden agenda...the "cat and mouse" of this book should have been great, but sadly it falls short.  In my opinion, Ripley's Game is the best of the Ripley sequels - this one doesn't even come close..
