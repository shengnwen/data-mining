Racism and prejudice exist, but why thwart over it, it will only protract thoughts supporting these mindsets.  If people thinking otherwise will just disconnect from this mindset, stop conjoining the thought, over time it shall pass unless you stay configured in it. But if you continue on giving it attention will only fuel the fire. A good fisherman goes out of his way to bait his hook with what the fish prefer-which might not be a bad tip for those who wish to succeed in human relationships.  Just as in a conversation it's a good idea to listen more than you talk, it is also wise in relationships to think about the well-being of others more than you think about your own wishes and desires.  When you constantly strive to treat others in the same way you would like them to treat you, you become a person whom others like to be around, one who commands their respect, confidence, and loyalty.  When you learn to manage emotions and your ego, and when you learn to always consider the needs and desires of others, it is inevitable that you will "bait your hook" with kindness and consideration, and catch more friends than you can count.  My philosophy is, if you're not in favor of it forget it, it tends to disappear and go away.  But if you bait it, it just keeps on coming always to persist. You'll always be that person in the mirror, your semblance, but what's inside is of your control, and if you change your mindset it tends to attract like-types
