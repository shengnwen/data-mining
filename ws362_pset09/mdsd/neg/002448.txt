 The work "Island of Seven Cities" by Paul Chiasson suggests the existence of vestiges of a 15th-century Chinese settlement on Cape Breton. The complete fiction of these claims are demonstrated by detailed rebuttals here: www.1421exposed.com

The publishers Random House Canada have published this fiction as non-fiction with not one effort at verification of the claims within. They have in effect colluded with Mr Chiasson in deceit of the public and there needs to be public censure of such publishers who engage in such deceit with complete contempt of the public's interest
