The authors write:
It is clearly impractical to demand that the federal government immediately withdraw from education, health care, and all the other areas in which its current vast presence is, to our minds, clearly unconstitutional.  It is too late, as well as politically impossible, to try to lock that barn door.  (page 23)

I reply:
If it is impractical, too late and politically impossible to again constrain the federal government to the powers enumerated by the United States Constitution as meant by the framers, then there is no Getting America Right.

The authors write:
Conservatives do not dispute that government should provide assistance to society's weakest members.  (page 74)

I reply:
This conservative subscriber to the Constitution does absolutely dispute that role for government.  It was said of the late Senator Paul Wellstone that he was "the most-generous person I ever met . . . with other people's money."  Government has no constitutional authority to rob from Peter to pay Paul.  Charity is the job of God's children, one by one and privately.

The authors write:
Social Security has been helpful for the country.  It has saved millions of workers from the disaster of disability and has been the foundation for years of dignified retirement for millions; indeed, without savings or pensions from their employers, Social Security may provide their only income.  (page 78)

I reply:
Unconstitutional cannot be "helpful".  Further, the contention is nonsequitur when the authors are testing Does it promote self-reliance?

Good grief, the head honchos of the Heritage Foundation and Townhall.com neither believe in nor respect the United States Constitution.  It must be that the train called "America" really has left the tracks.  Nontheless, I'm gonna try to read the rest of the book.
