The death of Jean/Phoenix on the moon in UXM # 137 was one of the most emotional moments in the history of the X-men. It was a great story and a lovely conclusion. As one of my favorite characters, I'd still have preferred to have a proper burial for Jean and the emotional story intact rather then digging her up and putting her in X-factor for the sake of making a splash. It also establishes the first hideous convolutions of the Phoenix story, establishing that Jean Grey actually merged with a cosmic entity on the shuttle while leaving her old body behind in a coccoon in the Hudson. This is the beginning of the many complications of the Phoenix concept, once extremely elegant. 

Thankfully they have moved towards a cleaner and simpler explanation in recent years with Grant Morrison's [i]New X-men[/i] and Greg Pak's [i]Phoenix: Endsong[/i]
