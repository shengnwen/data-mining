I can't believe Leonard Maltin would put his name on this compilation of  misinformation. He must be spreading himself too thin and hiring interns to  do his writing. This book is so full of wrong dates, films, facts--I hope  if he comes out with a second edition, Maltin hires someone to go over it  with a fine-toothed comb and make corrections. I expected better of him
