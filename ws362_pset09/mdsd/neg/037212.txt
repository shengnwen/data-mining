This book was a huge dissapointment for me.  I am a stay at home Christian mother of 3.  It is the typical Christian &quot;fluff&quot; that so many publishers and authors are putting out.  I might as well have picked up an arts and crafts holiday book.  I am suprised that focus on the family affiliated themselves with this book
