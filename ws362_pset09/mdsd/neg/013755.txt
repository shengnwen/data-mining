I actually feel sorry for Jessica.  She reminds me of Jennifer Lopez in that she is always striving one way or another to get the attention of the public, regardless, of how it affects those around her.  This book is another self indulgent compliment to her narcisstic self as the book cover confirms.  Personally, I don't find her really that beautiful.  I can't help feeling Nick felt ripped off marrying this doll of the media.  Good luck to them both.  What happens after the dream wedding is achieved?  Will they both live happily ever after in their day-to-day regular life as a married couple?  I guess we all know the answer.
