My parents gave this book to me when I was a kid because I was a "late bloomer".  I really think that was the beginning of my self esteem issues.  I was unaware that I was a "late bloomer" until they pointed it out to me by giving me the book.  I can remember being so sad reading it and thinking there was something wrong with me.  Now that my daughter is a bit of a late bloomer, it's gotten me thinking about this book.  Please don't buy it for your kid.  If you do, please explain to them why you're giving it to them.  Don't leave it to them to draw their own conclusions that they are like Leo they can't do anything right
