I took a chance on this book and its author. I was extremely dissapointed, bordering on furious. Truth be told, I could only read the first twenty pages of this monstrosity. de Bono's routine insults of Western civilization, of logic and certainty, and his denigration of perhaps the three greatest men who have ever lived: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, were simply too much for me. It's possible I may try to read it again, but I won't hold my breath
