The first half of DISPATCH is very interesting.  It follows the life of a young man named Jason Hanford, who can get things he wants by writing letters.  The first hundred and fifty pages of this novel shows how Hanford learns to use this power to satisfy his desires, both good and bad.  I found this part of the novel to be highly original and quite engrossing, if a bit repetitive (we get many examples of letters written by Hanford).

Unfortunately, the second half of this story veers into a very different direction.  After a long buildup, Hanford eventually gets hired by a mysterious corporation to use his power for an unknown purpose.  At this point, the novel becomes increasingly surreal and silly.  I thought the final confrontation in this book was a major letdown and had no basis in reality whatsoever.

It also doesn't help that Hanford becomes more and more unlikable as the novel progresses, doing many terrible and hurtful things.  This made it difficult for me to relate to this book on any sort of emotional level.  Also, most of the supporting characters in DISPATCH are essentially caricatures, with little emotional depth or complexity.  This is especially true of most of the female characters in this book.

For a better treatment of a somewhat similar storyline, I would suggest Stephen King's short story "Everything's Eventual.
