Engagingly written and populated with real characters, I wanted to "like" this book. Unfortunately, it felt overly forumulaic in the sense that it reads like too many of its forerunners: a stimulus for a family to go home for a reunion, all members with their predictable crisis and secrets, marital strife, single pregnant woman, recently disabled man, the overdone lesson that you can't go home...  Not to put down a sophisticated narrative and emotional achievement, but I've read this story a hundred times.
