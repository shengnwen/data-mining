It is necessary to note that this book is required for CADC licensure in some certification programs.  As such, it is so poorly written and organized, I am finding it difficult to get through it. I am disappointed to have paid significant money for what is assumably quality research and information about substance use and abuse, presented in a manner that is careless and disorganized.  There are innumerable grammatical errors and the author lacks focus and consistancy within paragraphs.  It is inexcusable to read a "textbook," where basic sentence structure and writing is neglected.  While the information contained is assumably valid and of great value, its presentation is lacking at best.  I hope that future additions are more cost effective and adhere to a higher standard of professional educational writing.
