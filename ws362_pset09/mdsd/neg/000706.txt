I'm a med school student, and I hate to say that this book was not helpfull at all in my anatomy class.
It doesn't get into the specifics we were requiered to know. In addition, it is organised by systems, which is too different from most books and atlases, which are organised by areas of the  body (for example Moore's textbook or Netter's atlas). 
If you want a faster review book then your textbook, get Moore's essentials of clinical anatomy instead
