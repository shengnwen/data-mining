I agree with Mr. O'Connor about the insufficent length of the book (128 pages).  The author should stopped talking about the overall situation with regards to the Russian, Italian, Balkan, and North African fronts and concentrate on having the aces talk about their air to air victories.  Also, I am getting sick of tired of reading military magazines and books where the authors and writers are always saying that no matter how many victories the Germans won, as individuals or as a unit, in 1943 to 1945 in the air or on the ground, it did not change the outcome of the war.  It seems to be a standard writing practice to insert that kind of comment.  That is no comfort to the Allied soldiers who were killed, wounded, or became prisoners of war.

There should have been more color plates of the ME-109E sporting the Condor insignia. In addition, there should have been a color plate of Gunther Schack's Focke-190 because he was one of JG-51 top aces.  Finally, there should have been more FW-190 and ME-109 colour plates of other JG-51 Aces plus more of the colour plates of green-white camouflage FW-190s.

There should have been more individual stories of II/JG-51 pilots shooting down Allied airplanes in Italy, Balkans, North Africa, and Hungary.

Moreover,there should also have been a special chapter devoted to the Stabstaffel JG-51 aces and their stories since that squadron was the only one in the entire JG-51 to fly the Focke-Wulf 190 from 1943-1945 while the rest of the unit flew the ME-109 for the final 12 months of the war.

Finally, the author did the book Focke-Wulf 190 Aces of the Russian Front which was first printed in 1995.  That is more then enough time (11 years) for the author to find more stories of air to air combat victories by IV/JG-51 because it had re-convert back to the FW-190 in April 1945 particularly since the unit had acquired some Focke-Wulf 190Ds.  He should have been able to talk to the pilots about flying and scoring victories with the FW-190D.

Reviews were mixed.  The author did a good job in explaining the situation on each front.  When it came to the above sections, that I had mention, he did a miserable job.
