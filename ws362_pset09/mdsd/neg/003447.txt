This book is laid out for the absolute novice.  Considering Sammon's long career in photography, I am really very surprised that this book does not have any inspiring photographs.  Many of the lessons are repetitive - the same photos are used for various lessons and the same techniques are mentioned over and over again (i.e., photos - Hearst castle, Amazon Indians; techniques - nik Pro filters, Photoshop curves).  And some lessons are almost unnecessarily inserted on a whim. Sammon has a well-deserved reputation as a photographer, but his take on digital photography does not do justice to this exciting field.  It is an exciting time in photography, and Sammon fails to portray that excitement in his book. I would recommend Tom Ang or the "How to Wow" series of books for better content.  I hope to see a more inspiring book from Sammon in the near future.
