Generation Rx" begins by musing over an article in the House and Home section of the New York Times reporting the rise in popularity of "triple-wide" medicine cabinets - taller, wider, and deeper.  Cause of this phenomena - the average number of prescriptions/person was 7/year in '93, 11 in '00, and 12 in '04 - despite enormous uncertainty about their benefits and safety.  (There are an estimated 106,000 deaths/year from serious adverse drug reactions from just those properly diagnosed and taken.  Drug-induced liver disease is the most  common cause of acute liver failure - more than viral hepatitis.)

A major source of this growth is the increased amount spent to advertise prescription drugs to consumer - from $2 million in '80 to $4.4 billion in '04.  Protecting these investments and sales is an additional one-half billion/year spent lobbying by pharmaceutical firms.

So much for the interesting part.  The vast bulk of "Generation Rx" is a rambling series of anecdotes guaranteed to put the reader to sleep.  I instead would recommend "The Truth About Drug Companies," and "Overdosed America" - both written by eminent physicians
