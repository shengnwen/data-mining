I just read this series because I had picked up &quot;The Harrowing of Gwynnedd&quot; in a second-hand store and really enjoyed it.  Boy, is it obvious that this was written by a much younger writer.  The plot is  interesting, the action fast-paced, but the writing is pretty awful.  Let's  face it, having the villain stand on a hill and shake his fist at the  escaping hero is so cliched as to be embarrassing.  Read it only to fill in  the background for the other books
