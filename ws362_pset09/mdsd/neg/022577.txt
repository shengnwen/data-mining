I bought this book because I wanted to find something that would take my work beyond the standard fair of PowerPoint presentations.  I stumbled upon this book title just before its release and thought by the title that this was exactly what I was looking for.  Advanced techniques would give me a book detailing the cutting-edge of PowerPoint.  Boy was I wrong.  A whole chapter on text placement?  Other chapters detail creating an org chart, creating templates, and using the text tool.  Does that sound like advanced techniques to you?  Sorely disappointed in the book.  My quest goes on for a cutting-edge PowerPoint book
