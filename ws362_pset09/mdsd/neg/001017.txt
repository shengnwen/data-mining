the author starts writing about herself.  There were parts of this book that were an absolute joy to read...but eventually, they were marred by the author's relentless self-promotion and conceit.  Reading this, one would  get the idea that Fran Gage single-handedly created the California cuisine  movement.  She mentions landmarks such as Chez Panisse or famous chefs only  to imply that they were influenced by her.  However, when she sets aside  her bias to describe food and cooking, her writing truly comes alive.  An  uneven book, and certainly an exasperating one to get through
