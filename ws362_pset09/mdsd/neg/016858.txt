You can also read my review of the series in my review of the 1st book.  Basically, I just want to restate how un-impressed and how boring this un-inspiring series was.  Donaldson focuses so heavily on his writing style and his portrayal of a one-dimensional self-pitying Covenant that he forgot to write a story which would captivate his audience.  Instead he writes a very rudimentary, unimaginative, predictable plot with flat unbelievable characters.  My suggestion is not to waste your time reading this series as I did
