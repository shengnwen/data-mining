Scott apologizes numerous times for rambling on and on in both his introduction and conclusion.  If you can control yourself and continue reading (even though this part is really really boring) you will actually find a story.  I am a bit biased for this book as I have toured Scotland and even seen Scott's Abbotsford home, but it isn't a bad book.  It is interesting for its portrayal of Scotland and the people there in the 18th century.  The characters seem a bit mysterious and far-off, because of this I never connected to them.  There is an attempt at a sort of Braveheart story, but it is neither touching nor inspiring.  If you are locked in a damp Scottish castle or if you have a STRONG interest in Scottish history then this book is worth a read.  Other than that, read something else
