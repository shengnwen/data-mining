If you want to be told that you are a procrastinator and that you need to make a schedule to find the time to get organized than this book is for you. But if you are truly disorganized, sitting down and making a schedule is the last thing you will find the motivation to do. The author tells you,"don't procrastinate and get organized, set goals and make a schedule," but she doesn't offer any real techniques to help, and she attributes laziness to messiness. I recommend 
you read, "The New Messies Manual," by Sandra Felton. She takes the time to explain why you are disorganized, and HOW to get organized. She explains how to change your thinking to help you change your habits. Unfortunately, I expected more of that from this book. It is a waste of money and very dissapointing
