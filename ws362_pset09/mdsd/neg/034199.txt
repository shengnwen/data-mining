Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book. I think
the information is all there, but it is so poorly organized that
I was frustrated and gave up.  The size of the book should be 
smaller or the margins wider.  I felt that I was turning my head
from left to right to read everything.  The organization was 
muddled and I just couldn't follow what she was trying to say
very easily.  It seemed that she typed it on a computer and then
just put a cover on it.  It needs some professional help.
