I live in Texas and have read in the news about the discovery of the Belle, and LaSalle's adventures.  I have also visited France many times, and I was looking for a good book to send to my French friends.  Not this book.  I've only read half of it, and then I gave up.  It is a very hard read.  Sometimes it reads like a history book or narrative, sometimes it reads like a commentary on history, and sometimes it reads like an editorial, with comments made on other historians.  To the extent that it is a history book, it does not always appear to discuss events chronologically.  It's hard to tell sometimes because it is such a hard read - hard to follow.  It appears that the author skips around a lot, and there is not a good flow to the writing.  Also, there was very little in this book on the recent discovery of the Belle
