For over ten years I've used Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book for making yeast and leavened (wild yeast) breads.  Mostly the former.  It has one recipe, however, for a whole-grain leavened bread which is more sophisticated than a rustic sourdough.  That recipe alone is worth the book's price and produces a more flavorful and healthful bread than the sourdough leavened white bread I just made using a recipe from Classic Sourdoughs.  Additionally, Classic Sourdoughs is not well edited for clarity, contains a fair amount of incidental information not relevant to learning how to bake breads, and lacks the extensive research that went into creating Laurel's Kithchen Bread Book.  Unless you cannot obtain good quality whole wheat flour or have a strong preference for white flour, Laurel's Kitchen is a much better value for your time and money
