I'll make this short and to the point.  This book exemplifies the worst aspect of the so called "religious right."  It shows that being judgemental is more important than being tolerant and hating is better than loving.  Worst of all, however, is that this author believes he is bringing to light Christian values that have supposedly become "lost."  I'd like to ask this Dave Kupelian one question:  Have you ever even read the Gospels?
