Since its publication a number of important books have been written substantiating the Bell Curve hypothesis.  The most direct arguments are given in "IQ and the Wealth of Nations" and "Race Differences in Intelligence," and "The g Factor."   Authors who pussyfoot around the factor of race in the heritability of intelligence, but whose work generally supports the thesis, are "The Journey of Man" by Spencer Wells, "World on Fire" by Amy Chua, and at the pinnacle, "The Blank Slate" by Stephen Pinker.  

There is a marked difference in the tone of "Measured Lies" from these others.  "Lies" is strident; the others have the measured calm of scientific works.  While the others project scientific objectivity, "Lies" is insistently moralistically.

The argument does belong in the realm of morality.  Lies' authors find it "hurtful" and "unutterable" even to discuss the possibility that there are differences among the average abilities of different races.  On the other hand, observing the vast difference in the accomplishments of different races, not only in the U.S. but between and within countries throughout the world, a great many observers have come to one of two moral conclusions:
1)  Certain peoples do not achieve because they are morally deficient: lazy, given to drugs, oversexed or whatever, or,
2)  "Hegemonists" such as European nations or Caucausian people systematically and immorally frustrate the aspirations of other peoples through subtle racism.

Either way it is a blame game.  And profoundly immoral, if the blame is not deserved.  

The gauntlet is down.  There are so many scientific, statistical studies supporting the hypothesis that there are systematic differences in group abilities that egalitarianists must fight fire with fire.  It is time to come up with some valid science to refute these claims, or gulp and accept the findings
