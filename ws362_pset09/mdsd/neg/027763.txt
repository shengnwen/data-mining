We don't all live by farmer's markets or in big cities. Too many ingredients (some hard to find in many places) and too long preparation time for stressed out families. I'm sorry Jamie, but I don't have time when I come home from work to crack open a coconut and shred it for fixing a sallad which, by the way, my family won't like. The amount of fat, especially saturated fat in the recipes is astounding. Fine for once a week, but for everyday?  I was very disappointed in this cookbook, I'm sorry to say
