I tried Bruce, I really tried.  There is a parallel between this work and his old pal Raimi's film "Army of Darkness."  Both had that type of unexpected success with previous attempts at their craft, unfortunately further attempts to capitalize on that success fell short.  I don't wish to be critical of those that enjoyed the aforementioned, but high expectations have a way of making an otherwise lukewarm piece seem that much more disappointing.  I'm a Bruce fan and this book is a must have for any of you wishing to delve deeper into all that is our favorite, unsung and oft neglected Hollywood hero.  However, caveat emptor; especially if you're searching for that groovy sentiment we've all felt before
