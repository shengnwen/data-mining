This book expects a lot out of students, thereby requiring instructors to work even harder at presenting the material in a meaningful and understandable way.  Unless students have previously had precalculus (including trigonometry), or had a thorough preparation in algebra, this text will be highly confusing and discouraging to most of them.  It is an inadequate preparation for calculus at best, as it completely omits many key concepts that will be necessary for the study of calculus.  This is a well written book for mathematicians, but not for students just grappling to learn this material.  Unfortunately, there are those who are involved with the "Calculus Reform" that believe this "Applied Approach" is the best approach.  If people really wants to learn about applied mathematics, they need not look any further than physics
