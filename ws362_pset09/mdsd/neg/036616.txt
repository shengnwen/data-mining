The hardcover and the e-book version should not be linked together because the e-book version is only 12 pages! Complete waste of money, I wish I could return it. I made the mistake of reading the review of the hardcover version (which is shown on this page too), and since I had already read the original book, I though I was making a bargain. The joke is on me... :-
