I finished The Second Premiter most convinced of the author's conflicted attitudes about, what?, the CIA?  The sub-theme of this work is:  We should not use harsh interrogation measures (he defines "harsh" as Abu Ghrab), or it will recoil back on us. 

After years as a "senior civilian executive" for the US Navy, he convincingly describes bureaucratic bumbling.  One of his villians ends up sort of a hero (after contributing to several deaths), and the big villian wouldn't have been a villian had not the CIA abused her as a captured spy and killed her lover in a gunfight she and her lover initiated.  Shame on the CIA.   

Two heros, one who blames the CIA for making the major villian a villian in the first place (forget aboiut being a spy, that's just a game), and the other, a quasi-Barney Fife political functionary who provides comic relief as the book moved toward its somewhat bathetic (with a "b") close.  In short, Mike Lawson had a story to spin, done reasonably well, but it gets muddled up with his sub-themes of (1) the beltway intelligence bureaucracy is a mess (so what's new?)and (2) the behaviors of the CIA are at fault for motivating our enemies. (It's all our fault.)

His years at the US Navy Dept didn't leave him a true believer, that's clear.  I'm surprised Vince Flynn is one of his jacket endorsements.  The New York Daily News says, "Thrilling enough to demand a sequel."  On balance, not.  Unless he's ground his axes to satisfaction and can just spin a yarn.  (Why do so many current fiction writers have to indulge their biases? WE READERS DON'T CARE.)
