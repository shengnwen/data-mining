I purchased this book last winter, hoping it would provide additional valuable insight into ways to differentiate within my 5th Grade classroom.  I was sorely disappointed, however.  I found the book to only "skim the surface" of the entire concept of differentiation in general.  It was more of a broad-based introduction for a new teacher, rather than a valuable reference tool
