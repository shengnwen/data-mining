How could the author of so great a book as "The Company" draft such a mediocre cliche-ridden effort as this.  One reason, I submit, is that he couldn't make up his mind if he wanted to write a historical novel or a spy novel.  He had a similar dilemma in "An Agent in Place" where he couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a love story or a spy story.  "The Company" was a whole dimension above most spy novels.  "The Once and Future Spy," sadly, is simply a uninspired work. The plot was highly improbable, the characters lacked credibility, and Littell resorted to too many cheap plot tricks to speed the book along, at the cost of believeability.  Even the whole theme of "whose truth?" also is not all that unique.  Don't want to give the ending away so I won't say any more about that except that, personally, I found the ending to be highly unsatisfying. I still have a few more Littell books to read and I am hoping that I will get from them the deep pleasure I got from "The Company."  Littell's capable of much much better work than reflected in this novel.
