The dust jacket indicated Ralph Peters was well known for thinking outside the box which is something I admire greatly.  So it was with great disappointment to find the same old machismo that has attempted to sell itself as startegy since men first fought.   Hardly outside the box, it is the same old nonsense that attempts to argue that a lever is unnecessary as long as you have a sledgehammer.  Occasionally Lt. Col. Peters and I would agree on some minor point but the overwhelming emphasis of the book is little more than a defense of the very worst in the status quo.  

If you are looking for a lot of tough talk without much analysis of the facts, this will suit your fancy.   If you are looking for truly outside the box thinking, you will find little of that in these pages.  

The chapters are, in essence, newspaper and magazine clippings of past works so it makes for a quick read at least.   The message that seems to come through though is not a positive one.   The tone seems more fitting a ranting blogger than a cogent student of military tactics or strategy.
