Of the 16 essays presented in this collection, only three were worth my time:

(1) Orson Scott Card's Introduction is a very informative and thoughtful analysis showing how TV has evolved over the last half-century and how LOST may be the next "evolutionary" step.

(2) Amy Brenner's "Double Locked" illustrates how the fictional character John Locke closely echoes the teachings of the real-life 16th century philosopher with the same name.

(3) Glenn Yeffeth's "The Art of Leadership" is the highlight of the collection, which discusses how Jack, Locke, and Sawyer are all really bad leaders. And it puts forth a pretty good argument that Hurley may be the best leader on the island.

Some of other 13 essays fall into the category of Comedy.  "The Same Damn Island" points out the show's similarities with Gilligan's Island.  "LOST Connections" attempts to concoct a conspiracy theory based on which actors have appeared on film together throughout their careers.

"The LOST Book Club" and "Have You Been Framed?" examine literary allusions and shared themes with classic works.  "LOST in Love" tries to analyze every love pairing on the show.  Surprisingly, only the essay "Game Theory" actually attempted to explain the mysteries; but I really hope the show doesn't turn out to be just one giant video game.

"Oops" and the Encyclopedia are both out of date, due to events that been aired since the publication of the book.

Overall, I guess I wanted more of these authors to present their theories to explain the mysteries.  Instead, I felt most of these pieces were just fluff and "talking head" analysis
