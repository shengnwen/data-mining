Yes, the history of Maria's, tequila, and the margarita are interesting.  Some of the "tidbits" are also interesting and useful.  There's a foreward by Robert Redford to boot.  But the fact still remains, this book consists of one basic recipe repeated again and again and again.  And I don't buy the argument about the careful match of tequila to a liqueur. After reading the book, I couldn't shake the sneaking suspicion that I'd been had. If you're looking for some margarita recipes, search the internet and skip the book, I just don't believe it's worth the price
