First off, I am on the Fat Flush Plan, and enjoy it very much. However, several things about the plan and this book in particular really offend me:
1. The name. This is supposed to be a plan about cleansing the liver and following a healthy lifestyle. I tell no-one how I lost so much weight, because the name is embarassing and offensive.
2. You have to buy many books to understand the whole plan. I find this to be greedy on the part of the publisher. Just publish the plan, or even all the recipes in one place!
3. The cookbook has much filler material, very few recipes, and an absolutely useless index. I don't know about you, but the index is the most important part of a cookbook for me! This was horrible.

So, this book has turned out to be one more waste of money
