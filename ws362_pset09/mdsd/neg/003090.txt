This book is OK as a VERY basic introduction to Icelandic. You learn the word for "coach" (ruta) before yes and no. Also, the exercises are short and insignificant. When you learn about declensions (probably the most important aspect of Icelandic grammar), all the book has is a long paragraph, a HUGE graph (with vauge footnotes "There is a subgroup of masculine nouns which has -ir instead of -ar in the nominitive plural and -i in the accusative plural". No hint of these words), and one, measly fill in the blank activity.

This is good if you want to become vaugely acquainted witht the language, or if you just want to learn a few phrases. For the serious Icelandic student, get the Teach Yourself book
