Although I admire Clare Clark's effort and the amount of time she must have researched before writing this novel, a story of murder in the sewers of London in the 1850's, wasn't enough to hold my interest. I think she has great writing ability. Her descriptions in the sewer are palpable but could not hold the paper thin plot together. Nice try but I pass.
