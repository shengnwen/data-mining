I recently travelled to the Dominican Republic and purchased this guide for my trip based on the online reviews. 

Although the book is informative and does offer a good selection of transportation and hotel suggestions, it is unnecessarily and generously sprinkled with negative commentary on the country.  

On my travels, I had the pleasure of travelling throughout the island, from West to East.  It was difficult to find a chapter in this book that did not offer some kind of caustic negative comment on the area being described.  

After reading the guide for a few days, I was so distracted by the constant negativity that it overshadowed the content.  I hesitantly continued reading it only because I did not have a better one at hand.  I would not recommend this particular guide.
