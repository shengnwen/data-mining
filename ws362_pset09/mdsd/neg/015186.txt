I was glad to see Slaughter going outside her "Grant series" comfort zone.
Having read her first book, which really didn't impress me, I was curiously excited to see what she could do in a standalone, after reading a great review of Triptych in the "Philadelphia Inquirer".  She and fellow suspense/thriller writer, the British Mo Hayder, have respect for each others work and I've read several articles where Karen praises Mo for her fearless, realistic portrayals of violence.  "Mo Hayder is the bravest writer I know" is quoted at the top of her (Hayder's) latest book.
 
I think Slaughter was looking to write Triptych in the same kind of atmospheric, graphic, factual, and realistic vein of Hayder, but it just didn't work.  On the plus side, it is a quick read, and I never put it down due to boredom.

Michale Ormewood, the detective we are introduced to in the beginning of the story, has a life so bad it could be parodied in a country-western song.  Then the POV then flips back and forth b/w 3 other characters with the proverbial hearts of gold, hearts which she kinda wants to hide from her reader, but not very well.  They're all "survivors"; though unfortunately their personal backstories aren't dealt with enough emotional complexity as they do not survive the crime of cliche.

I also kept waiting for a final twist, because I couldn't believe a book receiving such good reviews would give the game up half-way through, but it did.  It's just not layerd and nuanced enough for my taste. If you want a book with a realistic depiction of graphic violence, this author, though she does get mentioned frequently in this exclusive club, simply isn't a good enough writer to be at the top of the list.  Look at Val McDermid or Mo Hayder for the real McCoy, this is a cheap imitation.
I understood where she was going with this story, but she just couldn't quite pull it off
