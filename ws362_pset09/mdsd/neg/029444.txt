This book is full of typos; what happened to proofreading...is that a lost art/job?

This book is also a good example of what Andy Rooney spoke of; authors making thousands on the backs of others.  Nothing is original by the author in this book; it is merely a compliation of the works of others.  You would think at least, since the author did have to compose anything, she could have at least proofread it
