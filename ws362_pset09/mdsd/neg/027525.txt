I don't know how this totally inferior book got published. If I'd seen the cover before I bought it, saying she'd seen every Shirley Temple movie 8 times, that would have given me a clue as to her taste and I would never have bought it.  A waste of time and certainly no one could consider her a responsible movie critic.  The movies recommended are hardly 4 star movies.  Most of them aren't even worth seeing.  No wonder you probably haven't seen them
