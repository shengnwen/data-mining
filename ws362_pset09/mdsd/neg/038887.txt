I was disappointed by the books in this collection. They're abridged versions of these titles. For instance, Day at the Beach (a book we were replacing because it was lost) was missing at least 2 or 3 pages! How many pages are there in one of these books anyway...10? That's a lot of pages to remove, so I think this is a ripoff, pretty uncool of the publisher, and the titles should be labelled as "abridged". Not recommended.
