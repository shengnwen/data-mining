  I am new to P D James. I am thankful that this story was so short. I felt that there were certain plot machinations that were improbable (people coincidentally running into others, fortuitously seeing others, too clever 'clues'). Characters behaving much differently from one point to another. And finally, the real murderer getting away with it! The disfiguring of the corpse by the bad guy was out of character and unneccesary. Certainly a risk his character wouldn't have taken. Also why protect Simon only to murder him later? The horrific sendup to the Devil's Cauldron fizzled out, in my opinion. Then to use it in the finale in the manner it was (foolish Cordelia, again) was cheap. Cordelia going to the island unescorted 'knowing' that the owner was the killer was sheer stupidity. She probably didn't star in any future mysteries because she'd been killed by being too naive. One last thing, I wonder if Cordelia had ever heard of a tape recorder? I should think the police would've prosecuted her for allowing a killer to go free by her impetuous behavior? This story smacks of someone needing a new car or a fancied bauble. Dashed off for a quick buck.
