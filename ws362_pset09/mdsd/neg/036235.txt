  "Andrew Carnegie: and the Rise of Big Business" was the worst book I have ever read.  I went into reading it with an open mind, and after the first chapter I wanted to pull my hair out it was so boring.  
  First off, the book took place in a time period where I wasn't even born.  My parents weren't even born yet.  It has to do with a subject that I don't even know about.    
  Second, the author dragged on and on about numbers and business partners and business investments.  He was using words that were not in my vocabulary.  
  Finally, the plot and main ideas of the book were so slow.  They jumped around and I didn't know what business we were talking about, or which business partner was involved.  They talked about money and finances.
