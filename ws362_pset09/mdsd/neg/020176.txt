This is at least one book too many for Peter.  Most of the stories are old and too many involve farts.  If you find this funny, your sense of humor has not developed since the second grade.  The book is full of errors.  Peter tells how Riviera is one of his favorite courses and then tells about his hole-in-one on the 15th hole. Sorry, Peter but the 15th hole is a par four.  You made your ace on the 14th hole.  It is evident that Peter not only did not write the book, he didn't even read it.
