The first three books in the saga of Kay Scarpetta were readable, even good.  The character was sympathetic, as were most of those who were involved with her.  However, the stories and the characters quickly sank into self-pity, whining, and self-absorption to the point that they fast became unpleasant at best.  After some time, this reader decided to give Cornwell one more try, picking up Blowfly off the bargain table with much hope.  That hope was too soon dashed to small pieces.

First, the readers have not been dealt a fair hand in the matter of Benton Wesley, the man Scarpetta loved and who died a horrible death in an earlier novel.  Pete Marino, the detective Scarpetta worked with in Richmond, is even more irascible and surly than ever before.  And Lucy, Scarpetta's niece, now heading some sort of investigative/para-police group, is whiny and vicious.  Worst of all, though, for a professional, she makes one of the stupidest mistakes in the very beginning of this story that a person in her field could make.  Readers have to wonder how she has survived this long.
