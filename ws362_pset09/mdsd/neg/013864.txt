this book was nowhere near as good as gail's other books, but if you read this and dont like it, dont give up on her yet!!! ella enchanted was so good, i have rad it eight times, the princess tales are great for bedtime, and the two princesses of bammare is also amazing. i have not read her later books for younger childeren though, because they do not look as good. soon a new book called fairest is coming, so i hope she is getting back to her old ways. if you are a fan of gails better books, then i suggest you try reading shannon hales books
