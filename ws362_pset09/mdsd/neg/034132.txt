Pigs at the Trough brings up all kinds of problems that present serious complications to American democracy and to the honest running of the market system - corporate corruption, conflicts of interests, tight connections between business and politicians, the lack of a tie between executive compensation and company performance, the malfeasance of the big four accounting companies.

Unfortunately, rather than analyzing these problems in a serious manner, she has written a harangue, full of name-calling, insults, and anger.  She seems to hope that inciting a listener's outrage will inspire action.  In this sense, she seems to have underestimated her audience - as though she'd lose their attention if she toned down her arguments and delved into the substance.  The audio CD was read in a breathless and sarcastic manner, which quickly became tiresome.     

Everyone seems to be evil in her opinion - from politicians to lobbyists to corporate executives to pharmaceutical companies to mutual funds - the big and rich against the rest of us.  The suggested solutions, which take up a small section near the end, focus on what should be done, without little depth on who should take the steps and how this can be made to happen.  

The benefit of the book is the bringing to light of issues that affect many Americans but are not often discussed in depth in the general media.  One can hope that someone else will pick up where Huffington started and provide a more sober analysis.
