This is one of those books where you like the idea of the book but not the book itself.  This book didn't really make me feel anything. I never got so that I cared about the characters. I never came to feel that the characters cared about each other either.  This is one of the books that you know you read but you just can't really remember later on. I wouldn't recommend this
