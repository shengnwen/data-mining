Maybe this book is good if you don't know any better, but I couldn't help but notice a Zionist slant when it came to discussing either the greatness or victimhood of the Jewish people, as compared to only about 6 instances of mere mention of the Arab people but only as slave traders.  So, there you go, the vilification of Arabs yet again by an unsuspecting Zionist.  Only 6 lines dedicated to a people who have been greatly instrumental in much of civilization as we know it today, and all this person can say is they were instrumental in the slave trade?  And lest we forget, Palestinian Arabs have been and still are victims of the criminal Zionists going on over 100 years now!  Where's that mention?  I thought this book was about race, why not mention the racism that exists today that is wiping out a large group of indigenous people today, the Palestinians!  Looking at the mega ratings this book has gotten, I suppose I'm one of the few people who would notice such things because this sort of Zionist superiority and Arab bashing is so rampant in this country it's often overlooked and is why it's so easy for us to bomb Arab countries without too much of an outcry.  But Arabs have contributed greatly to our world especially in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and astronomy, and I happen to be a big fan of their contribution to arts (especially music) and literature (too many to mention).  So it seems I will have to continue my search to find a book that isn't so self serving and narrow in its agenda disguised as defining race and culture.
