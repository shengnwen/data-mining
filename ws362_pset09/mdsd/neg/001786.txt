The author lacks of moral clarity in the issue of the Middle East.  It seems that the only democracy in that region has the fault of everything. As Mr. Sharansky explain in his last book, "The power of Democracy.....", there is at least two  ways to know when something is anti-Semitic.  1) when someone compare attitudes as diabolic.  Ej: compare Israel politics as Nazis, or the way Israelis treats Palestinian as Auschwitz (Saramago). 2)  when someone like Mr. Swisher critics  the attitudes of a Nation o people, but says nothing about the same attitude in others country or people.  It seems in these books, that Palestinian terror does not exist, that suicide terrorist take places in another planet.
And yes, despite the many interviews he made, witch are interesting in many cases, this book is anti-Semitic and anti Israel, with no sustainable bases.
