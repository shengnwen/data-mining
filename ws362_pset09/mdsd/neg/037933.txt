Interesting to see a book like this come from Prestowitz, former Undersecretary in the Reagan Administration.   Back then it was America losing its good jobs and future to the Japanese.  Remember them?  Japan, Inc....central planning...national industrial policy...would soon be running the world.  American debt, loss of technological edge, outsourcing would all mean the USA would be reduced to second-world status by 2006.

It was precisely because Prestowitz's Commerce Department let the 'hidden hand' of the market prevail that we wound up with the economic boom of the 90s.

So it is very strange to see Prestowitz ring the same alarm bells he firmly rejected a generation ago.  Seems every economic book I read these days remeinds me of the early 80s....alarmist.  That is not to deny the issues he raises in this book, but to paint a grim and destitute future for the American economy is tired and not well thought out.

That, in the end, is why this book only gets two stars.  Intellectually it's bereft.  Nothing new here
