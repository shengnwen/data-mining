Well, the two Beth Manners CD must be the worst "bilingual" type CDs I ever bought. We are a bilingual family, and I bought this to play in the car.
The idea is nice, but the non-stop translation is cumbersome. After a while, if I were not fully bilingual I would wonder which is translating which (the word before or the word after?...)
I expected games, with explanations, "fun". I did not see the "fun" nor the "magic". And forget about "immersion"! 
All the kids on the CD have a thick foreign accent...At least there are no huge language mistakes / bizarre use of the language that we would not use etc.
Instead, try "lyric language", although for older kids...much better.
