This book certainly wasn't the worst book I ever read, but it was not as fabulous as it's made out to be. 

It was raw and honest and I like that. But the author was a bit full of herself and self obbsessed. Yes, I know thats how 15 year olds are, of course I was there not too long ago. Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book more if I were 14-15-16 years old, not 21. 

Mostly it is very repetative. We hear about how she is more intelligent than her lazy classmates a thousand times, we hear about her obsession over her gay best friend a thousand times, etc etc. It's the sort of thing that is interesting, but better in small doses. It is the sort of thing that would work well in a zine, a little bit at a time. As it is, I found myself reading just a bit, putting it away for several days to read something else, etc. 

Also there several points were it was way too vauge, and I found myself getting frustrated.

I'd probably recommend this book for 16 year olds. But if you want my honest advice, see if it is available at your library so you can read it for free and only buy it if you really will read it again. And don't buy it as a gift for someone because you "think it's thier style" Only give as a gift if someone specifically asked for it by title.
