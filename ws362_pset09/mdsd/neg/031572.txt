This book was recommended to me by an accupuncturist who did a great job on my back.  I found it contradictory and ultimately confusing to the point of being useless.  Readers are encouraged to diagnose themselves as being damp or dry, warm or cold, with an interior or exterior issue, and with an excess or a deficiency.  (There may be more categories, that's all I can remember now.)  The main problem with the book is that if one is, say, both damp and cold (which Pitchford states is a common combination) then the dietary advice is contradictory.  One chapter says to eat raw vegetables, the next says no.  One says eat meat, the next says no.  One says fruit, the next says no.  One stresses brown rice, the next says very little brown rice.  In addition, being too far along one axis is the same as being the opposite condition.  If you just said "Huh??" then get used to it if you order this book.  

Lastly, the big puzzle to me in reading all these 5 star reviews is that not one person (unless there is a review I missed) discusses how their health was improved, how they lost weight, anything!  Isn't that really the proof of a book on dietary recommendations?  

Bottom line:  eat whole foods, not processed, organic if possible, and a variety of produce, whole grains, and small portions of lean meat.  I just saved you 700+ pages of reading and $30-something.  And you're welcome.
