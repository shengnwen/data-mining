The most interesting part of "Uncle" Walter's book, nay, the only interesting part of this flimsy self-serving memoir, is the former CBS (as in "see BS") anchorman's statement that to avoid WWIII, "a system of world order--preferably a system of world government--is mandatory." He also speaks of "social and political and economic evolution, which will explode with such suddenness as to have the character of revolution." He adds that "the revolutionary forces are already at work today, and they have humankind's dreams on their side." Revolutionary forces? I thought he just said it would "have the character of revolution" but would, in fact, be an "evolution." Get your facts straight, newsboy.

Of course, I haven't heard about these "revolutionary forces" on the network news, and neither has anyone else. But then Walter and his fellow news reporters in the mainstream media are not and have never been reporters. They're propagandists, making and shaping the news according to the dictates of their corporate owners. If those elitists can benefit from a war, Walter and company will beat the drums so the American people will go along with it. As for that "world government," Walter promotes it because he's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and other New World Order groups who are, indeed, the "revolutionary forces" of whom he speaks. They're forcing their "revolution" on a world that doesn't want it, and the beast of the Bible's book of revelation will rule the one world government of which he speaks. And he knows it, too! Like most CFR members, and like all those who are promoting the New World Order, Cronkite is an occultist whose broadcasting career was all voodoo, a way to cast spells--broadly--on the viewers to prepare them mentally for the godless dictatorship that is soon to come.

Uncle Walter is going to Hell, kids. Weeping shall be there and the gnashing of teeth. Don't forget the Poligrip, grampa
