Horrible. They're young. They're old. It's the past. It's the future. Nothing is as it seems. Nothing makes sense. It's just a bunch of garbbled trash. Poor Grant Morrison had to be under the influence of some illegal drug to actually think this mess made any sense. Stay off the dope, man. It messes up your mind. I had to force myself to finish this. It was painful, but I did it. Horrible. Awful. Please, don't waste your money. I'll tell you all you need to know... at the end they disband the JLA. Why they do is not important, because in the very next issue (JLA: Strength in Numbers) they re-group. Skip this book and go straight to "Strength in Numbers", which is far superior than any of the previously published JLA books (Rock of Ages, being the worse)
