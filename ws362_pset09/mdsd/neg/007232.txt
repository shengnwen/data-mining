This book is very boring and it swerves around the theme repeatedly.  This book could have been written in less than fifty pages and it could have been more exciting for high school students like me who have no interest in  politics whatsoever.  It's a shame that guys can spend all of their time  writing a book like this when all this information is readily available in  any encyclopedia.  Once again, we have an author who doesn't understand the  true meanings and values in life!  He does not care to appeal to the  public; instead, this book is a product of his own urge and desperation
