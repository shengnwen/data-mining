Maybe it's me, but I think that if you're writing a light-hearted mystery with a lot of one liners and some characters who are so exaggerated as to be basically comedy relief more than real people, maybe you shouldn't punctuate it with scenes of grotesque violence.  There are descriptions of acts in here that reminded me why I was never able to read "American Psycho"-- really appalling, hideous stuff.  And yet the book is clearly a comedy.  I just couldn't reconcile the two aspects of the book.

There are some other problems:  I saw the major twist coming from around page two-- Konrath uses a gimmick that should be retired by now; it's been done so often that it just leaps out at the reader.  Jack Daniels repeatedly acts in ways that violate any willingness  to suspend disbelief: she knows that she's targeted by a psychotic who's torturing people to death, you'd think she'd take the situation a tad more seriously.

This is the first book I've read by Konrath, whose jacket blurb conceals his/her gender, a move about as coy and pointless as much of the book.  I seriously doubt I'll ever read another
