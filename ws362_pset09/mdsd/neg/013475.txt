I actually like the pictures in this book and find it a nice book to read but I have found, as other people have, that the basic cupcake recipe for Chocolate Sour Cream Cupcakes does NOT work.  I have tried it three times and (once totally ignoring the book method and using a method from another tried and tested book) found that each time the cupcakes sink and form huge craters that leave the cakes unedible.  I am an avid cookbook collector and cook and have never found this problem before.  Such a shame as the book looks so nice.
