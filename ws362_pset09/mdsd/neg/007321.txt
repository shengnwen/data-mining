Grammar is something you need to study, certaintly, but this book is not the way to go about it. Oftentimes, examples of English grammar are given, only for the next passage to say &quot;in French this isn't important.&quot; The book ends up seeming like a self-indulgent exercise rather than a useful tool to teach yourself French grammar. My Education Abroad program recommended this to me before I went to France, but if I were you I'd ignore any such recommendation
