I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?

I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.

Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.

2 Stars.
