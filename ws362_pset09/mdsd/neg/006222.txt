This book is a prime example of the old adage: "Those who can't do, teach." The author of this book has never been the primary author of a major scientific paper (he is a professor of English), but he tries to give advice on how to write an effective scientific article. Because he has little to say on the subject, much of the text is made up of amusing anecdotes and quips rather than substantive guidelines. An example of the unhelpful advice he doles out is on page ninety-two, where he advises the reader to submit a typed, rather than handwritten, manuscript to the publisher. He litters his chapters with cute Peanuts cartoons depicting Snoopy getting rejection letters from publishers: a great way to take up space, but not useful to someone seeking practical advice on how to prepare a scientific article. He also gives advice on good grammar, which is more within his area of expertise. But there are better books on the subject of good writing, the classic example of which is Strunk and White's Elements of Style. I would advise the fledgling scientific writer to read many scientific articles in order to learn how to construct them effectively. On the other hand, if you want to learn how to write a whole book about something of which you know almost nothing, Dr. Day's "How to Write & Publish a Scientific Paper" would be a great place to start
