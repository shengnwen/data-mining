I worked in this area in a peripheral way for many years. Bamvord didn't go into details because he did not know any. I was disappointed in most of the book. His little political asides smacked of Democrat talking points. He could have covered the downsizing of intelligence gathering during the Clinton administration, but didn't. I enjoyed reading about Crypto City and the references to Seymour Cray and the super computers. All of the two hundred references cited here saved the book from being a total loss.There could be a great book on this subject but this wasn't it.
