Some of her points are good and she can support with Bible Wisdom. Others I feel are her own opinions. I really did not like her views on childbearing. How can she make the statements she makes when she herself has never been married or bore a child. If I am not in the Will of God for practicing family planning would that not mean she is not in the Will of God for not marrying and reproduing offspring??? I feel that she is making judgements and the only person that can make judgements is God and If a women chooses not to marry and have children or she chooses to marry and have 500 kids that is her choice and we are not to judge either decision.
