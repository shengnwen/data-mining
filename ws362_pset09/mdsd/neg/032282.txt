AArgg..  I'm increasingly disgusted by the authors self-promotion.  In each of their books it gets worse!  This time there is almost a chapter dedicated to refering to the authors other works and worse yet refering to starfist!!!  

Pat yourselves on your backs some other way guys.  It's shameless and tacky the way your doing it now.

As for the rest of the book....Simplistic with sci fi techno toys thrown in to liven up the plot.  The main series is better but as filler Force recon isn't bad.

Buy the book used or borrow it from your local library.  It ain't worth the full price
