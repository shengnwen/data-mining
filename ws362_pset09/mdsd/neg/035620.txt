I've been a Heinlein fan for a long time.  My problem with this book is that it is not what it purports to be: a book in the Heinlein style, written as a collaboration between Heinlein and Robinson posthumously.

If he wanted to do a Heinlein book, Robinson should have done two things that he did not do: 

1) eliminate, almost without fail, every single vulgarity or swear-word in the book, and

2) not directly related elements within the book to our "real world".

Every time I saw a swear word I was reminded that this was not Heinlein.  (I am hardly prudish, but I know the Master could write about things such as polyamorous bisexual group sex between related people, or convey absolute disgust and hatred, without once using Anglo-Saxon terminology).

Every time I saw him talk about 9/11 or Star Wars in the context of future history, I was reminded that this was not Heinlein.

The real disappointment is that Spider //should know better//.  Was he trying to put his mark on the book with those swear words?  How could he not know that these would be jarring to those who were looking for Heinlein?
