I had used some of the earlier books in this series to teach my children and had enjoyed them.  In this last book, however, the author is writing about history that many of us have actually lived through.  I was disappointed and surprised to find that her writing was so biased and opinionated.  I really wish she had just stuck to the facts.  Although she is entitled to her opinion, and these opinions gave us a lot to talk about, because of her own bias she emphasized certain issues and people, while barely mentioning others.  Towards the end of the book I found that she had some of her facts simply outright wrong, and this was disheartening as it cast a shadow on all the information reported in her other books.  I found it very surprising that a history book for children would have errors in the facts, and that it would be used to so shamelessly support someone's personal political agenda.  Again, there is no reason why someone can't write and publish a book like this, but it should not be presented as an unbiased children's "history" book, because this book is certainly not that.  I was quite disappointed
