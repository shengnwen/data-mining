The only reason to go for this book is if you are a real collector of sex instruction books and need to have this to complete your "classics" section. This book was written a long time ago and is rather "out of date" and certainly not informed about alot of the really powerful devellopments in human sexuality which have occurred in the 90's and beyond. I mean, even lame sex-instruction authors like Nora Hayden and Lou Paget do better than this re-issue. If you really want to get something worthwhile in this category you should look at "9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power" by Clint Arthur. That book is very modern and covers all the bases. Or go for something on video like Dr. Corynna Clarke's "Goddess Worship," which is a truly fresh and beautiful look at "modern sensual healing.
