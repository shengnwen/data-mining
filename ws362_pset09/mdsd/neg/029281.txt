If imitation is the highest form of praise, then this book must be one of the most praised books in the English canon.  A man from a middle-class upbringing leaves it and ends up stuck on a tropical island.  This story would inspire Swiss Family Robinson, Castaway, and probably Lord of the Flies.  Mr. Crusoe is a white, Englishman with a wife and kids.  After the wife dies, he leaves the kids to go on his own and to serve God.  He ends up stuck on an island by himself.  There he encounters cannibalistic natives, and one of their intended victims.  The former scares him, and he essentially enslaves the latter, teaching him to call him Master.  

The book is not that interesting, as tales of desperation and survival are actually quite common
