Though I wanted very much to enjoy this book, I can't in good conscience recommend it. When  dealing with historical facts (the expansionist policy of the new government of the US vs. the interests of the larger tribes -  the battles in Canada, etc.), Eckert held my interest. When he intersperses  his own florid imagination in portraying Tecumseh's personal life he tends  towards purple, mythic prose that tends to make Tecumseh superhuman rather  real. Tecumseh emerges as a one-dimensional, single-minded hero who is the  main character in a Tragedy, rather than a flesh-and-bones human being who  happened to be a great leader of an ill-fated insurrection. For those  looking for a story with real pathos, told from a more controlled, but much  more powerful point-of-view, read Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded  Knee. Brown doesn't overdo it as Eckert does. He lets the story tell  itself. The result is much more affecting and agitating. Eckert's treatment  is exceedingly heavy-handed, Brown's more impartial, but ten times more  poignant. After reading Tecumseh, I asked myself, &quot;Why did I invest  time in this book?&quot; After reading Brown, I wanted to go find Custer's  grave and personally desecrate it
