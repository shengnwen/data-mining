I admit it, the 12 steps to Raw foods should have given away that this book is just a rehash of 12 steps. 

What I expected was an actual 12 step program to familiarizing myself with raw food, and processes, and grocery lists. 

This book is so subjective it kind of turned me off from the raw movement. It's a little creepy actually. Someone, please suggest me a better raw food book
