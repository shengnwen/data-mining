Icky, ick, ick.  This diet book has absolutely no scientifically proven nutritional info to back it up.  It is a fad diet through and through and was so successful because it got tons of publicity and the public is so clueless about nutrition and so overweight that they will listen to anything for help.  However, this book is lacking in so many ways.  Agatston is probably as clueless about nutrition as you are if you are looking into purchasing this book.  Take a look at healthy 100 by John Robbins or Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, M.D.  If you do read either of those books, you will understand why I am proclaiming this.  I am also a nutritionist who has a broad background on nutrition.  If you buy this book you will not be following the best diet for your body and may suffer some health consequences.  Joel Fuhrman, M.D. is a medical doctor who specializes in nutrition.  He has helped people to not only loose weight but helped people to get ride of health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, lupus, migraines, and myraid other health aliments, even cancer.  I had a medical appointment with Dr. Fuhrman once and I could not respect the guy more.  He is a nice person who truly cares about your well being and health.  I have not met John Robbins, but in his book he also comes off as genuine and caring.  I cannot say that about Agatston.
