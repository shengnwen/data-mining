I was aware that I was buying a miniature edition of the book, and I expected it to be small.  Maybe not this small (3"x3.5"), but small.  But inside there isn't a whole lot of useful information unless you've never drank alcohol before.  There are only about 50 recipies, including stuff like Gin and Tonic, which is like a cookbook containing directions for making broccoli.  I give it a 2 because it has some interesting information on alcohols, and it has some good recipies.  However, the Internet Webtender is a great place for much, much more of both of the above
