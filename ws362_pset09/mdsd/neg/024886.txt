What does Mr. Riley have against bunnies?  I read this book in the bookstore and found it disturbing. The truth is bunnies don't contemplate suicide but sick people contemplate killing helpless animals. Perhaps thats where the ideas stem in this book. I'm asking the bookstore to remove this book from its shelves. It is a sick and cruel attempt at humor. It belongs in the same wastebasket as the "roadkill" candy.
