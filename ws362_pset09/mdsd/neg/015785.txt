While I didn't partiularly care for this book, I can see how others might like it.  I'm not a big fan of fake meat products, and this book has an over abundance of recipies featuring processed "meat" analogs.  I very rarely use this book for this reason.  That being said, I do enjoy her baked goods section.  So, if you don't mind the vegetarian "meat," you may like this book, but if you don't like it either, then you may want to go with her other cookbook, "the Soy of Cooking," which tends to use more vegetables, temph and tofu rather than "meat.
