May I first applaud Dr. Schneider in seeing the value of alternative treatments as opposed to traditional medicine.  However Dr. Schneider as with most Md's is not a good source of information on alternative forms of treatment.  Md's are lucky in their 1000+ hours of education to get one 1/2 of a class on nutrition and alternative therapies.  Therefore their knowledge base is close to nil.  Most of the stuff he lists is mainstream knowledge. His research is not complete and most of it requires you to talk to your MD first who in turn would very unlikely recommend anything natural. However, because Americans have a love affair with their Md's they spend 244 BILLION a year on drugs.  This in turn has made Dr. Schneider's profession one of the top five leading causes of death in the nation (JAMA). Because of this Md's who are seeing a shift away from traditional medical care can capitalize immensely on this shift in care by billing themselves as experts.  I'd recommend someone who has MANY years of experience in nutrition and alternative therapy.  Nutritionists, Naturopathic Physicians, Ayruvedic Physicians, Doctors of Chiropractic and Osteopathic Physicians are much better sources of info.  Think about it.
