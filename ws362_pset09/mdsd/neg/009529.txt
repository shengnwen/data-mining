I love the explosion of colors that Kaffe uses, both in mosiacs and quilts . This book has a ton of brightly colored mosiac pictures in it...lots of interesting ideas...fairly good instructional pictures but all in all , I didn't like it and returned it . There was only one project (the broken pottery flower pot) that I would have even considered doing and it, too , was just to busy looking for what I was interested in doing. If you love the color explosion that always come with Kaffe projects then this book is for you. If you prefer something a little toned down , or a little structured, then this book is not for you. Hope this helps someone decide
