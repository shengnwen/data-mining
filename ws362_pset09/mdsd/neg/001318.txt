I am preparing for CIPT exam. I thought this was the preparation guide for CIPT. I was hoping that this book goes in depth analysis of all components of CIPT clearly. In my opinion, this book is short of explaining VoIP protocols. It needs a little more elaboration on the fundamentals. For example, I read about clusters in this book. I was very much confused. Then I read about the same subject in Cisco CallManager Fundamentals. It was actually a streightforward concept. All discriptions in the book are confusing, and insufficient. I vote strongly against this book if you are planning to buy this book only because you are preparing for the CIPT test. It might be a good reference for using the CallManager menus
