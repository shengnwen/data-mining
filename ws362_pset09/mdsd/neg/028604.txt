I loved the Jesus Mysteries so much. I was so excited to see this book in the store. I brought it home and could barely but down my bag before I opened it up. And that is where it all went terribly wrong. Instead of giving us facts it gives us slander and ridicule. Instead of breaking down the historical inaccuracies of the Holy Books of the three Genisis connected world religions it attempts to give us the impression that believers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all idiotic and naive. It was more of a sales pitch for Gnosticism then an accurate portrayal of the majority of believers. I love the idea of the book and I am still a huge fan of The Jesus Mysteries but I was extremely dissappointed. (I also missed the inclusion of footnotes in so many places). Instead of this book read The Bible Unearthed. It gives the information without tearing people apart and calling them names
