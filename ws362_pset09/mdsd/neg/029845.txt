This book has the dubious honor of being the WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ.  And with the variety and amount of books I read that's saying a lot.

Poorly written, thinly (and that's generous) developed characters, trite dialog, and was there a plot in there somewhere?  I never met a more unlikeable protagonist than Maggie, nor did I care what happened to her or her ex-husbands.  And WTF was Baraba Streisand doing in this???  Truly a nightmare of a novel.

Note to Mr. Patterson:  When you go through the process of writing a book, convincing people to publish it, then ask readers to invest time and money into purchasing and reading it, have a point.  On behalf of all the readers who suffered through til the end, I demand our time and money back
