I am 37 years old and trying to determine if I (and possibly one of my children) have ADD through both my own research and thorough medical and psychiatric investigation.  This was the fifth book I read on the subject, primarily to gauge the 'flip side' of the arguments in this area.  All authors are entitled to write their own opinion, it is their book, however I encourage potential buyers to do some research about this author and her biases and to formulate their own opinions to determine how much weight to attach to this information as it is presented.  I struggled to agree with much of the content as it does (as advertised) run contrary to most everything else I've read and most everything I've experienced personally.  I further don't believe there was any earth-shattering revelations nor reasoned counter-arguments to the mainstream ADD body of knowledge
