On avrage, I read fast.  I read a copy of the edition that was 264 pages.  Normanly that would take me 2 days.  This boring book took me about a week.  From the begining, this book was dull and hard to understand.  I would NOT recomend this book to anyone who doesn't history fiction.  It had some crude parts, as well
