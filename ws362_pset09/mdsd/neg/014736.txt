If you're looking for a graphic novel that both provides good story and good art, then you might want to pass on this book, especially if you're a fan of Marvel during the 80s.  House of M did nothing but bore me to tears because nothing much happened except for at the end with the whole "No More Mutants" deal.  

I'm a big fan of alternate reality stories and was looking forward to seeing what the marvel heroes would look like here.  I was very much disappointed because with the exception of a couple pages of Ms. Marvel and Wonderman in action, the world of House of M was a boring one where people did boring, everyday things with the only difference being that some of those people had purple skin and butterfly wings.  I would have cared more for the emotional side of things if it hadn't been that I was bored out of my skull and the emotional moments came at the detriment of the characters.

Do yourself a favor and pick up Age of Apocalypse instead
