I looked forward to receiving this book but was sorely disappointed with what it delivered.  I've had the same thoughts on employee recognition forever.  There were no new ideas and very little specifics on improving recognition.

It is set up in a format where you can have a daily reminder that employee recognition is good and that is the best part of the book.

Definitely not a must have but a decent addition for your bookshelf
