It might be useful for potential customers to understand that this is basically a literature review by an attorney who has PN, not a book written by a medical doctor experienced with treatment of the problem. The book seemingly includes every possible literature reference to treatments, and many anecdotal comments/cures. It is very much like what you might find if you searched every issue of Prevention magazine looking for cures for a desease -- one would find everything from herbal cures to surgery and would have little idea of what, if anything might work for you. Perhaps this is the best one could expect, considering the apparent lack of science on the desease, and some may find it informative, but it was disappointing to me
