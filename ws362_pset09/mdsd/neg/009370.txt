The recipes have severe errors that make the instructions confusing or utterly impossible. I just had to throw out yet another batch of cookie dough after following a recipe from this book. I have now tried seven different recipes from the book, and am ready to gift to someone I particularly dislike. Seriously, save your money, do not buy this book.
