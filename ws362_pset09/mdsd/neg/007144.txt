I am a long time fan of le Carre - have read and loved all his books - until this one. I just could not summon the interest to finish it. Yes, I'm sort of curious about why this guy's wife was killed, but not curious enough to wade through all the documents and emails et cetera ad nauseum along with him to get there. I was on vacation and had nothing else to do, yet still, I could not wade through this mind-numbing book. I got about half way through - did I quit reading too soon? Did it suddenly pick up after that?

If you're new to John le Carre, start with an earlier book - seriously. Because he's a wonderful writer, really
