The End of the Hamptons is less than meets the eye. The author has done little serious research and conflates gossiip with his superficial and dated Marxism. Indeed, to suggest that the secessionist movement to create Peconic County was Marxist inspired, as he does, borders on the psychotic. 

Harold Wit and I founded the Group for America's South Fork, yet the author spoke to neither of us.  He gives enormous credit to one individual, Hal Ross, who played only a minor role in the environmental movement that arose from a passion to protect the farms.  As the author of the Suffolk County Farmland Preservation Act, I  find this incredible. There is a real need for a serious study of what happened on the South Fork politically and socially, but this is not it.

Ian Marceau, who was the first director of the Group for America's South Fork, and who is lauded as a kind of saviour by the author, told everyone that he would work for the developers if they paid him more than the environmental group did. But don't look for this or any other truth in this slight and useless tract. The author's hatred of the Hamptons has its origins in the politics of resentment, which is utterly tiresome.
