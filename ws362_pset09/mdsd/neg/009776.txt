Lovely cover......... Liked that the Malory's are sprinkled thru out. But it really felt as if someone else wrote the book. Jumping from location to location, insipid heroine, couldn't get to know the hero. Thru the book whick took me a week to read because I was so reluctant to pick it up again and again, I would find myself saying 'this suck' and it is soley becasue I expected a Johanna Lindsey book, not a first attept. 
I regret that I didn't like it. I wanted to .
