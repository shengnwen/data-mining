I was very excited about receiving this book, but then was disappointed to discover it was Christian-oriented.  From the description I was led to believe it was metaphysical in nature, so I'm returning the book.  I was hoping it would be a great addition to my collection of metaphysical healing references. This would probably be a great book for someone of the Christian faith, but it will not work for me
