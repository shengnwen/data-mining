I don't have any comments regarding the this book's contents, however, I do want to make customers aware that I ordered "How to Manage and Own a Beauty Salon" by the same author and this is the book that was sent to me, instead.  Considering this book was shipped to a prison, I had no way of returning the item immediately but have since informed the prison that the incorrect book was mailed.  I've complained and complained and still haven't received a proper resolution.  If any one happens to experience this same error, please refer to this comment.  What I experienced was not acceptable customer service
