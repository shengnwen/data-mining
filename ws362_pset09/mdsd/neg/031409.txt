What America's Christians need to understand that getting closer to God involves opposing the Jews.  Why is this the case?  Because the Bible teaches us this.  Jesus Christ opposed the Jews and called them the "Children of the Devil" (Gospel of John) and St. Stephen opposed the Jews and said that all Jews are evil.  St. Paul warned against Jewish converts to Christianity who tried to make Christianity pro-Jewish.  Why do some people ignore all this important teaching in the New Testament.  Being anti-Jewish is integral to Christian holiness
