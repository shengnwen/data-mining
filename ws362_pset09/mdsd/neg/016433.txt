Judge Pressler's views in &quot;A Hill On Which to Die...&quot; though may be sincere, lacks the breadth of theological understanding of the various expressions of Christianity. Pressler, like many Fundamentalists, fail to accept that much of our understanding of scripture and theological concepts are interpretations and very few of the arguments that he is willing to die for would effect salvific truth. Every sincere believer and every denomination thinks in one way or another they have the &quot;correct&quot; view and interpretation. The problem is not believing. Pressler is correct in his argument that one must stand firm in one's belief. However, his failure in the book is the adequate display of the fact that Christianity, even among  faithful Southern Baptists, is broader than the narrow views which he holds. His concepts of Christianity would undoubtedly reject the Christianity of C. S. Lewis (Anglican), J. I. Packer (Anglican), Eugene Peterson (Presbyterian), Mother Theresa (Roman Catholic), and the vast majority of both main line and evangelical Christianity. For these reasons and others, I would not recommend this book
