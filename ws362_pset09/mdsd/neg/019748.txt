I'm a teenager and I've memorized every single aspect of the Inheiritance trilogy and when I got this book for Christmas I was expecting something useful. Instead I got nothing useful. The author has no idea about the books. She says that Durza(A shade) taught Galbatorix the secrets of dark magic wrong. There are many other 'facts' in the book that aren't even in the books. She says that ERagon is attacked by trolls in Eldest. Never happened, ever. Don't buy this book for anyone. They'll be sorely dissapointed
