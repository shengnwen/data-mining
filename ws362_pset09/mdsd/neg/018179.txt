The differences between females and males was truly the best part of the book. After that I had several disappointments. As a single Mother I am looking for suggestions and guidance. This author states that no matter what we do as parents are children's lifestyles and habits are based on how their brains are formed!! How discouraging. There were also other references that go against my own personal and spirtual beliefs. My suggestion to other potential readers is to read this book from a different perspective. Do not read it as a guide as I did. Read it as another viewpoint out there about the incredible world of boys
