It hasn't been clinically proven that Perricone skin products work. My mom (age 46) tried them anyway, and they didn't work.

His advice to stay away from grains (and whatever comes from them, of course) is great, but not new. Yes, farm-raised salmon is screwed up, eat the wild one, but again, I knew that already.

And I disagree with his complicated "system" of taking supplements. If you just eat normal food, like vegetables and fruit, NOT grains and soda, you won't need supplements. The only supplement you need is fish oil, since farm-raised animals that we eat lack necessary fatty acids
