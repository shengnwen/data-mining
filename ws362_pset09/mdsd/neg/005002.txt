I'm not a kid, I just didn't want to have to sign in on my screen name.

Anyway, I had to read this book this year for American History and I have to say that it was just God Awful. This is some of the most hackneyed reading I have ever seen. Not only are the characters ridiculously boring, but the story is just plain bad. Everything that you would expect to go wrong does, everytime things start to look up, something goes wrong. The metaphors used in this book also sound like the first attempts a 3rd grader trying to use metaphors. Not only is it bad, but Yezierska is just plain inconsistent with her characters.

*Spoilers



After his first wife dies, Reb remarries but his new wife is just after him for the money. When sleeping at his house, his daughter hears his new wife trying to get the still weak Reb to sign over his inheritence to her. The daughter quickly gets up and yells at the new wife. The next day though, the wife is now helping the husband put on his clothes and is asssisting around the house and the daughter realizes that he is dependent upon his new wife. There is no explanation for her sudden change of heart, it just happens. Then the daughter makes some food for the new wife who in return makes apple struedel for her and then they become the best of friends. The whole novel is like this with it's stupidity and inconsistency. Even our teacher said that its a pretty bad book, but that we read it because its a first hand account. Please, dont think this book is worth getting, it's really just a horrible piece of recycled trash you've heard a thousand times
