As a somewhat unorthodox Christian, I am not opposed to efforts to revisit the earliest sources of Christian tradition in order to discern the original teachings of Jesus and his followers.  It is indeed quite possible - even probable - that those teachings underwent transformation and development, and that some of these developments eventually ran contrary to the original teachings.  There are books that follow this process in a way that is intellectually respectable and based on sound scholarship;  this book - unfortunately - is not one of them.  

This book will appeal to those who despise orthodox Christianity yet feel a compelling need to reinterpret Christianity according to their subjective psychological needs.  For such people, facts do not matter, and any theory which radically reinterprets traditional Christianity - no matter how far-fetched - will find a ready audience.

For those who want views of early Christianity that pay attention to the historical facts, I can recommend - without necessarily agreeing with - the scholarly works of Geza Vermes, Raymond Brown, Bart Ehrman, Marcus Borg, N. T. Wright, and even Bishop Spong (if you insist on ultra-liberalism).  Do not waste your money on the rubbish of the aptly-named Timothy Freke.
