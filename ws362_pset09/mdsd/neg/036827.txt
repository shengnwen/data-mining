I have read ALL the books on sniping in Vietnam and this one is without equal when it comes to being a lousy read. It has so little about actual sniping the title should be A GRUNT IN ARIZONA! I feel I have been seriously [let down] by buying this, and it's difficult for me to say the word 'book'. There are so many trully good sniping books out there, don't waste your time and money on this joke. I hope Culbertson was a better Marine than writer. If not, he surelly must have gotten many a good Marine killed. I recommend ONE SHOT, ONE KILL and THE LONG RANGE WAR over this piece of garbage
