I am an adult who enjoys YA literature, but this book was absolute nonsensical fluff.  I became aware of this book when Amazon recommended it to me because I liked The Boyfriend List.  I read the book in an hour or so last night, and I got nothing worthwhile from the experience.  What stood out to me the most is the fact that the main character's motivation never really made sense.  The plot construction hinges on Claudia concluding that her sex appeal must be waning and deciding to practice her flirting skills by striking up a conversation with one new guy every day.  So far, so good.  The problem is that she comes to this conclusion after only one week of being single, and immediately after some random guy at a party tries to kiss her.  Claudia successfully extricates herself from the guy trying to make out with her, is complimented on the way she handled the guy by her Crush, and what she takes from those back-to-back experiences is that she must not be very attractive to guys.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Seriously, that's precisely the lack of internal logic and appropriate plot development you can look forward to in this book. Claudia is swarmed with male attention to an unrealistic degree (her ex-boyfriend is trying to get back together with her, band members that she interviews proposition her, the most socially important guy at her first Greek party hits on her, guys at the gym ogle her, a really great guy sees her at a coffee shop once and is so taken with her that he arranges a way to meet cute with her later) and yet she keeps telling us in her narrative that she lacks confidence in her ability to attract men.  I was never able to really connect with Claudia and I did not think that her experiences had any ring of truth to them.  It's a fast read, but completely forgettable and only slightly enjoyable
