"A Facsimile of the original edition" ? My mother has an original copy (7th edition) which was handed down to her & it is now held together with tape & love. Borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so I wanted to get one for myself. I did a lot of reading of reviews & finally decided on this one. Yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without ANY cooking temperature (electric, gas or internal temps). Even the time tables on page 32 & 33 with cooking times didn't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at. My mother's does except the charts are in a different area of her book. I am sorry but I am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book & take my mother's book & write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at. There was one recipe that state "cook for 20 mins. at a very high temp" & my mothers book said " cook for 20 mins. at 450 F". It almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same. Copyrights problems?  I am returning this book because it didn't meet my expectations & felt it was misrepresented
