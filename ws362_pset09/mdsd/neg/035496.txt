I think Cheryl Jarvis needs to get a grip on reality! What kind of wife wants to take a 3 month sabbatical from her husband and family to find herself? People like her need to wake up and remember the commitment she made to her husband and children! Life can be hard sometimes, and can take us all on a ride we don't like or in the wrong direction. Women like these need to realize that they have made other commitments now and have to stick with them! Her children come to her and ask her not to leave...... doesn't that right there give her the clue that maybe her dreams and goals have changed and being a wife/ mother is what she is now! This is why you see divorces at like 60% now because no one wants work at a marriage anymore, when it gets too hard they just pick up and leave! I don't like the message this book is giving and don't recommend it to anyone! You have problems with your life, talk it out with your husband. Don't read a book from a person who doesn't know the first thing about marriage! What ever happen to talking things out
