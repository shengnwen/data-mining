Taylor's book is a quick read, and a decent way for a Beatle fan to pass the time.  It is packed with interesting (if not-very-detailed) anecdotes about the Fab Four that I have not read elsewhere.  However, it is poorly edited.  The author tends to group unrelated anecdotes together. Strangely, on page 52 he references Ringo as a member of the band, waiting with the others for Brian Epstein to get them a recording contract, but Pete Best is not sacked until page 59!  Speaking of Pete, he is barely mentioned in this book.

Once or twice, the author completely contradicts himself.  Interestingly, the first half of the book seems to be organized and written better than the latter half; perhaps the author was up against a deadline?  Still, this does not excuse the poor editing job.  

I do not recommend this book for readers who do not already know the Beatles' basic story, as the author skips around quite a bit, and does not give adequate background information on some of the lesser-known "characters" in Beatle history.  

I give this book two stars, as it *is* somewhat entertaining, and has several neat photos I have not seen elsewhere.  Alistair Taylor's story has the potential to be very interesting, but he needs a) an EDITOR and b) to expand upon his anecdotes with more detail.  Perhaps this book could be polished up and re-released?
