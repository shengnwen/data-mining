If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.

All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.
