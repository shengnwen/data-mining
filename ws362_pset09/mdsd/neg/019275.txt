Apparently windbags on the left are as eager to exploit the September 11 tragedy as are their noxiously gaseous counterparts on the right, which, as a progressive, I find distressing. Actually, this book is offensive on several fronts. First off, it is sloppily thrown together, with slipshod, clearly tossed-off contributions from many left-of-center journalists, some of whom (like Michael Moore) tend to speak before they think, thus hurting their cause, however worthy it might be. On top of that, the book becomes redundant, with contributors echoing each other over and over and over again. Better and much less indulgent editing would have helped here. The book's design, too, leaves a lot to be desired (it's downright ugly). The worst offense, though, has been committed by the book's publisher, which crassly released this volume just in time for 9/11's first anniversary, thus proving itself as rapacious as any fly-by-night right-wing press. But then, as I'm sure the authors of this tome would agree, that's capitalism
