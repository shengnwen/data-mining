In this short book, Wolfe purports to tell us that the entire American art scene (ie ALL abstract art) of the post-WWII years is nothing but verbiage, a creation of a bunch of second-rater critics. I find this kind of generalization absolutely breathtaking in its arrogance and facile dismissiveness.  By what criterion does Wolfe make this judgment?  By the fact that there were a bunch of high-falutin' critics who explained it to those who wanted to be taken by fashion.  While this is a common enough phenomenon in a nationalistic sense (pride in the output of one's country), I think it only applies to individuals rather than an entire scene.  Afterall, the astract artists like Pollack belonged to a continuous milieu, which runs the gamut from Bob Dylan and John Coltrane right through the Beat Generation writers and Pollack and his cohorts and even TV like the Outer Limits and Twilight Zone.  Were all of them and all they did first rate?  Perhaps not, but I wd argue that there area a lot of wonderful things there as well, reflections of a time even if they don't quite measure up to the earlier generation of modernists like Picasso and Matisse.  I wd not dismiss them so cavalierely, so cynically, as if you can emcompass all they stood for in a single argument.  This book is for those who want to appear as glib smartas*es
