The talmudic writers are very clever in introducing their babylonian pagan beliefs and claiming they are Jewish.  Hashem gave Torah to Moshe and told him to write everything down.  Torah was to be read yearly to the congregation so they could understand G-d's law.  Now the rabbis are claiming that the people are too stupid to understand what G-d said they could understand.  This is the very same thing that goes on in the pagan catholic "church".  Read the Tanakh for yourself and ask HaShem to reveal HIS truth to you - unadulterated by the rabbis and their poisonous lies
