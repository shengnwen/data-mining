If this were a satirical view of Regency books, I might have bought the far-fetched storyline, the flat, idiotic characters, and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot.  As I rather suspect it is not a satire - Catherine Coulter being a best-selling Romance novelist - it was disappointing to say the very least.  I only, I repeat, only listened to it in its entirety because I hadn't brought anything else to listen to at work one day.  If you like historical romance that's fun and funny, try Katie MacAlister's book "Improper English", or for some more serious historical fiction, check out Phillippa Gregory's Wideacre series
