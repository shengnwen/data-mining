The author is a big fan of plain old chicken wings and backs.  Chicken backs seem the form a huge portion of her dogs' diets. 

Chicken wings and backs alone are WAY too bony.  
She is doing it to be as cheap as possible and in the process is feeding an incomplete diet.
Your dogs' poops should NOT be white and chalky- that is a sign the dog is eating too much bone.

It should also be mentioned somewhere in the book that raw pork can cause trichinosis and that freezing it for a month first will prevent this. She just recommends raw pork.  Period.

Yes, there is some good information in this book, but you need to do more research on your own and not feed by her personal dogs' menu, as it is lacking.

This is a nice starter book to get over your fears of raw feeding, but that's about it
