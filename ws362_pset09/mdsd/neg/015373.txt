but of course.women's rape torture mutilation equals men's suffering.what a great excuse:"we cant help it".it wasn't the millions of people persecuted for being nothing but themselves and forced to physical labor until they died that suffered,it was the nazi leaders who couldnt help feeling that little guilty tug of conscience when they ordered that screaming human beings be shoved into ovens.

all im saying is that excuses on behalf of an oppressive group do nothing but condone their behaviour.i know some people dont see it that away but other people learn from these types of propagated conclusions.

helpful history lesson
