The author freely reinterprets scripture to suit his agenda, without any convincing logic to support his assumptions.  I was unable to endure much of this book in spite of my desire to really understand an apposing view.  In my opinion, it's just another attempt to invent a social gospel rather than to accept the gospel of salvation
