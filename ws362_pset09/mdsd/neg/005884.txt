I had a devastating review here some time ago that was apparently deleted by someone. (Apparently, I wasn't alone. When I put in my review there was one with 4 stars. I fully expect this review to be removed eventually.)

In short, I enjoyed this book until I started noticing errors and a strange, sometimes nasty, bias. There are also several silly chapters on people who are simply not in the same league as the rest, a few that are extremely slanted and a few that are almost nothing but lies and misinformation.

It became apparent that the author tends to take sides. In more than one case he accepted the delussional rantings of the subject as fact, dismissing the volume of contradictory evidence. Worse, the author is, at times, very nasty in his dismissal of that contradictory evidence.

This is a sloppy, poorly written book. The number of egregious errors in several chapters make me doubt the validity of some of the assertions made in the rest of chapters. If you want to be educated, you are much better off finding books specific to the subject
