Although there were a couple of two star reviews, there were more strongly positive reviews so I thought to try this with my 4-6 grade students in special education.  First, I have to address the drawings in this book.  While I understand that the drawings were simple for the probable saving of time, they were completely racially stereotypical and innacurate, and I took offense to that, especially knowing that many of my students would take note of that (ex. Asians with slanted lines for eyes and names such as Ping, and African American students with big lips and noses).  Plus the activities were just too simple, with little room for discussion and growth.  While the book is for "special children", they can still have good discussions and come up with own scenarios and do not need answers so clearly obvious.  There are just too many items to tackle in this book and nothing is gone into with any depth.  I just could not see myself using anything in this, so in fact sent it back.  I am glad for the many who were able to make this work for them so easily.  I am just not one of them.
