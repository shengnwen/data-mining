...but I have to agree with the other reviewers who said that the recipes fall short. Many of them sound absolutely delicious, but I have found many errors and in recipes where there are no obvious errors, I often have to make adjustments to the seasonings or ingredients (for example, I made the Lemon Tahini Sauce tonight to go with the baked Falafel Balls...the falafel balls recipes is missing a step, and the lemon tahini sauce calls for way, way too much tahini and the end product is not what the recipe describes. I could fix both mistakes, but I shouldn't have to).  I wish they would do some heavy revising to this cookbook, because it has so much promise.
