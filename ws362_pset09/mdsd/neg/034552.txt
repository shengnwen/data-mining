One day my 6 year old Son brought home a Junie B. book His 1st grade teacher reccommended He read. At first I thought the book was pretty cute, but as we got more and more into the book I noticed the HORRIBLE grammar being used in the book. Its not just this book either, the whole series has horrible grammar!!!!! I don't think its appropriate AT ALL for children who are beginning to read and spell to see that kind of grammar. I mean if it was once or twice throughout the book, okay fine that is kind of cute. But the whole book and SERIES is the same. Horrible grammar on every page (i.e. runned around my room, I helded my head up...ect.)
Not only the grammar but Junie B. is a total brat!!! She whines and cries until she gets what she wants. What a handful!

All the children in my Son's first grade class love these books! Its awesome they love books and reading but Its a shame they love such horrible books
