An official Library Weekly book review.

EXCERPT:
If you are like most people, you are struggling, without much success, to get the yield back
into your savings. The places to which you are turning are not producing much relief.

RATING: 
2 of 5

REVIEW:
The 16% Solution is supposed to be a guide on how to invest in tax liens; however, as you
turn the pages, you find that it seems to cut back and forth with fictional characters and
then law-based jargon. There is an attempt by the author to deliver a point, which is
commendable, but there are many parts of the book that needs editing.  While this is an
acceptable guide to investing in tax lien certificates, it would not be a first pick.
