Yet another whitewashing and self-serving attempt to claim that Ronald Reagan "won the Cold War" - by the way, it was my impression that the Cold War was not in any sense 'won', it was rather something that just ended, for the most part because it was widely acknowledged within the USSR that the Soviet style economy and political system could neither be sustained nor reformed.

Secondly, these kinds of right-wing apologias always wallow smugly in the assertion that Western 'liberals' never perceived the real threat presented by the neo-Stalinist regimes in the USSR and Eastern Europe. Well, things have changed, and now there's a new, possibly greater threat. Did the Reagan administration (of which Charen was a part) foresee this later threat when they were happily funding, training and arming the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan, from whose numbers were to come the Taliban and Osama bin Laden? By all accounts, these Islamic warriors were at that time just as murderous, just as cruel, just as intent on the destruction of all 'infidels' (the US as much as the USSR), as they are now: the only difference is that, when they were the CIA's clients, they were committing their atrocities as 'freedom fighters', whereas now they commit them as 'terrorists'
