Unless you are proficient in statistics, this book will be very frustrating for students. I have trouble finding adequate explanations and definitions, and I am supposed to know this stuff. Their are numerous editing mistakes which adds to the students frustration, and could someone provide an answer key to the assignments. It reinforces the inability of some to understand how and what students need to learn.
