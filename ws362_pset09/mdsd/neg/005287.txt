I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.

The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell.
