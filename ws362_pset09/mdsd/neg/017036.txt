I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. It seemed to have so much promise! The main character was completely unlikable- she made me NEVER want to get married! She is the epitome of a woman who is willing to settle simply to be married. She seems to view her fianc as a decent catch, but not as something she is madly in love with. 

In addition, I strongly disliked the author's writing style. I can't put my finger on it, but it just felt rough and forced, like nothing flowed smoothly. Choppy I suppose. Perhaps this appeals to some, but I found it hard to read. As someone stated in an earlier review, I also can't stop reading in the middle of a book or I would have stopped. It was that bad. 

Read at your own risk.
