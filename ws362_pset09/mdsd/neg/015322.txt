The title may be "Chassis Engineering", but this is really just another suspension tuning book, with almost no real information about vehicle chassis (frame and frame reinforcing).  I purchased this book looking for something about reinforcing the frame of a unibody vehicle, and found that the first 85 pages  and last 36 pages are the same shock, spring, aerodynamic, and weight distribution stuff as every other suspension tuning written in the last 25 years, basically rephrasing everything from Fred Phun's "How to Make Your Car Handle" (1981) (And Mr. Phun presents the material a lot better).  There are only 12 pages about the "chassis" or non-moving parts of the vehicle, and those really present the subject with such lack of detail and depth that anyone beyond the age of about 10 is going to be disappointed and feel talked down to.  I suppose the good news is that it was only $12, which minimizes the waste of money
