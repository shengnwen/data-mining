Spirits in the Wires held a lot of promise for me, but it just didn't deliver. De Lint's regular stable of Newford characters is here, and I found that distracting rather than pleasant, since I felt he was a little too self-referential. Even the presence of Christy and Geordie Riddell, among my favorite de Lint characters ever, couldn't quite save this one. The writing plodded along in places, and the magic in the books didn't take place in Newford, but rather on the Internet. Since De Lint is a master of urban fantasy, that disappointed me. I also didn't feel it would have made a good introduction to Newford, since a lot of the time I found myself reading passages and going, "Huh? Who are they and why do they matter?" For a better introduction to Newford and its denizens, try one of de Lint's short story collections, or maybe Someplace to be Flying
