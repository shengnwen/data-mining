I admit that I am not qualified to "judge" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO "stupid." I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.

This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has "got it" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish. 

FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.

Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.

If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it. 

I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy. If still your ego insists on reading this, then purchase as many supplementary books as possible, and good luck
