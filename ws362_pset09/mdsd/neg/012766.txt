YES, I GAVE IT ONLY 2 STARS! I have read alot of motivational books in my life time but this one leaves you empty. Patt Summitt does not give a "one-size fits all" approach to obtaining Life's goals as she suggest.  Pat Summitt gives these long drawn out stories of her coaching experience and players experience then, at the very end, ties it to a generic principle of leadership that has been rehash by hundred of other motivational book writers.  I'm not hating on her leadership or abilities. She has proven herself a dynamic coach.  If you're a HS/college couch of any sport then this is the book for you! but for the rest of us her approaches to leadership do not necessarily translates to pearls of wisdom
