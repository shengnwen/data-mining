What is being called the &quot;paperback&quot; version of A Short History of Western Civilization here is in actuality not the paperback version at all but another paperback book entitled &quot;A Study Guide to Accompany A Short History of Western Civilization from the 1600's.&quot; Richard Sullivan is not the author of THIS book. On the order form and on the packing slip it says &quot;A Short History of Western Civilization&quot; but it is not!  If what you want is a study guide for half of this book then go ahead and order it.  If you really want the entire Short History of Western Civilization book, then order the HARDCOVER version
