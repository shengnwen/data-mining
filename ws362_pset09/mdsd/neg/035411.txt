This book attempts to be an all in one source for your post-partum recovery.  While it does cover everything from breastfeeding problems to losing weight to burping your baby, it's not done well.  It tries to cover too much information in too short of a book, the result is a lot of subjects, but not a lot of subastance.  It's probably better to get a separate book on breastfeeding (Dr. Sear's Breastfeeding book and the Breastfeeding Answer Book by La Leche League are excellent), a separate book on baby care, etc...  I even found the post-partum section in &quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot; to be more informative and helpful than in &quot;Bouncing Back After Your Pregnancy&quot;.  Incidentally, &quot;What to Expect the First Year&quot; is another excellent source for baby care issues, it's far more in-depth than this particular book. I'm so glad I checked this out at the library rather than buying it, the cover of this book has a lot of appeal, it's just too bad the content doesn't match
