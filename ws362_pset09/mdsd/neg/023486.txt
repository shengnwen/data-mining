Authentic Beauty was a disappointing read for me. I thought Leslie Ludy had some wonderful things to say and it is clear that she loves the Lord. However, the book was extremely repetative. I kept expecting her to dive into some really intense issues, but in the end it was all very surface. I'm a college student and i lead a small group of college girls. I got this book thinking it would really challenge us. However, it didn't. This book would best serve younger girls, probably middle school age, who are still learning what it means to follow Christ
