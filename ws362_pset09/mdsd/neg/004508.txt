I bought his with a lot of hope that it would feed me full of valuable information with which to arm myself the next time I go to see the doctors.  Instead it gave me the grade 7 version of what PCOS is.  It didn't have any medication information such as whether high estrogen or low estrogen bcps are better or what kind of progesterone is best, (i.e. ones with lower androgenic effects).  It simply restated what you learn about PCOS in preschool.  (well what I mean by that is it's like a censored version of what PCOS means).  It tells you things like: well, you should either tell your family about your syndrome or else lie to them because they don't need to know anything anyway.  Or: You should either find a doctor who will listen to you or find another one.  Well a B.I.G. DUHHHHHHH goes out to the authors of this book.  In the very small chapter dedicated to medications it stated that BCP's are used to regulate hormones (well every General Practitioner in the world can tell you that) it didn't even state which ones might help with which symptoms.  I could have written a better more informative book on PCOS from internet research, not to mention all the medical books I've read.
My advice would be to get free information on the internet rather than buy this book and then for less basic and more in depth information on PCOS...  Check out instead It's My Ovaries, Stupid! by Elizabeth Lee Vliet.
