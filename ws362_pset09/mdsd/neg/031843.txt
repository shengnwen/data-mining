I listened to this thing after checking CD set out from the local library - luckily I did not plunk down my own money for it (and only wasted one hour)! 

The first CD is an extended sales-pitch for other E-myth "books", website, worksheets, and consulting services (as obviously are some of the reviews posted here that "plug" the author's coaching practice). Even as a sales pitch, the book fails, being very crude and heavy-handed in the used-car-salesman, creepy kind of way. I gave up after listening to one CD, during which I heard about the website, the "coaching" service, the newsletter, and numerous god's blessings for the author, and then about the website, the coaching service, the newsletter, god's mysterious ways and blessings for the author, and so on, ad nauseam. 

All this, interspersed with a few sentimental, dull, and annoyingly protracted personal anecdotes with little or no relevance to business issues. What I have not heard during this first part, however, was a SINGLE useful piece of advice or constructive insight regarding running a small business, or good business practices in general. As another reviewer before me, I too felt particularly put-off by the tone, and additionally by the frequent mentions of god, blessings, "miracles", and "mysterious ways" all abused as part of the sales pitch. 

I am sorry to have wasted my time on this. If you think you have to read it, check it out from the local library where, I am quite sure, it's gathering dust on the bookshelves. If you need sound business advice, I'll agree with another reviewer who recommended the book Winning by Jack Welch instead
