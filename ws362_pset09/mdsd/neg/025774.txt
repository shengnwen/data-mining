The Corporation will find any way it can to squeeze more cash out of any platinum "artist". Jewel was a perfect candidate with her bloated, exaggerated tales of growing up in a van in Alaska and pure angelic features. Why would anyone think that a singer with lyrics like, "my hands are small, I know, but they're not yours, they are my own," can write anything that even remotely resembles decent prose? Her poems are nothing more than scattered, broken phrases that are, at worst, unbelievably incoherrent and at best, prime kindergarten-like tales of unrequited love and child-like observation. It's a hard cold fact that the only reason she was allowed to publish such trite poetry is solely because of her platinum cd sales. Anyone who believes that this stuff is good, must either be a loyal follower or the most basic of amatuer readers of prose, and must be taken to the nearest library immediately for an emergency infusion of Frost, Yates or Angelou. You would find more artistic merit in a car manual then Jewel's laughable prose.
