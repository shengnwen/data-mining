Having seen and enjoyed the movie years ago, I was intrigued to get the whole story.  Books usually tell it so much better.  This one doesn't.  So, if you're looking to read a better version of the movie, this isn't it - go buy the script.  

There's no drama, no character development, no humor, no love story!  It's just imagery, imagery, imagery.  BORING.  It was good for putting me to sleep, but that's about it.  Here's the cliffsnotes version of the book:  Two professors go to Italy, buy a house, fix it up, visit it every summer and Christmas and serve lots of dinners to lots of other people, all who have no story to tell either.  You also get a lot of descriptions of doorways and vegetables.  There, you've read it!  

Whoever wrote the script for the movie was a genius to find a way to make something interesting out of this SNOOZEFEST!  Save your money, go rent the movie
