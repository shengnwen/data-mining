Purchased Teenage Investor for my grandchildren but decided not to give it to them.  While the book gives a reasonable survey of the stock market it promotes the negative theme throughout that we, average investors, cannot succeed and would be better off buying mutual funds.  (So, why write a book about investing?)

This boy-writer (in my opinion) must have garnered a lot of help from dad, a lawyer, an accountant, a broker, a writer, and an editor. I read the whole book hoping to find something that read as if a teenager actually contributed, but I couldn't find it.
