This was one of the worst textbooks I've ever read. It drones on in excruciating detail for pages before finally stating the main point or idea. People don't think that way. State what you're talking about and then give the supporting details and examples. Not the other way around. It is a very frustrating read. I had to reference other resources in order understand the theories and concepts presented in this book
