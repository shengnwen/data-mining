With 3 kids and a full-time job, I haven't had time to pay much attention to fashion for years.  And unfortunately my body has changed a lot over the years and my clothes weren't looking so great on me.  So I went on a book spree and bought this book and several others.  This was by far the worst of the lot.  There's just not much to it.  Feldon returns to one idea over and over -- that to look thin you should wear monochromatic outfits.  That's pretty much it.  The books "The Pocket Stylist" and the What Not to Wear crew's "What You Wear Can Change Your Life" are far more informative books books on style for your money
