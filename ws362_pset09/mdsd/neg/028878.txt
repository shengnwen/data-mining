This is probably the worst textbook that I have used in the past two years.  The book makes a lot of basic concepts seem very difficult and a lacks the proper examples to even explain what the problems at the end of the chapter are asking.  The wording is very boring and tends to put the reader to sleep- making the poor explanation of concepts even worse.  The authors jump around and often fail to define terms or use them before they are explained.  The index has proved to be worthless in many of these instances.  There are a lot of problems that I do not believe could be solved by a new edition
