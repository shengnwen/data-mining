What a big, big, big disappointment!  I purchased this book and it is just a collection of old materials by Mr. Pyzdek in a new packaging that has a six sigma theme.  This book adds very little to the understanding of the six sigma methodolgy of business and quality improvement.  If you have Tom's old exam refresher books then you have everything that this handbook offers - except for the cover.  I wish I could get my $100.00 back????
