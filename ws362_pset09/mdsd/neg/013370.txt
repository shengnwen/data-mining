I wasn't really impressed with this book.  Iwas esxpecting more of the things that I can do as a non-professional (I'm a receptionist right now) and someone who has no real selling skills.  All that the author talks about is pretty obvious things that require some serious skills, like start a business that earns an average of $700,000 a year, then sell stocks in that company.  Okay, sounds good, I'll get right on that.  He does mention some good points about saving (what we should be saving according to our income, but the stories about the people in his book (are they even real?) get to sound a little out of my ballpark.  I like the idea of finding something that you're good at and make a lot of money off of it, but is that always possible?  I like painting buckets, but there is only a small market for that (I've even tried to sell online).

I'm skeptical about the stock advice- don't invest passively, he says.  I was told that the best way to invest was to picka or fund that you're confident and let it ride, because "beating the market is nearly impossible, " someone once told me.  So, if I can't invest aggresively, and can't dramatically increase my income (or get rid of all of my expenses), the only thing left for me is real estate.  I think that point was made after the housing boom made the author rich, but the market isn't going anywhere now.  

I'm still looking for good advice
