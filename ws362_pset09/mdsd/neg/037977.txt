This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read.  It is laughably hokey and unrealistic.  There is even a scene where Jason gives a karate chop to the back of someone's neck and they fall unconscious....I mean really, I thought that only happened in Get Smart episodes or perhaps Charlie's Angels.

I understand this is fiction but there needs to be some basis for reality...otherwise why not just have the characters fly around like Superman
