I read several books a week, and made numerous attempts to get into Judith Harris' volume.  It is a subject I am quite interested in, and know something about, being a professional psychologist.  So I was looking forward to reading it.  Let me tell you though, this book needed some serious editing.  In just the first 30-40 pages there are so many repetitive sentences, gratuitous self-references, false starts, second starts, third starts...I don't know where to begin...so I won't.  I will simply say that Ms. Harris should read "The Elements of Style" or some other book on writing or argumentation.  Say it, Judith.  Say it clearly and say it one time.  And if you tell the story of the conjoined twins who had differing personalities one more time I will shoot myself
