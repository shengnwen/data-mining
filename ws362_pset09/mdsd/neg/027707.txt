This book describes a concept which is not revolutionary at all, lacks a comprehensive concept and good illustrations. The first chapters lead the reader redundantly through the biophysics and biomechanics of swimming bodies and quite extensively, the development of TI. Unfortunately, it sounds more like self-adulation and is excessively descriptive. The impatient reader will skip these chapters, asking himself where the swimming drills are. Thus, coming to real swimming, this book describes a good approach by teaching balance and breaking down a stroke into single sequence drills. However, if the reader does some internet search he will get these drills for free. Additionally, most internet pages provide video-clips. The reader may enjoy the drills up to the point where he is ready for real swimming. And then, the reader has to realize that this concept lacks drills for breathing and flip-turns! In summary, this book does not provide a comprehensive concept of swimming lacking essential techniques and good illustrations. Furthermore, the approach is not revolutionary if you research the "evolution" of modern swimming
