I purchased this book last weekend. I was really looking forward to reading it, but I must say I was very disappointed. Missa's constant comments about how beautiful she is, combined with her nasty and mean spirited comments about everyone else really nauseated me. Enough already! We get it. Also, most of the the book is devoted to swinging, which I really didn't understand because Missa does nothing in the book but whine about how much she hates everything about swinging. This book was painful to read, even for a masochist. Do yourself a favor and flog yourself instead.
