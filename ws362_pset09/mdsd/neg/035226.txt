These short stories were not really enjoyable to me. I found the humour bland, the characters shapeless, the plot in the stories ordinary (to put it mildly...) Short stories by Nadine Gordimer or Raymond Carver are in my view far superior. So it's really not the end of the world, there are many other books to read
