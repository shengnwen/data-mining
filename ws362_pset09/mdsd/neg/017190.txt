It has tons of information; both fresh and processed foods, but I found it difficult to look at the pages.  The cheap, greyish, mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading, but when you're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do.  After looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore, I finally found one compact book with medium stock, bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just $2 more.  The Ultimate Calorie, Carb, & Fat Gram Counter by Lea Ann Holzmeister.  I recommend that one over the Netzer book
