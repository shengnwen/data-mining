PAUL PRESTON IS NOT OBJECTIVE IN HIS BOOK "FRANCO".  HE MAKES FRANCO APPEAR WORST THAN HILTER.  EXAMPLE IN REGARDS TO ONE OF HIS SOURCES - JOSE MARIA GIL ROBLES- notes 114 and 120 on pages 592 and 590.  PRESTON MAKES IT APPEAR THE GIL ROBLES KNOWES WHAT FRANCO STATED AT A TIME WHEN GIL ROBLES HAD  LEFT SPAIN AROUND 1936-39 IN A PERIOD IN THE BOOK OF 1949.  THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES.  I SUSPECT MANY OF HIS NOTES AND SOURCES.  IF I AM WRONG OR I DID NOT UNDERSTAND PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  PS. I suspect that many of his sources are not creditable.  Too many of his secondary sources appear to be primary sources
