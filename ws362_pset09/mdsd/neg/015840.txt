     A relatively easy read.  The chronology is rather loose and jumps around more than I cared for.  Certain positive issues and programs sponsored by the Vatican are ignored.  Also, some negative situations addressed seems to be a more grabbing at straws to shore the argument, not much meat to them.  Other determining factors were well covered.  It could have been a little more balanced in my opinion.  Not my favorite read on the issue
