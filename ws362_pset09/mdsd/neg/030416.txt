In her book, &quot;Energies of Transformation&quot;, Bonnie Greenwell, Ph.D., describes the experiences described in &quot;Joy's Way&quot; as a Kundalini crisis. She also interviewed many of Joy's former students who were experiencing a Kundalini crisis. &quot;Energies of Transformation&quot; originated as Bonnie's Ph.D. thesis and I consider it scientific proof that Brugh Joy's conferences are highly effective at beginning a Kundalini crisis. Avoid Brugh Joy like the plague
