I bought this book after reading Homeschooling on a Shoestring, and was thoroughly disappointed.  I'd estimate that eighty-five percent of the websites listed either didn't work or were something other than what the author thought they were.  The other fifteen percent I was already aware of from Homeschooling on a Shoestring.  I strongly recommend you to bypass this book.  Also, there is a strong christian fundamentalist vibe in this book, so if you aren't a fundamentalist, that would be another reason to avoid it
