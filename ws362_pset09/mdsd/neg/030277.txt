Or she doesn't admit to having much understanding. Like when she mentions how the USA put the Shah on the throne of Iran. She doesn't mention that the Shah already was previously the leader of Iran and that he and his dad ruled the country since the early 1920's.

Also, when she discusses on page 166 how the Iraqi Air Force under Saddam Hussein dropped bombs on the Iraqi Kurdish municipality of Halabja in the 1980's she doesn't get much into depth with the bombing of this place in Iraq was part of Saddam's much larger deadly campaign to murder Iraq's Kurd's population (he killed 180,000+ Iraqi Kurds in just one year)

Lastly, this author doesn't seem to realize how the USA was very militarily paralyzed by the pacifist movement of the late 1960's and early 70's so that is why we didn't invade evil Iraq 
under Saddam much sooner like back in the 70's. It wasn't until 2003 with the Vietnam War a whole 30 years gone that the USA became a full-fledged military power again with Dubya's appropriate invasion of Saddam's Iraq
