...it probably is.  This is a valueless book with a title designed to sell.  I got this from the library and read the first section then listened to the CD per the instructions.  I don't think it hypnotized me, nor do I think it helped me quit in any way.  
I've since found some good books on dealing with the nicotine addiction like the disease it is.  It's not a question of will power, or hypnotizing your mind to not want to smoke.  It's an extremely strong addiction that will take months to recover from.  Once you accept that - it's a lot easier.
