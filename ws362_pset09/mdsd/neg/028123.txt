In the last few years rock music biographies have come of age and many are well researched, full of insight and show a real and objective understanding of the artist in question. Victor Bockris' study of one of the most important icons of the 1960's unfortunately falls far short of what I've come to expect.

The book reads like a lazy retread of thirty years of news clippings and has very little insight into what actually made the Stones become the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world. He's good at knitting together a constant series of quotes and old interviews into a below average narrative but seems to be unable to actually have any real understanding of the people behind the words.

With less than a quarter of the book dedicated to the years when the Stones actually had some validity and almost half of it dedicated to the incredibly tedious 'heroin' years Bockris misses the whole point of why a book about Keith Richards should be written. One unproductive junkie is just like any other and I don't need nearly two hundred repetitive pages to get the message. As another reviewer has rightly pointed out, the author seems to have an unnatural admiration of Keith's heroin addiction and completely fails to comment on the fact that it neatly coincides with the band's rapid creative decline. 

I can only hope that the next four hundred page book on one of popular music's most influential guitar players will have three hundred of them covering the period of 1964 to 1971 with the remainder dealing with the following thirty six years when the Rolling Sones simply ceased to have any relevance
