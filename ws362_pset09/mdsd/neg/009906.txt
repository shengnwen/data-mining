This book is AWFUL.  If you are trying to learn Sanskrit grammar as a beginner or just interested in getting some basics, this is NOT the book for you.  This book would be great as a reference material if you understood complex grammar terms such as another reviewer mentioned.  The books is entirely too dense, the index to look things up is awful.  All and all I would NOT recommend this.  Please stay away from it unless you are holding your Master's in Linguistics or already have an EXTREMELY THOROUGH knowledge of Sanskrit language and grammar.  Very disappointing book indeed
