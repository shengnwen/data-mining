In my opinion, 70% of this book is theory.  I don't understand how anybody can use this book as a continuous guide.  The first couple of chapters of the book are great, but it goes down hill from there.  This book is good for those that want to gain a deep understanding of DBMS and how they optimize queries or things of that nature, but this book should not be used for an undergrad course.  This book explains alot of concepts behind DBMS, concepts that might be nice to know, but will not benefit you in your database implementation.  There are a couple of chapters dedicated to SQL, but that is it.  And to be honest, it did not help me much at all.  I agree with another person who made the comment if your course uses only this book, drop it because it will probably be a waste of time, unless you are interested in the inner workings of a DBMS.
