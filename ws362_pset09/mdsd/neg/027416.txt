Okay, I confess I'm still plowing my way through this book. I'm on page 157, I think, and while the bodies were revealed way up front, everything else I've read thus far is Cissie being Cissie and Andy being dumber than a brick. A little of this mother-daughter dynamic went a long way in the first book, but this time it's simply over the top. As humor, it falls flat. As a mystery, it's *what* mystery? Maybe the second half of the book will pick up the pace a little, but getting there is a challenge I'm not certain I'm willing to take
