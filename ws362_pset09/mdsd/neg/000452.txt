I loved ECW.  So everytime a dvd or book comes out about ECW, I do a double take.  I could write a really long review on this book, but I'll condense it really quickly to save you the time:

1.  Thom Loverro may be a respected and longtime journalist, but he obviously knows nothing about ECW.  He can't even decide if the name is Mike "Nova" Bucci or Mike Nova.  The writing style is drab and reads like someone took a pile of notes and threw them on a page, then made barely-conscious transitions.

2.  It's a dvd rehash.  That was obvious from the beginning but I was hoping it would provide something interesting.  I was wrong.  If you have the dvd there's no point in reading this.

3.  The innacuracies are frustrating.  One would think at least one fact-checking session could have been devoted to this.  Taz is even labeled as Mikey Whipwreck.  Small children, after watching one show featuring the two, could have noticed there's a difference.

I would have given my eyeteeth to recommend this book and I rarely consider reading even the silliest books to be a waste of time, but this really was a waste.  It's sloppy, badly put-together, many times inaccurate and totally devoid of any real passion.  If you really want to read it try to check it out at a library
