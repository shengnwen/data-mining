A very bland pictorial scrapbook of those jet-set ladies from the past.  It could and should have looked much better than this haphazard collection of period company PR photos from the last few decades.  There is no contents page, no captions to the photos or even page numbers to give a buyer any sense that this is any more than a quickie production which I expect will hit the mark-down section of most bookstores faster than the publisher's expected.

Despite this there are a few pages that caught my interest.  Near the back of the book there are twenty or so of those upright timetables that you could pick up from travel shops years ago.  Each has a smilling (naturally) stewardess, a company logo and parts of a jet on the cover.

Another reviewer has mentioned 'Come fly with us!' (ISBN 1933112069) which covers exactly the same subject and predictably has the same sort of soft focus posed company photos but at least it has a lot more editorial flair and an imaginative design (even though its published by Collectors Press).  Stewardesses by the nature of their job are likely to be seen in most books about airlines and these two offer an interesting pictorial overview of flying: 'Airline design' (ISBN 3832790551) and 'Airline: identity, design and culture' (ISBN 3823854607).  I prefer this last book to the others mentioned.
