Not once in his book does he tell ONE success story.  He writes about several couples who were in the TRYING stages, but didn't share whether they ended up having a boy or a girl.  I'm not sure how much stock I would put into this method... but I've not used it personally, so I guess I don't have a personal testimonial one way or the other.
