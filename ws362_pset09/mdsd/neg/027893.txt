This book could have been written by the "the N.I.C.E" from C.S. Lewis' That Hideous Strength.

This is quite simply the most cynical book I've ever read. There are no positive messages or characters. The Heart of Darkness, an exploration of evil in us all, is cheerful in comparison.

The setting is a religious (Catholic) school called Trinity. The teachers and administrators are called brothers (Jesuits?). The brothers are all either completely corrupt, complicit or psychologically weak. The main character who fights for his own road, in the end, recants. His friend, the only other marginally moral character is portrayed as both weak and unwilling to go against the group, no matter what the cost. The other characters are either portrayed as amoral (Archie) or unwilling to stand up to the promptings of their conscious. 

I guess this last point is the most disturbing yo me. There are many characters who are prompted by their conscience to act against some kind of wrong, they all ultimately FAIL TO ACT ON IT.

The main message:
Life is pointless and filled with selfish and hateful people. Trying to fight against this (no matter what your conscience tells you) is futile. Those who are the most self-serving and manipulative triumph in the end.

I found this book fully out of touch with reality. I have been down some dark roads in my life and in 42 years have yet to meet anyone as selfish and malevolent as Archie or Brother Leon. The sheer numbers of bad and weak-willed in one school is just absurd.
