I can't agree any more with the reviews that have pointed out the poor writing in this book.  As a fan of stories about Chinese Americans and of historical fiction, I was sorely disappointed with this novel; what could be emotionally-moving scenes just aren't because of the &quot;see jane run&quot; kinds of descriptions.  There is no skillful subtlety in this novel.  I normally don't like to be this publicly critical, but this is one of the only times I've felt this strongly about something
