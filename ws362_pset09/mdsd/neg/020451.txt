This novel was advertised as being funny but most of its humor is more stupid than funny. The basic idea of a LasVegas casino geter becoming an NFLowner had promise but Lupica just goes over the top in his satire. Good satire requiresat least some nuance as well as a degree of moral seriousness and Lupica displays  none of this in the novel which was full of cariacatures but no characters. I will continue to read his nonfiction but I doubt I will ready any  more of his novels
