The buyer must be informed that this work is a mere pamphlet, containing barely twelve pages, five of which are the composed of the introduction.  It also should be noted that the obscure Christian mystic St Dionysius the Areopagite's work the "Mystical Theology" contained here is essentially useless without the rest of his body of writings; it is difficult to get an idea of the whole with only a part of this sage's theology.  So for anyone seeking to find a comprehensive view of St Dionysius the Areopagite's theology in a single volume they definitely should not look here.  Instead check out Colm Luibheid's "Pseudo Dionysius: The Complete Works" (Classics of Western Spirituality) for a full-scale treatment of his theology
