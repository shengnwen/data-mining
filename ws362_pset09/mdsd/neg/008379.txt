This would never have been published as a first novel.  I had read and loved earlier books by Jeanne Dams and was looking forward to reading this book.  But the plot was almost nonexistent and the protagonist, young  Helda, unbelievable and not very likeable.  You had to do more than suspend  disbelief with this book, since everything about the book was so  improbable
