Being a dog lover but not a dog owner who believes that it is cruel to keep most dogs in an urban environment, and especially a large dog in a flat as the author did, I found this memoir not to be my cup of tea.  Humans are portrayed in it as curious, rather unsympathetic creatures, whilst the dog at the center of his love, is romanticised despite the loving detail with which the author describes the bodily functions of the animal.  I can understand though, its appeal to those with an obsession with their dog who find humans too argumentative, contrary or difficult.  An instance of &quot;horses for courses&quot; so to speak
