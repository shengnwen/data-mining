I faithfully read this book as a text for a class.  The fact that it was boring wasn't such a problem because reading the book was unpleasant.  In fact, it wasn't such a bad read, for a textbook.  However, I was bored enough that I retained next to nothing from each chapter.
I personally find Chinese history fascinating (I speak the language, studied in Beijing, and majored in Chinese studies) but this book was a snoozer.  For what you are going to get out of this book, take my short synopsis instead and forget the rest:

Qin Dynasty 220 BC: Unified China, Machiavellian
Han Dynasty 200 BC - 200 AD: Confucian
Tang Dynasty 600-900: Cosmopolitan
Song Dynasty Around 1000 AD: Confucian revival
Yuan Dynasty Around 1200: Mongols
Ming Dynasty 1300-1600: VERY Chinese
Qing Dynasty 1600-1900: Manchu
