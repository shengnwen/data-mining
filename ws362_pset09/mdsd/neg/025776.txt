Unlike the other reviewers, I was not interested in detailed discussions of the mathematics that the Bourbaki group wrote. I heard the author plugging his book on the radio and the topic sounded interesting.  However, when I started reading the book it did not cover what he was talking about in much detail. The first half of the book is a poorly conveyed life history of the various mathematicians in the group.  The book lacks cohesion and continuity.  The book is not very long, but the author repeats material in later chapters that was covered in earlier chapters.  I can not believe that any publisher would publish such a poorly written book.

I am a Physics instructor that emphasizes the importance of good writing even in technical fields.  This is a perfect example that I often cite to my students of someone in a technical field that does not know how to convey his thoughts because he failed his English course.
