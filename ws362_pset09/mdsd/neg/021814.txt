I studied very hard for well over a month through this book and took the test today. Now I don't know my score yet or anything, but my general impression is that this book is not at all representative of the GRE Psyc exam. The Kaplan book only covered less than 50% of what was on the actual exam. I had to rely mostly on logic, reasoning, and what I had picked up from classes and my own studies to do a lot of the test. The Kaplan book did not at all cover I/O psychology or many famous experiments or facts that were on the test.

Also, the Psyc GRE was much more application based than the book portrayed. There are no "Definition given - What is this called?" questions. I blew through the practice tests in just over an hour for the most part and did well, but took over 2 hours today and did not have time to check my test again. I haven't looked at the other books out, but I would highly suggest looking into other books or at least supplementing your study with something else
