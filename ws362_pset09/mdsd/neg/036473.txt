Don't waste your time or money on this one Constant Readers.  I'm a huge King fan, but this one never even got off the ground. Where most King storiess leave you wanting more, this one leaves you wanting anything but the shear boredom it delivers. Sorry, SK, but you must have written this one in a coma.
