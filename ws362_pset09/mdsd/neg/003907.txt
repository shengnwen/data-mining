Any resemblence between what is stated in this book and what's actually going on in the Middle East is purely coincidental.  What the reader gets instead is some amazing fascist propaganda that won't truly serve anyone.  

Hirst writes for the Guardian, a rather famous British newspaper that took decades to establish a fine reputation for its journalism.  It is staggering to realize just how much damage the Guardian has done to this reputation in just a short while by permitting such nonsense to invade its pages.  And I think we need to ask ourselves how and why this has happened.

The staff of the Guardian has to be professional.  One would think that they would hesitate to destroy their paper in such a manner.  After all, it would cost the paper money.  It might ruin the paper entirely, and put them out of jobs.  One might suppose it unlikely that they would want to violate any semblence of good journalistic practice just to hurt a few Jews or Israelis.

However, the experience of reading this book and seeing some of the reviews has led me to a hypothesis of what has happened.  The destruction of the Guardian's reputation as a conduit of good journalism has not put it out of business at all.  Just as this book has brought money to its author, the ghastly articles in the Guardian bring money to the newspaper, if only by appearing sensational and controversial.  

I think we readers have a duty to try to reverse this trend.  Just as dedicated people have made great progress in the campaign against cigarette smoking, the same can be done in the campaign against bad journalism.  We can warn our friends about books such as this one.  And we ought to do just that
