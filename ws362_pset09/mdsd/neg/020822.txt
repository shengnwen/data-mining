I found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena.  I have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue.  However, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay, exageration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism.
