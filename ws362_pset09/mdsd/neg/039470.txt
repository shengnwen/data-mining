This book would have been vastly improved by a decent editor or even the use of a spell checker.  The book was close to unreadable due to the many errors in spelling and punctuation.  It may have been based on a diary, but there is no excuse for the sloppy way the book was published.  I am actually interested in the subject of book.  However, it is extremely off putting when you have to read sentences twice and try to guess just what is being said by the author.  When I want to read a mystery, I'll buy Agatha Christie
