This book tries hard to say that it is a book on search and not on Google. Indeed, even the reviews on the backcover tries hard to convince me that this is not a book on Google. However, I get the impression that this is a book that was probably originally intended as a book on Google, but was late to the game, and tries to be rebranded as a book on search. To the author's credit, he does add material on search that is more original, but the feeling that this book started out as a book on Google never left me.
