Upon first gaze , this comprehensive new book of the collections in the Musee D'Orsay - by Alexandra Bonfante-Warren, looks like a must have for any art lover.  It is a big, juicy book with hundreds of full-color photographs. The cover is arresting - that beautiful familiar view of one of the world's best user friendly museums. Unfortunately, this is a classic case of &quot;don't judge a book by its cover.&quot;  All the plates are totally off-color, many too dark to see any detail. All the white highlights are missing from the reproductions. The person responsible for checking the print quality of the reproductions did not do an accurate job. We were quite shocked - considering the price of this book , for us, as Canadians. ($116) What good is an art book if the colors are off - especially for this period in art which was all about color and light? If you want to purchase a good book of the Musee D'Orsay Collections I would recommend instead the book &quot;Treasures of the Musee D'Orsay&quot; by Francoise Cachin. Although less comprehensive in content, it presents a more accurate depiction of the works, and is a far more inspiring book visually
