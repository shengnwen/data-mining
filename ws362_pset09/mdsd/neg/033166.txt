If you suspect you or your child has ADHD ("A.D.D." is not the correct acronym), please look elsewhere for treatment and practical strategies.  Any ADHD intervention book worth its salt includes a variety of approaches to treatment.  If you want to avoid medication, there are plenty of options - this book is nothing novel.  However, medication does work best for many children and adults and the benefits definitely outweigh the "costs" (which are relatively minor - these medications are considered quite safe).  Stimulant medications do not "change" children's personalities or "break" their spirits - they help them improve their ability to function academically, emotionally, and socially.  Why wouldn't you want these things for your child?  Please talk to a physician or psychologist and ask for book recommendations.  This book is a waste of time!
