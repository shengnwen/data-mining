The book had an impact on me. It did, for instance, tinker with my idea of what dating should be (or shoudl be like). But the book is like a dogmatic pile of rules that people should abide by. And worse still, the book is interwoven with scripture to make it sound like the Bible says such and such about dating, instead of Joshua Harris. 

I know that his heart is in helping people grow in their relationships, but this book is written from a perspective high up on an alter of self-righteousness - and down below, the rest of the world, broken and depraved. I mean, as a student (and now I am a teacher), I have sat through many college courses where professors talk about the ideal of education - every child can learn, every parent cares, and every child comes with some innate bundle of intelligence. But the real classroom is nothing like this. When Harris talks about asking the father of the girl you are about to date for her hand in courtship, or when he discusses going to his father for advise or for his pastor for guidance, I think he is talking about an ideal that few people actually have access to. Should they? Perhaps. But this book is written in such a manner that says that unless you do this, then it is highly improbable that your relationship can survive - or better yet, be as good as his.
