Perhaps I should ask why it was published and how come some of those folks on the back cover mislead us with undue praise. Did they read the bool or just endorse it as a favor?  There should be more integity in the reviewers who are often paid by the book company or do some one a favor in exchange for a good review of their work, but this leads us to mustrust them and regret spending money on books that waste our time.

This is so here in a book about one man's journal during a summer sabbatical while he prepares to teach a one day workshop on Merton's poetry. It adds nothing to the glut of Merton books and sheds no new light on Merton himself.  What it does do is show us how the author is enamored with Merton, whose poetry was after all not that good, and who would not appreciate such hero worship
