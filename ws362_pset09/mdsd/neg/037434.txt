The authors seem to assume that by the time most graduate students complete and defend their dissertations they are bereft of the simplest social graces.  Doctorally prepared adults who can't keep themselves from  being obstreperous with prospective colleagues, chairpersons and deans need  therapy and not &quot;strategic rhetorics.&quot;  This is a poorly written  and highly dispiriting book.  You'd do well to stay away from it
