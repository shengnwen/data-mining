This is truly one of the worst books I have ever read.  The writing style is tedious and jumbled.  Jacoby has little sense of logical flow.  But more importantly, her historical research is TERRIBLE.  The examples are endless, but for example:
*Jacoby argues that the Founding Fathers really wanted a strict church and state separation, but then goes on to only quote Jefferson and Madison.  So what happened to the many other framers, such as Washington, Hamilton, Adams, Jay, and so forth?  Oh right, they probably didn't fit her argument just so, so she conveniently leaves them out.
*According to Jacoby, Lincoln never mentioned the Almighty/God/Supreme Being in the Gettysburg Address.  Clearly, she has never read this speech.
*Jacoby also blames organized religion for helping slavery keep its grip on the country.  Essentially, Jacoby sees it as an organized religion v. freethinking issue.  Wrong!  It was a sectional issue, and people from both groups supported both sides.

These are a few examples, and her bad work on these aspects is enough to make one doubt everything else she says.  Additionally, her critiques of 'non-freethinkers' is especially biting, and serves to make her sound childish rather than educated.
