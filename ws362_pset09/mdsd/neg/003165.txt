I really like Paul Colligan's website and podcasts about podcasting (both very highly recommended -- search on Google to find them), and I eagerly ordered a copy of this book, expecting some great information.  Frankly, I am very disappointed.  This book is nothing more than a poorly produced extended commercial, full of platitudes both general and inspecific.  This book explores a lot of general business philosophy, but provides little practical, applicable advice about how to really make any money in podcasting.  There are a *few* good ideas hidden in here -- but you have to wade through a *lot* of prose to find them.  Unlike some of the other excellent podcasting advice books in print (see Jason van Orden's "Promoting Your Podcast" and Walch/Lafferty's "Tricks of the Podcasting Masters"), this book just didn't meet my expectations -- which were admittedly high, considering the impressive pedigrees of the two authors.  Paul and Alex, you two are acknowledged experts in this field, and you can do a lot better than this book.  In addition, I was struck at how poorly organized and produced this book really is -- no titles for chapters (which makes sense, since there is little organization to the subject matter -- many of the chapters read the same), and no index.  There is, however, a lot of advertising tucked in here and there for services provided by Paul and Alex.  When I buy a book from industry experts, I don't want an infomercial -- I want real information.   I even went to the "member site" referred to in the book, and ran into technical problems when trying to access it.  Frustrating?  You bet.  My advice: skip this book, and go to Paul Colligan's excellent blog -- you'll find a LOT more useful information there
