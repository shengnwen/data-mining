OK...here's what I think: Anyone whose parents named him "Firpo" probably got a lot of teasing as a little boy, and the whole gay thing really upsets him and he's spent his entire adult career self-publishing these explanations for why he's not one of, you know, The Gays.

But really, any author who titles a book: Are Gays Really 'Gay'? A Sociological, Scientific, and Theological Analysis can't really be taken seriously. Theology has no place in science. And the assumption that theology is necessarly a benign source of information is laughable in an era in which the church-state line has been so thoroughly blurred. Though you have to admire the honesty with which the author trots out his blind faith in judeo-christian mythology to justify his bogus theses. This is not a scientist, this is a bigot who will twist facts and specious Biblical translations to suit his prejudices.

And if you liked this book, be sure to pick up Firpo's second book: Are Women Really 'Hysterical'? A Sociological, Scientific and Theological Analysis
