Some unique and wonderful war stories made this otherwise embarassingly bad book worth the time invested in reading it.  Sadly, Bruce not only worked without a ghost writer, but must have negotiated a deal that tied his editor's hands.  Too much of the writing is disjointed, self-indulgent, and inappropriately compiled.  Some parts contain too much uninteresting personal detail (although a daughter-in-the-studio story or two might have been fun), while others contain more technical details than even a geek like me wants to read (I already know that I'll never be able to afford 99% of the equipment he uses).  Much too frequently, sentence after sentence is distractingly bad or inappropriate.  This could have been a monumental work if someone like Bobby Owsinski had interviewed Bruce and written the book.  Instead, we have an awful first draft of great stories by someone that has no writing skills.  Enjoy the stories, but know what you're getting
