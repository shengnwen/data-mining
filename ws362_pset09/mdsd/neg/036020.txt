Bevin Alexander has written in the past the excellent book "How Great Generals Win", but this new one is so much disappointing that I couldn't believe it came from the same author. Nothing new is contained, and the title is misleading because Bevin Alexander does not point out the fatal errors of the Nazi Germany but only recounts the trivial history of World War II without offering any new perspective. If you want to read something interesting about World War II, avoid this book and try instead Richard Overy's "How the Allies Won" or John Ellis' "Brute Force", or the much discussed and controversial study of Martin van Creveld "Fighting Power"
