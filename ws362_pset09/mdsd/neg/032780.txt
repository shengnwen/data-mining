Rowan is a so-called witch with a bad itch that needs scratching preferably by Rick.  But hey, why stop there?  The plot is incomplete.  The bad guys aren't really bad guys.  The transitions between the scenes are jerky.  Characters run from Point A to Point B and back to Point A again.  This book is completely pointless and a waste of time.  For a good witch story, try Nora Robert's Three Sisters Island Trilogy
