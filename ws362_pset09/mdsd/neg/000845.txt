This is a book written by women - for women - almost all of the examples and people profiled are women - they even go so far as to quote a writer page 235 co-auther Jennifer) as saying, &quot;Sometimes it bores me - why I am pigeonholed into looking at things from a woman's point of view all the time?&quot; One gets the feeling that this collaboration was done by a few ladies sipping espresso for the purposes of marketing themselves and hoping to garnish more freelance work in the process. Some of the chapters are useful - if you are a woman and want to write about women's issues - but the areas where they deal with non-women-focused interviews, quotes and advice seem as they were thrown in as an after-thought - somewhat as if the manuscript was finished and the editors commented that they needed SOMETHING for SOMEBODY who isn't a feminist
