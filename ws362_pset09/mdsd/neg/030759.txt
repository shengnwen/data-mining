Talk about selling out to the whims of 21st century secularism... When the word Bible has to stand for something other than the bible, we have lost our way.

Where is the focus of the client in bible counseling? I believe that those seeking help and counseling need the focus to be on their healing, not the dogmatic agenda of the counselor. How is that going to help someone? It makes them more dependent, and vulnerable, to the manipulators of the faith.

Drop your personal agenda, ask your client questions and let them organize their options and plans for moving through their challenges. When stuck, find appropriate guidance on such topics biblically and ask the person to be accountable for their actions. The key to success is listening with a non-judgemental mind
