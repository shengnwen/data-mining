This collection of essays is a complete joke. Christian Kim is completely ignorant of Jewish law. These essays are incoherent and poorly argued. Many key historical facts have been distorted, omitted and even invented to fit Kim's crazy arguments. It seems to me that Kim is on a crusade to destroy Jews and Israel. I would stay well away from this book, it really is crap
