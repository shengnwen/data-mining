I cannot understand why this book got so many good reviews. I'm not saying that if I didn't like it, no one can or should, but I really don't understand. It's so tedious. Every little thing in these unbelievable characters' lives is described to such great length. Unnecessarily so. Why do we need to know all the details about every piece of art work this guy made? A summary would do. And to take soooooo long before getting to the point. It's like half the book was merely background to the reall thing, but why so long?! And the characters don't come alive despite all those details. They don't feel like people, just mouthpieces for views on hysteria and art. No matter what, I just didn't care about any of the characters. And even as a novel of ideas, I think this one would fail. The ideas are not developed, they're described like self-gratification, something you may take from a friend but not someone you don't care about. So, clearly I didn't like this one. I would just like to understand what I missed that made all those others love the book so much
