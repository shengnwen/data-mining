After reading other reviews, I expected an erudite, flowing novel which would connect multiple worlds.  What I discovered was a complicated plot that does not make it easy for the reader to understand.  I do believe that if writing is too difficult to comprehend, then is not clear writing, and I wonder if the author really knows if she is presenting a ghost or love story of both.  If it is both, it is confusing to me.  The action is wrapped around two cousins, one successul and the victim of a childhood prank of the other loser adult cousin.  We are transported to a castle near Prague where we imagine the successful cousin will finally have retribution, Egan spins a tale of blood lore based on family pride.  From this narrative, she shifts to a maximum security prison where the characters are similar to the castle folk.  The creative writing teacher, Holly, becomes a main character, who has her own demons and finds a commonaility with a prisoner who is the same, we are to believe, as the loser cousin.  She does prove that escape is impossible, and I wish I could have found some sanctuary if I understood what she really wanted to tell us
