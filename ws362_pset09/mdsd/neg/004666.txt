Okay, there's always one in the bunch that runs contrary, and I guess, in this case, it's us .

My just turned 3 year-old son and 5 year-old daughter could care less about this book.  It was on my entering-kindergarteners Summer Reading List and I suppose they thought that kids would be fascinated by the concept of riding a bus to school... but mine weren't.  Probably because there was no plot and little of interest other than the nice pictures of yellow buses.

Text follows, which may or may not help you decide if this book is a good choice for your home shelves:

"Yellow school buses
large and small.
Empty yellow buses cross the town.
Stop.
Go.
Going this way.  Going that way.
Here it comes.
See you later.
Full Buses head for school.
Here we are.
Right on time.
Empty buses wait.
School's over.
Full buses cross the town.
Home again.
Home again."

Two Stars.  Unrelenting parade of the standard yellow school bus.  Nice art, but no story
