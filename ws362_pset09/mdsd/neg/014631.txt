I received a very old copy of this book which was in terrible shape.  I tried to make a request to return back to the shipper but with no response and no help!  The book I received was published in 1992!  I feel that I got a bad deal and no assistance.  No support from Amazon after multiple attempts.  This was a real rip off with no ability to correct the problem!!!!!  

Overall rating would be less than 1 star.
