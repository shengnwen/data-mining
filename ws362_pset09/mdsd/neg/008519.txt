Avoid being egoistic -- these three words sum up the entire book, so if you already know this, don't bother with the book.  Based on other rave reviews here, and from hearing Ben Stein on the radio, I decided to give this book a try.  This book serves two purposes: as a humor book and as an inverted self-help book.  Regarding humor, I was disappointed to find the book as a whole, not funny.  I smiled a couple of times, but that was it.  In terms of the self-help aspect of the book, there is really nothing new here and Mr. Stein is very redundant - so much so that it suppresses any humor he was trying to convey. Overall the book could quickly be summed up by reading the table of contents and afterward section in the back of the book -- which is only a couple of pages.  Another weakness in the book is that Mr. Stein tries to address too wide of an audience and on the same page he will address you as wife, husband, and student -- this makes parts of the book awkward to read, and I'm surprised editors didn't catch this.  Thankfully I picked this book up at my library today and didn't buy it, because frankly, I don't think it is worth the money and wasn't what I expected from a man of Mr. Stein's noteriety
