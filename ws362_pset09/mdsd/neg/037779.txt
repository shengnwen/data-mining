This was the first novel I've read by Sydney Sheldon.  The character development, plot development and prose is drivel compared to books by Greg Iles, Joseph Finder, Nelson DeMille, Richard Crais, Michael Connelly, Sheldon Siegel, and Richard North Patterson.  Its so bad, I'm throwing the book out so I won't make the mistake of rereading it.  Raise your standards people!
