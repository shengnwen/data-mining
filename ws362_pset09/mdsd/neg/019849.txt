I bought this book because I was intrigued by the title. I expected a book that considered words used with criminal intent, in general. 

I am disappointed that pornography is the only crime considered here. I wish the author had examined other kinds of cases--not to mention many many more specific examples. There is probably a wealth of legal material on such crimes, if only the author had broadened her horizons.

While I agree that pornography can be a crime, I find the author's arguments used to ban it fundamentally flawed. As other reviewers have noted, this book is argued poorly, uses a shoddy set of examples, and definitely runs afoul of logic. 

Had I been interested in an anti-pornography book, I would have preferred one showing practical means to legally limit its damage. 

This book does not argue cogently that the first and 14th amendments are NOT considered equally in cases of criminal use of words.

Neither does it effectively show that words can be criminal, or suggest means to prosecute such crimes. A pity.
