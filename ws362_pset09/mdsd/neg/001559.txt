I have to preface this review by saying that I normally do not have a visceral reaction to novels and stories I do not like.  As a matter of fact, I have wasted a good chunk of my life reading things that were no good and or not worth reading.  That being said, I actually threw this book across the room.  I have never read such a self-congratulatory piece in all my life.  The smug conceit of the author actually oozes out of every page.  The book made me go and reread some Dostoevsky, just so I could feel better about the world and literature
