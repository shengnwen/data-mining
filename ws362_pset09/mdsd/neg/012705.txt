This is a terrible book. If you are into getting only the 1st 200 pokemon in the "hoen" region, this book is okay. But, if you are like me, and you want to get all 386, find another book. The description above says that you can get every pokemon in the game, yet it only lists the 200 in the "hoen" region, while still making refrences to jirachi and deoxys, saying basically that you cant get them in America. So, don't waste your money on this useless piece of garbage and go buy a gameshark. I sat around for 8 days, waiting for it to show up, only to be dissapointed beyond belief at its poor maps, unhelpfull pokedex and very vague item and berry information. SO, dont waste your money on this guide, or the prima guide, just buy a cheating system because I think you would be alot more satisfied and get your moneys worth
