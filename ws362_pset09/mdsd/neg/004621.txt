I have been trading futures for about 3 years, and wanting to learn more about spread trading. This book is very dry reading, and difficult for a beginner to go through. No color graphs. Just boring tables with numbers, and many words. Not an easy book for a visual learner. Seasonality is hinted upon, but no good charts provided, and he does not really tell you when to do what, or what triggers or conditions to look for to enter a position. His section on spread options trading is perhaps easier to grasp, and I did learn a bit from that. A more advanced trader might perhaps glean more from this book than I did, but I do not recommend it for the beginner
