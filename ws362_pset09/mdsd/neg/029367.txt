 	The book Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage is about the economy and the impact one scientist had on the world with his predictions.  Hubbert's theory stated that in the early 1970's oil production would reach its highest level. He was doubted my many scientists, but when it came true scientists used it to look at what the future holds for oil production. It is expected to hit this decade at some point. This book describes the origin of oil and development over the many years. It also describes several different oil fields and the prosperity of them, and the different types of techniques and bits used to find oils by scientists. Each scientist has different methods of finding the oil fields, and they use data sets to record the sites and sizes of them. It provides an overview of what the future holds for oil production, and what different kinds of energy we can resort too if needed to avoid the economic troubles lying ahead.
	I thought this book was overall pretty boring. I wasn't  entertained or hooked on it, and it didn't make me want to keep reading in the end. I found it very confusing most of the time, and it had a lot of information to try to digest all at once, such as numbers and equations. It wasn't the kind of book I really get indulged in, and want to read more of, or cant put down. 
	I would recommend this book to those who like to read books about our economy and what's going on in different industries. This book is easier to read for adults, as it contains advanced material that could confuse younger children. For those who enjoy reading advanced books about our economy or oil, this is an excellent book.
