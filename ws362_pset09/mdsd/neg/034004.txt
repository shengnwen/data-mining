Today I looked at the genuine leather edition of the ESV single column. I love the translation, and the format. But the paper is so thin there is ridiculous bleedthrough. Since the print is only 10 pt, a crisp and clean page is critical for readability. Because the paper is so thin, it is easy to read the opposite side of the page! 

Additionally, the leather and the binding seem less than ideal.

I have waited a long time for a side-column edition of the ESV, and it looks like I will have to wait even long for another publisher to produce one. Why Crossway would go to all the trouble of producing a new edition only to use such an inferior paper is beyond me
