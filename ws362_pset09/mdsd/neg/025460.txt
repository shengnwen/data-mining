The book talks too much about the author's life and his father.  Very little about the games.  Some of the material is based upon interviews with former Colts that were conducted for the author.  Some of the information about the Colts before 1952 (when they were the Dallas Texans), and particularily the Colts of the AAFC I had not heard before, but it makes up just a few pages of the book
