Without a doubt, Way Bandy is a unique and legendary talent. However, this book was very dissapointing. There are no actual photos of his work on women in this book...NOT ONE. The &quot;illustrations&quot; are nothing more than amateurish sketches which do not benefit the reader. You will get more examples of his work in any Francesco Scavullo book...buy one of those and save yourself from buying a useless and abysmally boring book
