While I am addicted to the Cat Who series and wish only that there were some that I had not yet read, 14 Tales was a great disappointment. I found it overly sentimental and cloying.  There were few stories that seemed  worthy of Ms. Braun's time and talents as a writer.  The great strength of  Ms. Braun's books is her hero Jim Quilleran and the amusing cast of  characters who inhabit his world.  Picking up a new Cat Who (or rereading  one already read) is something like revisiting an old friend.  There is no  such sense in the Tales. It is the only work of Ms. Braun's to which I  would not wish to return
