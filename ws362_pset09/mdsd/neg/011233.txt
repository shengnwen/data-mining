I've read a couple of Levinson's books but this may be the last. This book was flawed in so many important ways that I would not recommend it for anyone with more than a cursory understanding of marketing. 

As a couple of other reviewers pointed out. Levinson is trying to take complex marketing principles and transform them into bullets and coy little catchphrase. In the process he looses the complexity and richness of the topic, reducing the principles to a "taste great, less filling" tagline. While this might be successful if he is selling beer where "taste great less filling" is enough information for us to make a decision about what beer we are going to drink it is too superficial for framing our marking efforts. 

Second, the writing is so awful it's uncomfortable. Poorly constructed sentences, incorrect word choices, and mixed and sometimes inappropriate metaphors abound. For example, on page 30 we are to believe that marketing is a bit like being a duck hunter were we blast our target (our customers) with a shot gun but on page 31 were the "big ducks" that flap our wings presumable being shot at by others if we are to follow his metaphor?.  This doesn't make sense. 

Third, the structure of the book--30 days to guerrilla marketing--is artificial and not very helpful. A thematic arrangement (like in his other books and most other marketing books) might have been more useful.

Now, on the other hand I did find helpful the basic messages of the book--that marketing is an ongoing process, not something you doing once or twice, that marketing is about knowing who you are and who your competitors are, and so forth. Unfortunately the messengers gets in the way of the message in far too many cases. 

For my money, Levinson's other books are a better value as is The Portable MBA in Marketing
