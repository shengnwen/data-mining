I read the book to see how far Lindsey could go,and it's way too far.This book is nothing but hate filled lies to flame up
the hate against Islam by evangelical neocons who want to make 
their form of Christianty the main religion in the world.I'm terrified by how many people but into Lindsey's mindset.It's a 
tragic time we live in when all that matters is using religion
for power and economic controll.He refuses to see the mistakes
the United States has made to support Israel at all costs,especially our security.He has absolutely no understanding of cause and effect,of how we are in the mess we
in now.Muslims aren't the ones destroying Christianty,it's 
people like Lindsey who make followers into rabid Islam 
hating war mongers
