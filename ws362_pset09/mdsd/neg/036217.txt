Not the nicest thing to say, but I found this book is acompletely waste of both money and reading effort. After reading Ms Aftels first book on natural perfumery, I had expected something similar and was deeply dissapointed. This is one tiny book, but so is Mindy Greens book "Natural Perfumes" and that one is surely worth every dime. The size of the fonts are too large = very little text on each page and the sad fact is, that it contains absolutely nothing new, that wasn't covered in Ms Aftels first book. Some of the pictures are beautiful, but so are the ones in other books on perfumery. The very few formulas that is offered are simple beyond simpleness and I believe that even  beginner at the art of NP could come up with more inovative ones.

My advice is - don't buy this book! If you is interested in natural perfumery, there are quite  few books on this topic, that offers more knowledge and inspiration than this one
