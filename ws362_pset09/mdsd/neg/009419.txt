Bought this book hoping for a properly constructed thesis, very disappointing. If you don't subscribe to his thesis to begin with that the world is agin men being receptive like women, and that religions that disdain homosexuality are in fear of losing their patriarchal structure; ie. receptive male intercourse undermines male hierarchy and confuses sexual roles - well if you don't accept this to start with you won't after reading this book.

It would be good to read a proper logical argument instead of frantic efforts to heap sand into ramparts before the tide of critical opinion comes in and washes these soluble ramparts away; but I have not yet found it, and this book doesn't either.

It is actually quite pathetic, there is an absence of hard logic or reasoned fact. Men may well engage in same-sex relations because it pleasures them, or for some dysfunctional reason; it is the hedonism that offends religion, not the feminist line about threats to male hierarchy...............then again Dr Long can hardly use "penis envy" as a rationale but otherwise he re-hashes feminist jargon to pose some great threat to male family structures if one of them decides to bend over and be receptive to male advances.

It is like tackling a souffle; the book has no coherent argument and merely reinforces existing prejudices; if you want to believe this nonsensical thesis you will enjoy the book provided you are not given to rational thought; otherwise you will feel you have just read some flaccid prose in a third-rate magazine.............maybe you have
