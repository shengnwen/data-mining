Overall, I can't say much beyond what others have written about this book. It's more wiccan than Norse, and any Astaru worshiper would be appalled at how Conway writes. Mind you, ANYTHING Conway writes is Wiccan based, be it Norse Magick, or Dragon Magick, or any other book they have written. Nice for beginners, but beyond new ritual ideas, nothing else is any good. (I have a feeling Conway jumped on the money making wagon that other wiccan writers seem to have and lost all sense of why they are writing this stuff) However, it's not all bad, just most of it. Some of the stuff in it is not so bad, if a little basic and full of fluff
