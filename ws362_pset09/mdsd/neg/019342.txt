Natural Law and Natural Rights by John Finnis is, by far, the worst book I have ever read. The author maps his arguments in an outline format, in the hope of capturing his audience.  Though, this outline format is way of organizing ideas within different topics, it lacks the extensive explanation and cross-referrences a reader needs. Real-life examples are out of the question, since the author neither give them nor explain them fully.  In addition, to the lack of explanations, the author speaks as if he has intelligence. It is clearly obvious that he knows nothing about keeping his audience awake.  Despite the fact that this book is boring, the author also loses the audience by making simple arguments sound complex, thus, using uneccessary vocabulary.  Granted, this book is not intended for neanderthals, however, anyone would agree that this book is not worth the paper its printed on
