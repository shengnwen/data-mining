   This book is not really a commentary but an explanation of Tim LaHaye's view of the end times which is not thorough and leaves tons of holes. The whole Rapture movement is based on almost no Biblical grounds but is popular just because it makes for exciting books. For a thorough, well-researched, understandable, and Biblically sound commentary on Revelation, pick up Herman Hoeksema's outstanding work, Behold, He Cometh!
