Why look at self-sabotaging human behaviors as an addiction?  An addiction is a serious disorder that requires medical attention.  No scientific evidence is provided to support the existence of an addiction to unhappiness or that recognizing an "aversive reaction" is key to defeating the addiction.  Countless people overcome self-defeating behaviors through the love and support of friends, self-help groups, families, church, etc.  without referring to themsleves as "addicted."  Some even have the temerity to call this growth promoting behavior "maturity" -- something most adults are capable of through out their life span.  While early childhood experiences clearly affect our lives, the journey not to be defined by one's past and to build a good life is something we must all do and something that has been done without the unscientific overblown claims of  these two authors.
