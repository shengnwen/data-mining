I had to read this book for class.  It wasn't that good.  Conversations get confusing because its not clear who is saying what.  It might be a small book but its tedious reading.  I'm usually a fast reader but it took me a couple of days just to get through 3 chapters.  I asked around at class and found that I was not the only one who had this problem.  Its less painful if you just get a summary or if you just get someone to tell you what happens
