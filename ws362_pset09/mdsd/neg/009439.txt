Robert Anton Wilson is sort of like the Howard Stern of the New Age movement. I'll give him this, he's entertaining. This book however, gets a resounding 'piece of crap' rating. It's a great book of fun little facts, but completely lacks any unifying theme (despite what you'd think), and Wilson degenerates all too often into one of his pat rants. This guy's getting old, and he apparently needs money, because he's cranking out high-volume and low quality lately, and re-issuing danged near everything. It's incredibly interesting (as a synthesis of facts already known to me and avid RAW Readers) in the first few chapters, but then meanders like the mind of a septagenarian, life-long potsmoker (oh wait, that's what Wilson *is*!!), on his deathbed. It gets into 15 year old news (the Manhattan Beach Satanic child abuse case(s)....ummmm...Why!?), 'Seeing-is-not-knowing' General Semantics that Wilson is wellknown for and 'map is not the territory' etc...all of which have *what* to do with a neo/quasi-fascist conspiracy financed by Dutch-English-American banker/extant blueblood families that have subverted the American Constitution? Well, I don't friggin' know either, but my guess is that the answer is 'nothing' and Wilson needed to put out a book. There's this whole reciprocally fellative network that I've noticed with these 'new agers' cross-endorsing their latest project and the New Falcon Press is a particularly egregious case of this phenomenon (in fact, in some occult bookstores, the genre, yes the *genre* is listed as Wilson-Hyatt- hahahahahahahaha)
