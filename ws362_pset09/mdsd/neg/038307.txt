Every young woman's experience with cancer is different so this account is useful from that perspective.  But as a young survivor I found it very ego-centric and not at all relateable. Is it tragic that she got breast cancer - yes.  Is it more tragic that she got breast cancer AND she's "pretty" and married to a doctor and knows people whose names we recognize - no.  While I acknowledge that body image and issues of sexuality and attractiveness seem to be more acute the younger a woman is - this book never develops beyond the surface.  Being someone that is not interested in "It" girls (or guys) to begin with - her "it" experience with breast cancer is also lack-luster for me
