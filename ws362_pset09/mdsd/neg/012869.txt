No seriously.
I had the highest expectation for this experience. But the story is a mess.
It's episodic to the point of distraction. The point of view changes randomly. At one point it's a confession, or a "verbal account". Then it is a written account from a character hardly seen in the first 70% of the story. To say the characters are weakly developed is an insult to...uh...weak people. The language is occasionally witty, but often repetitive and uninteresting.
The best part of the novel is the epilogue, which gives details of the Phantom's origins, all of which are FAR more interesting than the contents of the book. I also loved a bit about the real Opera House that came with my Easton Press copy.
I loved the stage musical, I loved the old films, I liked the new film...this was extremely disappointing
