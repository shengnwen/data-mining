I agree with bibliophile. Most of the 'free' things were catalogs. Here's a sampling of the 'free' stuff. L.L Bean Catalogs, pamplets on raising puppies and kittens from Purina, a free copy of 'Sheer Facts About Hoisery', a Lane Bryant catalog, Lilian Vernon and Harriet Carter catalogs, a free photo or greeting from the president. And the list goes on and on. What do these things have to to with seniors? There are about 100 pages in the back where they talk about free prescription programs and some State sponsored programs for seniors. That might be the only redeeming thing in this book. I returned it to Amazon. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow zero
