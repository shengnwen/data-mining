Well, I am really glad I borrowed this book instead of buying it because I saved myself the 10 bucks.  There's nothing new in this book.  At least he doesn't go on and on about his political agenda like he did in the last book but in this one all he does is tell you to feed big pieces of bone and doesn't talk at all about WHAT you're feeding - as in the quality of food.  Don't you think it's important to talk about that?  I mean, is it natural and okay to feed your dogs hormone and antibiotic laden food for its entire life?  Give me a break.  I would would have expected more from someone who supposedly knew so much.

Bottom line: don't waste your money
