I was disappointed in this book.  Most of it is a field guide to the birds that isn't necessary if you own a good field guide already, such as Sibley.  I expected more detailed descriptions of the birding sites listed, as I have seen in other guides.  The descriptions about birding sites in this book were very basic.  This might be helpful for a new birder.
