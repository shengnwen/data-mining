Carter's attempt to trace the disingenuous way in which many Americans have forsaken their moral compass in favor of political labels and bumper-sticker-grade philosophy is just about on target.  His prescribed fixes, however, are little more than just the sort of swell-sounding but essentially empty rhetoric which he is skewering.
While Carter promises a new approach to integrity in American life, all he seems to have on tap is a lot of quotations and circular logic.  "We can learn to do right by doing the right thing, or listening to the right people," he seems to say, without ever providing a really supportable definition of those terms.  Instead, he depends on his own, completely subjective, ideas of right and wrong, which don't convince.  His appeals to group ethics are slightly more useful, but fall prey to the same critiques he is leveling at what he calls "media culture" and other left-wing "evils."
Political hackwork.
