This book is an excellant example of Liberal thought taken to the level of complete nonsense. Filled with statements such as  "It is difficult for any white American not to have an immediate feeling of fear in the presence of an African-American male."(pg 68) and "We expect men of color to be dangerous." (pg 69) and in the context of challenging racism we might see in other whites, "How can we challenge other whites when we may need them in case of attack?"[by a balck male](pg 68) and "...we are more easily deceived by white leaders who have an aura of trustwothiness simply because they are white." (pg 71). These are just a very small sampling of the silly statements that are evident on each page. In an obvious attempt to conjur deep feelings of guilt, the book rehashes all of the horrible things that whites have done to people of color. This is always, ALWAYS!, counter productive. Many of the solutions that he offers will never be taken seriously by Moderate-Liberal to Conservative persons. And that is the real problem with this book-unless you are a far Left individual already predisposed to believing the largely unsubstantiated opinions he offers you will more than likely dismiss everything he says and throw the baby out with the bathwater. Racism does exist. This book offers very little to uproot it
