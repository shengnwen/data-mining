I haven't read the book but I am about to buy it so this isn't a review it's just a comment on the other reviews.

I don't know exactly how the writing linked Taoism and Ninjutsu as I haven't read the book. I just wanted to say this isn't the first time I have heard of this. 

It was in one of either of these two books I can't remember which (I would bet on the first):

Mind Manipulation
The Ninja - Steven Hayes

They discuss the development of alot of the psychoogical aspects from the Taoist 5 elements and there was a reference to some "5 element ninjas." There was even a Japanese word for them.

I remember this clearly coz at the time I was doing XIng Yi Luihe a Taoist art with the 5 elements at its heart. Also the 5 element ninja idea sounded cool.

I am not concluding anything...just offering a bit of info in passing.

PS. My rating was just to try and not mess up the rating by others.
