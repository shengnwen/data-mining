Perhaps this is the most difficult review I had ever written after my 100+ trading related postings here on Amazon. It's just so hard to give you a summary of a book that provides little substance at all. In short, the author used five chapters on economics/psychology/expectations/sentiment, two chapters on TA tools including Market Profile, Long Term Market Activity Chart, two chapters on merging the former paragraphs into the author's Coherent Market Theory and then Sentiment-Activity Model, and five chapters to illustrate the power of the Model on T-Bond, Sobbeans, DM and Crude Oil. Well, does that look like the thesis you and I did in colleges? It doesnt really matter if the ideas are useful and applicable. However, they are not. It's simply not practical at all for any genuine trader, not to mention the low possibility of any reader to understand the usage of Market Profile and LTMA Chart with the little coverage of them in the book. Besides, the writing of the author is really boring. 
  
  Very green trader reader may find the first few chapters interesting, but they will certainly get lost from chapter five onwards and can hardly move to chapter seven. In case you got plenty of time and money to waste, that's fine. If not, go for some book else. 
  
  p.s. I can hardly believe that the author is a FX trader, and had traded commodities and cash bond for Fortune 500 companies as well. I might prefer him to write books about his trading life instead of giving a long useless lecture on something useless.
