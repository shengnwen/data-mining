I am not sure if I should be disappointed with the book itself, or the fact that Dan Kennedy's students run around online giving all his products 5 star blindly.

This book is NOT written by Dan Kennedy. Dan Kennedy only wrote the first chapter, and from that point on, each chapter contains teaser content and a plug for a different guru.

This book has some nice overview of some examples, but it is not as good as the reviewers make it out to be. You will not get anything concrete out of it
