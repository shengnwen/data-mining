Sullivan was one of the best around.  But somehow he has become just another doom and gloom pundit.  He even manages to equate the Christian right with the Islamo terrorists. It is a shame to see such a talented guy become an extremist too.  His optimism has been replaced by cynicism and hate.  He used to make arguments and discuss both sides and how he ridicules others and calls them names.
