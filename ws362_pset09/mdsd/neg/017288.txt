I would not recommend this poem book to people unless they like reading this type of poetry, or poetry in general.  While I was reading these poems, I found it very hard to concentrate on the poem I was reading, because the poems didn't really catch my interest.  I don't think I would enjoy reading another poetry book bye Edgar Allen Poe because I don't really like his type of poetry.  My mind wandered a lot while I was reading Poe's poems because they weren't exciting, they were sad, scary, and gloomy
