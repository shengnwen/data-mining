this book was so terribly boring that it made me come close to tears when knowing that i had to read this book for a project. There are no clif notes, spark notes, etc. for this book and there should be. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS BOOK! it has no twist, and i can't even imagine how there could be one, considering that it was the same boring historical detail over and over and over again. if you must read this book, i recommend some strong coffee and some valium
