After hearing Christiane on PBS I really thought the c d package would be directed at developing a friendship with your mother after reaching adulthood. Why they act the way they do, how to see their words and actions through their eyes, understanding them and letting the pain they cause drop away. But this c d is directed at mothers with girls still living at home. How to raise them so they have self pride, integrity and can handle finances. Only the first tape talked about mothers and daughters over 35. It was a waste of my money.
