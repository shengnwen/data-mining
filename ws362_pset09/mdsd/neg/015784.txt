I belived that this book was written in collaboration with James A. Michener.  Michener writes all of his works with great detail and research of facts and information.  This book has none of the  Michener style and  substance.  Instead it lacked quality, depth and information.  Every part  of the body ends with &quot;I love and  appreciate my beautiful [teeth,  gums, neck,spine...]&quot; This was my first ever purchase online, and I  feel that I was misled as to any Michner involvement in this book (not even  an introduction which would have indicated his feeling of quality)
