Being an admirer of Mr. Mercer's work, I looked forward to reading this book.  I found the bio's author, who was acquainted with the songwriter, to be way too intrusive, opinionated and judgmental.  The author heaps abuse on Mercer's wife of many years mostly because of her life post-Johnny and, amazingly enough, because she apparently wasn't a good conversationalist ("I could never find anything to talk about with her" is the refrain that occurs way too often).  The other reviews of this book posted here interested me because it hints at something that is completely glossed over in the book - Mercer's sexuality.  The closest it gets to the issue is the  statement that Judy Garland always got involved with homosexual men, followed a few sentences later with the beginning of Mercer's affair with her.  Mercer is obviously tormented and unhappy about something throughout his life - Lees near the end of the book tries to pin it on Ginger, but given the apparent lack of passion in that relationship, that doesn't seem to hold up.  If Lees is afraid to say Mercer was closeted, fine - but he shouldn't then blame everything wrong in his life on his wife.  Mercer was an incredibly talented man - but I think being the wife of a sexually conflicted man is probably not the happiest position to be in either.  There is a lot of good information about Mercer in this book, but the author puts himself in the middle of it much too much
