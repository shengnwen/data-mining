This is a tract, not a thoughtful piece of scholarship. It is in the Latin American school of angry social science, but is little informed by fact.  Much of what it says is correct, but is also well known.  But the analysis is weak, based on incorrect or outdated data, and simply a regurgitation of stereotypes instead of a deductive grounded analysis based upon good ethnographic work.   It is therefore often simply wrong.  But anger sells books....
