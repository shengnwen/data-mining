Hoping for an exciting read with this, my first Lee Child mystery.  Unfortunately you don't always get what you hoped for.  Every aspect of this story is poorly thought out.   I'm as willing as the next person to suspend reality for the sake of an exciting storyline, but this is too implausible to be ignored.  Buy a John Sandford novel instead.
