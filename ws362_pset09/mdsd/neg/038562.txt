I enjoyed the first 2-3 Covington books but this will be the last one I read. 
 
The dialogue is so contrived, they don't sound like real people.  Also, since I've read the previous books, all of the recapping--especially when the characters themselves do it--is tedious and boring. 

One reviewer (on the cover of this book) compared Jan Karon's books to Ms. Medlicott's, which is a great disservice to Ms. Karon.  Jan Karon's writing and character development are far superior to the Ladies of Covington books!

I also find it discouraging that the Covington books are labeled by some as Christian fiction, since one of the main characters is having sex out of wedlock and another is married to a man but living with two women friends.  These situations are not what I would endorse as Christian living
