Another one of these self published books that I have been sucked into buying (like "The Great Pretender"!!) because all of the author's friends and Publisher's acquantances have logged onto Amazon and written positive reviews.  This is part of the deal when a new author signs on to get their book published.

Really poorly written.  Terrible waste of money and time, I am glad I bought it used.  DON'T BUY INTO THE HYPE
