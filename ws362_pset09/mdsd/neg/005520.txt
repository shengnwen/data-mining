Like most things from Entrepreneur, this book does not offer a lot of depth.  It is a good primer for someone considering starting a concierge business or errand service.  There are a few good ideas along with a lot of common sense that the average person will have figured out before buying the book.  Several times the author claims &quot;there is no hard data available&quot; - I worked in B2B market research for 9 years, I know reliable data can be developed by anyone who makes the effort.  This is the first book I've read on the topic, so I can't make other recommendations yet, but look for this at your library before paying money for it
