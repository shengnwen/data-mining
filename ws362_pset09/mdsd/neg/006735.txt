A humorous account of another young 60s counter-culturist who was enlightened as a young man by hookers, opiates and SE Asian narcotics that "opened his eyes" to the "goodness and purity" of the Khmer Rouge, Viet Cong, Ho Chi Minh, Pathet Lao, "French enlightenment" of the Souteast Asian barbarians of the 19th century, and of course last but not least~ the absolute horrendous barbarity of the hegemonic & demonic US regimes that failed to truly understand these great organizations of the 50s thru 70s (yawn...).  He waxes on and on about his great acquaintences of Phnom Penh's and Hue's opiate dens as this "illustrious journalist" of the vaulted 4th Estate.  Pretty pathetic writing overall as I waded through all the despot worshipping until it just got way to sycophantical.  Saloth Sar, Ta Mok, Ieng Sary and General Giap would have loved to have Mr Swain nearby at nap time ........ :)   If you loved John Kerry's tired anti-Vietnam War fantasies, you will love Mr Swain's opiate dreams book immensely!
