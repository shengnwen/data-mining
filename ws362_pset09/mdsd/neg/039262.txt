i read this book on advice of a friend, so i finished it.  but i didn't find this book gripping or inspirational.  i didn't have sympathy for any of the characters and the writing was bloated.  while i was reading i found my mind wandering and didn't feel a need to go back and read paragraphs or sentences i missed while wandering.  the characters are somewhat true to life in that they are total environmental hypocrites, but the book didn't present this as something to work on avoiding. overall a long read that just made me realize why so many people hate tree huggers
