The message in this book is very outdated and a  nightmare to anyone interested in preserving the environment. I love Dr. Seuss and ordered many  of the books for my son. This one however I have to send  back.  The little boy, not content with hens' eggs, travels far and wide to snatch the eggs of countless rare and exotic birds. He prys off a mountain top to get at one bird, and cuts down  an enormous tree (old-growth dimensions) to get at another. And he collects  literally thousands of eggs,  just to cook up for himself and perhaps his family. This story may have been funny when it was written almost 50 years ago, but today it  describes  little more than environmental destruction and selfish waste.  This is definitely not the message I want to give my son, and I am sending back this book
