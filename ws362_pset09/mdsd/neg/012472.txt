i guess anyone can get published these days, even jackbooted morons like randall. hey the biggest perpetrators of racism in today's america are racist bigoted blacks like yourself randall. check yourself fool. love and peace is oh so neat, but randall's book smells like stinky ole feet.
if you have any semblance of a brain and can think rationally, avoid this clown trying to leech off the black community with sucker-punch books like this one
