I enjoy most of Card's work for their thoughtfulness and characters.  Neither come through here and I cannot recommend this book for Card's readers only for fans of action.

The book is a quick read and unsatisfying in the end.  After all, a story is supposed to have a problem and a solution.  Card seems to have gone for the literary anti-solution ("Wait and see" his characters say to each other) but with nothing else to attract readers of literature rather than stories.

The heroes go after one straw villain after another discovering again and again that they have not found the true villain.  It is strongly hinted that a certain character has encouraged all the mayhem either for his own benefit or possibly in order to shake up the status quo and get rid of the extremists of both sides, but although the characters will obviously figure out which is true it doesn't seem to occur to them that the end doesn't justify the means either the evil goal or the 'good' one.

The book seemed like an inflated pastry which collapsed when the heat leaked out and upon further examintion was full of noxioius ingredients.
