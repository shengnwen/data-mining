While better than her last 2 books--more rooted in objectivity, perception--here too Graham is so mannered that she cariacatures herself relentlessly; she is, at this stage in her labored career, pure cartoon. One is reminded of Gardner's Faults of the Soul, &amp; cannot help wonder if these poems are the ultimate Frankenstein wrought by the factory poetry system of the MFA: a poetry of preciousness, of hyper-articulated stylistic/typographical *ticks* employed in the hopes of masking a shortfall of intellectual courage &amp; spiritual discovery. If looking to have the top of your head taken off, turn to Hillman or Carson, Brock-Broido or Bidart. The most radical thing Graham could do at this point in her life's arc would be to embrace a decade or so of silence, to not publish every self-reflexive utterance. The other worthy task, one senses,would be to abandon all the stylistic bric-a-brac &amp; hiccuping in favor of language itself, to *dare* to be direct, centered in image, lyric in intent
