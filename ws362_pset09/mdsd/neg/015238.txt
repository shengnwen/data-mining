I was not impressed with this book although I'm a big fan of Focus on the Family and Dr. Dobson. I just felt this book didn't deliver much at all. I think Boundaries with Teens would be a much better choice. I actually have the book on CD. I listen while waiting to pick kids up from school.  It offers a lot of great advice and suggestions on life with teens.
