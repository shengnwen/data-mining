I have recently read this book, and I have to say that I'm less than impressed with it. When I started it, I was pleased and relieved that it was so easy to read and entertaining, but after a couple of chapters of Eagleton's witticisms and biting humor, I found myself waiting for the "theory" to kick in...and it took him until the last three chapters. The book seems to be primarily a rant directed against capitalism (i.e.-the United States, though he does make a tiny disclaimer about this in the postscript), and while it's not surprising coming from an alleged Marxist, it does eventually begin to wear on the reader--at least on this reader. He has good points, but After Theory really feels more like a soapbox for a fist-shaking rant than a discussion of the decades that have comes after literary theory's "golden age" of 1965-1980. I was really hoping for more out of this book
