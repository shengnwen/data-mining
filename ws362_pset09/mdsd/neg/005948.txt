This short book, written from a Protestant fundamentalist view, reads like a collection  of a few sermons, (certainly not academic!). The authors have a few good insights. For example, that the ecological crisis does not come from Christianity, but from modernity, but then, while praising medieval, traditional Christianity, they don't seem to see that this is contrary to Protestantism. Furthermore most the book rests on special pleading (not even solidly grounded, but using a citation here or there from other fellow protestants), some citations from the Biblical writings or some historical misunderstanding.
