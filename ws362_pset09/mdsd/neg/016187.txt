Well, I guess it's been a while since I've been a college student. I'm a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now. I guess all college texts have ridiculous prices. This book used to be the best reference I've ever seen on basic electronics for non-EE's, and even for non-engineers. It's not much of a cookbook - instead, it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you're designing or adapting. The second ed. is getting long in the tooth, and since the book is used as a college text, it's preposterously overpriced. The one terrible thing about the book is that there are no answers to the (otherwise excellent) exercises, and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you're not sure about. It will be interesting to see what the 3rd ed. looks like. Maybe I'll start a web site and publish the answers online
