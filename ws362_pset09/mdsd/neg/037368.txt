**Disclaimer**  My review is of the abridged audio version.

Most of the time I can find something redeeming about a book.  But there are exceptions . . .

This book really re-defined "bad" in a whole new way.  Histrionic women that give us girls a bad name, completely unbelieveable actions by the characters, phony affairs, odd revenge motives . . . the list is unending.

And let's not forget the dead bat on the bed as an aphrodisiac?????

Suspense is great, but it needs to be based on some plane of reality.  (Anyone believe that the Senator wouldn't have requested at least one photo of the supposed "affair" before buying the whole thing, hook, line and sinker?)

Romance is great, but it needs to be believable between the characters. (Barbara and the villain?  Even the lead couple - what is the basis?)

Women are emotional (hey, we could even be described as mercurial at times), but most of the time we need some provocation before going stark raving crazy and falling into the arms of the nearest available good-or-evil stud muffin.  (Apparently none of the women in this book ever matured past Madison, the 15 year old.)

So, fellow readers . . . pretend this book is a waterfall, pretend it's a psychotic good-guy-gone-bad, pretend it's a dead bat on your bed . . . STAY AWAY
