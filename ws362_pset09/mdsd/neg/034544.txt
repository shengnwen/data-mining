In 5th grade my reading group was assigned this book. We all hated it because Gilly was an obnoxious, snotty brat. We spent most of our work time drawing comics in which she crawled out of the school toilets and attacked us, and we had to fight back and defeat the evil Gilly. So if you want your kids to waste time, buy this book; if you actually want them to read something meaningful and enjoyable, look elsewhere.

However, I do have to say that we weren't at all shocked or corrupted by the language. Kids learn that stuff anyway
