At the risk of sounding egotistical, I consider myself a fairly intelligent person, which is why I am loathe to admit that I didn't understand the ending!!! Who was this person in Cuba? It didn't sound like it was Craig Bowman using a dead person's name, because of some physical characteristics that couldn't be faked. If anybody has an idea what the ending meant. 

But let's forget the incomprehensible ending for a moment. This book has more potholes than the Sea of Holes in Yellow Submarine. Among them:  
What was the killer's motive? Who sent the thugs to scare the girls? NONE of this is ever explained!!!

I have always been an avid reader of Robin Cook's books, but this one is a huge disappointment. Maybe this was accidentally sent to the publisher before it was finished!
