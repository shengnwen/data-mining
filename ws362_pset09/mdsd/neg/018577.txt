Schwartz is a new-ager who believs in ghosts, psychics, and talking to the dead, and he says these things can be proven scientifically. Why must people who believe in goofball ideas try to legitimize them by using scientific terms? They must believe no reasonable person would believe them otherwise, and they are right.  Unfortunately, the "scientific evidence" Schwartz presents would not impress a six-year-old. In his big "experiment" he got a guy named Chris who said he was psychic to write down some items he said he dreamed, such as a pile of tires and a bunch of umbrellas. Then they walked around town until they saw some tires and umbrellas. Wow, that's impressive. Schwartz was so impressed he says "I literally could not breathe" (page 20). I assume he dropped dead, but no, he went on another walk with Chris, who said he dreamed of seeing some trees and grass. You'll never guess what happened. They walked around until they saw some trees and grass. This guy Chris is amazing. Schwartz? Not so much. Later he takes pains to say he is not a numerologist, and then describes his obsession with the number 11 and how he sees it everywhere he looks for it. As Schwarts often says, give me a break! He claims to have been a professor at Harvard and Yale and says he is a university teacher. Surely this cannot be true; at the least, it does not reflect well on Harvard and Yale. If any university is currently paying him a salary for indoctrinating young minds with his new age speculations, someone should tell them about this book.
