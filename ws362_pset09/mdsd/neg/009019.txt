This book was quite disappointing.  The writing is fair, but very dry. The text is filled with VERY well known stories, and I learned almost nothing I didn't know from other books I have read.  Do yourself a favor and skip this book. Instead read Chernow's masterpiece "Alexander Hamilton," and find a good book on Madison - you will learn so much more that way
