Lots of style, no substance. Read Ed Abbey, Barry Lopez, or Terry Tempest Williams, and a walk in the woods (or the desert, or the arctic) tells you the names of the flowers they saw, the colors, the smells. Cahill just sees flowers on a walk up Mount Washburn; he doesn't know their names, let alone their colors or the way they smell. It would be  easy to write a full-length book about Yellowstone Park's Lamar Valley; Cahill knows so little he sums it up it three (3) pages. Cahill's writing is a mile wide, and a 1/4 inch deep.
