This book was sooooooo boring.  I kept reading it only in the misguided hope that it would get more interesting.  It has an unlikeable and annoying main character.  The writing style is overly simple, and literally NOTHING happens.  The reason that she and her mother "fall out" is never explained.  Don't waste your time.
