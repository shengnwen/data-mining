I obviously did not conducting enough research before buying this book.  I am seventeen and this was an easy read, but I was hoping for and expecting a philosophical examination of our speedy lives.  Instead I was bombarded by semi-interesting, useless facts about how our world has been struck by "hurry-sickness" and how everything has been accelerated (a fairly obvious fact).

If you are consious enough of our world to buy this book (because of its title) for yourself, it will not raise you conciousness with any deep philosophical questions or with any solutions.  The only people who will benefit from this book are the ones who will never buy it for themselves.  Therefore I believe this book is basically useless and slightly boring
