If you want to know more about the powers within and you've never explored this part of yourself before, then this just might be the book for you. If however, you've delved into this area before, you'll find it wishy washy and wished that the author would just get to the point! With that in mind, I found it rather boring. I'm not one for books that tell me all about the authors life stories and I certainly didn't learn anything new. Definitely a book for people who are looking for a starting point in this subject
