The book has beautiful pictures, but that is it.  The book was written for someone living in the UK, so if you do, you might like this book.  The descriptions of each of the rides and attractions were vague and basically  useless.  If you want an excellent book on Orlando, spend you money on the  Unoffical Guide or the Econoguide books.  Those are worth their weight in  gold
