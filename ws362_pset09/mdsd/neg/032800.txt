This book is too big an attempt by the famed Harvard biology professor to try to cover "everything". If we compare Mr. Wilson's "total map" with Mr. Ken Wilber's attempt on the same kind of synthesis. It will become obvious that Mr. Wilson fell short because he puts an "Environmental Policy" category where a "Spirits/Psychology" one is more appropriate. How can any integration attempt misses such important inner subjects?! I guess Mr. Wilson decided that he will stick to his iconoclastic scientism view rather than being open-minded. We, as readers, should be aware of his bias. There was a Newsweek bookreview article titled: "Why Wilson is Wrong" published in 1999.
