This book was heartbreaking for me to read.  I understood the dilemna Jon was going through with an aggressive dog, but I kept wondering why he could not have chosen to keep Orson in an enclosure, and take him for walks and/or the ORV rides Orson enjoyed in the mornings when no one was around.  He does seem to have taken the easy way out.

It comes down to this for me - Even though Jon thought that keeping Orson in an enclosure would be like a prison, don't you think Orson would have preferred that over death?

Aggressive dogs are tough.  I have one.  He has never bitten anybody, but he hardly has a chance.  I keep him behind a fence, and when we go on walks he is always on a leash, with two lines attached to his collar.

Even though he is a problem dog, we have a very happy, active, life together.  We both are happiest when we are out in nature together
