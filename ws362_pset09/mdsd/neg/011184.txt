Mr. Shore's book couldn't possibly be more pretensious, or more out of touch with the fundamental changes that are taking place in the world of photography.  His writing is wordy, his perspective self-promotional, and  his ideas are trapped in the critical perspective of a mid 1970's college  professor.  If you're interested in a book that explores photography in the  pre-digital era, you'd be better off spending your money on John Berger's  &quot;Ways of Seeing&quot;, or Sontag's &quot;On Photography&quot;
