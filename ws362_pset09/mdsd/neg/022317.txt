I wanted a more clever and biting title for this review but not sure I would get away with it. This "writer" has written books by three of my favorite musicians-Townshend, Rod Stewart and Paul McCartney. Unfortuntely, I have read all three. His prose is nothing to get excited about, his books contains errors that any casual fan could point out, and he is just rather slimy in his selection on what to cover. If he ever get to Springsteen, I will know not to bother. You would be wise to avoid anything with this man's name on the cover.
