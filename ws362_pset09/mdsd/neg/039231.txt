I was interested in many of the details - conversations and public appearances that garnered little fanfare "in the day".  I was looking for a less sycophantic and more honest account.  According to the dewey-eyed Kane, John really wanted to be a great father, but...   He really loved Julian, but...  He really wanted to do right by Cynthia but...  There is no but, according to Kane.  John was just Wonderful John, with a license to hurt, ignore, brutalize and abandon his original family (and others) because he's, well, Wonderful John.  It reminds me (with some irony) of John's own lyrics to "Bungalo Bill", where the children ask if it's wrong to kill, to which his mom (or Kane) answers "Not when he looks so dear".  This book reads more like it was written by an adoring groupie than an experienced, balanced journalist. 
I loved John's music, his humor, his genuis.  I can take the truth though.  I don't need to beatify him.  He had some rather serious flaws, and they shoud be acknowledged honestly, or it shoud be stated in the foreward that "this book is by an ardent admirerer who wants to paint a picture with no rough edges".  I can't help but think that John would verbally tear Kane a new one if he read this harmless, suck-up account.
Get the other half by reading Cynthia's book.  Don't miss the forward by Julian
