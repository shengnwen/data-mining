Hello, I wanted to say that I read this book after I read The Signs, by Canyon Adams.  I have to tell you all that Canyon Adams did a much better job at detailing the identity of Israel and helping the reader understand how it has become the United States and Europe.  If you have money to burn, buy this book.  If  you have money enough for only one book on this topic, buy that book by Canyon Adams because it says more and will actually help you see the whole picture onca and for all
