Yes, I know I will get bashed for this rather harsh review but somebody has to get serious.  The title is inaccurate since it did not include "and what the Bible predicts". Although I feel that oil is simply an afterthought of the Tehran regimes and that a nuclear weapon is the real priority, they are all connected.  Throw in radical Islam and you have a potentially heady brew. 

But adding Bibical "prophecy" that was not written as prophecy or is taken out of context or is misinterpreted or refers to events back then is opening yourself up to well-deserved criticism. There will always be those who find mysterious messages from the past that just happen to pertain to the present.  Let's get something straight - for prophecy to be valid it MUST pertain to the people for whome it was written, i.e. Israelite tribes. When the Gospel writers have Jesus predicting the destruction of the Temple (written right after its destruction) it was meant to refer to that event - not something 2,000 years in the future. 

Think about it - how probable is it that someone living 2,500 years ago predicted the end of the world and second coming of the Messiah when they had not even predicted the first coming??? For sure, the author does not make specific predictions with dates which is a good practice since every end of world date so far has come and gone and we are all still here. He does try a rather fuzzy comparison of names - matching an ancient place with a modern country when the similarity is far-fetched at best. 

Lastly, if the author is correct, why do anything? Why not just sit and wait for the final battle, let God intervent then cheer? If this is true prophecy we can't change it and there's the rub - we all know it does not refer to Iran in 2006.  That's why we are working so hard to change events, to alter the course of history -because we DON'T take things like this seriously.  If we did it would be sacriligious to try and work against prophecy wouldn't it?
