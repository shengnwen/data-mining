I got this book used for well under the retail price. Now I feel guilty after reading all those glowing reviews. I don't deserve this book! What can I say? I don't like it. Mainly it's that I don't find the projects very inspiring. My use of embroidery tends toward embellishing clothing and linens. This book is for someone who wants to paint a picture with embroidery, or do a whole pillow or footstool. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just not what I had in mind. I like a book more like Mary Thomas's, where you get inspired to use the designs for your own purposes
