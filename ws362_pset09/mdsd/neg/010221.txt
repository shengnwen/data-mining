This book is a "horrid example".

The author and Martina Navratilova were, for a time, a very public couple. Then they broke up. And Brown made the fatal error of writing a roman-à-clef. This is always a mistake. Getting revenge on your ex is death on good writing. It's a shame, because Brown is ordinarily an excellent writer.
