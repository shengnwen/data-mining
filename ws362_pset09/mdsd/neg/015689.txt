It's a pretty terrible book overall. It's more like "Dick and Jane Go Downtown." There is plenty of information here concerning the band but Bowman's arrested development writing style makes the sledding rather tough, and at other times, outright laughable. One example is the purported "mystery" concerning how many times Byrne sings 'fa fa fa fa fa fa' in Psycho Killer's recorded performances, live performances, and the six fa-fa-fas documented on the liner notes for Talking Heads '77. As Bowman writes, "The mystery may never be solved". So gobsmacked was I to learn this that I nearly spilled me Jameson's down me loonpants! It also doesn't appear that Bowman actually spoke to any band members for this book. Further, he wears his own literary inclinations on his sleeve: if I read one more likening of Tom Verlaine or Patti Smith to Beaudelaire or Rimbaud I'm going to puke. It's just a not very good book - it reads more like undergraduate hero worship than objective critique. The photographs included in the book are laughable in their triviality. Only the captions are worse. Save your money, this is a real dud
