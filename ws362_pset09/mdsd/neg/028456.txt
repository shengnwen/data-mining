&quot;Cold Shoulder&quot;, the first novel in this series, was successful largely because of its rich characterizations.  In this sequel, the characters have already been developed and not much happens to them, outside the relatively pedestrian mystery plot.  Lorraine Page has another  brush with the bottle, but this turns out to be nothing more than a red  herring designed to artifically add to the suspense.  The book also suffers  from a weak false ending.  Readable and generally enjoyable, but hardly up  to the standard of the original
