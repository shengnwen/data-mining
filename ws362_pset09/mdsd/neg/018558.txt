I really wonder how many births the author will need to wash off the sin of writing this book. Ramakrishna will surely forgive him as he was Lord himself. But what about the wrath of so many devotees.
Dont even attempt to look at this book. Its blasphemy. As somebody said rightly that the author is like a vulture soaring high, but is looking at filth (also one of Ramakrishna's saying).
