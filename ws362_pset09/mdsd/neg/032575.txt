If, indeed, the true definition of porn is no plot and copious sex, then this book is pure porn.  It sucked (you should excuse the pun). It seems even the editors had their fill (you should excuse yet another pun):  by the end novella there were mistakes galore (to instead of too, stature rather than statue, heroine initially introduced as brunette but four chapters later is described as a willowy blonde).  I wouldn't blame an editor for walking away from this garbage.  

Trashy mouthed (wo)men and/or rape in captivity (or under any other circumstances) are not entertaining.  I can't help but wonder what kind of money she made from this waste of time/effort/publishing.  It would be nice it she would donate it to a women's shelter.  I shudder to think this women and her husband also write children's books.
