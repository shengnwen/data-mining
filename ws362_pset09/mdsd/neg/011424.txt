DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. this book promotes eating disorders, plain and simple. i'm a dancer, and i have always been thin, but the &quot;suggestions&quot; this book gives are absurd. dancers are very conscious of their bodies, compare themselves to other dancers and hold themselves up to high standards. this book pretty much says that a dancer who is 5'3&quot; should be 94 pounds. this is so messed up. the book suggests a diet of 1200 calories a day. look at the titles: &quot;why a dancer should diet: you can't hide anything in tights&quot; and &quot;the chain around the refrigerator.&quot; it shows a dancer ready to &quot;feast&quot; on garden products. besides that, this book was written in 1984.
