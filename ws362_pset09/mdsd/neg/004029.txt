Alright, seriously, this book is to leadership what Who Moved My Cheese is to Civil War History.  

Luckily, I've followed Coach K's career for some time and have gleaned many an important lesson from him, something not found in this book.

Lessons like: When the chips are down, act like you have an injury and cannot perform your duties and then feign responsibility for anything as a way to keep your fragile, insecure ego from showing cracks.  

This worked really well with my last marriage.  My wife found me with another woman and I instantly thought "What Would Coach K Do?" so I faked like I tore my ACL and that the woman I was with was an on-call physical therapist.  Needless to say, I snowed my wife and continue to see my "physical therapist" - all thanks to Coach K.

But, you won't learn that in this book.  You'll learn other things that translate from the hardcourt to the boardroom.  You'll learn that the best way to fire up your team in a meeting is to slap the floor like crazy.  I tried that and was fired immediately.  This book stinks
