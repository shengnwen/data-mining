This book went beyond erotic. It was sick! After reading the other books, I wanted to finish it up with Stephan's story. He did not seem to feel so guilty in The Hunger.  However, in this book, he seemed weak. Susan Squires has some sick fantasies. I do not consider rape erotic in the least.  Raping someone does not make them a warrior. Our heroine Ann Van Helsing is psychic. Just one touch with Stephan and she sees his past.  She sees the Daughters committing horrible sexual acts. She sees his love for Beatrix. She sees the cruelty of Asharti. Ann even realizes that he is a vampire. What is really lame is that she accepts it as someone just told her that they had a cold.  Ann for being so alone and isolated seemed up on her sexual techniques and even sociable. How does she know so much about the town since she does not mingle with the people? I really thought this book was dumb. It needed more character development and oh yeah, a plot!
