This book does have some cultural/sociological worth, but if you buy it new, you've got gross emotional problems.  Buy it used--as long as you can find a dependable seller, and it looks like there's a good one already up here, you'll be much happier for it.  Trust me on this one--save the few dollars and the years of therapy
