A formulaic thriller that includes everything but the kitchen sink - unrepentant Nazis, Basque separatists, an outcast murderous tribe of Eskimos, Canadian natives in northern Quebec, environmental activists and the usual female sex interest. This one goes beyond the pale and actually seems comedic at best. The heroes can thank their lucky stars that the dastardly villains resort to that time-worn cliche of gloating instead of getting on with killing them when they've got the chance!

This one's definitely a laffer! Give it a pass and save your pennies for the next one.
