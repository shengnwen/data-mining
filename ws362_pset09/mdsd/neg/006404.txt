This book was obviously written at a time when most Conures were imported from the wild and not captive bred or handfed.  A large portion of this book deals with how to acclimate and taim a wild or unfriendly bird.  Furthermore this book is not a good companion for the Conure owner looking to find information on a particular species.  Many of the species covered in this book are not even avalible as pets or to be imported into the U.S.  When I finally came to the section on the bird I was interested in purchasing all I found were the physical characteristics with nothing about its general temperment as a pet.  This was hardly helpful as I knew exactly what the bird looked like but little else.  Another topic of no use to me was the detailed information on the breeding of Conures.  I am looking for a better source of information and would not reccommend this book to the average pet owner
