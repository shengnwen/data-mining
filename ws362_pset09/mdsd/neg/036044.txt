I give the spanish version a 5 star rating but this english version a 1 star.

At least she gave us some warning in the preface and introduction but personally; when John writes "El diablo" I see no reason to impose your own beliefs into a translation and make "The devil" = "the fragmented self".  

I feel I might re-translate all of "Les Miserables" and make it say what I think it should say in english! How about that!

Translate, let us think for ourselves
