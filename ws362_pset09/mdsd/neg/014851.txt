I used to respect Mr. Butler's work. I was a big fan of "Good Scent" and especially of "They Whisper." But this is yet another superficial, lightweight offering. It makes me sad to see a once-great author sinking to such depths. Anyone interested should go back and read the old works. They had some real magic to them. The last few books are all just dead weight, a finished author plowing ahead simply because he's expected to. I wish I could say something more nuanced and objective. But this is just a depressing last straw. I am finished with Mr. Butler from here on in.
