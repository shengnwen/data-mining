There are instances where the translator includes things which Ibn Ishaq had not written about, and he does not, as mentioned earlier by someone, clearly demaricate this.  For example, the entire section about the Satanic verses is no where to be found in the original Arabic work, yet it somehow is in the English "translation".  There are other such descrepancies, so the reader should know that some of what he/she might be seeing is external to what Ibn Ishaq wrote
