This is a reprint of a story from a former era when it was not only apparently acceptible, but actually romantic for a man to become obsessed with a woman he doesn't know, repeatedly watch her from a distance without her knowledge, and then lie to her about knowing who she is when circumstance causes them to meet (he's watching her again when she is finally made aware of his presence). I found this to be far more creepy than romantic. It's interesting that this title was determined worthy of reprint at this time. It's worth reading only by someone interested in the idea that this could have been considered the beginning of a healthy relationship a generation ago.
