I don't know how many of the people that will be reading this review have ever bought a book from ESRI.  Let it be said that their books are usually for the beginning and lower-intermediate class of GIS users.  I purchased this book before it was even published in the hopes that it would break that norm and offer something like the description states.  From everything that their marketing wizards say about the book, one would expect a quality map design product that would really highlite layout, composition, etc. Wrong.

Advanced users, or anyone who even thinks they have the slightest notion on map design, do not buy this book!  Chances are if you think to yourself, "I make pretty decent maps", then you will gain nothing from this book.  This book should only be purchased by beginning users or people who have been told that their maps look like absolute crap.  If you make north arrows that take up 1/4 of your map, you need this book.  If you are a little wary about your ability to choose color, do not buy this book.  Instead, focus on buying books in the Art section that will help you improve your color understanding and picking abilities.

There is very little information of use in here for advanced users, that is why I am rating this so low.  This is an acceptable book for beginners, though not the best I have seen.  Again, my gripe with ESRI is that they pull together just enough vague information to publish a book on a subject without really telling you anything that you couldn't figure out on your own
