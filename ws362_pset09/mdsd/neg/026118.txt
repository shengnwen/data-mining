This book made me feel dirty as a womyn. I found it insensitive, uninspired, and inaccurate. Anyone who wants true scholarship should look elsewhere for truth. There were, of course, many Goddesses in herstory,  however to deny them their individual importance with a pseudo-intellectual  monotheistic interpretation makes us no better than the men we must  educate. It is time for synchronism, not separatism
