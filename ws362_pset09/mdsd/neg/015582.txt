What a disappointment!  A book on this topic desperately needs to be written, but after reading Who Cares About the Rules, I'm still waiting, because unfortunately this book isn't it.  All Dickerson does is suggest yet another set of rules as a means of dealing with all the dilemmas her book claims to address, and then she does nothing but re-state these same 4 rules over and over again, without variation or development, in every single chapter.  If you feel that reading the same 4 sentences endlessly repeated over the course of 200 pages (or until you die of boredom, whichever comes first) will help you deal with issues as complex as men, careers, finances, friends, family, eating disorders, and independence, then go ahead and buy this book.  Otherwise, save your money and read those 4 sentences here, because they're all this author has to say on any subject: 1) Recognize and name the problem.  2) Understand and challenge the expectation.  3) Connect to what you value and believe.  4) Seek allies against self-doubt.  Feeling empowered yet?  Me neither
