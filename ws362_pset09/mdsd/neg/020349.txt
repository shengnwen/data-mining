 . . . and more nonsense.

Like I've stated in previous reviews, the only reason I read any of this c**p is because as a professional Christian educator and theologian, questions about stuff like this come up far more often than I would like -- and I've gotta have my ammo ready.

Here we go again:  Dispensational pre-millinalism, which is the theology presented in the book as "authentic" Christianity, was invented out of whole cloth in the mid 19th century.  This is not the faith of the Apostles.  This is not the faith of the Early Church (East or West).  This is not the faith of the Reformers.  Luther and Calvin would have rejected this.  This is not the faith of the Great Awakening.  Wesley and Whitfield would have rejected this.  Even in Protestantism, this represents a minority "out there" viewpoint.

A non-Christian who picks up one of these books and believes that it represents mainstream Christianity will be grossly deceived.

This is not honest theology; this is not honest biblical interpretation; and the writing is horrible to boot
