As a long time Lowell fan I had looked forward to a new release and not just a remake of an old book, but this book was not worth the wait.

I found the characters shallow making it hard to relate or connect them within the plot. As for the plot, it wandered so I had a hard time remembering which side of the border the characters were on! I kept on reading hoping to see a glimpse of the Lowell found in the Donovan, Risk or Rarites series but that just didn't happen.

Was this just another case of an author "cranking out" books to make the publishers bottom line regardless of whether the book is worth the paper it is printed on.
