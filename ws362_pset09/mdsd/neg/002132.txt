This book was required for the DE classes at UTexas for a first/second year student, encountering DE's for the first time.  The book is very comprehensive in teaching all aspects of DE's.  However, the book is very dry and difficult to get through.  The worst thing is that is impossible to get through this book without some supplemental material.  For examples, the book uses proofs instead of examples that can be applied to the homework several times.  In addition the examples on countless occassions are like it can be shown through some simple calculations(which they won't show you)(it skips steps) that you can get to some other formula and you're like how did they do that?  In addition the notation/symbols they use are not defined all the time, and this leads to extra confusion when trying to learn something new.  Overall the examples are vague
