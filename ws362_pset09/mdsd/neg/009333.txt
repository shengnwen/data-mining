A man who has not lived a life cannot tell a real story.  Tarentino's films are universally and fundamentally boring for anyone who has ever lived a real life and not just fantasized about having one.  His dipictions of violence eminate from his own personal lack of sexual energy.  Sadly, teenage males without girlfriends seem to like these slammed together video games that are being called brilliant, and continue to support the trash factory that generates this type of hyper garbage.  It's especially sad when a true film afficienado understands the brilliance of all of the original pictures which he doggedly ripped off and claimed the scenes for his own.  If one more person calls this sad, pathetic, lack of a man a genious, I will become even more sick of him.  Please get a life and buy a real movie
