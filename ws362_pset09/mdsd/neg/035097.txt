The most boring, rambling book I've ever read.  Was Wray being paid by the word?  If you have problems falling to sleep, this is the remedy. I have issues with buying a book and not completing it, both as a courtesy to the author and as a return on my investment.  This book is the exception. I managed to make it through 150+ pages of a 300+ page novel and dozed off so many times that my chin bruised my chest.  This is easily the best sleep aid on my bookshelf
