As a prosecutor, I was very interested in reading this book.  I had seen an interview with the author and read several customer reviews.  I am disappointed.  I understand that the author apparently lived a fairly priveleged life prior to working as an Assistant D.A., and says as much early in the book.  I would assume, however, that her $100,000 education would have helped develop a more grammatically correct writing style.  The errors in grammar and spelling were distracting at times and made for a less than smooth read.  Additionally, though I do not prosecute in the Bronx, and am sure there is a steep learning curve, five years as an Assistant D.A. hardly creates an expertise in any area.  The "cop speak" throughout the book, and the drama with which the stories are told suggest a motive more in line with personal promotion than delivery of insight.  This may explain the numerous T.V. appearances, etc.  The author may be a good lawyer and may have been a good Assistant D.A., but the book does not convey that.  Finally, the stories told are important ones to tell, and all should have some exposure to what man is willing to do to one another, especially the most vulnerable.  I just wish the book's focus was more on them and less on the author's gallant fight for those unable to fight for themselves, at least for five years.
