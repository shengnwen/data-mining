The book covers a lot of areas, but does not provide sufficient guidance for application. After completing the projects, I was disappointed with my efforts and thought I needed more practice until I picked up &quot;How to Draw Heads and Portraits&quot; by Jose M Parramon. I discovered a lot of details were not covered in this book that would have made the difference in my drawings.
 
 If you already owned this book, you need additional. If you don't, pick up something else
