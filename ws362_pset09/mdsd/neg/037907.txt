Save your money and buy Netzer's Encyclopedia of Food Values:  this book appears to be merely an extract from the larger work. You will receive four or five times as much information, although you still won't have dietary fiber information. 	The problem with Netzer's Carbohydrate  Counter is that it neglects to break the carbohydrate gram count into its  nutritional carbohydrate and dietary fiber carbohydrate components. That  makes this book useless for those people whose nutritional needs require  that information. 	This book simply gives total carbohydrate counts and  says &quot;Th-th-th-that's all, folks.&quot
