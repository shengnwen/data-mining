I read this book after coming across it on a "most important books ever" list. I found it very hard to get through. Approximately half-way through the book I found myself counting down the pages until I finished it. This is not a book to read if you're looking to be entertained, however if you're looking for a good bit of culture/history I would think this would be a decent pick. Some of the passages involving the main character and his love interest are very well written and beautiful to read. In fact, I re-read some of the passages again just for the majestic quality of the author's writing. As a college junior with little knowledge of or interest in African culture I did not enjoy reading this book, however I may try again in the future to see if I can get more out of what others have deemed a very important and worthy novel
