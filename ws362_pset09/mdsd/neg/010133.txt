Who talks like this except on daytime television? I'm not sure where Anita Shreve learned to write dialogue and I can't fathom how she's qualified to teach writing. The book rings false from start to finish which made it impossible to care for any of the characters. Jack's double life is preposterous--the only thing more ridiculous is that his wife didn't have a clue! I recommend avoiding this book
