First you get to marry a doctor, then you get bored and become a Bohemian, find some drawbacks there and so finally you get to marry somebody that understands and appreciates you.  You get to take care of and understand animals as a veterinarian.  But your life still seems to miss some spark and so a murder mystery is thrown into the mix.  All of your friends are affiliated with Harvard, Berkeley, or some other high prestige place--no Illinois State or blue color workers for you.  This was a truly awful book written for dreamy status-seekers with no empathy or understanding of the real world
