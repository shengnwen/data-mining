this book has a title that appeals to the heart of every parent, particularly new one and this is the only reason it gets sold. There is no valuable information in that book other that what is compiled from other books by prominent pediatricians. If you want to help your baby sleep, read Dr. Wisebluth book "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child"
