If you are interested in carefully plotted, intelligent thrillers, this book is NOT for you.  James Patterson tests the limits of the reader's suspension of disbelief with his blatant tactics of manipulation.  It is too impossible to believe that a niece, a fiancee, a partner and a new lover can all become targets of one "mastermind" killer after another.  To have the killers turn out to be people that Alex Cross knows time and time again is laughable.  His sentences are no longer than 10 words and his chapters no more than 3 pages, leaving no room for character development.  I couldn't get past the first half of the book before giving up in disgust.  Take my advice, check out Michael Connelly or Karin Slaughter
