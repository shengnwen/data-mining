if you are looking for an irish name spelled in gaelic, this is your book.  if you are hard-up for a romanian name for your little one, this is your book.  if you are looking for a "normal," pronouceable name, you'd do better looking elsewhere.  

yes, this book has a billion names in it, but well over half are utterly unusable--seriously.  either you cannot pronounce them (see above referenced gaelic names) or they are just plain off the charts weird.

we have this book and while i flipped through it a few times, mostly we made fun of the names in it.
