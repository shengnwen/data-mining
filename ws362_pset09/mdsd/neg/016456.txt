I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it.  Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it
