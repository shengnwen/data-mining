I tried to force myself to the end of this book, but I couldn't. I enjoy mysteries, but there is no mystery here. I figured out what was going on in the first half of the book, and the prose was so bad that there was no reason to finish. Cornwell could use a class in creative writing or a good editor. Her style is amaturish and grating. Her over use of adverbs, tinny dialogue, and sloppy construction were annoying to read. If a character was about to disclose something important, Cornwell made sure you knew by telling you how important what they were saying was in the dialogue tag--like the reader is an idiot. I am amazed anything this bad made it into print
