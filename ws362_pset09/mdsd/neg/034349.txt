While I greatly enjoyed DeMarco's non-fiction books "Peopleware" and "Slack", I felt this attempt at a novel was weak.

*** spoiler warning ***

Tompkins, the main character, has supposedly been chosen for his role in this novel because he is an gifted, experienced manager. Yet pretty much every chapter is a lesson he learns by screwing up.  Perhaps I would have found it more palatable if the character was a newly-promoted manager, who knew he was ignorant.

In the end, comes the revelation that, in spite of all the mistakes, he is an excellent manager because he *cares* about people.  I don't see how this shows.  Among the management problems he faces is reporting to a difficult supervisor up the chain, and the solution to this problem is essentially to have the man poisoned and sent to the hospital! Can you say cognitive dissonance?
