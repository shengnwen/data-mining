I am a huge fan of reincarnation books (eg the amazing Journey of Souls and the beautiful Northumberland Dreaming) and have done a little past life regression via hypnosis myself. but this along with the other books in the series i bought, are not impressive at all. atlantis, creation, his thoughs on the future - sorry, its just junk
