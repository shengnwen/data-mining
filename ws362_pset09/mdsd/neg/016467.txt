Although what a book says is perhaps the most pressing sphere in which to evaluate it, the way those words are presented can sometimes, sadly, eclipse the content.

This is one of those unfortunate books, cast asunder before it was even fully born. The crime: body text in sans-serif! And not only that, but on glossy pages. I could almost handle the typeface, but it does, truly, give me a headache. Add in the somewhat patchy editing and it makes for a lot of frustration.

A fascinating book with fascinating content. If only I could read it for more than a few minutes at a time. If, like me, you are one of those who refuses to purchase books printed in horrible, difficult-to-read fonts: this is one of them
