I agree with most of the reviewers above who think this book is hogwash. As someone else noted, the book starts out strong but there is no payoff at the end. 

As someone with Borderline Personality Disorder and a few other mental illnesses AND a Christian, I think this book is irresponsible. Peck says he thought "Jersey" might be a touch schizophrenic. A touch? You're either schizophrenic or your not. There is no in between. Someone might have psychotic tendencies; also, some who are bipolar can appear schizo but you think a psychiatrist like Peck would already know that. 

In my opinion I don't think possession is real because I don't believe demons can cross over into this plane because if they could we'd all be possessed. Especially the extremely wicked. People have minds of their own and that's where the devil comes into play..in your MIND, not your body.
