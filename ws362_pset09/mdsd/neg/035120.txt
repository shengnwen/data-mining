I didn't even finish the book.  By the end of the first chapter I was disgusted by the completely one-sided portrayal of women, particularly minority women, as abject victims of white men.  I agree that this book has its roots in truth, but I think that a more evenly assessed account could certainly have been written.

I didn't like the attitude of the author.  She seems to think that black women were the only ones who suffered.  What about black males?  Or white women?  Or Native Americans?  Just because I didn't see them in the first chapter doesn't mean they aren't discussed at all, but it didn't set the right tone for me
