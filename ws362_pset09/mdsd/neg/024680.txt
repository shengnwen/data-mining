This book is terrible. It trades on the good name of Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice, then completely ignores the P&P story.  There's nothing in the book that convinces me that Ms. Aston ever read Pride and Prejudice. I think she has only read a cliff notes version of the story. Here's my criticisms in a nutshell:  First - Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are not in the book. Second - Col. Fitzwilliam is an old, lecherous scold. Third - The P&P characters that are in the book are totally unrecognizable, except for their names. Fourth - I didn't believe for one minute that Mr. Darcy's daughters were the product of Mr. Darcy or Elizabeth. Fifth - It was boring
