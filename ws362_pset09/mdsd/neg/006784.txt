Some of the chapters in &quot;1968&quot; were slow, tedious, and boring--especially if they were edited in the 1980s or 1990s, long after the year passed. The chapters on Germany and France were difficult to say the least and somehow it appears that the editors were not first-hand witnesses to these events. They stop short of describing accurate details and in some cases are too wordy and don't connect well with the reader--possibly for the sake of political correctness. If you are expecting a gripping, fascinating account of 1968, a year that changed the world forever, you will be disappointed. Beware of editors that don't know how to write historical facts without losing their audience
