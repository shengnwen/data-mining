I do not think this is a very good book for a book report on Rosa Parks.  Despite the fact the title is "Rosa Parks", I received more information on other things that were happening at the time and about other people than you did about Rosa Parks.  However, this is a good book if you are doing a report or want to learn about African American History in the late 1800s and 1900s
