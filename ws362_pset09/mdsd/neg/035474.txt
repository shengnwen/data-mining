I was looking for a time-travel book & I love dino movies, but this book, my first read by Sawyer, was worse than disappointing. It was like reading an old '50's short story when flying saucers, Martian slime, and the idea that dino's are cold-blooded was popular. Well, those days are over.

For $15, save your money for something that can draw you into a story that is halfway believable.

Btw, it's more about the relationship between 2 guy-buddies than dinos, and that relationship wasn't much to speak of either.

A totally unbelievable story that I forced myself to finish since I paid so much for the over-sized thing.
