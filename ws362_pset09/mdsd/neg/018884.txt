I was forced to read this in high school and it was awful.  The characters behave idiotically as if they have no common sense.  Liberals including my literature teacher love this book because of of the pro-communist and "blame the white man" views.  I'm not white, and I still found it impossible to relate to Bigger.  Young adults would enjoy books more if they weren't forced to read bad novels like this
