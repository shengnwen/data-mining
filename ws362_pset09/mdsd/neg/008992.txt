Blessed are the peacemakers
Love thy enemies
The meek will inherit the earth.
It will be easier for a camel to walk thorough the eye of a needle than a rich man to get into heaven.
These arent direct quotes but are some ideas expressed by Jesus Christ, the same man this hypocrite claims to follow. To say that George Bush is a faithful man is so blatantly stupid. Its sad that people in this country can be subdued into believing that this man is a Christian. It seems to me that people who claim themselves to be religious have chosen nationalism over religion. If it makes you feel better to vote for someone who has murdered thousands and thousands of people by saying he is a christian, fine, answer to it when you die
