This fanciful tale takes me back to the days of my youth when a good wrestling match with the cyclops was enough to put me right to sleep. Now I must find other means to bring upon myself that great slumber so I turned to none other than the inimitable Pat Robertson. It is an easy read but very difficult to beat the wookie to. The only thing that works better for me is Mein Kampf
