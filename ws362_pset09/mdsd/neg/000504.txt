A plain-looking girl with the most horrible name a mother could invent EVER-Herculeah!-loves solving mysteries,and -I give the author credit that they don't just fall into Herculeah's lap from nowhere;instead she likes to solve the mysteries that her mum-a private investigator-is working on-she is trying to work out ifn escaped loony-bin patient is really dangerous.I would not buy another Herculeah mystery,although it was OK.I am also aware that this review inludes an abnormally long sentence.Oh well.Bye
