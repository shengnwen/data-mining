This is one of the worst books I have ever bought.  I had to buy it for a college course and I am furious that my teacher used this one.  It is totally unprofessional and too general. Not only myself but others have complained about the  boringness and also but find it completely useless.
It reads like a high school essay project with unnecessary sarcasims, endless repetition and examples that are really very weak and inept in the explanations. 
If you are seriously considering pursuing an interest in compensation and benefits, do not use this book.
Teachers: don't put any other students through the aggrivation and insult.  We are professionals looking to advance our careers not waste what little time we already don't have. 
It infuriates me that I had to pay so much for a book that isn't worth $13.00 never mind $103.00
