I bought this book mainly on the recommendations of other reviewers.  That was a mistake.  The book is a dull gleaning from unacknowledged secondary sources.  Lots of more or less accurate names and dates, but no depth analysis at all.  Style?  Try this: "The feeling that the arrests were a criminal act of unapralleled dimensions were felt at the time."

If you still want the book, don't buy it.  Let me know and I'll give you my copy
