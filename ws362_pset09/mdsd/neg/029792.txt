Tittle the "ethicist" (more like elitist) puts her faith in Eugenics.  Welcome to Nazi Germany for the 21st century.

She proposes the development of a contraceptive vaccination universally administered to children at puberty, the antidote only given following an individual's licensing by the government.  Now logically, the inevitable illegal pregnancies would have to be halted by abortion. Forced government abortions. China, anyone?  Or at the very least, ripping babies from the arms of "unsuitable" mothers and awarding them to more correct ones. Fascist Argentina in the 1970s?
 
Wonder why so many copies of her book are available for sale used?  Hmmm.  Remainder table.  Should have aborted the book
