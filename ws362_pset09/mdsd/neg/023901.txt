As with any kind of encyclopedia you will find a brief amount of info on a particular topic, and one hopes that the info there is both truthful and objective  since your usually using a book like this for a report on something or maybe just for some advice. Since I worked for two years in a library I can say from direct experience that encyclopedias are like the internet. They are often just recycled information taken from other books or articles containing half truths. Reading this book gave me the impression of just this and that the researchers had done little if any actual reading of the sacred texts of any of these groups.  And so While a lot of it may be true a small percentage is very innacurrate due to the authors inability to grasp the psychological depth of each system. In fact, because I read a lot of sacred texts, alot of the so called research of this book appears more like newspaper reporting.  Like, Think I'll call the local Hare Krisha center up and ask em to give me brief description of what thier all about. You could just do that yourself without the personal filters of these authors and probably get a clearer picture. As a teacher of religious anthropology my impression of this book as a useful source of information is that it was written by people who's only real concern was to have thier names published in a book in order to help give them more credability so as to be considered authorities on religion.  I would never reccomend this book to any students or teachers because it contains both an incredible amount of misinformation and also very little insight into the psychological aspects of many of these groups and systems, which to me is very disrepectful.  To wrap it up, If like you McDonalds you'll love this book.
This is the McGuide to new religions. As long as you don't mind that thier may be just a little filler in your meat, and that your just eating fast food you'll be ok.
