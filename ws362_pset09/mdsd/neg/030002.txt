At the beginning of the book when Avery was mistaken after the mishap and was Carole's ringer the story was a real thriller. After you read more pages the story starts to go out of the main plot and repeating itself pretty much. How many times could you read in a book explicit sex scenes? Maybe 9 or 10? That means that in this book SB hadn't anything else to write to fill 442 pages. The last 100 pages or so are heavy as lead and all you'll read there will be Tate's campaign and two or three pages of the main plot. So I think that if this book were written with 150 pages less and always be in the main plot would have been a great thriller
