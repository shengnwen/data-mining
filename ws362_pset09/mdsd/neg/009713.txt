The opening is my area of expertise in the chess game, and I went over various books in amazon to find the right one.  I finally selected this, and feel I've completely wasted my money.
There are many openings the author doesn't cover, including the Bird (1. f4) and the English (1. c4).  Furthermore, those openings he does cover almost exclusively simply go over the main line.  And in some cases, it's not even the main line, but simply the line of Seriwan's choice!!
The opening that got the worst coverage was undoubtedly the Danish gambit.  This opening gives white an advantage only after a specific sequence of moves.  Seriwan cuts off this sequence quite soon and changes the main line in such a way so that white's advantage is completely lost!  (for those who know the Danish gambit:  his coverage was the sequence: 1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3?).
If you're looking for the ideas behind the openings, get Fine's book.  If you're interested in seeing the lines of the opening, get the MCO.  But avoid Seriwan's Winning chess opening, unless what you want is to here an IM blabber about what openings he likes
