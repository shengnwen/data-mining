While I am not qualified to pass judgement on sculpture as far as methods of actually creating works of art,as a art foundry owner,I have reasonable background in usage of diferent materials connected with sculpture. I found this book to be of rather limited use to anyone seeking information on materials in use today. Almost all refererences are very dated and may be considered useful if a study of yesteryear's practices are intended.It appears to me,that information on various metals and their processing  in particullar is more or less imprecise and in some cases wrong altogethrer-for example:to aneal common aluminium alloy to &quot;pink&quot; heat means going past melting point!To sum up,if you intend to learn current practices, go elsewhere
