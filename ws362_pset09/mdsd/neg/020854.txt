This book promotes stereotypes by radically overstating some slight differences between the sexes. If you want a scientific explanation of how they are grossly misrepresenting science, read either: 
1) Brain Gender   by Melissa Hines (2004)  or
2) The esssential difference: the truth about the male and female brain   by Simon Baron-Cohen (2003)
