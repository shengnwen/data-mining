In the midst of life I felt the need to look for a little guidance in the "gentlemanly".  This book delivered very, very little truly helpful information.  I imagine I could have produced a book like this back in the day, with plenty of alcohol on board and witty friends around the keyboard...  It's cleverly written and modestly entertaining, but really not at all what I was looking for.  
If, however, you do need to know the "gentleman's" take on smoking pot, threesomes, and carrying a flask, this may be your book
