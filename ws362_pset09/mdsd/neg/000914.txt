As I read these other reviews I'm curious if they were reading the same book that I read.  I gave it 2 stars only because I have read worse books.  That is not to say that the information in the book is not interesting, or heartfelt, but I just feel poorly written.   Dirlam repeats herself in many useless issues, such as the numerous times that she metions the reavealing dress of the russian girls.  The book is also a bit scattered, it did not flow well.  I would recomend against purchasing this book, rather for an excellent book on siberia read Colin Thurbron's "In Siberia" it will delight and amaze you
