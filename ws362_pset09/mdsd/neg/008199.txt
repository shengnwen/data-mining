The author could have done much more with her subject.  Many anecdotes in the book suggest Sandy Weill is a complex character.  For example, Weill is presented at the same time as a monumentally frugal, yet ridiculously lavish executive.  At one point he won't allow an acquired company to subsidize employee transportation to work, yet later insists it subsidize his own by maintaining a corporate jet.  Unfortunately she never addresses the question: how can Weill demand his troops run such an efficient operation while paying himself so exorbitantly?  Other, similar paradoxes also emerge which suggest Weill is a very complex individual.  But the author never treats him as such.  

In the last analysis her book is a patchwork of news articles that discuss different chapter's of Weill's life and career.  To sew the articles together into a coherent story, the author suggests that Weill's stunning ascent is driven by his simple desire to be accepted by the WASPy Wall Street powerbrokers who won't let a Jew join their club.  Perhaps that is the overarching goal that has driven Weill for the past 40 years.  But it raises interesting questions that the author doesn't address.  

I'm a Jew in finance and Jews have been very well-represented on Wall Street for some time now.  Weill is presented as having been driven to create Citigroup by his notion that he was still being excluded from the WASPy Wall Street club.  But by this point we're into the nineties and any exclusive WASPy club had long since been abolished.  So all of a sudden Weill comes off as pathologically insecure, which is intriguing.  But the author doesn't elaborate.

This is a good book if you want a run down of Sandy Weill's career.  No other author has compiled so much information about the man in one place.  But all that information confirms that Weill himself is a very complex man; to do her complex subject justice, the author would have had to do much more with this book
