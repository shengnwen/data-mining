I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good
