Brothers Majere starts off well and offers a new and never-before-seen adventure the likes of which I have never seen. However, it quickly degenerates into The Classic Dragonlance Plot, but without the epic feel Margaret Weis  and Tracy Hickman incorporate in their novels. The author also made two gigantic mistakes which contradict lines located in Tales of the Lance and Dragons of Autumn Twilight. The Soulforge and Brothers in Arms are much better than Brothers Majere
