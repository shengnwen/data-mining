I did not like this book. At all.

Lyanka and Gitana were both disgustingly perfect. Beautiful, talented, fantastic fighters . . . Mary Sues. Both of them. Ick.

The story was interesting, but I found that I just could not get into the book. The writing style seemed amateurish. It was a slog. I was on vacation, and I had nothing to do but relax and read. This is the sort of situation in which I go through a day. This one was so boring that I read it between other, much better books. I finished it mostly because it was a birthday present.

The only good thing about this book is the fact that there are many, many lines about Angel shoving Spike up against walls, which makes us slashers happy.

I've read better fanfiction. Don't waste your money
