Unfortunately, I ordered this book without first browsing through it at a store.  I was hoping for some innovative in-the-round patterns that would help me make better-fitting sweaters.  Instead, the book is full of shapeless designs with no waist definition. (I suppose I could figure out the increases and decreases to do waist shaping on my own, but the reason I buy pattern books is to reap the benefits of someone else already having done that!)  Virtually all of the designs have simple drop sleeves with minimal shaping, so that the sleeves bag at the top.  There is only one sweater in the book that I would consider making.  The photography is adequate, except that the same model is used to show every sweater, so it's hard to get a sense of how the designs might look on different body types.  I have to say that I wasted my money on this one
