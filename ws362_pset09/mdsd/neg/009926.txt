The CIA is a secretive organization.  So it comes as no surprise that a book that states that it reveals the top secrets of the CIA is merely a hodgepodge of technical mumbo jumbo relating to how the agency works.  It is not very informative, but what can you really expect?  No one is really going to get to the bottom of what the CIA knows presently and what they are telling the president.  It is better that way.  Policymakers are able to surprise our enemies.  At the same time, because the agency is secretive, we are able to benefit from novels and movies that probably exaggerate the day to day life of a CIA spy.  If you're really interested in knowing secrets, I'd suggest reading a crime novel or joining the CIA itself.  But this book does not help.
