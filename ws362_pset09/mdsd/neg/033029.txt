someone wrote this review above, i want to second it.  the book could have been a lot better, was quite disappointing.  i got into the habit of skimming through a lot of pages at a time, the last hundred pages or so are the best and worth reading, the rest is just a quick skim.

"From what I understand, this book is supposed to have some substance. But I just couldn't read it as its terribly written. First of all, it has a distinct feeling of a log book: January 17, I did this, January 17 I did that, in March I flew to New York, etc. Its never highlighted what days and events are important. There are too many acronyms, and too many people to keep track of. The book reeks of bureaucratic, military jargon. There is no in-depth analysis, no sufficient background, - overall, its just bad writing.
