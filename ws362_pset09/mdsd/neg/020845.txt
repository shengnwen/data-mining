This is a picture book biography of Dizzy Gillespie. We learn that he is beaten by his father while growing up.  At school he takes an interest in music and let's his anger flow through the trumpet he is learning to play.  He goes on to make a name for him self.  He makes his own style of music  and the people love it! 


At one point in the text a bunch of symbols were written and it looked like the author was wanting to write a curse word in the book but used the symbols as well.  I really didn't like that at all in a picture book for young readers.

I really would look else where for a good bio on Dizzy.
