     In his account of the war in the last months of 1963, the author contradicts himself and reveals a right-wing bias. He acknowledges that Kennedy never committed combat troops to Vietnam, and never committed to commit them, and says rather that Kennedy simply "retained the option of ordering just such a deployment at a later date." But the author then contradicts himself and reveals his anti-Kennedy bias by asserting that "Kennedy bequeathed a terrible legacy to his successor, Lyndon Johnson. The United States was committed to participation in a civil war in Vietnam without guarantees of success." This opinion is rubbish. The United States was not committed to any course of action in Vietnam when Johnson took over. Johnson, not Kennedy, bears the responsibility for the decisions Johnson made as President. 
     The author recites but ignores the fact that, when Kennedy was assassinated, there were only 16,000 U.S. military personnel in Vietnam--all advisors or support personnel, no combat troops--as opposed to the 565,000 combat troops Johnson committed. The author acknowledges that, shortly before he was killed, Kennedy told a top aide and the Senate Majority leader that he intended to withdraw completely from Vietnam after the 1964 election. The author dismisses these statements as "represent[ing] more the musings born of the frustrations of dealing with Diem than an acceptance of a communist triumph." Absolutely no factual basis is provided for this assertion.
      If you hate Kennedy and enjoy revisionist histories, buy this book. Otherwise, keep looking for a real history
