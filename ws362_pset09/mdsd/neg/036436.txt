Now I must confess that I am a historical fiction fan and NOT a romance fan.  I came across the first book in this series and enjoyed it.  I was a bit put off by the constant pride, by one misunderstanding after another leading to constant bickering, etc., but the story was fun and adventurous.  I decided to read the second book and was dismayed to find practically the SAME thing repeated all over again.  A strong-willed female defying her male captor, they fight verbally and physically, they accuse each of other lying... they have sex and fall in love.  Come on!  Did the second book have to be a cookie cutter of the first one?  I can understand the need for tension to keep the pages turning, but this book was overkill in that regard.  If the writing was not about the two principal characters fighting, then it was endless commentary on patriotic and political musings of the characters.  I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if it had varied a bit more from the first book.  It think I am done with this series.  If you are looking for a story that is full of tension -- physical, psychological, emotional and sexual, but does not have much substance, then you'll love this book.  If you want something a bit more intelligent, find another book
