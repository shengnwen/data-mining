This book is deeply flawed. It foundational premise is utter nonsense. Tarnas has used his vast understanding of the humanties and history and attempted to correlate trends, themes, biographies and events to the movement of planets. 

Like all astrologers, he is attempting to merge the scientific and factual using his intuition, seeing corrlations and causes and effects when none exist. The intuitive connection between the scientfic facts and the "facts" of history simply does not work. The supposed correlations  are simply subjective conjecture. And in the final analysis, the over arching question is "so what?".

I found the book very disappointing in light of his brilliant Passion of the Western mind
