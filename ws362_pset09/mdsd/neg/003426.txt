Faye, a successful young model, is about to marry Mark in a beautiful destination wedding.  Two of Mark's ex-girlfriends have been invited to the wedding as his friends, so Faye has unearthed two old boyfriends to invite along, and the whole band is staying in the hotel where the ceremony will be held.  In the twenty-four hours preceeding the ceremony, Faye must deal with Mark's jealous exes, her own unpredictable friends and past liasons, and Mark's disapproving brother - who happens to know of a past indiscretion that Faye doesn't want aired.

This book is an amusing romp, a British piece of chick-fluff.  The cast of characters is fairly broad: Faye's mother, Mark, and a few of the other characters are well-sketched through flashbacks as well as the main action of the book.  However, the main character, Faye, is unsympathetic.  The writing is inconsistent, funny and light in places, callow and dragging in others.  The beginning in particular is difficult to read, and some of the story is implausible.  However, the book is on the whole a not-unpleasant read
