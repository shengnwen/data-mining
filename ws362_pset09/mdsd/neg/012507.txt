This is an unbelievably bad book. "Unbelievable" is the correct word. Lunn has trouble with sentences and paragraphs with a single subject are quite beyond him. Logical flow of thought does not occur either.
Worse, as a "historian," he accepts as facts, concepts which are in great dispute or have no documentary evidence (too many to mention, but start with Mary Magdalene in France and even the existence of Arthur in England).
