I don't know if I got the same book than the other reviewers but our impressions about it are quite different. In my opinion drawings are not very clear and instructions get confusing with all this counterclock, reverse 90?, etc.

It is not that drawings are a bad thing, I have seen other books with illustrations that are actually easier to follow than photos but that is not the case of this book. Could be used in order to remind movements that you already know but forget about learning a new form from this book
