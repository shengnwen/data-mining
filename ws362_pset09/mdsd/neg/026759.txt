this is the absolute worst book i have ever been forced to and have ever read. i would like to add that i made a very strong attempt to get more interested in the plot of this book because it was a school assignment, but jeez, this was cruel and unusual punishment. when i think of this book, the word that comes to mind is "torture". i like a number of books and i love to read, i usually don't have a problem with book assignments, but this was just...just really mean. If you are smart, you will take my advice and stay far away.
