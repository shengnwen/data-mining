The authors of this book touch on many subjects, giving very little detail in any of them.  The legal and accounting loopholes are very basic - and they keep referring you to other products and sites they've written/published - making this book one big commercial.  In one area, when talking about the benefits of real estate investment, the fail to even mention costs associated with using equity, cash flow, repairs, etc.  I am a new entrant to real estate investing, and would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is no different than the get rich quick schemes you see on tv/internet
