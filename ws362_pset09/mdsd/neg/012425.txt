Bloody Mary is a very poor sequel to Whiskey Sour. It is the same book, basically. Once again, a powerful sociopath has a personal vendetta against Jack. I hope the author has something new to offer in the upcoming third book in the series...Unbelieveably, according to the reviews of Rusty Nail, the 3rd book, he recycled the story again. Forget it
