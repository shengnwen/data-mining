This book is tied with On the Banks of the Bayou for worst in a series.
As for New Dawn, far too much was devoted to the saga of Miss Sarah;  Elsa Beaumount/traveling man; and Paul stringing Rose along. 
On the Banks of the Bayou, Rose doesn't even appear to be the same person. Which I can understand someone maturing but Rose was always wishing for a large beautiful house to live in(like her friend Blanche Coday) and complaining about being poor. She travels to Louisiana to live with Eliza Jane who has a huge house with an electric light in the kitchen, beautiful, expensive furniture and a hired girl, but suddenly Rose is ashamed of wealth.
Which is confusing because three months earlier she is grumbling because her parents are too poor to send her to Mountain Grove Academy where her  rich friend Blanche is attending school. 
In Louisiana she has nothing for her classmates, her uncle Perley and his family or her Grandmother Wilder. Rose seems to be even more self-centered while in Louisiana than she was in Missouri.
