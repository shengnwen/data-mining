Being a big Russell Banks fan, I was very much looking forward to reading The Darling, a book that addresses a subject matter that is clearly a departure for Banks.  I wish he'd stuck with trailer parks and the rural working class. The only reason I finished the book was because I was so hoping something bad would happen to the heroine.  She is perhaps the least likable, least sympathetic heroine in a book I've ever read. What ever happened to writers writing what they know?  Banks using a woman as a first person narrator was a big mistake. Hannah rings so hollow to me, a supremely self-absorbed, irritating and, in many ways, dangerous person to anyone she encounters. The dialogue throughout -- particularly the trite conversations among the characters about the "sixties" -- was contrived and unreal.  I was immensely disappointed
