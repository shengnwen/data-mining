I bought this book because it was touted as a work that will show how to convert fear into "a source of energy and strength".  Along with personal "journeys" from the authors there are supposed to be inspiring stories from others.  Instead the authors have simply come up with a clever title to obfuscate the fact that this is a  political statement by two radical activists.  Ms. Lappe's personal journeys include her fear of speaking out against the War in Iraq until she was motivated by Moveon.org.  She overcame her fear and joined Senator Kerry's campaign.  I fail to find that particularly inspiring.  It simply makes her one of thousands of people in this country who campaigned for Kerry and speak against the war.  Mr. Perkins blames the policies of the United States Government for the AIDS epidemic in Africa.  I didn't see anything there about overcoming fear, but it was an inspiring example of how far the human imagination can stretch a set of circumstances to try to make a political point.  If you're a Bush-basher who believes the U. S. Government is evil and responsible for all the worlds ills, you might enjoy this book.  If you're looking, as I was, for something to help you face fears and self-doubt in your daily life, I recommend Wayne Dyer's "The Power of Intention"
