Kids like books written and illustrated for them.  Parents, not all but too many, want their kids to like 'the classics.'  That makes the parents feel successful -- it has nothing to do with the child's needs or wants. 

Russell has a good gig going here, because he doesn't pay for any of the excerpts.  He uses only writing no longer covered by copyright, so that he can collect the royalties and not pay writers.  That's why he doesn't use contemporary authors who might actually appeal to kids.  If he did draw from popular, good kids' authors like Gary Paulsen or Katherine Paterson, he'd have to pay them!  Same with the myths books, and with William Bennett's similar books.  Neither of them are really looking for the best for kids, they are looking to line their own pockets
