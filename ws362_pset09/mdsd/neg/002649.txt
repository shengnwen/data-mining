It won't let you print...

In other words, you have to be in front of a computer to read this book (I know it is an e-book, but it would be nice to be able to print out a few pages to read at the doctor's office or on the plane).  In additon, the layout is incomplete, there are no items associated with the index topics, the pictures are slow to load, and look third rate, etc.

Another little problem is that the book can only ever be read from two computers.  I travel for work, so I am "stuck" with the first two computers I read it on.  

I am really dissapointed, and I will be contacting amazon regarding a refund
