There is nothing particularly noteworthy about this book.  Many of the pictures are reversed negatives, making the shells "sinistral," or reversed...a big oversight to shell collectors worth their weight in salt.  Many of the specimens are ordinary, not intrinsically special in form or in color.  It is as if the photographer simply took fairly nice photos of whatever happened to be at hand -- which is not acceptable. Where is Oliva porphyria?  Conus dalli?  (color/pattern)  Malea ringens?  Stellaria solaris? (form)  My mind nearly boggles with the missed opportunities here!  There are so many other existing shell books that are superior to this (The Shell, Abott, 1968, well worth owning, being a classic of the type) that I am speechless as to why this one was published.  Compared to what could have been it adds very little indeed, and is not worth owning.
