I generally like and admire Faulkner's work, but this novel (or whatever it is) got the better of me.  Usually I make myself finish any book I read no matter how difficult, but with &quot;A Fable&quot; I simply couldn't do  it (and I've managed the entirety of James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; and  Proust's &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;.)  I may have a Master's  Degree in English, but I still had great trouble following what was going  on in the book, much less appreciating what it was trying to say.  It's  amazing to me that the Pulitzer Prize committee could even manage to get  through this thing, much less give it an award.  I haven't given up on  Faulkner, but for the first time since I was a college undergraduate, I've  given up on a book.  It took &quot;A Fable&quot; to bring me to my knees
