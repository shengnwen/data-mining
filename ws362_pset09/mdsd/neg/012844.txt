The book is incredibly boring.  If you're condemned to read it (say, it's required reading for your qualifiers), I strongly recommend that you find a group of people to study w/ and pool your resources to only buy a single copy.  The lack of answers at the back of the book makes self study difficult, and groupwork might be the only way to stay awake.

I wish to God I could think of another book to recommend over this one.  I imagine any will do
