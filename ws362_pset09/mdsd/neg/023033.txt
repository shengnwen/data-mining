Is there any possibility of giving this book zero stars?  What a
tedious and most forgettable read!  I completely agree with the previous
customer comment; this book has more to do with the business peripheral
to Paul, not Paul.  But in addition to that, Alan Clayson's writing style is
absolutely torturous.  

The entire book is composed of weak, endless, one-sentence paragraphs
that meander across perhaps five subjects, adding clause upon wandering
clause, dropping name over unknown name.  By the end, you have no clue
what in the world you have just read.  I had to read and re-read it
until I could decipher the text's meaning.  Alan, do yourself a favor
and brush-up on your basic writing skills.

I learned more about Paul in one 45 minute interview with Larry King
than from this effort by Clayson.  This book, unfortunately, is a
complete waste of time, and makes Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag Archipelago"
feel like a light and happy read
