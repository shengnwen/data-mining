This is a strange book. Even for a tell-all book it comes across as really strange. I'm not altogether proud that I purchased the thing in the first place but I was a bit curious about Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and what sort of person she was (aside from beautiful). To that end, the book doesn't really help to enlighten anything. Even when the author claims to have been head over heels in love with her, she (and him) come across as nutty and with too many issues for anyone to be remotely intrigued. It seems to me that Michael Bergin should have had more help in writing it; if he wanted love and respect to come through he just didn't make his point. His dislike for John Kennedy does shine through though, dislike and jealousy. The latter might be understandable if it weren't for its lack of nuances that a proper person and a book needs to have. Towards the end of the darn thing, I was genuinely disturbed by the suggestions that linger off each page. Could he have saved her life? Did she live out her final years in utter unhappiness and despair? Did he know or even care? Perhaps he meant well but it sure doesn't feel like it!
