What a waste of money!  After sending about 160 letters to the various recruiters listed in this book, about 90 were returned as undeliverable due to firms out of business and people moving to different firms.  The headhunter business is extremely fluid and recruiters apparently do not remain with a firm for any length of time.  The book also advises people not to call a recruiter on the telephone.  This must be an attempt to alleviate the recruiters from having to actually speak to a person without having a sure shot position open for them.  The authors must be former recruiters because they seem to write from a recruiter's point of view and not a job seeker's.  The book's advice and how-to sections are common sense; anyone with half a brain uses the steps outlined in the book already without having to be told to do so.  All that this book accomplishes is to line the pockets of the authors at the expense of people who are looking for valid resources that can assist them in a job search.  Ask your Uncle Ralph if he knows of anyone who is hiring and don't give these two useless people,(Christopher Hunt and Scott Scanlon) any of your hard earned money, especially if you're currently unemployed.  P.S.  the only reason my review has one star is because I wasn't offered the option of no stars
