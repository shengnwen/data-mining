If I was going to be locked up for 10 years and they let me choose just one book to take with me I'd grab Siddhartha. So when I read the reviews of Narcissus&Goldmund I couldn't wait.
Now I find it hard to believe the same person wrote both books.
N&G is lacking in all respects and there is no ending - throughout the book there is a poorly defined attempt to create or illuminate a conflict (which is sloppy) and there is no resolution at the end. What an empty book. If this is Hesse's work then I wonder whom he stole Siddhartha from.
