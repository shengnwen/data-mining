Oh my goodness me where do I start? This book is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The writing level is comperable to that of a 7th grader. The story is very poorly told as well. The writer tries to make herself sound talented by using similies and metaphors at the most awful points in the story. The story could've been interesting if I was written nicely, and was more in depth of events. This book gets too much publicity than it's worth, and this is probobly only because of the subject matter. The book starts off with Lalu, poor Chinese immigrant who was sold multiple times in China, and was starving. Once she came to America she was fed plenty of food, but unfortunetly, she was a sex slave for an evil Chinese Saloon owner. This is where the story gets uninteresting and stupid. She's then sold off the Charlie, a good friend of the man who brought her to the town she resides in. Then it just tells us what happens to her life after all of this. Maybe I didn't like this book because of the subject (Immigrant books never really were my favorite), but the poor writing style sealed the deal for me. Your money is better spent on something else
