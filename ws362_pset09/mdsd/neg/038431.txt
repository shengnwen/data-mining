This book has no questions and answers for the FCC test.  It only answers the most basic of newbie questions, and certainly is NOT a "Reference for the Rest of Us" as many of the "Dummies" books can be. I would not recommend this book for anyone except the least literate and most technically-challenged among us...not exactly what Ham Radio really needs to have as members. I wish I hadn't bought it
