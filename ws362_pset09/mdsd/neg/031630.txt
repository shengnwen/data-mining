The author is obviously in way over his head. This pathetic mockery of game theory is filled with errors. I'll only present the two most egregious ones:1.Incredibly, the author doesn't seem to realize that the probability  of a major adversity (as defined in the book) is greater than or equal to  the probabilty of a minor adversity. This restricts the applicable section  of his model.2.The slope for determining profitable trades (according to  the author's model) is given by (w+x)/(y-x). By choosing x arbitrarily  close to y the slope can be infinite.Conditions 1 and 2 imply that a  profitable trade on any and all stocks can be made under any market  conditions with no risk whatsoever.This inept, incompetent book is so bad  that it casts doubt upon the entire line of technical books from Wiley and  Sons and their editorial process
