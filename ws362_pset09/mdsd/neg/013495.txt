This book is primarily concerned with the history of yoga and source texts, with very little attention paid to the practice of yoga. Of the hundreds of yogasanas, only a handful are covered (possibly as few as twenty) and there is zero coverage of yoga as it has evolved in the West over the past 40 years and no mention of Iyengar or Bikram. If you are a practitioner of yoga then you will find little of practical value in this book. If you are an armchair yogi with an interest in history, you will find what you want here
