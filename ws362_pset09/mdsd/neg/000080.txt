18 people have reviewed this book before me and most of the reviews were favorable. That's just ridiculous. I picked up this book because I thought it might have something to say. Who would even publish this crap? Okay, Whitey Herzog was a big-league manager and he liked to play small ball, that's cool. But that doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talkin about. Anybody that  could say, in all truthfulness that bob &quot;pea brain&quot; costas would make a good commissioner has got to be kidding. He spends most of the book demonstrating how ineffective a writer he is and making excuses for coming up short. I would love to go fishing all day and knock the bottom out of a few cold ones, but you have got to be kidding me. I enjoyed the Casey Stengel anecdotes, but there is nothing original coming from this man that does anything for me. Is this guy serious about the midwest being the best place in the world to live? I remember Whitey Herzog being a conservative, unexciting type of manager. It's true about what's happening with the same teams competing every year because they have all the money. But Mr. Herzog doesn't shed any new light for this reader.  If you think there is any real character in this book, just refer back to what this guy says about costas. Boring, uninteresting and difficult to keep your eyes opened. SUMBUG, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS BOOK GOT PUBLISHED, IT STINKS
