I applaud Mr. Gipe's obvious commitment to renewable energy. He also seems very knowledgeable about wind energy. Unfortunately, this book is poorly written for anyone who has a "technical" mind, and I can't imagine anyone interested in reading a book on this subject to not have some kind of technical inclination. 

I understand that this is supposed to be an introduction to the subject, but even the most basic concepts are hard to grasp due to the way they are written
