...going to make money on nanotechnology within the next fifty years are stockbrokers and people like Jack Uldrich who -- for a fee of course -- will unveil their nanotechnology "expertise" and proffer advice accordingly...unfortunately, at this point, nanotechnology is little more than a fancy term -- practically speaking there is no tangible nanotechnology outside of research labs and what does exist is years away from commercial development...more pertinent in this particular case, Mr. Uldrich really provides no evidence to support his claim for "expertise" in the field of nanotechnolgy -- his resume shows only that he was a former naval intelligence officer and Defense Department official and also served as the Director of the Minnesota Office of Strategic and Long Range Planning under Governor Jesse Ventura...Jesse Ventura?...hmmmm, I'm not quite clear on how one acquires nanotechnology experience working for Jesse Ventura...moreover, his advice is basically free via columns he publishes every week on the "Motley Fool" website...no, I have to say this book is not recommended
