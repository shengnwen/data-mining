Though this book was written much better than Foundation's Fear, I wasn't very impressed. You know how movie studios always do re-makes of old movies? Well this here is a re-write, basically of the first chapter of Asimov's classic original Foundation book. What a waste of paper. If you already read the original, then you already know what will happen at the end
