Her other two books were awesome so I expected the same out of this one but was sorely disappointed.  I kept slogging through the short stories expecting them to be connected in some way but alas, I was wrong.  The entire book is a series of short stories that go nowhere.  They're not connected with at all.  I'm left totally unsatisfied.  

How did this get published?  Oh yes, the name "Jennifer Weiner" was on the cover.  Don't judge a book by its cover and I am ashamed I did just that.  This is the first book that makes me want my money back.  Shame on the publishers for letting this one out, in hard back no less.  To think what I could have done with $20 and the five hours I spent on the book..
