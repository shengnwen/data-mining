Gray is so far off the target when it comes to nutrition and
exercise.He says women might gain weight from exercise? Didn't
he ever hear about if you burn more calories than you take in you'll lose weight? Simple math Gray!Everything about this book
smacks of sell,sell,sell! snail oil salesmanship.When will he 
realize people have different needs bssed on individuality rather than gender.No one has any business making the blanket
statements he makes,it's irresponsible.
Another very corny statement is women get good brain chemistry
from affection and cuddling,while men get good brain chemistry
from sex.How much longer is society going to promote these 
myths? Bad advice,irresposible and plain corny
