There are some good points and bad points to James Shelton's &quot;Bear Attacks&quot;.  There is some excellent information presented on attacks themselves and on what to do if you find yourself in that situation.  There are a few problems I have with this book.  First, Shelton is just as biased as the so called &quot;preservationist&quot; groups he demeans.  It is clear he was raised in the thought that everything in the world belongs to mankind and that we should be able to take something if it benefits us.  His attitude towards bears, while showing respect, paints them as some sort of lesser being that we need to control.  Second, some of his ideas on why attacks are happening seem to be skewed by this.  While I do not agree that all attacks are all people's fault, Shelton makes it seem like we should blame bears for the way they live and naturally are.  He insists that attacks are not people's fault but then presents information about how the bear was food conditioned by people, even if they are not the ones who were attacked.  If you are looking for a definitive book on bear attacks, look for one by an actual biologist who does not have a hidden agenda
