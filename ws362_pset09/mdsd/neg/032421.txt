I never quite understood why everyone seemed to love this book so much. I read it, along with my entire grade, in seventh grade, and found the book to be annoying. I was especially annoyed by flawed characters, and a not very impressive writing style.
Many people are impressed by this book, saying it is an accurate portrayal of life then. I understand and respect that. Many books are accurate. That does not make them good. In this case, it's a book that is reasonable (not terrible, no), and at the same time has many deep flaws, the chief of which is the characters.
To put it simply, I was unimpressed by the book, and don't understand why it is considered something so incredible. It is just an ordinary, okay-quality book
