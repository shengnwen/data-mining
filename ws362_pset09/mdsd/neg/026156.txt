Being a bookseller, I often fall on nice book covers (dustcovers). Not that I judge a book by his cover but what can we do if they look very good? Tempted we are! This one really catched my eye and the story briefly explained on it made me buy it. Here we go!
Now. Reading began in earnest. Going through it became a sad tale. Finishing it was expeditive. Then...
What happened Mr Mosley? Got fed up while writing it? Your idea was truly marvelous but why going in every direction? Poor 47 must have had to run truly fast to follow you. Fictious tales of slavery should be read by young people (why not?) and giving it a science-fiction/magic twist... well, why not? Remember that science-fiction must be a context as real as slavery if it should be believable. 
No young adult will be able to read that... I will not judge this author by the only book I read from him either, but I'll stay with history books to learn on African-Americans 18/19th Century sufferings and Star Trek for sci-fi, thank you. :(((
Maybe a shorter version read by the great Ossie Davis could make me like it...
