The general problem with Arabic texts is that there are not many good options out there. Supplemental books, such as the '201 Verbs', is ok, but it quickly loses the average student who is unfamiliar with what the meaning of the 'jussive' verb form is in English. 

I wish there would be a listing of the verbs in English as well.  They are in alphabetical order in Arabic, something that is only of limited help.  The need for better Arabic texts is very high.  An overhaul of this book would be much appreciated
