I must confess that this book was not a pleasure to read.  The trivia portrayed in the Roosevelt-Churchill relationship was at times interesting and even amusing but when all is said and done both men made decisions NOT based on their supposed special relationship but on the needs of the day.  Roosevelt was at first suspicious of Churchill, then came to be a fan or his, but turned again suspicious of Churchill as he pursued the courting of Stalin.  I am not convinced that there really was a meaninful and consequential relationship between Roosevelt and Churchill.  Without this relationship much the same would have probably occurred.  Meacham does not demonstrate that his thesis is valid.  

Having recently read Meacham's analysis of the Jesus Question in Newsweek I am not surprised that his work here is superficial and jejune -- the work of a journalist not a scholar.  He is a bright young man but doesn't have anything to say which would last more than a week
