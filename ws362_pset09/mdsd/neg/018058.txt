I have never in my life read a more BORING, POINTLESS work of fiction.  You will find yourself utterly befuddled when trying to follow the poor wording and punctuation of this story.  The plot is MIND NUMBING, and of course I have to finish it because I am compelled to finish every story I begin reading.  I wish I could find it in myself to light this on fire and put the ashes in my cat's litterbox but that won't happen for another one hundred agonizing pages at least. RUN THE OTHER WAY while you still have the chance, friends! Use the five or six bucks you would have spent on this paperback to buy some toilet paper instead, I promise it will be more interesting
