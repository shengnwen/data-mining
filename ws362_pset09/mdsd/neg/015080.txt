Bramley is just as bad as sitchen with his outlandish interpretations.  Sure, there is a conspiracy of sorts but Bramley's theories doesnt hit the mark.  The whole talk of antiquity interpretation was laughable at best.  The only conspirators on planet earth is the western governments!  This book, and others like it shows that ppl like myself and others have too much time to be occupied with nonsense.  Besides conspiracy or not just go for a personal goal no one with conspire against that.
