I know that a lot of people have loved this series and have come away from this series with ideas that have become a part of them. So I really wanted to read and enjoy these books. But my brain can't follow 20 shifting characters and constant point-of-view shifts even within the same character. I'm sure that the story is brilliant. But I just couldn't manage to keep all the stories and people straight. I finally gave up altogether with the reading. These books will definitely challenge you, but they're not for everyone.
