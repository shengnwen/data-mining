The book that I just finished reading "Teacher The One Who Made The Difference" by Mark Edmundson was an average book. At first when I bought the book I thought that it would be  interesting and enjoyable to read but it was not really interesting at all.There were so many ideas that were hard to follow, and it did not talk particulary about the teacher and how he changed his life.I would not recommned it to anyone, but if you like to read for pleasure and you have time you certainly can. There were some chapters that keep you interested but there were some that you just do not want to read. Overall it had a nice ending.
