Despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the 20th century, Byatt, in all her annoyingly feminist glory, has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet. Each and every character is lacking in charisma, humour and, in fact, any other attractive facet about their personality, offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy, thus leaving no hero, so necessary to such a story.
   Then there's the sub-plot literature which was all, unfortunately, written by the woman herself. To interlink the text with poetry and letters is, admittedly a good idea, but the quality is dire. Could it be more pretentious to fill a book with sections that the author herself admits will not be read by most? And chapter 10...just too long. So unneccessary.
   This is, without a doubt, the single worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read, and would recommend it to no-body other than those who consider suicide by boredom a good idea
