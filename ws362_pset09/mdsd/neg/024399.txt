I borrowed this book from my local public library.  It is filled with darling projects - in fact, a friend asked me to make the shell-edged shrug for her.  Well, it started out fine, but about halfway up the first sleeve, the instructions went wacky.  Realizing the book was first published in Great Britain and translated to American (the crochet terms are very similar, but a G.B. single crochet is a U.S. double crochet), I tried to work with it using the photo as a guide.

When it was time to shape the shoulder, front, and back, however, the instructions became incoherent.  I gave up at that point - it just wasn't worth the struggle.  

I've crocheted for many years, and it is rare that I find a pattern that stumps me so completely.  Needless to say, I've found a different pattern with a similar finished look to make for my friend, and I won't attempt any of the other projects in the book.  I don't have time for this
