This book is horribly disapointing. I bought it before spending two semesters studying in Austria and instead of reading something that would in some way prepare me for what I was to experience, I found a biased, xenophobic, uneducated critique of a, contrary to what the authors have to say, wonderful country. The only part that was good was the section concerning food, but you needn't bother, menus in Austria are also written in English
