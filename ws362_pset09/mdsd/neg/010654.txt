Are we all mad???? No really?   This is a nice book.   Well presented and well-made but it is blank book and how much does it cost?   The Book of Shadows is a sacred book of spells, recipes and feelings.   It does not have to be leather(look)-bound and cost a fortune.   It is the content which is valuable not the coverings.  Sorry to be so negative.   Blessed be
