I was very disappointed with this book.  I was hoping for a clear and concise overview of world history in order to gain a general understanding of major world events and trends.  The author had only 513 pages to cover the entire span of world history, so why does he waste space rambling about vague sociological trends, or how one country might possibly have affected another?  The writing itself is incredibly clunky and unclear, and the organization is somewhat confusing.  I only ever had a vague grasp of the details of a specific civilization before the author jumped to another geographic area and back 1 or 2 thousand years.  I couldn't even finish the book ... I'd rather spend my time doing something (anything) else than spend it muddling through this mess
