I will tell you why I did not read this book. The back cover shows it is unnecessary by telling you every single tip you will get to know in this book. The tips are so simple, TOO SIMPLE, you will wonder how this guy even managed to make a book out of tips your teachers and your parents have told you a billion times. If you are a D-student, this book will help you by telling you to start working instead of writing notes to your girlfriend/boyfriend of 1 day and plans to break up. Just read the back cover and write down what you plan of doing.
If you are a A/B student, go home.
A poster can do the job of this book. 
Another problem would be that since this tips are so simple, you may not have the attension span to read every atom of a detail behind it.
