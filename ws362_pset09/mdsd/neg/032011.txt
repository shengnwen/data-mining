The only thing perhaps more moronic than this tripe is those who have let themselves be bamboozled into thinking that there is something of deep thought and/or substance here.  I can only assume that those who found this entertaining are extremely insecure and think that if they like something that others who are perceived to be "important" like that they too will be "important".  The part of this I truly find mind-numbing is her "deep" and "thoughtful" insight into the solution to the violence/terrorism in the world;  all we need is "vagina warriors" working at the "grass-roots level".  You know what, let me reconsider my first observation; to call this moronic is an insult to morons everywhere.  It's sub-moronic
