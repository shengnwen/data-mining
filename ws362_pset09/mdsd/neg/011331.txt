I find this author very simplistic.  It seems it would be good for a young reader: simple language and not too challenging.  For adults?  I'd think adults would get impatient with the overly simple writing.  I'm a big mystery fan, and tried a couple of her DoD series, but they're SO immature. Geeze, Encyclopedia Brown is more complex
