Mr. Irving is a renowned writer who has pleased readers with books like, The World According to Garp, Prayer for Owen Meany and Cider House Rules.  There is a creativity about his writing and a quirkiness in his characters that I find appealing.  What happened here?  I was so mired down in wordiness and child sexual abuse that my commitment to the book ended with the protagonist's early grade school sexual experiences.  If somebody walked into a person's home and found drawings of what was verbalized in the book, they would probably consider the individual a pedophile and his home would be marked on public records as housing a pervert.  It seems strange that a brilliant writer could go on ad infinitum, describing the same things in words and be considered worthy of praise.  Anything the book had to offer was lost on me because I couldn't get past being inundated with pages and pages dedicated to pathetic images of a young boy's penis; crude and rude, abusive adolescent girls; and body hair fetish.  Maybe had I been pulled in enough to read further, I would have found redeeming value in Until I find You.  As it played out for me, the book is not worthy of John Irving.
