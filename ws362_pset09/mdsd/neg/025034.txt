As someone suffering from social anxiety disorder, this book was extremely disappointing.  It focuses almost entirely on what causes anxiety and the "suggestions" are not helpful at all.  I felt as though all this book did was explain to me what it felt like to have this phobia. If you are looking to research the disorder, it would be a great book. If you are looking for help in battling social anxiety this book will be of no use to you, as I am guessing you already know what it feels like
