PLease consider how many books there are out there before you pick up THIS one.  Though you may be a fan of suspense or romance, this has a plot that has managed to be predictable, dull, and pretentious all at once.  The story is a basic spy story, and the little romance is obscured by slang which has no place in today's literature.  The author tends to describe things in a way that could take paragraphs (if not pages) to explain.  The only reason to go near this book is for a school project or in class assignment.  Otherwise, ther is no reason to read through this "classic".
