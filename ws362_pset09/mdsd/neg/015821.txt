This novel starts out okay, but rapidly deteriorates into a maudlin melodrama of cardboard characters.  After I began reading this, I thought it seemed very formulaic compared to other Ludlum novels.

My biggest problems with the book can be put into two basic categories:

One - The man with no name who is too dangerous to let go.  This theme is well done with Jason Bourne, but far too commonplace here. Several times I felt that if the main character was this well trained, he never would have pursued his course of action.

Two - The reasonable female.  The girl is far too willing to accept really bad things here.  No convincing is needed - just imply cloak and dagger and the girl falls in line.

I started out liking the book - but ended up hating it
