Sandford has done his best to be "fair" to the insufferable and untalented Paul McC.   And yet he bends over backwards (or maybe forwards) to say nice things about the even less talented Linda and even seems to have a soft spot for Heather Mills (Milks) McCartney, who has become a spokesman for IHOP recently.   

When will somebody come along and really tell the truth about this bozo?
