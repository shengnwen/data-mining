I was considering reading this book, as it had come up as part of a work discussion.  I went to the website brandsense dot com to find out more and on the promotional materials there's a blurb about the author where in the opening sentence it claims "Martin Lindstrom founded his own advertising agency at the age of 12"!!!  Now, forgive me, but I find this extremely hard to believe unless he is really stretching the definition.  And even if it is true, do you really want one of the first things someone reads about your brand (ie: Martin in this instance) to be something that makes you think "what a joke, this guy is obviously full of hype"?!!?  Now, maybe the book is OK, certainly a lot of other people think it is, but I fear that this sets the tone.
