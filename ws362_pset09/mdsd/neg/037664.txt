This book was not helpful at all.  It claimed to include all of these tips from the masters on how to MIX, but at least 80% of the book focused on each famous producers start as an engineer and their favorite gear.  Very little detail was given about general mixing techniques and if it was, it was very vague.  I would recommend the MIxing engineer's handbook instead
