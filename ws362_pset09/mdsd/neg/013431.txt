If there is anyway to make a quick dollar today, its for some moronic MD to write another book about the use of anti-depressents. I really wish that people would stopped reading this garbage, and just do what they feels is right, and stop believing everything someone says just because they have the letter MD in front of their name. The reason I take this personally is that I have been diagnosed with a mental illness, and these drugs have saved my life. I have tried everything, from exercise, to herbals, to vitimins, to theropy, and even though they help, w/o the drugs, I am unable to function. Yes, it is true, these are some strong drugs, and doctors do Overpriscribe them, yet at the same time, they can do wonders for people who dont react well to "Alternitive Theropy" so the person can live a normal life. Every drug has side effects, and little is known about long lasting effects. Does this mean that people with other diseases shouldn't take Meds, should they sufefer and Die because of side effects from Meds, or do you take a chance and possibly live longer. DOnt believe the hype with these [...]. The human brain is still the one body part that doctors are still puzzled with, and little is known of why stuff happens to it. Take your meds, dont suffer, live longer, and tell Peter R. Breggin to go [..](oh yes that is anger created by the use of Effexor..
