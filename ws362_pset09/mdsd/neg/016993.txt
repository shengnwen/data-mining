I finished this book fairly quickly, and I came away from it feeling like I had a decent overview of the atmosphere in America during 1968, but that I had not learned anything other than the basic facts of what went on.  In  my opinion, Kaiser fails to go in-depth enough into any one subject (except  the McCarthy campaign) to give the reader a true understanding of what it  must have felt like to be there.  I was born in 1982, so I was not there,  and I still feel like I lack an understanding of the attitudes and events  of the time.  Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the title is  misleading.  This book is not about music or the counterculture or really  even  the shaping of a generation.  It is about the presedential campiagn  of 1968, and specifically the McCarthy campaign.  If someone wanted a more  of a cultural account that is specific and goes in depth into the feelings  and conflicting spirits that characterized that turbulent year, I would  recommend they look elsewhere, as I will
