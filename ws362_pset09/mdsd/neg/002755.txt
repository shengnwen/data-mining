Crappy mystery novel about a forensic anthropologist convention.  Very poorly written.  Uninteresting plot, not well constructed, full of characters that never felt real or were cared about.  Completely not worth  the time I put into it.  One or two interesting points, and the fact that  it wasn't actually offensive, are all that save this book from being  awarded the lowest grade.  Must remind myself not to spend time with books  like this in the future
