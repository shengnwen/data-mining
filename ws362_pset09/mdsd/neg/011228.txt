The first 1/3 of this book was just fine. The characters were portrayed realistically, with subtle enough evidence that this family was not what it appeared to be. Then the characters-mostly the female ones took 360 degree turns that were so unrealistic they became laughable, or at least shake one's head vigorously. When I reached for this book at my Barnes and Noble, it literally was within arm's reach (it was on the highest shelf). Frankly, I wish is was unreachable, I might have found a better book that day
