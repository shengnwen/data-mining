Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...

If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you. 

This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.

I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.

Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation
