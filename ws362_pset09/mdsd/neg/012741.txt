This would be a great book with a large number of food items analyzed, but it doesn't include the fiber information, something that can be very important to a diabetic since fiber can have a positive effect on blood sugar and cholesterol.  I was going to return it, but it isn't worth it, so I just ordered The Complete Book of Food Counts by Corinne T. Netzer which has all the information needed
