Mike Wallace has been engaged in his so- called hard- hitting journalism for years. But anyone who has studied Wallace close-up knows he has engaged repeatedly in some of the most dishonest of all journalist practices. In the late eighties his crew was caught paying Palestinian youths to throw rocks at Israeli soldiers. This provided good film footage. Wallace's most recent interview which is not included in this book is a perfect illustration of the dishonesty in another way. The very same week Wallace interviewed him Ahmadinejad spoke in Iran before a screaming hystircal audience. He ranted against the United States and said how it would fall apart. But his most bitter cursings were for Israel and he repeatedly shouted to his audience , in Hitlerlike fashion 'Death to Israel' 
Now switch to the interview. Wallace says Ahmadinejad is personable , does question him about his Holocaust denial, but lets him off relatively easily. There is no mention of proposed genocide, or politicide, only that Ahmadinejad is against the 'Zionists' 
Years ago watching Wallace I noticed how insulting and aggressive he could be with those who did not share his political views. 
Edward R. Murrow he is not.
