This novel was a terrible disappointment for me because I have enjoyed almost all of Elizabeth Berg's previous novels.  This one, however, is so unrealistic, so phony and so easy to see where the story is leading.  An idyllic marriage, a perfect little town, ideal new neighbors and acquaintances,  friends who rush to the aid of the new widow even though she has ignored them for 30 years, and so on.  Too treacly by far!
