There are very few books where when I'm done reading them, I'm not sure what the book was even about, but this is one of them. Before reading this, I'd read "Never Let Me Go" by the same author, which I really liked. "When We Were Orphans," however, was not enjoyable at all. I admit that part of this may have been my fault; this is a book that you need to read closely. It's not an easy book, but I don't have a problem reading somewhat confusing books if they're well-written. This one just didn't capture my attention. The beginning was easier to follow, but it got worse and worse as it went on. I'm still open to trying another one of Kazuo Ishiguro's books, but I wouldn't recommend this one
