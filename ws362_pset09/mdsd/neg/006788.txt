I'm sorry but I've read books a lot funnier (Christian Culture Survival Guide) and a lot more intelligent (God's Politics) then this one. I was hoping for some edgy satirical writing that The Door is known for. The author seemed to have chickened out on Chapter 6 (Too Queer for Words) as the entire chapter was 4 pages long and made little sense. 

If you want to check it out sit down with a cup of coffee at a bookstore and browse it for about 10 minutes and you'll know what I mean.
