When I picked this book up, I expected it to be interesting.  As a fat kid, I thought I would enjoy the story, thinking that I would feel connected to the main character.

Boy, was I wrong.

In the beginning of the book, Troy, feeling suicidal, wants to throw himself on the tracks, but Curt, a skinny druggie, stops him.  By the middle of the book, I wish Curt had just held back and let Troy jump.  The book was very slow for me; each new chapter sounded like the last.  I read this short book over two weeks because I just couldn't take it.

The end was unsurprisingly predictable.  I mean, I could've told you what was going to happen by the fifth chapter.

Usually, when I read a book, I take something from it, maybe a lesson or a moral.  In this book, I just felt a sense of nonclosure... the ending didn't really do it for me.

Based on the other reviews on this page, you probably think that I'm just a mean person who writes scathing reviews on great books.  The first part may be true, but I only write scathing reviews on things I did not particularly like.  You may not have liked Macbeth, but I sure did.  Whether it's a good book or not is all a matter of opinion
