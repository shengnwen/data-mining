I agree with the comment below.  Boring.  I also have read all the books in the series and look forward to each new one.  
This one was not up to the standard I expected with the In Death Series.
By the end of the first chapter you knew the killer and why.  The conflict with Mira didn't fit either.
Maybe the next one will be better
