Three times I picked up this book and started it. Three times I put it down and read something else instead. Since I let myself run out of reading material I picked this up again. It is truly one of the worst Iris Johansen books ever written. As the previous reviewer said "It's far fetched and a lot of drivel." After reading the first hundred pages or so I finally flipped to the last chapter and read through that, skipping entire paragraphs. This is really a no brainer, no suspense, most repetitive book I have ever tried to read. I give it a MINUS 5 star rating. I have purchased my last Iris Johansen novel. Save your money. Buy Stuart Woods, James Patterson or Lisa Gardener.
