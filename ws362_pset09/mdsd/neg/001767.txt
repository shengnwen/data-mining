Okay, I'm a sucker for a good sob story that pulls at the heartstrings. Unfortunately, this didn't do it. I own many of the Chicken Soup books and this one in particular had the potential for hitting the zenith of Chicken-Soup-ish-ness. But the stories seemed fake, not particularly heartwarming, and contrived.
