I used this book as a text for a very large (~150 students) first-semester course in biostatistics for public health grad students.  It is lavishly illustrated and has huge problem sets at the end of each chapter.  It uses lots of examples.  I did not think it did a good job of either conveying either intution or theory.  Many definitions are far short of rigorous, and students seemed dissatisfied with the resulting uncertainty.  The problems are far too repititive.  I would prefer a more terse book which provides definitions and theorems that actually can be used
