This book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships.  Heinlein is so different here than in his good books (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers, Door into Summer, or Orphans of the Sky) that I wondered who actually wrote this awful work.  It seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti-woman. The basic premise is what would happen with a man's brain in a female body.  Maybe a good concept, but it is terrible in application here.  I just hated this book. I was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work. Please consider avoiding this work.  Perhaps every writer deserves some grace, but this work is almost beyond redemption.  Maybe Heinlein was ill while writing this, or maybe his editor was on drugs?
