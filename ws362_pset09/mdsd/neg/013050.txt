well, i had a list of books to pick to read for a project in AP american history, and i picked this book for it being the shortest.  Big mistake.  I could have finished a book twice its size in the same time, for i couldnt  read it for ore than 30 minutes straight because i was so bored.  The  author wasted so much time with description, and the plot was pointless.   Well, i would not recommend this book to anyone in high school
