I will focus solely on Sunstein's take on the Second Amendment.  He supports the so-called "collective rights" theory which a) runs exactly contrary to the plain text of the amendment b) the historical understanding of the courts and c) against the current "standard model" of legal interpretation of the Second Amendment (which is in fact a return to the historical view of the right - an individual right).  He ignores the 14th Amendment and incorrectly interprets one of the few modern Second Amendment cases - Miller (which ruled that weapons suitable for military (militia) use ARE protected.  Sunstein bends and twists language, precedent and history to yeild his desired interpretation, rather than be informed by the same as to what the writers of the Constitution intended.  This way lies madness, where words have no meaning or context and the Constitution is maleable as wax, offering no limits on the government and no protection to the citizens rights.  Don't waste your time or money on this book, as the subject of this fiction is politics and not the Constitution
