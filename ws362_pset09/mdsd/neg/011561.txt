Author Nathan Aaseng published Navaho Code Talkers. I thought he crafted the book horrifically from the start since he did nothing to pull the reader in. He just started off with too many facts. This was not a book that makes you want to stay up on school nights and read even when your parents tell you to go to bed. This book is the kind of book you may want to stop and not continue. The kind books you will be glad to finish reading. He did a great job of giving the facts but they where not organized in a way which interested you. 

 However I do truly under stand the code talkers where a big part in the war, but really he should have spoken about the war more than just the code talkers. After reading other books on the code talkers he really left out a lot of details that he should have included. It may just be me but I will never read one of Nathan Aaseng's books again.

I recommend this book for any one who only wants to learn about the Code Talkers but if you want the full package on the war pick another book.
