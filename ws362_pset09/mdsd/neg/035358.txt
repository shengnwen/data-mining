Somewhere in &quot;Blues Legacies,&quot; Angela Davis the Activist and Angela Davis the Scholar collided leaving both worse for wear. This is a powerfully stated, well-intentioned study that loses focus and credibility  by screaming, rather than supporting its ideology. Davis argues that three  foremothers of American blues music, Ma' Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Billie  Holiday, offered up a version of black, working-class feminism through  their songs that emphasized self-suffiency, personal pride, and admitting  one's shortcomings. These value, the author asserts, sprouted into the  feminist conciousness of the 1960's, largely coded as white and middle  class.  Davis thorough knowledge of black musical criticism and exhaustive  study of the three artist's lyrics makes this central assertion a  convincing one. From here, I waited for her to place it in a historical  context and ask some tough questions about the role of women in popular  music which would tie the study firmly to contemporary discourse. It never  happened. Davis hammers this feminist assertion into submission for nearly  200 pages, never letting it mature beyond simple declaration.   The role of  black feminism in the 20th century is under-explored and long overdue. Yet  the author never grants it the weight it deserves. How did this black  feminism figure into the process of composition since Rainey, Smith and  Holiday wrote very few of their songs? How did these Artists influence  their children from the Shirelles to Tina Turner to Salt n' Pepa? The  potential for answering these important question is all over &quot;Blues  Legacies&quot; yet Angela Davis keeps getting in her own way. A scholar  shouldn't have to choose between their message and their scholarship but  this case, a frustering collision might have been avoided
