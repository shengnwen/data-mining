I did not find this book helpful.  I feel that the fashion tips are ridiculous for plus size women. Checks, bright colors and huge caftan type clothing are certainly not flattering. I am a plus size and I would never wear any of the selections found in this book. They are loud, loose and make the model look like she even heavier than she is. I found Sandra Betzina's books, especially Power Sewing, to be much more detailed and helpful. The sewing techniques in this book are certainly not couture in my opinion. The techniques are quick, but the results are a home-made look and the fit is poor. The waistline techniques are amatuer at best. My skills are on the intermediate level and I did not gain any helpful information from this book. Having found better selections in the Sandra Betzina line of patterns and books, I gave this book away, because there is nothing I found in it that I consider worth my time.
