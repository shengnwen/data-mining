As an avid, albeit amateur reader of prehistory through Native Americans, I found this book to be appalling.  In one chapterm the author states that the Native Americans wasted the buffalo, leaving their bodies to rot and wasting meat.  This, unfortunately, would have been the doings of the white man - the "Indian" wanted all parts of the animal, not just the tongue and tail.  I was horrified, and will make sure my children's schools will never read this book, unless as an example of twisted "facts"
