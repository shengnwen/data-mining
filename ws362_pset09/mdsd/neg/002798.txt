This is surely a book for beginners. After a few basic mental exercises to easily and quickly go to 'your basic psychic level', the rest of the book is mostly a long list of pleasant case stories intermixed with very short and easy descriptions on how to do something similar - just by asking your higher mind and/or guide/angle for it.
I see the value of the book as an appetizer to a potentially wonderful and very pleasant life with just about any power and knowledge one could imagine. But it will probably not make you a psychic unless you are already VERY close. Perhaps one should keep in mind that the author has a background in hypnotherapy and builds somewhat on (self-) suggestion.
I bought the book because of some exercises mentioned in a review, and indeed some of them might show up to be beneficial over time. As usual, this will depend more on the student than the teacher. But again, more depth would have been nice
