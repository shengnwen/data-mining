In this book, perhaps more than his others, Rudy Rucker takes the common themes of Cyberpunk literature (the frightening/enlightening possibilities of technology) to unique and fascinating ends. For those looking for a taste of just-over-the-horizon technology in an all too familiar environment, you will find much to like here. There is the dependence on visual stimulation and passive entertainment, whose destruction brings about blood-thirsty mobs. There is the shift away from real-world social interaction and towards anonymous techno-societies that makes communication increasing awkward when not accompanied by digital interfaces. Finally there are the ethical and logistical problems involved in giving increasing control and autonomy over the machines that do not necessarily share our moral qualms.

In the end, however, the writing fails to live up to the ideas. The first hundred pages are awkward at times, excruciating at others. Once the meat of the plot begins, the overall writing seems to improve, but the dialog still seems stilted and the pacing is jumpy. Although I had hoped to attribute these factors to the stylistic choices made by many modern sci-fi writers, it became obviously that the writing simply wasn't up to par.

If you want high quality Rucker, you will be better off with his later *ware tetrology
