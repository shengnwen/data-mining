Ok so when I first started reading the book I thought all right this is ok.  And the book went along and I still thought it was ok good at times but just a decent book.  Then I finished the book and I realized something.  Nothing had happened really.  There was nothing to tell you what the overall plot would be for the triolgy it was just them going from once place to the other.  Its like oh there is a ghost we should follow it, yeah because that is such a smart thing to do.  This book just annoyed me so much because nothing happend in it.  I don't really understand why so many people love this book.  This book is average at best and not much else.
