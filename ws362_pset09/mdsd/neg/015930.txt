Just finished reading the book of "secrets."  Perhaps it is because of the general degradation of the English language over the years, but the word "secret" seems to have lost its original meaning.  No secrets here.  This book is just a check list of things to remember, in other words, some helpful hints.  A very fast read.  My major concern however, is that the author appears to have a heavy bias towards recruiters/headhunters, perhaps because he earns his income in that way.  For example, one of the "secrets" given in the book is: "Be kind to the headhunter."  The advice on interviews is very scanty.  You could get more useful information on interviewing from the average newspaper article on the subject.  In summary, it seams as though this book was written in order to glorify the author's career as a headhunter.  Naturally, he cares more for his clients (those that pay them his fees) than he does for job candidates.  He spends an entire chapter warning job seekers never to accept a counter-offer from your current employer.  No surprise, because one of the most frustrating things to headhunters is on those occasions when they find out that they aren't going to close on a deal.  This book is OK for a person just starting out, but will produce a yawn for anyone with ten or more years of work experience.  The advice is just too obvious ... and obviously biased
