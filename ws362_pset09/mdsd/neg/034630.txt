But I'll throw him a bone with a second star. (See end of review for why.)

First, let me qualify myself in a few ways.

I'm an atheist, so I'm not attacking Dennett on religious grounds. 

Second, while I believe in the validity of evolutionary psychology, I don't believe in Dennett's adaptationist-based Evolutionary Psychology. (And, are there that many Dennett fans here, for the negative replies to my review, or is something about Ev Psych vs. ev psych not clear? Read my review of "Adapting Minds," David Buller's book, or of "Why Men Won't Ask Directions," further down this page.)

The problems with Dennett's book, as far as his previous history goes, boil down to two things: adaptationism and memes.

Adaptationism, at least the strong version touted by Ev Psychers, hasn't been shown to be true for purely physical evolution. For cultural evolution, even though it too is ultimately biological, it's got even less proof that it's anywhere close to a convincing primary explanation. See my blog, wordsofsocraticgadfly.blogspot.com, for some recent comments on Dennett, adaptationism and Ev Psych (versus ev psych). Or read my review of "Adapting Minds," David Buller's book, or of "Why Men Won't Ask Directions," further down this page.

Second, much of Dennett's approach could be explicated without ever reverting to Controversial Idea No. 2 - memes. If, and that's a big if, there's any truth to memes, they're likely to be much less robust bits of mental heredity than Dennett, even more than Dawkins, would have us believe.

Related to that is Dennett's incorrigible urge to translate language - and to some degree, the ideas behind the language - of people like Scott Atran and Pascal Boyer into his own. I've read and reviewed both their books on this subject. Go read them and learn a lot more than in Dennett's watered-down, "tweaked" transmissions. Ironically, in a book about religion, "dogmatic" might be a good word to describe some of Dennett's tendencies in this way.

Now, how does Dennett shoot himself in the foot in this book in the first 10 pages?

Simple. He first says he's not an expert on academic religious studies, nor on Eastern religions in general. He then runs roughshod over both these on page 10, where he defines religion as including a belief in a theistic deity, obviously excluding Eastern religions Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. All DO make the cut of "religion" in the academy, Dan. But your definition of "religion" doesn't.

This is probably Example No. 1 to underscore what other reviewers have said, as well: This book looks like a rush job, perhaps to Sam Harris' book, or otherwise shallow. Part of that, given Dennett's previous writing history, is that he hasn't done much with religion in academic journals, so had no starting point of turning academic essays into book chapters.

Second, to skip ahead in the book to pages 272-73, Dennett makes what should be considered elementary errors of logic, even if being used to some degree as rhetorical talking points.

On 272, Dennett broaches the possibility that religion makes one healthier, mentally more fit, etc. He nowhere discusses the issue of statistical correlation vs. causal correlation. Nor, even if there is a causal correlation, does he consider which way it goes. I.e., does religion make you healthier, or does being healthier make you more religious?

On 273, he presents the hypothetical talking point that examining the issue of religion making one healthier or mentally more fit might fade under the scientific microscope. To broach this as even a halfway serious talking point, Dennett comes off sounding like paranormal peddlers that James Randi and CSICOP are constantly having to shoot down, special pleadings and all.

There's lesser errors on top of these, but what I've just listed are train wrecks of logical reasoning. Can anybody mail Dennett a copy of The Skeptic's Dictionary? Maybe this acclaimed philosopher wouldn't come up so short, or so naï¿½ve, in the logic department as his thought on these two pages indicates. And, no, I'm not saying this totally tongue in cheek. Near the end of chapter 9, Dennett's logical reasoning skills are that weak.

I'll give the book two stars, not one, though, but only by the skin of its teeth. As a popularizing version of some of what Atran, Boyer and Harris, among others, discuss, and especially as (ostensibly) written in a spirit of outreach to a variety of religious believers of at least some depth of faith, it rises above the one-star mark. But only for that reason
