This book is garbage.  Absolute garbage.  I think Glannon's Civ Pro is great, and I have read many others that I can learn from.  I am in chapter 8 right now, and I have been searching the internet for a way to tell the company or the authors that this book sucks.  I visited the Aspen publishing webpage, but they don't give a crap, they just want to sell books.  THIS BOOK IS PATHETIC.  Wherever you are, Mr. Burke and Mr. Snoe, thanks a lot.  40 bucks for this crap.  I just hope I can resell it to somebody who didn't read this review.
