Compared to Richard Rhodes' "The Making of the Atomic Bomb," Walker's book adds little to the story. The author focuses almost entirely on the training, flight crew and opertional aspects of the Hiroshima bombing, sensationalized with vignettes of the few remaining Japanese survivors he was able to interview. In my opinion, he adds little new information and useful perspectives to the literature about this historic world-changing event. MGEN Leslie Groves comes across as the major personality with little focus on the fascinating interplay between Groves, Oppenheimer and other key players, both scientific and political. Rhodes account of the "Target Committee" and the political decision-making process leading to use of the bombs is barely mentioned. I consider this a very poor first book for someone who wants to learn the history and backround to the development of the atomic bomb and the agonizing political and moral decisions that led to its use against the Japanese.
