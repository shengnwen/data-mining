How does an 8 page article become a 127 page book?  By the most annoying padding ever attempted in a single book.  

The author wanted to sell a book, but had no material.  He never talked to Tiger or Haney.  He used photos from a driving range.  What does he do to fill the pages?  Mention how many majors Tiger has won-at least every chapter.  Tell the reader he was once an editor at Golf Magazine- 15 times.  Plug every book on golf he's ever written. Write a chapter on the grip.  Say it is important- quote everyone who said the grip is important.  Talk about Hogan.  Tell about his book.  Mention Nicklaus.  Never write 6 words when 80 will do.  Here is an example- He doesn't write "Tiger won the 2005 British Open."  Instead he wrote, (this is an actual quote!): "On Sunday, July 17, 2005, Tiger Woods raised his already great game to an even higher level to win the coveted claret jug that is given to the winner of what Americans call the British Open and golf aficianados overseas refer to as the Open Championship. On that beautiful Scottish evening at St. Andrews, the home of golf, Tiger was also crowned the 'champion golfer of the year' as he was given the gold medal presented to all champions."  

There is more, but I don't want you to throw up
