I was very disappointed in this book. It's not quite sure what it's supposed to be, and so, ends up being nothing. There are endless lists of workout routines that Bruce Lee supposedly used. But, they usually have little or no explanation, so are useless. There is no, repeat no, nutritional info that you can't find in a free booklet in any supermarket. There are weight training guidelines for rank beginners, but nothing that hasn't been done better by weight training or martial arts magazines.
There are many personal pictures of Bruce, and many apparently shot on his movie sets. But, they are not captioned, so we have no idea what's going on in the photos.
The only people who will get anything out of this book will be those trapped on an island where Bruce Lee is worshipped by a cult who has nothing else to read. It's a shame that the memory of Bruce Lee is being expoited in this hollow, useless way
