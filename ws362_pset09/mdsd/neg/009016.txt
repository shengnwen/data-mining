This is an excellent book(with CD) ,through the media's eyes.There is no scientific ,logical evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald shot the President.Yet,the media captures the staged-event and the hoopla connected with it. (-My theory-) Nixon never forgave the Irish Catholics for the tragic ,senseless murder of his childhood brother ,Arthur Nixon.Nor forgiving of Kennedy for the alledged voter-fraud of the 1960 race.Johnson divided the democratic vote and Nixon reaped the unified Republican consenses.So-called "witnesses" add to the myth, that all the shots came exclusively from the book-depository warehouse building.There is no mentioning of Charles Harrelson,the most credible shooter.There are Christian Masons,as well as Jewish B'nai B'rth ones.So what about the Masonic connection to Dealy Plaza?And no mentioning of the Nixon Cuban Miami goons,calling off a possible Miami assassination attempt.Nor a mentioning of George Sr. assigning landmark status to a Dallas grand hotel ,that day.If you think Oswald was the lone shooter,don't believe the hype.Investigate.One star for the pictures,and none for reporting the truth
