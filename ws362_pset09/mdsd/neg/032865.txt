I read this book as it was a suggestion from my book group. I adore vanilla. Most likely more than the average person. However, the author of this book REALLY REALLY REALLY loves vanilla. More than I think it humanly possible. Patricia Rain's pacing is terrible, she opens the book with a list of incorrect facts in an effort to "trick" the reader and then show off her smarts. I think the person who would buy this book already knows such basics as "vanilla beans are green, not brown when they are growing" so her trickery just comes off odd. If you really want a book that is badly written, but tells you everything you could possibly ever need or want to know about vanilla, then this is the book for you! If you're looking for an interesting read about the cultural history of a spice, I'd skip this one
