I'm not sure what Thomas Ryan, in Prayer of Heart and Body, is saying about whether the Cross and Resurrection of Jesus Christ are necessary for our salvation.  The internal logic of his statements seems to contradict a Christian theology:

1) On page 22, apparently from his own voice and his own conviction, he states, "Most of us don't realize this Spirit within because we are living in a fallen, illusory state of sin."  

2) Later, on page 33, he says, also apparently in his own voice, "There is no getting around the fact that Christianity is a religion for those who are aware that there is a deep wound, a fissure of sin that strikes down to the very heart of our being.  It is a spiritual path for those who have tasted the sickness that is present in the inmost human heart estranged from God by guilt, suspicion and self-seeking.  If that sickness is an illusion, then there is no need for the cross, the church, and the sacraments."

3) On page 113, in his conclusion for Part I of the book, he seems to take the position that the Cross is not necessary when he states, "There are many different ways of meditating taught in the religions of the world.  But if one wishes to go deep, it is important to choose one's path and be faithful to it. Many Christians have found it necessary until recently to seek life-giving disciplines for their journey from teachers in other faiths because they did not find them in their life in the church.  As I have tried to expose in these pages, Christian faith offers its own [here non-Christian readers might infer "superfluous and unnecessary"] deep well of contemplative experience and counsel.  We are blessed to live in an age where the full richness of it is being recovered and widely shared [but just what richness that may be is impossible to say, since Ryan implies there is apparently no life in the church without the meditation styles of Eastern non-Christian religions]."

Another problem I see with Ryan's teaching is his obvious emphasis on technique in this book.  The Catholic Church warns against the reliance on techniques, per se, in Christian meditation: 
From Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on Some Aspects of Christian Meditation, by Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, October 15, 1989:
"23. Without doubt, a Christian needs certain periods of retreat into solitude to be recollected and, in God's presence, rediscover his path.  Nevertheless, given his character as a creature, and as a creature who knows that only in grace is he secure, his method of getting closer to God is not based on any technique in the strict sense of the word.  That would contradict the spirit of childhood called for by the Gospel.  Genuine Christian mysticism has nothing to do with technique:  it is always a gift of God, and the one who benefits from it know himself to be unworthy."
One last note of caution from the same document just quoted above:
"28. Some physical exercises automatically produce a feeling of quiet and relaxation, pleasing sensations, perhaps even phenomena of light and of warmth, which resemble spiritual well-being.  To take such feelings for the authentic consolations of the Holy Spirit would be a totally erroneous way of conceiving the spiritual life.  Giving them a symbolic significance typical of the mystical experience, when the moral condition of the person concerned does not correspond to such an experience, would represent a kind of mental schizophrenia which could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations."  My own and my family's indescribably painful experience bears out the truth of this warning. ________________________________________________________________________

The Catechism of the Catholic Church has a large section on prayer, highly recommended by Carmelite Fr. Thomas Dubay.
