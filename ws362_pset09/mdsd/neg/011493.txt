I'm sorry - generally I'm a fan of business stories, but this one really missed the mark.  In attempting to bring a sense of realism to his characters, it seems he focused too much on story plot and character development and not enough on the mechanics of politics and providing real examples of how to deal with it from all levels.  I want "take back to my desk" application.  This book fell short
