As "Everyman" opens, the main character has already passed away.  From here, the plot moves back and forth in time to see how his life has come to this point.  This includes three unsuccessful marriages and strained relationships with offspring.  Ultimately, "Everyman" concerns how quickly life can pass us by- how death can come and people can be ill even when they feel they should be young and healthy.  And that's just not fair.

Quote: "My God, he thought, the man I once was!  The life that surrounded me!  The force that was mine!  No "otherness" to be felt anywhere!  Once upon a time I was a full human being."

I honestly cannot figure out what it is with folks and this book.  I did not find it to be interesting, nor the characters compelling.  Although I realize that the point could be made that in titling his work "Everyman" Roth is insinuating that the main character is actually representative of any man (who might not be a good man at all), I cannot find this convincing considering that I am unsure of whether the average man early has passionate affairs with European models thirty some odd years their junior . .  . maybe they do.  The virtue of this book is in its look at how an average man reflects on his life and death, but this man is not "average" enough for that to be pulled off here
