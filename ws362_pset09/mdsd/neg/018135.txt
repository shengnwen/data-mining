My wife got me Outside Fitness for Christmas knowing I enjoy the magazine and am working on getting back into shape.
What she didn't realize is that I have actually been getting more and more disapointed in Outside magazine. Quality is slipping as they are trying to compete with various new "mens"magazines none of which appeal to me.
Well Outside Fitness is severely lacking too. It was a nice idea and could have been great. Also, this book like a previous reviewer has already said, could definitely use some heavy editing.
Be nice if it were like the old Outside magazine - Be nicer if Outside Magazine were like its old self
