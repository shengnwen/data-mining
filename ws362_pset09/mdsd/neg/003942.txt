Each epidsode in this stitched-together book is so flat and tepid that the book as a whole doesn't even really manage to be episodic.  The reason this book is famous is because it was the first to deal openly with gayness.  Nowadays, you can watch TV and see questions about famous gay people and events on game shows, for crying out loud.  This book is so dated, it's not even funny.  And none of the characters come alive, including the narrator.  If you want to read a good book about this same sort of milieu, check out Hubert Selby Jr.'s &quot;Last Exit To Brooklyn&quot;.  If you're gay and you're desparate to find traces of gayness in the media, I suppose &quot;City of Night&quot; will satisfy you for a day or two
