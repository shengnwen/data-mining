The works of Dan L. Thrapp which in any way deal with the Apache Indians are highly annoying to me. Of course, the non-critical reader and the casual reader of books on the Apache or on frontier history in gerneral may no doubt go through Thrapp's titles and actually think that they've gotten a superbly accurate amount of information about these Indians from a very capable author on the subject. Unfortunately for them, this is far from true because Thrapp is expert at using historic fact to camouflage what I see as his highly baised views of these Indians. Let me explain.

Unless the reader is already aware of a significant amount of detail concerning the Apache in gerneral AND individual Indians of this tribe, they simply won't pick up on what I would call Thrapp's infantile adoration, his seemingly "I-wanna-be-an-Apache" love affair with these Indians and several of their old leaders (which he relentlessly attempts to glorify through Politically Correct maneuvers of "writing in" or exagerating their personality traits and the qualities of their leadership, warfare skills, etc.

To the reader who has a good deal of knowledge about the Apache of frontier times, Thrapp's enthralled, school girl-like fixation with their various leaders almost oozes from the pages of his books. EVERY APACHE LEADER OF THE FRONTIER PERIOD(with the exception of one) was, if Thrapp's writings are to be believed, something of a superhuman individual with superior mental capabilities and ultra high-toned morals and ethics - Tragic Heroes of the Southwest who were victimized by memebers of Thrapp's own race.

Well, after reading Thrapp's "Conquest of Apacheria", "Juh, An Incredible Indian", and "Victorio and the Mimbres Apaches", I became so sick of this childish, Politically Correct type of distortion, that I decided to come on here and write a few reviews. In each review, I'll use JUST ONE example out of many I could draw upon to show the potential purchaser of Thrapp's books just what sort of "bargain basement" work of scholarship they're going to buy!

Please recall that I just mentioned that I consider Thrapp to be in love with old Apache leaders with the exception of one. This crush-like adoration Thrapp exhibits extends to Cochise, Mangas Colordas, Victorio, Juh, etc. BUT NOT TO GERONIMO. To Thrapp, Geronimo seems barely worthy of mention in terms of the Apache leadership. Also, Thrapp seems to desire to leave his readers with the view that Geronimo was grossly inferior in every way to all other Apache leaders. 

I quote now from Thrapp's forward to "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey" by Eve Ball:

 "A goodly share of this important book concerns Juh, the ablest of the militant Apaches after Victorio, although his fame was mainly among his own people, while for his enemies it lay submerged beneath the flood of reports, and ballyhoo, surrounding his subordinate, Geronimo, in every way a lesser man."

Here is another quote taken from Thrapp's "Juh, An Incredible Indian":

 "With [Juh's death], the power of the Apaches to make massive war virtually died, for his successor, Geronimo, never became more than a minor guerrilla chieftain."

It is a matter of FACT that the Apaches NEVER had the capability to "make massive war" against Europeans in their entire tribal history. I could be gererous here and say that Thrapp's idea of what "massive war" might mean could be different from my own and that he is entitled to his opinion, but as an author dealing with historic FACT (not opinion) in detail, Thrapp SHOULD be able to comprehend the obvious! But by wording his comment about the leadership of the Nedhnis shifting from Juh to Geronimo, Thrapp once again reveals his desire to distort FACT in order to paint certain individual Apaches in a favorable light (or unfavorable, in the case of Geronimo) ACCORDING TO THRAPP'S OWN TASTE, NOT ACCORDING TO ACTUAL FACT! 

I offer the following quotes by APACHE INDIANS who knew ALL the leaders of their tribe as a firm rebuke to Thrapp's slanted view of the FACTS concerning Apache leaders. These quotes come from statements given (person-to-person) by Apaches to Eve Ball, author of "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey". I ask that you read them and then consider Thrapp's assessment of Geronimo (which is firmly based upon Thrapp's bizarre dislike for Geronimo and not upon any concrete FACTS). By reading the following quotes,you'll see how APACHES (not Thrapp's fantasies) hold the memory of Geronimo in terms of just how important this individual Indian was to his tribe. 

"It took a man to lead the Chiricahua. Geronimo was of middle age, a well-known fighter and a superb leader, and he was also a Medicine Man. No White Eyes seem to understand the importance of that in controlling Apaches."
Daklugie (son of Juh)
page 101
"Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"

"Even in [Geronimo's] delerium, he talked of those seventeen men who had eluded five thousand men of the army of the United States for many years; and eluded not only them, but also twenty-five hundred Mexican soldiers - seventy-five hundred men, well armed, well trained, and well equipped against seventeen whom they regarded as naked savages. The odds were only five hundred to one against Geronimo, but they still could not whip him nor could they capture him."
Daklugie (son of Juh)
page 101
"Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"

"We talked it over. Geronimo was shrewed and cautious. Also he had great Power, much greater Power than I. As you know, Geronimo could foresee what would happen. I relied upon that and upon his habitual caution to keep us out of trouble."
Daklugie (son of Juh)
page 173
"Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"

"Death is not new to me. I had seen hundreds of people die. But Geronimo's death hurt me as had those of my mother, father [Juh], and brothers. As I sat beside my uncle [Geromino] I thought that he would never speak to me again and that the Apaches were losing the best they had. *Even though he [Geronimo} was old he had more influence than any since Cochise."
Daklugie (son of Juh)
page 181
"Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"

"Although Geronimo had never brought attention to it, all Apaches, including the scouts, believed that his Medicine gave him great Power, and they were awed by it."
Kanseah (young warrior with Geronimo)
"Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"

"...but of all living men I respected Geronimo. He was the embodiment of the Apache spirit, of the fighting Chiricahua."
Daklugie (son of Juh)
page 134
"Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"

"He [Geronimo] had never been one, but he weilded more authority than did any chief."
Daklugie (son of Juh)
page 181
"Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"

"We stood guard over his [Geronimo's] grave every night for months. Not one of his warriors, including Eyelash, failed to volunteer to take his turn guarding that grave. Many who had never been with him on the warpath joined in the lonely vigil. There were so many that we usually had at least two every night."
Daklugie (son of Juh)

"Indeh, An Apache Odyssey"

So, Ladies and Gentlemen, there you have several quotes from Apache Indians about Geronimo, specifically from Daklugie - THE YOUNGEST SON OF JUH, chief of the Nedhnis, and a chief himself. Now do you see what I mean about Dan L. Thrapp superimposing his own TASTES on historic FACTS in order to color the final opinion of the reader? Geronimo, a "lesser man" who was nothing more in the Apache scheme of things than a "minor guerrilla chieftain"! That is Thrapp's great tallent - distortion through camouflaging his TASTES and BIASES under and around actual historic facts. 

If Thrapp could deliberately mislead the reader about Geronimo, what and who else could Thrapp also offer a severely distorted view about? 

With this in mind, I advise you that if you want to learn about the Apaches from accounts provided BY APACHES, read "Indeh, An Apache Odyssey" by Eve Ball. 

Equally, if you want to learn about European dealings with Apaches from frontier people, read; "Life Among the Apaches", "Three Years Among The Comanches", and "Nine Years Among The Indians", all available right here at amazon.com

Forget about Apache wanna-be, Dan L. Thrapp and his slanted work concerning the Apache, their leaders, and their wars. True, Thrapp can swamp the reader in minute details concerning all sorts of incidents in Apache history and the conflicts and campains within these incidents in the 1880's, but gushing up from beneath this swamp of details always come Thrapp's crush-like fixations to distort and color according to Thrapp's own tastes, likes, and dislikes.
As for me, when I want to read about historic events, I want plain facts, not fantasy or someone's OPINION slathered over facts, and as far as I'm concerned, this describes ALL of Thrapp's works which I have read to date. He was not present during any of the events he writes about, and therefore he has little to nothing important to say about them. Other sources containing actual accounts from people of those times stand as true monuments of historic record. Read those, reject Thrapp's!
