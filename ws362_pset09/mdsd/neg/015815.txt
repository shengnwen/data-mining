A disclaimer: I did not complete this book.  Got about halfway and lost interest.  This book is both boring and trite, and frankly doesn't shed much light on why the conferacy continues to facinate so may people in my opinion.  In this case you can actually judge the book by its cover - the ugly guy on the cover is a good indication of what you will read in this book - a sordid story.
