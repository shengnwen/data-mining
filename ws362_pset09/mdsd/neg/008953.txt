I was given a First Edition of this book by a friend who knows that I practice Vodou and Rootwork. It is a fascinating story, but sadly the author focuses on "wild orgies" and "blood drinking negros". It was written in the 30s and does indeed reflect the "taste" of this period as well as the prejudice attitude towards Voodoo and Vodou in that time.
