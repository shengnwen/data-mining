This book is horrible!  It is  uninsightful and utterly pointless.  The first 200 pages build an advertisement riddled case for healthy diet and exercise that leaves you less than conviced that John Gray has any idea what he is writing about.  Maybe there is a reason the U.S. has outlawed some of the treatments that are espoused with giving Mr. Gray his "insight" into what our bodies need?  The scientific data was never openly stated, but shrouded in mysterious, sensational statements such as "the same diet plan may cause a woman to gain weight and a man to lose weight."  This book left me wondering if John Gray actually believes this stuff or whether he is just trying to fulfill a book contract with his publisher.

I hope that this review does not dissuade you from ever purchasing a book by John Gray.  If you have never read "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" then I highly recommend that you purchase it and refer to it often.  It is a truly amazing and well written insight into the minds of men and women.  Check it out and leave this diet book on the shelf for someone else
