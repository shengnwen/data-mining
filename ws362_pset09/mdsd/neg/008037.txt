`"I'm of course aware that some believe that Herta von Walther played the Dietrich role in the Garbo film Die freudlose Gasse, "The Joyless Street",' so writes Diana McLellan.

Despite the author's claim that Marlene was in Pabst 's "The Joyless Street," there is absolutely no evidence that any actress other than Herta von Walther played the part of the woman in the butcher line. 

McLellan certainly has no proof that Marlene played the part. Therefore any thing she says about her in that role is opinionated speculations. 

There is, however, much evidence that Herta von Walther was in that role. 


Marlene and Herta did appear together in one film in 1923, Tragï¿½die der Liebe.

There is no evidence that Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich ever appeared in any films together. 

The fact is that Herta made four films with the director of The Joyless street between the years 1925 and 1928. The four are Joyless Street, Secrets of a Soul, Love of Jeanne Ney, Abwege. 

There is no record of director Georg Wilhelm Pabst having ever made any films with Marlene Dietrich
