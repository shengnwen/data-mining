not by a long shot.

this was given to me by one of my qigong students; one who hopes to become a master. this was my reply to him:

i read the first 31 pages, and it was clear that the book was not going to make a dramatic turn for the better any time soon. i won't be finishing deepak chopra.


the only thing i can conclude from what i read is that you just haven't been exposed to any serious spiritual teaching. his writing style and explanations border on comedy to me. i can see how they might touch someone who's never read anything of that nature before, but even then i would expect a critical person to sooner reject spirituality altogether rather than persue it after reading something like this. his words are empty rhetoric and his concepts are borrowed from true teachings and then stripped of their substance.

this book holds no credibility for me. and in my opinion, one could only "follow" what he says. he presents nothing to be considered. nothing to be understood. just gross generalizations, false causal relationships, and superficial advice.

i think his book is an insult to the philosophies and religions that he skimmed in order to write it
