I'm sure once you wade through all of his unsupported statistics, you'll find some useful advice from Mr. Lawhon, but I'm completely turned off by his assertions of 75% of this and 25% of that, for which he has no documentation.  If only I still owned the book (I was reimbursed for it by my employer), I would go back through it with a pen and redline all the useless crap.  After reading Book One, I feel discouraged, which is perhaps what the author wanted--to discourage anyone who wasn't wholeheartedly committed to selling.  (I started to write "110% committed," but then I would be guilty of misusing percentages in much the same manner as Mr. Lawhon.
