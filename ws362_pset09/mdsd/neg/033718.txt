i bought the book to make this incredible guitar birdhouse. when i gathered all the stuff and went to copy the pattern part was missing. i contacted sunset ,thye cant help me because that one was outsourced and not available, i was told it was left out intentionally to make me use my imagination/it was not a simple piece. it was the part where the keys and strings attach.i think i wasted my money. it was for a charity.
