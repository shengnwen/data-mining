Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.
