This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  Its title deceives us.  We expect to see things like "kittens are cuddly," or "mothers love us."  Instead we read "snow is white," and "rain is wet."  We are led to believe there is something important in "whiteness" and "wetness," but these are merely descriptions of the world about us.  In giving such bland descriptions, the author attempts to derive values from facts, in effect deadening our senses to what should be depicted for children as a wonderful world.  The fact of the matter is, there's nothing important about this book at all.  Discard it!
