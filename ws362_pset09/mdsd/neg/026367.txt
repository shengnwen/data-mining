I will admit, I may not be suitable to write a review: I only read half the book.  By that point, I had my fill of short, dark stories that were not about dogs at all, they only used them as a plot device.  In fact, in many of these stories, being a plot device is a far less terrible fate.  Dogs are shot, trapped, beaten and drowned.  How anyone who truly loves dogs could read this is beyond me
