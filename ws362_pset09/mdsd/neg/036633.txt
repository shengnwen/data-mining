Nietzsche was destined to be cursed by the vapidity and foolishness of those closest to him: first his sister, and next his translator, Walter Kaufmann, who singlehandedly stifled all creative and thoughtful work on Nietzsche in English for much of the twentieth century, when it would seem to have been just getting started. Not only were his translations one-dimensional, not only was his view of Nietzsche fairly warped and condescending; but he spent most of his time not translating Neitzsche or doing thoughtful work in the community but rather destroying the careers of others by publishing nasty reviews which, due to his iron grip on the american philosophical societies, made it fairly impossible to publish on nietzsche if one hadn't earned his prior approval by kissing up. He was, in short, the very portrait of the arrogant know-it-all professor. To see this, one only has to look to his translations of Nietzsche, where he comments derisively on the works of others; chides Nietzsche for his views on women, his poetic capability, and his philosophical outlooks; and refers more to his own footnotes than the text in question. It becomes quickly apparent that W. Kaufmann sees himself as vastly more important than Nietzsche; even his biographical note at the end of the texts is almost twice as long as Nietzsche's!

Here he is no different; his view of Nietzsche is perhaps slightly more developed than some, but is not outstanding in any way. Besides, this is less about Nietzsche than about Kaufmann anyhow. The "Kaufmann freeze" has broken, and other people are publishing about Nietzche; it may be hard to find good books about him, but rest assured that this isn't one of them. Briefly: forget about this one, and also avoid any of Mr. Kaufmann's translations. Try Hollingdale, who isn't much better in the translation department, but at least doesn't detract from the text through arrogant footnotes
