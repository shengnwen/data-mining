Five-Element Constitutional Acupuncture, as the authors clearly state in their introduction, is a synthesis of several influences including five element acupuncture and TCM. This well organized book thoughtfully presents their work.

Professor J.R. Worsley, with whom they studied early in their careers, was widely recognized as a living master of Classical Five-Element Acupuncture.  Although the authors accurately present portions of what Professor Worsley taught, these are intermingled with such fundamental departures that Five Element Constitutional Acupuncture cannot be considered a clear transmission of the lineage  he learned, practiced, and taught.

Rather than attempting to improve upon the system, Professor Worsley gained his level of mastery by practicing and teaching it exactly as he was taught by his own masters and theirs before them. Doing so requires developing one's awareness and senses to an extraordinary level. Patterns of behavior, body types, facial expressions, constitutional and mental characteristics presented by the authors as corresponding to each element are generalizations which exist only in one's mind. They have no application whatsoever to practicing Classical Five-Element Acupuncture with actual patients. 

In short, Five Element Constitutional Acupuncture presents the authors own theories and synthesis of five element acupuncture with TCM principles. Professor J.R. Worsley's own books presently serve as the clearest, most accurate guide for those interested in following in this late Master's footsteps.
