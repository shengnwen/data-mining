This is a moral relativist/post-modern/revisionist and (therefore necessarily) stridently anti-Christian tome. So undoubtably, some of you will enjoy it.

Ms. Lepore wrote this book primarily to add her singular invective onto the mountain of slanderous and false accusations already accumulated about the people who settled and built this country. (And I thought post-modernist were supposed to be nonjudgmental?)

A sample of the revisionist history Ms. Lepore regales us with is her assertion that torture (of the most hideous and unspeakable nature, well described in this book), practiced by the Indians against English settlers in King Phillips War, was really just as an expression of cultural norms in the Indian "community" and therefore not "wrong" in any absolute sense. Nevertheless Ms. Lepore is in high dudgeon when she describes one occasion when white settlers set fire to an Indian village and slaughtered women and children fleeing the flames. 

Actually, the main value I obtained from this book was seeing in "vivid color", so-to-speak, just how bloody the Indian warfare really was. I'm no advocate of massacre, or genocide, but when you read this book it doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure out why "the white man" became so determined to exterminate the Indian. If one day you find yourself enjoying a pipe by the family hearth, with your family all around, and the next you find your home and barn burned to the ground, as well as the raped and mutilated remains of your loved ones scattered about the countryside, I think you might "evolve" some passionate feelings too.
