This is a defective product by the publisher, otherwise it would rec a 5 of 5 stars.  The publisher repeated pg 145 twice missing pg 147.  Amazon replaced the first order only to receive a second order that was also defective and this is an essential part of the book in interpretating the last four cards.
Until the publisher recalls the entire lot and fixes this I would not recommend purchasing the book
