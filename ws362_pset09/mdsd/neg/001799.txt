I concur with my fellow reviewers that this Casebook contains more typos and grammaticla errors than a first-grader's book-report!!  If your Torts prof is excellent (and mine was) such editorial problems won't keep you from getting a good grade.  But, to be sure, buy the Examples and Explanations by Glannon and a good commercial outline to supplement this POOR casebook!  Finally, I wholeheartedly agree with one of the reviewers who indicated that this casebook is VERY much biased towards the plaintiff's bar and against defendents, businesses, or &quot;the MAN&quot;
