The book tells you that friendships at work are good.  That's it.  The author doesn't address when those friendships over take the workplace and what to do when the workpplace is the only friendships people have.  The author also doesn't address the issue of diversity.  It is large type and double spaced - it is a waste of your money.  If you are a fan of the information from the Gallop Organization, you are going to be very disappointed
