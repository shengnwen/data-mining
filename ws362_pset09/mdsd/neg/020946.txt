I have enjoyed Dr. Helmstetter's various books over the years, and I expected that this book would be every bit as good.  I was very disappointed that there was so much verbiage dedicated to a multi-level marketing skin care company.  I just couldn't get past the thought that every chapter seemed to be a commercial for this company, and that every Arbonne sales associate would be using it as a tool to recruit to their "downline."  

If you have not read other books by Dr. Helmstetter, this may be a good read, but I sadly found it to be redundant and a bit stale.
