This book is not a DM's book. With the exception of a few tatical feats, and some new weapons, this book, with the majority of its pages detailing new prestige classes, is not a book that was meant to ever enter the hands of a DM. I saw one feat in here I liked, and I payed 25 dollars for the privlige to look at it. In short, if your a DM, dont buy the book, if your a character who is big on fighters, go ahead. But be warned, some of the prestige classes are hopelessly stupid. The Eye of Gruumsh is the prime example, its abilities are just wierd, not to mention bad, and although I rarely judge a class by its portrait, I must say that is without question, the ugliest D and D picture I have ever seen. The new base classes are kind of repetitive, like a pretty lame remake of the Samurai. A hint;if your buying the book so you can use that class, don't, buy Oriental Adventures, save money, and end up with a better class. Some things appeal to my PC side though, like the Spellsword, which offers the best spellcaster/fighter mix I've seen in a long time. And then there's the Hulking Hurler, the most uber chea class I have EVER seen. If my PCs ever even try to get me to let them use this class I swear I will write an angry letter to Wizards of the Coast, telling them to stop making classes that can be used to defeat the purpose of arena deuling of even normal D+D. Still the book fails to really deliver anything important, not overly recomended
