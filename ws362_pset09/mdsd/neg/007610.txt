Stealing Time provides a lot of details on the individuals involved in the AOL Time Warner merger, but no business perspective.

AOL overtook CompuServe, Prodigy and other on-line services to become an industry leader with a market capitalization greater than General Motors. Was this due to luck? Or good decisions? Was it because of Steve Case, or in spite of Steve Case? Stealing Time tells us about Steve Case's personality quirks, but it doesn't look at the business context to tell us if he was a flawed genius or a lucky flake.

The AOL Time Warner merger was severely troubled. But was it a brilliant idea killed by bad execution, or a false view of synergy doomed from the start? Stealing Time gives us the personalities and boardroom maneuvers, but no context to know if thie was a tragedy of missed opportunities or simply a comedy of errors. 

So if you are interested in the clash of personalities, Stealing Time has some good material, but if you are interested in why AOL was successful and why AOL Time Warner was not, this book doesn't have anything to say
