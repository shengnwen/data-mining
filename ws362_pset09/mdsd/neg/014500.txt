I am just sitting here reading this book, studying for a huge exam tomorrow morning, and I am just getting so incredibly frustrated with this book and decided that I should let it out on here. Oh my God, there is a mistake on like every friggin page... and to make matters worse, all the mistakes are right smack-dab in the middle of an example problem. So there you are, trying to learn how to work certain problems, and all of a sudden, there's something that just doesnt seem to make any sense. And the whole time you're thinking that you're stupid and you just cant figure out the correct way to do the problem, until a wasted-hour later, you finally realize... "oh, its just ANOTHER stupid mistake these idiots made, and i thought i was retarded." Grrrr, this is killin me.  I cannot freakin believe that they could actually charge $140.00 for a book no one even bothered to proofread. okay, so point of the story is... this book sucks, dont buy it if you can get around it, i'd recommend.
