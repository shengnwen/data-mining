Philosophical musing of hard core materialistic reductionist, incapable of open-mindedness to overcome blindness of shortsighted old-paradigm scientific dogmas, thus incapable to see a revolutionary "big picture", which is offered by cutting-edge scientific discoveries of our days in the fields of quantum physics, epigenetics, neurobiology, neurosociology, social and emotional intelligence, etc., etc., etc.
This book gives no articulated, nor substantiated answer to the question it claims to give, just contributes to mental confusion and emotional illiteracy. Enlightenment is something the author would NEVER enjoy...
Waisted time and money for those readers, who could sense the historical merger of all scientific disciplines and ancient wisdom we are witnessing now.
