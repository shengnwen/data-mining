The fatal flaw of Wilson's idea of the moral sense is that it can be used to justify why people do &quot;bad&quot; just as easily as why people do &quot;good.&quot;  Our innate sense to duty, self control, etc just as  easily describes why Germans so willingly participated in the holocaust as  why we help old ladies cross the street.  In the end the book left me  incredibly empty--even if we have an innate moral sense it has been  selected for so weakly that it becomes generally useless when humanity  needs it the most.  Wilson unforunately couches too much of his argument in  the culture wars of the early 1990s and constructs too many obvious straw  men to make his argument useful in a broader sense
