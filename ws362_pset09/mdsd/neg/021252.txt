I had never read this book as I child but since I knew it was a classic I decided to buy it for my daughter.  I never realized that Curious George and his owner smoke pipes and make it look appealing.  I guess this has to do with the fact that this book is very old.  If you dont' mind giving your child the idea that smoking a pipe is acceptable than buy this book for your child.  Mine won't be reading it
