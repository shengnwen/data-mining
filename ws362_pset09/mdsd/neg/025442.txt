In my opinion there are two Iranians.  The Iran represented by the thieves and the scoundrels who supported the Dictator  homosexual Shah of Iran and who took off right after he was disposed of his power by the brave students.   This group held so much power in Iran and stole the wealth of the hard working Iranians. Europe and America was their play ground.  While Iran had so much natural resourced, this barbaric savage group, controlled everything.  The poor  were left uneducated and  their child mortality rate was one of highest in the world.   Shah lived in palaces where toilets and showers were solid Gold. While the majority of Iranian went hungry and destitute.  

The other groups constitute those who supported the revolution (mainly students and intelligentsia) . This group still believe in the dream Khomeini and his Mullahs had for Iran.  But with the US economic embargo against Iran since 1979, it is hard for Iran to achieve its potential.  Of course the youths who never saw how their parents lived under that despot (H.I.M)  think America is their friend. America has never been friend to the Iranians except to those who wanted to hand Iran's recourses on a silver platter or a golden toilet.

What's funny is those who supported Shah are now living as second class citizens in America feeding their worthless children the same propaganda the usa media inflicts daily on its citizenry as showed by the previous reviewer.  I had the misfortune of meeting such people in school, and most of them especially the girls are semi-prostitutes without morals or direction. Now they went the good women of Iran to follow their immoral lifestyle.....No thanks!
