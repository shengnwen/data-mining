Has anyone looking at this book noticed that for the Cancer sign, which, to the best of my knowledge its symbol is a CRAB, that in the book it's a  LOBSTER!   I mean, come on!  Who edited this book?  That just threw me  right off. Maybe it is just the St.Martins Press copy I picked up?  Don't  know. But it certainly hasn't leant any credibility. If this author was  alive today, I am sure she would be livid. Very silly
