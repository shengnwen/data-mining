The final storyline in a string of bad stories from the now cancelled and hopefully forgotten Batman: Gotham Knights monthly series. 
Leiberman commits the crime of meddling with the classic "Killing Joke" to present a confusing, convaluted and outright bad sequel to the bestselling Hush by Jim Lee and Jeff Loeb . The revisions in this story imply that Alan Moore's masterful Killing Joke is erased from continuity to make way for this trash. Add the fact that DC is blatently using Hush in this story as a way to cash in on the superior effort by Lee and Loeb's original, to boost the sagging sales on what had become one of DC's worst monthly books, and the whole afair just leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. 

The artwork by Al Barrineuvo is also nothing special. It is underdone and one can tell he is just starting out in the bussiness and has difficulty illustating the characters consistantly from panel to Panel. The coloring is also muddy and dull.  
Leiberman is a better writer than what is presented here, and hopefully he will move on to better projects (that don't involve Batman)
