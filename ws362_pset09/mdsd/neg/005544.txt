I am writing this primarily to warn people from wasting their time with this book.  I would write an exhaustive explanation of why this book is so bad, but I don't want to waste any more of my own time with this book.  For  an excellent book, read either THE FOUNTAINHEAD by Ayn Rand or ATLAS  SHRUGGED by Ayn Rand.  Actually, read *both* of them
