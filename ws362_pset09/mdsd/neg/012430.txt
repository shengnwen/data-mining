Ronald Alsop's book is pretty much the product of what one would expect from an author with a background as a newspaper journalist. The book reads like a collection of articles on the subject. Corporate reputation-building is, of course, a very important subject these days. So one would benefit from some original thinking and deep analysis on the subject. Not much of that here, however. You could get the level of treatment the book offers from a perusal of newspaper and magazine articles over the past couple of years.

What's amazing is that none of Alsop's sources are disclosed.  There is no bibliography, no footnotes disclosing where often highly specific results of corporate rankings and opinion polls should be backed up with authorities.  What about the question of the reputation of an author, and his publisher, for solid research and scholarship
