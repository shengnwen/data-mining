My husband who is off fighting for the Constitution sent this book to our daughter.  If he had not sent it, I would want a refund.  My daughter and I sat down to read the book together.  She thought the drawings did not match the words and thought the author still did not like the Preamble. (HE makes mention in the begining that he was forced to think about the Constitution). There was no inspiration from this book and she hasn't picked it up again.  The pictures are not exciting to children and only vaguely connect to the words.  She loves the Freedom Rock version of the Preamble and and really enjoys Lynn Chaney's "America A Patriotic Primer", so I understand why he made the purchase, however it is not inspiring or uplifting or interesting
