I found this book really wordy and confusing.  The images are not numbered and do not have full refrenced captions, which makes finding infomation on a particualar image very difficult.  Also, the chapters are in chronological order, yet several images and some information is not in the chapter of the correct time period.  This would be fine if those images from a time period other than what the chapter covers were being compared to images from the time period, but they are not ever that i noticed.
