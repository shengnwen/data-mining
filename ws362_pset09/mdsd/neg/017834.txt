There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.

Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].

Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.

Strike one.

As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].

Strike two.

And I'm sorry... State of Fear?

Strike three.

Michael Crichton, you are out
