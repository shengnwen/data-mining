There is only one reason : Stephen Thornton has spoiled Marion's original masterpiece. If you can get the 2nd edition, which Thornton didn't join yet, just compare it with current one. Except this, I dare to say this book is the best intermediate classical mechanics text book. This was the bible of classical mechanics, but not any more.
