i am disappointed with silver ravenwolf for many reasons (the &quot;teen witch kit&quot; to name a big one). this is one of three books in a series. if you are a very beginner and just learning the general ideas of witchcraft, this book is okay but i would not take it too seriously. there is not enough attention payed to important matters about the spirituality of witchcraft/wicca/paganism and far too much payed to making silly powders to win the lottery. come on now, if these &quot;luck&quot; powders really worked how come we are buying our books used and for the sale prices on amazon:) magick is serious and you need to have a firm foundation and know the basic moral principles before practicing. that is not what you get from this book at all. i bought mine because of the cover art and because i desperately wanted to give silver ravenwolf a chance. it is nothing against her as a person, she is nice for i have met her. i just think that the capitalism has gone to her head and that she is more concerned with making money than magick. it can happen to the best of us, but you do not want to buy a book about spirituality from someone who is &quot;all about the money&quot;. i use it in my coven as a &quot;what NOT to do&quot; book
