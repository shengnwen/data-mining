I was rather dissappointed at the content offered and barely impressed at the book's attempt at teaching new skills.  I bought the book for my 5, 7 and 9 year old children and the 9 year-old had already mastered all of the skills offered, the 7 year-old was bored very quickly and only the 5 year old's attention was held any length of time, but his age group lacks the concetration level to hang on for long.  The content was far too simple and barely progressed through the entire book...this book should be marketed to only highly introverted 4-6 year-olds in my opinion, and then it would get only 3 stars...
