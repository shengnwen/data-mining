This book was a bit typical for my liking. The setting was stereotypical only to be mixed in with bland characters, all told through a horribly punctuated journal of a tenth grader who seems like someone who should still be in middle school. Through this story Jeremy, our lead man, experiences the many things which high schoolers encounter. And what are these things? Why smoking, drinking, partying and sex of course! All told through immature eyes, making this book one which I did not enjoy very much..
