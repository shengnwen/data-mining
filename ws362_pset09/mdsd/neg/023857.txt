I also heard the author speak at the NW bookfest and was looking forward to reading this.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The Mary Kingsley story is the saving grace, the modern woman's story didn't strike me as authentic or interesting and I found myself skimming those sections. Not horrible, but I cannot recommend it
