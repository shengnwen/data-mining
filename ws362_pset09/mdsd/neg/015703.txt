If you are looking for a source in 19th and 20th century history don't bother.  Francine Prose left one thing out.  How did the muse inspire their artist?  This book is packed with too much second hand history, no timeline and no focus on the muse herself.  All I found written; a bunch of petty people with petty little lives with no focus on their art. This is one book that will not live on my bookshelf
