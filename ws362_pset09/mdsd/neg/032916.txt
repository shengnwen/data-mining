Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Drafts 1-38: Toll (Wesleyan, 2001)

I've (ironically) put down a number of drafts of this review, and haven't come up with anything remotely satisfying. There's really not much I have to say about the book; it's overlong (though from what I have been able to gather it's only the first two sections of a larger, as yet unfinished, work), close to unintelligible in places, full of parallel text branching off the main piece with no stage direction as to how a reader is supposed to read said parallel text, and drops out of what poetic mode it has in places and becomes didactic ("Deixis" is the most blatant example of this). All of this leads to a simple "didn't like it much." Nothing else to be said, I guess. *
