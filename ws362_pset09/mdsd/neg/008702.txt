I've read several of Greg Benford's novels, and although this novel tackles some interesting ideas, on the whole it is sketchy, underdeveloped and lacks continuity. This might have been more entertaining if the authors had stuck with one segment and worked through it. The action is nonexsistent, extended over nearly one hundred years and broken up into 20-25 page chapters for each time period. The characters are few, two-dimensional, and unsympathetic. Plotlines are too many and undeveloped, (none of the aliens stick around for more than a few pages, nothing is taken to any kind of a logical conclusion.) Finally, there is a very unsatisfying ending. You might want to try reading "Heart of the comet," which Benford co-wrote with David Brin
