This book reads like something that sat in the author's desk drawer for a few years before he decided to publish it.  The terminology for the submarine, referring to the "King" as the class ship of the Centurian series of US Navy submarines is sort of confusing.  If a ship is the 'class' ship, that is what the series is called, such as the Seawolf class or Dallas class and so on.

Another clue that this manuscript just sat there is a total lack of reference to the 9/11 attacks.  Not one word.  Seems like there would be something there, since one of the stated missions of the submarine is littoral or shallow water combat, according to the book.

All that aside, I was disappointed with the characters, particularly the stupidity of the American sailors when presented with an imposter on their submarine.  I just don't buy the fact that no one notices all the mistakes.  No one notices that a supposedly well trained officer doesn't know anything about American submarines and how they operate.  That asks too much in the suspension of disbelief department.

I won't give away the ending, suffice to say that it was a huge disappointment heaped on top of a pile of others.  Buy this one at your own risk.  If you want thrillers that are accurate, best stick to the authors that do their research, and have actually set foot on board a submarine
