This book was a silly mess.  Karp's pop ethnopediatric approach, which likens toddler development to the evolutionary development of humans, was silly at best and scientifically shoddy at worst.  In addition to the problems with his guiding analogy, his notion of "speaking toddlerese" and thus supposedly showing our young children that we understand their feelings is ridiculous.  Maybe it's just my kid, but I don't think many young children are that in touch with the feelings which we are supposed to mirror back to them.  In addition, my child doesn't care if I understand her or not if (as another reviewer remarked) the answer is still no.  I think understanding child development is very important in helping parents to contextualize and deal with various behaviors, but this book is a failure in both of these respects.
