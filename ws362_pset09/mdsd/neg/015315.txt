I was expecting this collection to be as funny and engaging as Nobody's Perfect.  While the collection does have some highlights, notably Woody Allen and Steve Martin, a good bit of the book is more enjoyable as a historical observation on highbrow humor throughout the great magazine's long run.  One of the fun parts about the book is trying to figure out when each piece was written, as you're reading it.  That's one of the FUN parts.  Hoo Hoo Hoo
