I got about one-third of the way through this book, and then just couldn't  continue.  This is without a doubt the worst science book I've ever (tried  to) read.  Edelman goes out of his way to use unnecessarily long, ponderous  phrases to describe simple concepts.  This is presumably meant to impress  you, but personally it makes me wonder what the author is trying to hide.   How about this: that his ideas are neither new, nor original, nor correct
