I wasn't sure if this was from a S. King writing or some child night mare of a writing! 

It's obvious that any one can write then have that book published. 

Only the most outrageous of imagination could come with this fairy tale type of fantasia.

Sorry, but the author is searching for the truth in the wrong place! you Know?
