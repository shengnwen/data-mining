Other reviews give a good sense of the concretes of this book, so I'll just mention what struck me as the fundamentals:  the characters (and I do mean all of them) are pathetic: thieves and murderers; the setting is a dark, pointless future containing not a single real person with a real life; and the plot feels like a confusing tumble down a well.  Although Gibson is intelligent and quite creative, he seems to enjoy creating difficult, jargony prose (muddying the waters so that they appear deep?).  If this is one of the best in the cyberpunk genre, then the genre is not for me
