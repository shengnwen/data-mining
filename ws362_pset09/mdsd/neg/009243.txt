I am not a web developer, I have bought several other aws related scripts and I always have been able to implement them on my websites. I bought this book in hope of getting more control over display of products on my website.

Some interesting exercises at the end of chapter, but no hints or working examples.

There is no after sales support for assistance with customization of the examples. Usually autors create their forums where users can help each other, but we don't even have a forum for this book.

Lots of information , it might be a good book for an expert Web Developer.

I will be returning this book.
