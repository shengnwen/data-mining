If your intent is to be a scholar of Shakespeare, you may enjoy this book.  However, if you enjoy the literature attributed to Mr. Shakespeare, spend your valuable time reading "his" works.

I was seduced into buying this book by a review that painted a rather incomplete picture of the true nature of the contents.  I have struggled thru 3 chapters of pedantry, as this group of scholars argue over minutiae like the context and validity of the phrase "precious instance". ("Nature is fine in love and where 'tis fine It sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves")

Go to the library, read from a few chapters and then make your decision on whether to buy this book or "As You Like It"
