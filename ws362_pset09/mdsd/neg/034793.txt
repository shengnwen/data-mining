This book was really hard for me to get into. If you are like me and read a little and then dont pick a book up again for another few days, this one is too confusing. Just when you get to know a list of characters, the book starts a whole new story that is within the current story with all new characters.  Also I felt there was just too much useless side information that was just filler. I am really busy and dont have much time to read so I want to be entertained (plus I have a horrible attention span). 

If you are the type of person who will read a book from start to finish without stopping this might be for you. But otherwise this is just too much info and too many characters
