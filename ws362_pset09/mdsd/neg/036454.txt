As John Waters wrote in his first book, "Shock Value," 'there's GOOD bad taste...and there's BAD bad taste.' Author Jimmy McDonough may have been wise to consider this before choosing to write an entire book about exploitation flick bottom-feeder Andy Milligan. 

Not that a decent book can't be written about a bad filmmaker. Rudolph Grey's bio on Ed Wood is a pretty entertaining, informative read, after all. But, as presented by the author, Milligan's world of pervs, pederasts and theater rejects becomes more ho-hum than hair-raising. We're supposed to be shocked (I think) by the depravity of these people. Instead, just as in any Milligan film, the characters are too void of life to be very interesting.

Almost worse, as this book grinds on, it almost feels as if McDonough has lost sight of the fact that Andy Milligan made really, really, REALLY bad movies. Unlike the best films of, say, Herschell Gordon Lewis, there's no spark, no wit, no fun of any sort in a Milligan flick. Milligan's defenders will use words such as "gritty" and "merciless" to describe his work, thus placing it on a higher shelf than it deserves. Well, his films may indeed be gritty, but does that really excuse the fact that they're also unwatchable? And if they're so 'merciless,' does that make it okay that they're mercilessly boring too?

The long and short of it is that if Andy Milligan had any talent at all, he sure didn't show it in any of his movies. McDonough, in writing this book, seems to have gotten too close to his subject to see this. And in the author's hands, the story of Andy Milligan and his band of misfits just never catches fire. "The Ghastly One" might be a little better than an actual Milligan movie, but that's not exactly high praise.
