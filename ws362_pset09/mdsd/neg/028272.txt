Uhhh, puh-lease. Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away. I had to read this book for school. It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog. They lose the dog. They are sad. They can't figure out who took the dog. The dog comes back. Whoop-dee-doo. End. Ya see? I could have written this book better. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!! EVER!!
