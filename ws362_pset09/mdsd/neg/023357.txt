The illustrations are spectacular in Special Cases, and many of the anecdotes are vividly written.  But the author also omits much of the subject matter's historical and scientific context, leaving the  &quot;special cases&quot; looking more like simple freaks.  As well, this  book is poorly organized and poorly edited, so that by the end I was  completely frustrated with Ms. Purcell
