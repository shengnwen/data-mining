I know I read this book and I remember raving about it to preety much everyone I met 2 years ago.  For the life of me I cannot remember what the book was ABOUT.  That is the feeling you will get when you read this book kinda like Chinesse food, a great feeling and something you want to tell your friends about but ultimity forgetable
