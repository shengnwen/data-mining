It can only be a good thing that this book provides positive support for women who suddenly find themselves in a marriage that is not what they thought. After all, spousal compatability is the most important aspect of a lasting marriage. It does seem remarkable to me, though, that in 30 years of "mostly happy" marriage, the author never realised her husband was gay. Surely the marriage's general long-term happiness should have the author questioning her own status, vis-a-vis the whole gay issue? Different personality types and their relative compatibility are usually issues that are sorted out in the pre-marriage courting stage, or at least in the early stages of marriage. For it to take 30 "mostly happy" years for the author to realise her objections to her husband's gaiety indicates the likelihood that she had actually changed over time. It's natural for some people to become more melancholic and morose as they get older, but it seems a bit unreasonable to be taking it out on your spouse
