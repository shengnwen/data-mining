If you take the time to write a biography of a person, isn't it part of one's research to interview their wife? Donya Fiorentino was married to or lived with David Fincher for 5 years and gave him a daughter. When they met, he was directing Pepsi commercials, and when they split up, he was an auteur. For some reason, Sharon Waxman made no effort to interview or contact Donya, and dismisses her in two sentences as an alcoholic and drug addict. In fact, Donya has been sober for 6 years, is a brilliant and creative photographer who has an edgy side to the Fincher story that has never been told. I know the truth; as Donya's physician I have heard her compelling story. Waxman also does not mention that after their divorce, she married Gary Oldman. This was written with my patient's permission, who was very hurt by this book's publication
