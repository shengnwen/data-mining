This is a very clever book, as far as I could make out, but very overrated. There were a few good, suspenseful scenes, but the military action was awfully repetitious. Perhaps the action is accurate and realistic, and it could potentially make an exciting movie, but it does not make good reading. 
The basic premise, that the Soviet Union starts World War III in order to get oil, was ironic, given that President Bush has repeatedly been accused of attacking Iraq for the same reason. In both cases, I found the reasoning unconvincing. 
Clancy's writing is pretty odinary, and often sloppy. I was particularly annoyed by the continual use of unexplained acronyms - I tried looking them up some of them in a book containing thousands of acronyms and could only find about half of them - and the military jargon was similarly confusing. Sometimes he would use a term extensively and then 30 pages later he'd explain what it meant. I suppose it would be all right for someone with more military background than I have, but a lot of the time I had no idea what was going on. I was also put off by the continual change of scene - I counted 17 scene changes in one chapter, and there are 43 chapters. 
The military strategy and tactics are fascinating, but the plot of the novel is pretty basic. The characterisation is virtually non-existent - most of the characters sound the same. 
This is the first Tom Clancy book I have read, and it makes me wonder how he manages to out-sell so many superior writers
