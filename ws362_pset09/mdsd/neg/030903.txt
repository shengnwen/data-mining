I am disappointed to have bought this book.  More judgmental than analytical, the author clearly has an agenda and presents many one-sided arguments in support of it, resulting in numerous rhetorical fouls (e.g. completely ignoring the important distinction between statistical correlation and causation) in addition to complete dismissal of basic economic tenets.

The statistics presented are quite unidimensional and are given with opinion frequently presented as fact.  After conventional attacks on the very real problems of CEO salary levels and increasing gaps between our nation's very rich and very poor, the book takes a turn for the surreal.  To whit, while questioning salary differentiation between different types of medical specialists: "While we allow ourselves to be entranced by the mysteries of medicine, none of us really knows whether orthopedic surgery is any more complicated than overhauling a transmission.  We know that police officers deliver babies with no ill effects, and on at least one occasion, a submarine corpsman has performed a successful appendectomy.  Much of medicine now depends on high-tech equipment, which most of us wouldn't know how to plug in.  As it happens, doctors are just as baffled by it."

The author offers this passage and many like it without trace of irony, satire, or devil's advocacy.  If you are the type to argue that we will run out of a natural commodity in XX years by linearly projecting today's consumption rate into the future while ignoring the impact of increasing scarcity on prices and economic viability of substitutions (and therefore decreased demand levels and consumption rates), then this book is for you
