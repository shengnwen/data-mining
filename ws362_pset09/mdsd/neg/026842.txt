I ordered this book after reading an excerpt from it somewhere else on-line.  I was interested in what she had to say about other women who were struggling with the work vs. family dilemma, as well as those who weren't "perfect PTA moms" who were perpetually happy.

I think perhaps the reason I found the book unsatisfying is that she tackles too many subjects in the book -- looking at women's life choices beginning in their twenties and going to retirement and beyond.  In many cases, she would introduce a subject whom she had interviewed, and a few pages later, would move on to someone else.  I found myself wanting MORE.  

I also felt that, though the book is only 6 years old, it already feels dated.  She speaks about women who choose to be single parents as being in the vanguard of a new generation.  I think this may be less true nowadays, especially in the upper middle class world she describes.  She also talks about the 'betrayal' women feel who delay childbearing and then find out, too late, that they've left it for too long.  This also seems to be a nonissue these days, since the 'donor eggs' which she speaks about as a last resort, are perhaps more accepted these days as well.  

That said, I would probably recommend this book to a younger woman, such as one in her twenties, just because it helps break down the idea that women's choices are black and white (work vs. family, marriage vs. career).  She shows that many people have many different paths, careers and even marriages in their lifetimes and that nothing is absolute.
