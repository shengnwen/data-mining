The first books by John Ringo were gripping tales of interstellar war and invasion, liberally laced with what he himself calls carnography. By the time his third book was published though, he seems to have learned the all too common skill of filling pages without providing any content.

"The Hero" tries to tell the story of a military special operations team a thousand years in the future. All the characters are totally forgettable, and indeed the authors proceeds to kill most of them off quickly enough. The story consists of the teams travails slogging around a hostile countryside playing Blind Man's Bluff, while some of the members try to kill each other. The situations are arbitrary and meaningless. The authors introduce strange fauna, and then mostly ignore them except when convenient. The equipment carried by the soldiers is shockingly primitive for a culture with a millennium of uninterrupted technical civilization.

The only minor points of interest are that Ringo finally includes the English pronunciation of his Bane Sidhe (for those who hadn't figured it out), we learn a little (very little) about the Aldenata, and there is confirmation that the Posleen were bioengineered, like that's a surprise
