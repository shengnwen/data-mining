Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.  

This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror
