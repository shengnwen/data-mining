They both made a decent amount of money playing Magic, then went on to make even more money gambling.  Finkel is From New Jersey, Williams from Texas.  I was not aware of any connection between the two of them in terms of being on the same team or similar.  Eric Froelich, to my knowledge, was a friend of Finkel's and was a very young winner of a WSOP bracelet, and I believe got a slight mention  in the book.

The author is clearly trying to force a connectin between two things that have enough in common that people automatically assume more than the author says.  The story isn't that compelling, and Finkel's attitude towards Magic these days is decidedly poor.  There is no reason to glorify him at all
