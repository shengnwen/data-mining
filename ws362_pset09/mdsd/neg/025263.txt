As someone who is currently single and trying to become a mother, this is not a book I would recommend.  I was looking for something a bit more practical and this read more like someone's thesis.  Also, I didn't identify with many of the women profiled.  Their reasons or the reasons given for choosing this path just didn't ring true for me.

The one part of the book I enjoyed was hearing the different stories about how the women explained the "fathers" to the children.  That was very helpful since I've been struggling with the story that I will tell
