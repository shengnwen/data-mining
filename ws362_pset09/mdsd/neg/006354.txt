  I have always been fascinated with the Middle East and usually devour every intellectually honest book I can find on the topic. But I have my doubts about this one. (Granted I have not read it yet but let me explain why I say that.) 
  I have only recently heard of this woman. I happened to be listening to right-wing talk show host Glenn Beck as he was interviewing her and came away disappointed. I was hoping for someone with intellectual honesty but didn't find it. She said that the Moslem extremists hate us because we are free. Frankly I find that to be nonsense. If you listen to what they say they hate us because we have supported dictatorships in their land and are incredibly one-sided in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. They never say they hate our freedoms.
  Her story was also rather bizarre. She said she was told to hate Jews as she was growing up and then one of her relatives--or maybe it was her father--had to be taken to an Israeli hospital and was treated very well.
Suddenly, overnight, she became a pro-Israeli Zionist! (Say what?) That made no sense to me at all. Ok, I could see her learning to see the Israeli's as decent human beings. But for her to become a Zionist? Oh please! The Zionists want her people kicked off the land! Surely she is not that stupid.
  Plus I see that the people who wrote endorsements for the book are all hard-core right-wingers--Horowitz, Santorum, etc.  (That is never a good sign.) So I would suggest that people take this book with a grain of salt. I fear that there wiil be a lot of right-wing propaganda in it
