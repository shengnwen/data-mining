I'm giving up on this book.  It reads like a first draft.  Sentences like the following on page 71 abound: "When you hear not so often as you wish, remember, our silence means our safety," the Committee of Secret Correspondence  - now doing business as the Committee for Foreign Affairs, although Franklin, who had never mastered the original name, was not to know for months - soothed the envoys, whom they understood to be starved for news.
     Schiff needed a good editor but didn't get one.  This certainly isn't Pulitzer grade material.  I wonder if the publisher rushed this book into print in time for the 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth.
     Van Doren in his biography gives a better account of Franklin's years in Paris.
