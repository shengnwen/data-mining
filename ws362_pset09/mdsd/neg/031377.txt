I can't even describe how disappointed I was by this book. I love Michaels' other books - I own them all, but this was a disaster. It didn't even appear to have been edited - throughout the second story, the name of one character is constantly switching between Harry and Henry, sometimes on the same page. Overall, it was not chilling or witty like her other books. The writing seemed flat, which surprised me since all of her other books are wonderful reads
