I ran across this book at a local library and it picqued my interest.  Tipler's theory of immortality, in a nutshell, is the following: 1) the planet earth...and all its living creatures are doomed as the sun will engulf the earth in ~1 billion years. 2) Man will make self-learning and self-replicating machines (can Windows XP do that?) that will colonize, over millions of years, our galaxay and, eventually, the entire universe. 3) These machines will be capable of individual thoughts, emotions, etc and are essentially "alive." 4) As the universe begins to collapse, the machines will be able to manipulate this collapse and prevent total destruction of the universe. 5) All the knowledge possessed by these machines will eventually coalesce into one "super being" at the center of the collapsing universe...this super being is the "omega point." 6) The omega point, via its "all knowledge of all things" will be able make emulations (exact duplicates) of all biospheres, including earth.  Within these emulations, individual humans (you and me!) will be emulated.  Thus we will again be "alive" as these "beings" in these emulations will be unable to tell if they're real or virtual....PRESTO...immortality for all.  The book (theory) reeks of circular logic and assumptions.  It's an interesting theory, but it's just that, an interesting theory by a theoretical physicist.  PS: Tipler denies the resurection of Christ and in  the last chapter admits to being an aetheist.  (I wonder if he's a God-fearing aetheist?
