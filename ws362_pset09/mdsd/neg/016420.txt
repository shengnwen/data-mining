I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset. 

The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring.
It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible. 

The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful!
Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money!
