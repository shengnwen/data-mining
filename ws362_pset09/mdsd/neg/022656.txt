Somewhat dull and unsatisfying, like some other "literary" works I've read which don't hole my interest, don't resolve problems, swimming endlessly in the inner thoughts of a person with no action or only references to previous actions. I enjoyed his 'They Came Like Swallows' because it was very satisfying, but this is too "literary" for me in the sense that it appears to be more about the writer's writing ability than the actual story.
