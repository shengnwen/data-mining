I am not sure how this book got such great reviews. It really misleaded and dissapointed me. It is for a woman with significant resources to start with, who doesn't need all the dry tips listed, but not for stay-at-home Mom. And it is a business oriented, not life oriented. It is not 'A Mom's guide to working from home', but a business women's guide to get more organized and hire multiple services for the business developement. There is nothing absolutely about Mom's life and for Mom's life. It is a big text however and probably can be useful for someone, but mostly dry and a reference-like, big doesn't mean good. Gives an advise how to choose an office chair, a domain name, purchase a web-site design, organize a radio appearance, etc., and some tips that you know from a common sense. It is a self-promotional book leading to the author's web site to promote her coaching business. I returned it. May be it can work for someone else..
