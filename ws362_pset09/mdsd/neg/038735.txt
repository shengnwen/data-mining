Despite its title, this book is not an in depth study of the battle at the Hot Gates. It is instead an overview of the Greco-Persian Wars as a whole -- starting pre-Marathon and ending post-Plataea. The action at Thermopylae is given but a few scant chapters. As much if not more space is accorded Artemisium and Salamis. You?ll learn less about Leonidas than about Themistocles. Perhaps the concentration on the Athenian fleet is not really surprising given that the author is a former navy man. However, one must wonder why then Bradford titled the book &quot;Thermopylae&quot;.
 
 But even as primer on the Wars, this book is a disappointment. It lacks both the political and tactical scope one finds in Peter Green?s far superior &quot;Greco-Persian Wars&quot;. It is a pleasantly readable work to be sure and might make a decent introductory piece for a novice looking to aquaint himself with the period. For the rest of us, this book is well-trodden ground, adding no new insights.
 
 Go for Green. Read this as an afterthought.
