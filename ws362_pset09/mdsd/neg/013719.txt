This rather disparate and dis-appointing collection of essay.  The author's main contention is to demonstate that there is no Islam only islams... the demonstration is done by asseration rather than argument.  The author seems to think that an opaque writing style will compensate for the analytical rigour the book so clearly lacks. Thus we have a strange brew- an attempted deconstruction of Islamism in the name of an essentialized universalism.  Critique of Islamism for its essentialism becomes nothing more than a rhetorical act rather a theoritical position
