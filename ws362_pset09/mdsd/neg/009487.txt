Disappointing.  I was expecting an Audubon-style reference book, but got a simpler, very brief, nothing new, thin, magazine-sized tickler.  I've heard good things about Stokes, but this book wasn't a winner.  Was looking for more details about plantlife, positioning of shrubs, feeders, bird baths, landscaping etc, but book consisted more of bios on birds with a little bird-feeding info. at the beginning of the book.  Save your money and go elsewhere. :-
