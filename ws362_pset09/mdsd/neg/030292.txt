After hearing rave reviews from friends, I expected to be "wow'ed" by this book. And while Dylan's use of language is poetic and painterly in many instances, the vast majority of this manuscript consists of name-dropping, ramblings about superficial details, and elaborate multi-page descriptions of only mildly interesting activities. I mean, was that section about album production in New Orleans EVER going to end? And when it DID, did we actually KNOW any more about the man than what we could have learned in a few paragraphs?

I'm a singer/songwriter, a product of the folk era and a huge fan of Dylan's music. It was exciting to learn how well-read he is and how deep was his study of music genres and geniuses. Beyond that, I was left wanting. And often confused.

If you're expecting to learn about Dylan's heyday in the '60s from this book, better wait for the sequel, 'cause you won't find more than a paragraph here and there in the entire 293 pages.

Sorry, Bob. I still love your music, but next time, hire an editor
