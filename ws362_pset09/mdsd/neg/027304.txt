Now this books title is MISLEADING. It should be called "HOW I GOT BRAINWASHED INTO BEING A VEGAN"! Very little of this book has to do with women's health. It advice you to not to eat oil, fish, milk and meat, basing their "science" on statements, NOT FACTS! Very often source is not given or the logic is faulty. For example, at some point in the book you can find a statement like: your morning egg carries salmonella because chickens peck at each other because they are in cages. 
BEWARE of this GARBAGE. What a waste of paper!!
