This edition is not really what it says. Carcassi's original method was published as Opus 59. There are three parts - the first takes you through the  major keys C, G, D, A, E, F and minor keys Am, Em, Dm. The second part starts with slurs and trills, introduces higher positions, and rounds out some of the other keys. Part III, ***which is missing*** are 50 graded etudes. These  are NOT the 25 Etudes of Opus 60. The omitted etudes of Opus 59 are very charming and do a lot to prepare you for Opus 60. The Carl Fischer edition (the orange one) has the 50 etudes
