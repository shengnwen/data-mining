I give the first part of the story a 4 and a zero to the second - in fact, I didn't even finish the book - I simply didn't care what happened to them or the treasure. I enjoyed the first two characters -- Eve and Roarke bore me to tears - or at least, Eve does. I don't like female characters who flaunt the fact that they have bigger (you know whats) than the men in her world -- she's turning Roarke into a whimp! I've read 75% of Robert's books, but I think I'm through with Roberts/Robb - she's done her story formula to death
