Losing weight is NOT as simple as Mr. Critser seems to believe, and his obvious disdain for the obese only takes away from his basic premise.  Although he goes to great lengths to show scientific studies and historic references, the underlying attitude of "obesity is the same as laziness and the culture is just promoting it" is apparent in the language.  Trust me, making someone feel bad about their weight is the worst way to make them get thin--or at least stay thin.  How about, instead of trying to shame people back into thinness (an impossible task, as it turns out), we try to shame McDonald's and Krispy Kreme into being more concerned for their consumers' welfare?  A better book on the subject would be Robert Pool's Fat: Fighting the Obesity Epidemic.  It contains many more conversations with doctors and scientists as well as people who have gained or lost a large amount of weight, putting a much better spotlight on science versus personal disgust
