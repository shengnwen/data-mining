I found this book to be a total waste of money.  Sure it has a few interesting pieces of information, but nothing I haven't heard before.  This book may be useful if you have never had any experience with children.  If you have been around children at all, you will find everything in this book to be pure common sense.  I was looking for something with more concrete usable information
