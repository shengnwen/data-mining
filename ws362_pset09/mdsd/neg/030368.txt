P.J.Lynch's vivid illustrations are gorgeous.  Without them, however, left on its own, the story flounders. Although fairy tales often make use of repetition, this narrative is much too redundant.  You meet, for example, seven characters, and each one repeats the same long, tedious text. To make it worse, the sentence structure is routine and dull. Too many sentences begin with "So", "Then", "Well", or "But".  When we do read it, I can't wait for it to finally reach its drawn-out ending.
