I am a studant of gardnerian wicca and I like when elders says: "keep wicca traditional".
this is a book of recipes, another one book of a ecletic, self-initiated "wicca" (or witch, or reclaiming, whatever).
Is poor in poetry and in rituals. I only take 5% useful from all this pages. I consider this book the same fluffy wicca started by Scott Cunningham.
For youngs who want start in practice of wicca, very well, but only for start as curious and a dedicant, this can't show you what wicca really is.
It is a joke to sincere seekers, is an outrage to elders
