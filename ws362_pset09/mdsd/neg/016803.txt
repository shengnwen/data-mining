I couldn't get past the first 20 pages.  I flipped through the rest and the same pompous writing style persisted.  The author writes in eloquent words and sentences that make me want to fall asleep.  His flowerly language and verbosity is a sign of a poor writer who wants to seem talented.  Total waste of time and money.  Amazon, could I have a refund
