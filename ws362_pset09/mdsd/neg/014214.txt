This is a critique of federal case by scholars and attorneys NOT scientists. They come at the case from a religious viewpoint whether they all admit it or not.  James Watson who along with Francis Crick won the Nobel Prize in  1958, for their DNA  work. And Watson graduated from the University of Chicago at 19 and nabbed his doctorate at 22, whereas the authors of this book have NO PhD's. Watson also noted on a recent Charlie Rose Show on PBS that he only knew of one true scientist,  Francis Collins, who believed in a God. Yet on CSPAN during the week end of August 26-27 the authors of this book say they know 600.  Whom does one believe?  A Nobel Laureate with a PhD and respect within the scientific community, or authors who have neither?

The authors also make a big point of saying they disagreed with the parents/complantants in the federal case, because the authors didn't see ID as a religious belief and that ID doesn't require a belief in a religious 'God'.  But they fail in my opinion, by not realizing that it was indeed the intent by the Judge and many others, that the filers of the case did believe that ID was a God issue and that they wanted this taught. The Judge even noted this in his decision, which cannot be overlooked.  Had the authors or their Discovery Institute (discovery dot org) filed the case they probably would have found the Judge more open at least to their arguments.

Should you read the book?  Yes, simply because I believe in being informed about what all sides of an issue believe or push.  Do I think the Judge made the right decision? Yes, based on what the complainants put forth in their case.
