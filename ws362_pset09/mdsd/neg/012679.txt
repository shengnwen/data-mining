This book is written by a Wiccan who tries to incorporate the Orishas into the Wiccan mindset. It is poorly written and not worth the paper it is printed on! It might be "a gem" if you come from a Wiccan background and want to follow the latest trend, but it is useless for every sincer practitioner of the ATRs
