Endless collection of the same photograph, same pose, and same lighting showing little imagination.  On the positive side, probably makes a good reference book if you want to take your own photographs.  The black and white format adds nothing and they should have been shot in color.  Add 1.5 stars if you enjoy pictures of nude women and don't really care about the photograph
