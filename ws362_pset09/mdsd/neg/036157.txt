The book covers a LOT of topics but it assumes too much.  Even on Chapter 1 the author discusses topics that I didnt know about.  Name of the book is &quot;Network Tutorial&quot;; bad name.  I would call it Networks Unleashed.  It also seems a bit outdated to me, the latest edition was released in Jan/2003, yet there is too much talk about Windows 3.1, OS/2 and NT.  Linux and XP are rarely mentioned.  I dont recommend it, its good but not worth the price tag
