I do not understand why certain critics who are acquaintances of Mr. Lambert's have described this as an affectionate book about actress Natalie Wood. It is not a sympathetic portrait of Miss Wood' in fact, Mr. Lambert blames her for the tragic events in her life when she's not alive to defend herself. He also goes out of his way to attack her mother and her sister in what seems to be a personal vendetta while at the same time falsely glorifying rv actor Robert Wagner, who he admits is a long time friend of his. There would be no need to remember Miss Wood in a book at this time had she not drowned under suspicious circumstances that Mr. Wagner obviously wishes to conceal. It is clear that Mr. Lambert's true loyalty is to Robert Wagner, not to Natalie Wood
