The author arrives at the incorrect answer to the question he approaches.  Darwinian evolution is impossible without death.  Thus, to allow that some single-celled organism evolved into people (an absurd conclusion, but beside the point of this review) depends on the acceptance of millions of millions of deaths before humans showed up.  
However, we know from the Bible that death was a direct result of humankind's rebellion against God.  This is a basic tenet of Christian belief.  As such, it would be impossible for death to lead to the existence of humans.  Therefore, there is no way darwinian evolution and Christian belief can coexist
