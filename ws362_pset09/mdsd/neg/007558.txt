There are more than 4000 books that have been written on Abraham Lincoln. I own about 100 and have read 200. Why Lincoln Matter's by Mario Cuomo should have been entitled: Why I Don't Matter. It is hard to find much about Lincoln in the book. There is much about how America has failed to measure up.
