I guess I was expecting a Japanese, day before Pearl Harbor, Gorky Park. It wasn't. The problem with this book is that it did not hold my attention. I went back and reread more pages than in any book other than Michael Crichton's. In fact when I finished it I really could not tell you what it was about beyond ... the day before Pearl Harbor.

Buy it if you have insomnia
