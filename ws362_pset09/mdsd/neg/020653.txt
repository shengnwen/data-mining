You must bear in mind when this book was written and if you are researching the development of self-help books then it will no doubt interest you. 
However if you are looking of anything to inspire you, then perhaps your money would be better spent on many other titles on Amazon's shelves. 
The style and format of this book renders it almost unreadable to the normal reader. It repeats the same lines and thoughts ad infinitum and is full of the most out of date pseudo-scientific clap trap that you will ever come across. 
Statements made earlier in the book take on the status of "facts" in later chapters. It seems that if Charles thinks of it, then it is true, because he was successful. If you count, conning people into investing in Eucalyptus tree plantations for furniture manufacture and vineyards that don't produce enough grapes, as success, then that is your decision.
There was for me a certain entertainment in reading this old Snake Oil salesman's tilt at established religion which earned the banning of his book by the Church. No doubt this was the reason for many of the books sales.
Again if you think it will improve your life - don't bother
