Elmore Leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  He has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  What many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, Leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  As such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  However, 'Be Cool' is not one of his best.

The concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  And not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  Chili Palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  As always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  However, when reading 'Be Cool' I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  Many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  Also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  Leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  The reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  I'd always recommend Elmore Leonard as a quick, enjoyable, "beach" read.  However, go with something else of his instead of 'Be Cool.
