The first Nora Roberts novel I read was Northern Lights, and I was pleasantly surprised by the strong sense of locale, interesting and believable characters, and a well-crafted and exciting plot.  Angels Fall sounded like it would follow in the same genre, but it is more a gushy romance novel than a thriller.  This time the hick town location is cliched and dull, as are the characters (especially the heroine).  I started this book on a ten-hour plane trip, and put it down after a couple hours.  A month later I'm still only half way through it; in the last ten chapters not much has happened.
