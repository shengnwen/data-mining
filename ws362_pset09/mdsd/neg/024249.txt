When I ordered Mr Dubal revised "The Art of Piano" I have high expectation  - his second edition is my "piano bible" and I have all his book. So my dissapointment was very big. I have feeling that this is "rushed edition" and Mr Dubal didnt work hard on this revision. Why ?

My big "suprise" was to look back and forward in H when searching for Mrs Angela Hewitt who in my humble opinion is the leading Bach pianist and her complete recording of Sebastian is best avaible. No Hewitt. Also serious book edited in 2004 should notice Piotr Anderszewski activity. Many other pianists that developed major carriers in last decade have very "pale" and not update bio:  Hough, Demidenko Andensen .... Others like Gulda and Zacharias have also small note. I understand that You can't write tottaly objective book and maybe these pianists are not writer favorites but you can't miss their work and progress in last decade !

Why I thing this book is rushed ? Because updates on some major pianists are not visible. For example - Murray Perahia. I found that Mr Dubal didnt notice this wonderful pianist work from 1995. Also, when copying from 2-ed his bad review from Mr Perahia recital, it will be fair to note that the event happened some 10 years ago and maybe is not relevant now. I suppose that Mr Dubal have listened to Perahia recitals/concerts in last decade and I'm sure that He listened to new CD's. No single word about Perahia Bach and wonderful Chopin Etudes. It's also case when speaking about Pollini and others. For example I would like to read about Zimerman new recordings , comparing his Chopin concertos (I personnaly prefer the first version). My dissapointment was great because the writer is real "guru" of piano and his knowledge about piano and pianists is huge and he is wonderful writer.
The book is real treasure for person who have not read 2-nd edition but has little to offer for readers familiar with previous editio
