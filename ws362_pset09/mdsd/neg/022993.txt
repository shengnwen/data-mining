I thought &quot;Priciples of Meat Science&quot; was just okay. But I think  &quot;The Sopranos&quot; is much, much better. Hopefully, this is not the  best that the Lifetime Channel can do. I wish they'd show the reruns of  &quot;Homicide, Life on the Street&quot; again, because I can't watch  &quot;Court TV&quot; (it's against my parole.
