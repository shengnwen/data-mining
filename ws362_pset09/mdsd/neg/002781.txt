If you think a book must be depressing, hopeless, and about unhealthy people who don't really want to change, than this is the choice for you.  It is well-written, but pointless, falling into the genre of fiction about pathetic losers failing to find any glimmer of happiness or meaning or joy or redemption.  
I am not suggesting that fiction must be happy, but this book is just too much about  failure and mean-spirited revenge.  There are no good guys.  The main character watches as his little girl's life is destroyed by his wife, and doesn't stop it!  Or even try to stop it. Angry and Hopeless: and do we need another book about such people?
Sure, there are such people: by why wallow in their misery?
