I had to use this particular book for a class I was taking.    I was hoping for at least a balanced presentation, but I was very disappointed with this book.  I found it to have a definite anti-life view.

I found that the author minimized the role of morality in the field of bioethics.  Especially how religion contributes to moral views and how that effects bioethics.  

I also found that the author tried to present Catholic Church teachings specifically without even a basic understanding of how the Church developed these views
