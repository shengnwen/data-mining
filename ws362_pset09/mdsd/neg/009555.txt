I bought this book based on the back cover which reads: &quot;...Then he offers practical proven steps you can take to change your lifestyle, without relying on medication and psychotherapy.&quot;  I found as I was reading the book, however, that Dr. Hart is a huge proponent of the use of medications.  There are also many absolutes in the book.  He claims that if you don't do certain things or let certain things go too long, you may never get rid of anxiety or worry.  This book is definitely not for everyone
