You have to read through over 250 pages leading up to about 30 pages of what I was looking for in the first place:  action and some suspense.

You could just skip the first couple hundred pages and get right to the real story.  Excellent book for the readers digest version without really missing anything.

Also all the political discussions came across as so phony that it really hurt any sence of reality
