Most reviews give a description of the book, and then rate it according to a number of criteria.  In this case, however, there really isn't much to say, as Quesnal's story is -- at least in comparison to the tales of other bikers -- uninteresting.  Very little is actually revealed about Quesnal's time with the HA, and one gets the sense that Quesnal is more concerned about portraying an innocent facade than he is about telling the truth.  This is a poor choice for anyone, but especially for those trying to learn a little about the so-called biker brotherhood
