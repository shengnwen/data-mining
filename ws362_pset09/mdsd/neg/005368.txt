I have to agree with some other reviews here in that this book was a disappointment. I thought it was going to be a normal-sized book when I ordered it, but it actually took me about 20 minutes to read. Oh sure, it's attractive with lots of cute pictures, but if you're thinking like I was that it was going to give you lots of ideas on how to be a &quot;Hot Mama,&quot; forget it because it just doesn't.  I received no new information, which is what I normally read for, ya know. Although I do agree with the other reviews that say it would make a great baby shower gift - it is a fun little book. But there's really nothing more to say about it except if you really must read it, you could probably get it from the library and save your money
