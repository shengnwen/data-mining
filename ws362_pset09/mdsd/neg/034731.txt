I have always enjoyed Rita Mae Brown's work. That being said, and yes, this  story line does wear abit thin, but the worst, unforgivable sin is that she read the story herself.  It was awful.  Several times she will start a sentence, only to stop and restart after a few words.  There was no feeling of character in her voice. Yoy can hear her swallow and clear her throat, so I guess it's the production values that are the biggest offender
