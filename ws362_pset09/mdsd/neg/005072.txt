I picked up Thanksgiving hoping for a cute fun read for the holidays. Instead I found the plot of this novel rather thin and the humor a bit 'meh.' From the moment where the rabbit was eating our heroine's costume to the scene where the single teen mom drops her baby off with Dr. Pat, I just found it a little too silly. Too implausible even for Evanovich. 

I guess I'm a bit bored of the sterotypical 'single people who cannot cook...' humor. Been there read that. Also the cutsey baby humor and the way the heroine oozes over the baby made me roll my eyes. If I'd known this was one of those baby books I'd never have picked it up. 

I gave up halfway through when the heroine and the doctor conspire to keep the baby for the holidays... I just found I could not maintain any interest.
