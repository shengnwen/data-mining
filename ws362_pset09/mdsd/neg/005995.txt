I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading.  I was so disappointed in this novel.  It did not meet my expectations.  I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly.  The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la "Weekend at Bernie's."  Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one.
