I was forced to painfully read this awful, shocking book for my A-level course. I don't understand what is happening in this 
book, as Angela Carter randomnly goes from one topic to another without any explanation or plot.

Seriously, do not read this unless forced to do so.

It is 232 pages of random anecdotes and stories from a weird and boring life of Dora Chance, who at the end of the story, aged 75, decides to go to bed with her 100 year old uncle. SICK
