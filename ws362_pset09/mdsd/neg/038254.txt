This is one of those books that's so bad you can use it to judge critics -- because if *anybody* says it's well written, or well plotted, or has good characterizations, THEY'RE NUTS.  The fact is, there's NO characterization, the sentence constructions are painful, and at least one major plot point is impossible.  (If you're paying even a minimum of attention, you'll put the book down and go, "HUH?")

This book is good for exactly one thing:  it shows you don't have to spend a lot of time writing a book -- or even be a competent writer -- to have a best seller.  I don't mind mindless escapism -- heck, I'll give Janet Evanovitch two thumbs WAY up -- but when it's a trash heap like this it gives reading a bad name
