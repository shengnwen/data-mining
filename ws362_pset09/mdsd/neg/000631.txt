I am a couple of chapters in and I am trying to like this book but it just isn't that approachable.

Compard to Practical Common Lisp (Same series I assume) there is little to no explanation of example code.

Haskell is supposed to be the more difficult language to master but, every text I have read on Haskell is far more approachable.

I am going to persevere but I think only experienced programmers should attempt to read this.
