I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.

Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.

It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book
