My child has an excellent teacher and is doing very well in piano, but when I showed this "easy piano" book to the teacher, she said it was too hard for now.  Maybe, by the end of the summer.  Maybe, "easy" should be better defined as to what level you would have to be at in order to play this "easy" book
