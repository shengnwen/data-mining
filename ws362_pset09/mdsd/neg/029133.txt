 I don't understand how anyone could give this book a rating anywhere over 2. The average rating for this book is over 4 stars. I checked and THE LORD OF THE RINGS, DUNE, ENDERS GAME and THE GRAPES OF WRATH just to mention a few have the same rating. No way this book should be rated the same as those classics. The things that really bother me about this book and the whole series for that matter.

 1. Accepting the basic premise that there's a blinding flash of light and the laws of nature change causing life to revert back to feudal times. As an American and I don't believe that America would vanish so
completely. Americans love America and they would not let it die. I didn't
understand the author's take on this until I looked up the authors bio. Once I saw that he wasn't an American it made more sense. 
 2. The time line makes no sense. I don't believe in only 9 years that these societies would have evolved so far.
 3. As a combat veteran I find it totally ridiculous that in 9 years you would have warriors so proficient in the use of swords, fighting with bows, with lances on horseback. It is not possible. And the charactor of Astrid. She must be green because she's more deadly then the Hulk. The greatest rider,bow shot, sword fighter and tactician. She's thinks she's a Ranger. I've read the RINGS so many times since I was a kid and the Rangers didn't walk around like Astrid constantly boasting, telling people how good she is how she was going to kill them. She's closer to Boramir. Another blatant theme the bad guys are stupid and always lose despite always having all the advantages. since the good guys always win the book has no suspense. I thought it was boring.
