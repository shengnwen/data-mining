I found no useful information at all in this book. I developed a PCI device driver with DMA capabilities, and hoped that this book could give me some valuable hints on the subject. It did not. Nor did it give any clues on how to handle plug and play or power management. It looks as though the author just put some small WDM driver together, saw that it worked quite good, and then wrote a book about it
