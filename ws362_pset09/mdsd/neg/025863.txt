Being the horror fan that I am....I was quickly drawn to the cover of this book...after I began reading the book....I was scared too death....scared of the story that is....This storyline has been done and I was not even interested in finishing this book, but just to prove myself right I did finish the book only to be completely satisfied that I WAS right and It ended just like every other story like this....Dont even bother and read a real story from a real author like...Neil Gaiman, Dean koontz, etc.  Please pass on by this title.  Later readers!!!
