Maybe I'm jaded but I found most of these stories anything but miraculous.  Perhaps "humdrum" (NO goosebumps). I gave 1 star because it did prompt me to appreciate the many, many similar experiences in my life.  Unless I am some kind of miracle magnet, the point I got from reading this was to appreciate ordinary occurances as "miracles", which is not a bad thing.  It seemed as if these were stories from the Vissells, their family and their friends (most were from similar professions).  I was really hoping for a collection of stories from all corners of the globe, stories that really evoke thoughts of the miraculous and maybe even add to my faith in a benevolent universe.  What I got was more of a self-congratulatory marketing piece
