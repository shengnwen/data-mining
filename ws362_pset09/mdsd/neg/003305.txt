I was very disappointed in this book.  Being a new mother I thought I would be able to relate, enjoy and learn from Harriet Lerner, however all I learned is that I would be better off reading other books.  This entire book is nothing but reference to other authors, Drs, psychologists and more.  I got a strong sense that Ms Lerner does not have an original thought of her own.  Some of the anecdotes she uses about her family are humorous and entertaining but reading this book was more like eavesdropping on the mothers table in my local Starbucks.  ...returns based on whether you liked a book or not, this one would be going back
