I have read many diet books and been on many programs.  For a person who has knowledge of dieting there is nothing new here.  The people cited in this book have lost zero to over 100 pounds.  The book consists of small paragraphs of advice from "dieters"
It has 12 chapters from "Why lose weight" to "Good Stuff That Doesn't Fit Anywhere Else" (in the book).
Some "wisdom" in the book:  Don't buy cookies and candy at the store so you aren't tempted at home. p72  Eat with chopsticks it slows you down. p174  Eat tons of popcorn and skip the butter. p92  No Krispy Kremes under any circumstances. p73.
If you need pearls of wisdom such as these, buy the book
