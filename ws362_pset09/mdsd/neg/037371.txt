When I bought this book, I wasn't exactly sure what the author's viewpoint would be, but expected a fairly rigorous treatment on the history of church & state issues in America.  I thought this might lead to some meaningful conclusions.  To say the least, I was disappointed.  This is a work which is long on rationalizations, but short on rationale.  Meacham largely sidesteps the critical questions and instead wallpapers over them with anecdotes about the support that presidents and other leaders have given to expressions of "public religion".  He seems to build his whole case out of historical inertia rather than a clear-headed and logical analysis of law.  Meacham points demonstrably toward the fact that presidents have consistently expressed their religious beliefs in public, but completely ignores the reality that those are the kind of people who get elected to national office.  Is someone with strong non-theistic leanings likely to become Commander-In-Chief?  Of course not.  It is important to recognize, however, that this is a bias which is built into the political climate, not the Constitution.  Yes, there is a longstanding history of infusing religion into the public sphere, but this hardly supports the author's contention that it would be impractical for things to be any other way.  He only demonstrates the limits of his imagination and vision.  If he offered a strong case for his views, that would be one thing, but he largely obfuscates the most important questions by offering a collection of stories which really doesn't make much of a point.

In the end, if you're looking for tales about the religious perspectives of various presidents, give this book a read.  The content is hardly riveting, but you may find a few points of interest.  If you want an objective analysis and detailed exploration of the issues which divide our nation on the question of separation of church and state, you won't find it here.
