Maybe it was just the recipes I tried first from this book (Orange honey glazed carrots, brocolini and balsamic vinaigrette, mustard roasted potatoes), but her recipes are inundated with salt, to the point that my kids (usually salt lovers) cried out "too much salt" and wouldn't eat them.   I couldn't have misread three recipes by mismeasuring, and I won't try any more items from this book that call for salt.  A major disappointment.  If you are hypertensive, STAY AWAY from this book, it could be dangerous to your health
