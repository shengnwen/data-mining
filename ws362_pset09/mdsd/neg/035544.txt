This book has a few pieces of useful information ... but overall there are many much better books out there about generations and how they differ (e.g., Generation Me, When Generations Collide, Generations). The authors take a spattering of information from other sources (they are not researchers or policy makers themselves), tell a few narratives, and that's about it. You are much better off buying another book on generations. 

Also, notice the publisher: Focus on the Family. Thus the book is written from an explictly stated Christian perspective. For some readers this might be a bonus; others might be put off by this in a book that is not about religion
