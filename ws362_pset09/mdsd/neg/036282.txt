Words cannot describe how ripped off and disappointed I feel about buying this book. 

Having read RDPD and CFQ in the Kiyosaki range previously and finding them great, I thought this book would be great as well. I'm sorry to say it's the worst book I've ever read. The entire book is a blatant sales brochure for all his other books. 

There's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more, you need to buy one of his other books.
I didn't get any useful information and it's certainly not a 'how to' book. I thought I would be reading about him and his wife's story but all I got was the same few points said over and over again. He doesn't even try to say them in a different way.

The other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option. It was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members. 

I could seriously go on and on about why you shouldn't waste your money on this book but I won't.

I have NEVER written a book review on amazon before as I have never felt so strongly about a book. I generally feel if I get even just 1 thing out of reading a book then it was well worth it. In this case I didn't get anything out of it and felt really used and taken advantage of which is why I decided to post this review. 

I hope it saves someone else from wasting their money. Buying this book WILL NOT HELP YOU RETIRE YOUNG OR RETIRE RICH
