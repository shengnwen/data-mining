I don't know what book those other reviewers read, but I was put this on the shelf in 5 minutes.  Much is written in Greek.  I tried keeping up with a Greek Interlinear Bible on the computer, but still couldn't make sense of it.  The author assumes you can understand Greek.  If you're not a Greek scholar, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.  Major disappointment
