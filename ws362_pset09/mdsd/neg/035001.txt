This is a wonderfully researched book and well written as you'd expect from Mr. Owen, and I enjoyed reading it. But wondered if I was the only one who thought it was ruined by the obsessive desire to defend Cliff Roberts,  even on matters that really seem pointless. So I came here to read reviews  and I couldn't help but notice that many of the glowing reviews here on  Amazon appeared to be written by the same person, but I was glad to see  some agreed with me about the format of the book. I suppose it's a must for  the pictures if you want to see the course the way it once was, but I  recommend avoiding it if you get irritated with a book that has an agenda  and seems to go out of its way to not just tell the story, but to address  issues that someone wanted addressed
