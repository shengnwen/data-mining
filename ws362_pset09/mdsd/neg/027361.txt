The person who wrote this cookbook obviously likes everything fatty and unsweetened. I found this cookbook useful only if I changed just about all the recipes by reducing the fat content by half, and doubling the amount of sugar.

My daughter didn't know this and baked some cookies using the original recipe in the book. They were disgusting! They weren't at all sweet and extremely fatty. Yuck!

I use the corn bread recipe all the time, it's excellent if you know what needs to be changed. Do not add any butter at all (the recipe tells you to add 2 tablespoons), and add 3/4 cup of sugar (the recipe tells you to use only 1 tablespoon).
