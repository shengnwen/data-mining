I've had a number of upper level courses.  This (and part B) may be good for undergrads taking an advanced course but not for grad school.  There are a number of errors and important subjects are glossed over or not covered at all.  The best part of either of these books are the questions at the end of the chapters.  There are lots and lots of questions.  If you need it for a class, I'm sorry, if you're looking for a comprehensive advanced organic textbook, get the latest edition of March's book
