I found this book dissappointing.  It gives readers misinformation that can make symptoms of NLD worse, not better.  For example, the author encourages the readers to allow video/computer play stating it "builds eye-hand coordination".  Not only will this NOT develop eye-hand (that comes from anticipating a three dimensional object coming to you in space and manipulating the hands to accurately receive it" but fixation on computers often leads away from motor development and soical interaction.  We don't need more misinformatoin about NLD
