This would probably be a great book to read if you are in the habit of reading a few pages here and there and easily forget what is going on.  To read it a few chapters at a time is almost torture.  This book could have easily have been 50 pages if we weren't reminded every paragraph that Sasha is 9 years older than Liam and he is a wacky artist and his family pushed him away and he can't be controlled and she is so very successful...blah, blah, blah.  Historically, I have really enjoyed Danielle Steele's books but this is one to skip
