I had to read this book for a class in Legal Ethics given by Professor Dershowitz (Dersh) at Harvard Law School. I threw it in the trash when I was done, and for good reason. The topic is interesting, but tired. How do you defend a guilty man? You don't. Unfortunately, Dersh (and, to be fair, many others also) does. The focus of the book is on the ostensibly proper division of a defense attorney between two personas: that of a person and that of an attorney. Dersh feels that a defense attorney leaves behind his personal ethical standards and morals when he takes a case and goes to the edge of the envelope in legal ethics to successfully defend his client. I don't think such a person has a personal morality. If it can be subjected to a second persona, it isn't morality. The worst part of the book is its writing. It is poorly written, poorly developed, and has a completely unbelievable &quot;happy&quot; ending. Dersh had to cater to his feminist viewpoints in the ending and that's unfortunate because it denies his central character (himself) the pain of truly feeling the results of his own amorality
