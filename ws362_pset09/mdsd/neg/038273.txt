Although I admire Howard Raiffa's book Smart Choices, this book doesn't appeal me at all. I felt his approach to negotiation too theoretical and extremely difficult to apply to real life issues. As one of the other  reviewers states correctly, the book is rather for students of negotiation.  I do much more prefer Getting to Yes, which sets an easy framework for  approaching negoatiation
