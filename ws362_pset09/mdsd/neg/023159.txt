If I could give this book 0 stars, I would.  This "mother" should be ashamed of herself.  So she didn't like being pregnant, so what.  I saw her interviewed on a televisions how and she was saying how she hated being pregnant because she couldn't go out anymore and got fat and that "soon after" giving birth she started going out again to try to get her old life back.  News flash, you'll never have your old life back, you're a mother now.  Why have a baby (even if it was an accident) if you're just going to keep going out and get a nanny to watch the baby?  How about talking about the joys your new baby has brought you?  Has your new baby brought you no joy?  What's the point of scaring other first time moms with your nonsense about how horrible it was being pregnant, but giving no real reasons why other than you got fat.  WAH WAH WAH!  If you didn't want to get pregnant, you should have kept your pants on!  She's a disgrace
