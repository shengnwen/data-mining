Prior to reading this book, I read reviews which proclaimed this book as being  &quot;A Masterpiece.&quot; I will say that the topic of the book is SAD and Depressing and my heart goes out to anyone that has experienced what the author has written. I felt so depressed chapter after chapter. The book seemed to be getting worse the deeper I read and I was unable to complete the last 3 chapters without a good, strong, stiff drink.....And I don't even drink
