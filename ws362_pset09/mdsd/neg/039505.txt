The author has used an inherently intriguing aspect of the field of linguistics -- the oxymoron -- and has written an awful book about it.  While the examples are all fine (though some do not technically belong), it it the author's own writing in betwixt the quotes that is unbearable.  I expect better prose from my 5th grader.  Not worth the time
