I am not a horror genre fan, but picked up the book when it looked like a good old-fashioned cheesy "mummy" story.  I admit it,  give me a story about a mummy or Egypt, and I'll often read it even if only for the chuckle value.  This book was so disappointing, that I did not even finish it.  The multiple plot lines vary from "fairly interesting" to unsettlingly sadistic and I found no reason to follow the stories through, even just to see if "it all comes together in the end"
