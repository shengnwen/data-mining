This book is a waste of time. It's heavily padded with material not directly relevant to film studies. The first chapter, "film as art," is a general history of aesthetics, so general as to be virtually useless, and not directly related to film. The second chapter on the technology of film is better; it goes into the physical equipment, cameras and so on, used for film. The third chapter on "the language of film: signs and syntax" should be the heart of the book, but it's poorly written and confusing. Oftentimes, the writer introduces technical terms without giving examples. Chapter four, "film history": can you imagine the history of world cinema in one chapter? It's a jumble of names and titles. The fifth chapter on "film theory" is adequate but no more. The 6th chapter is padding, a discussion of other media such as print and TV. The 7th chapter on "the digital revolution" is more padding. No glossary of film terms is included. There are better alternatives available. See for example FILM ART: AN INTRODUCTION by Bordwell and Thompson
