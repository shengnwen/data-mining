I bought this by mistake-thought I was buying book of same title by Lolly Winston...what a disappointment. These 20-something novels are something else...boo hoo hoo...life isn't perfect, but wait-then suddenly it is! Give me a break...I know it is fiction but don't readers want some real life in their books anymore??
Maybe not...that might require thinking..
