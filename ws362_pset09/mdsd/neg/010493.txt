Patrick Smith knows a lot about Japan, having lived there for several years and being a journalist specializing in the country. He knows more than I do, to say the least. It is therefore surprising that he should produce a report so reactionary and misleading, and attempt to support so many disparate theses with such poor or virtually non-existent arguments. (And even more surprising to me that it won an award)
