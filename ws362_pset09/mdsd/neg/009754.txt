I read this book looking for an intelligent take on the innate sexuality of the Muslim woman. But I found it to be shallow and crude at best. This book has been touted as an example of sexual awakening but the character of Driss, who supposedly liberates this character of her inhibitions, is hardly a liberator but rather another blatant stereotype of a subjugating male. The main character's pathetic attempts to mold herself into a creature worthy of this perverse male's fantasies is pitiful at best and downright offensive at worst. The writing was poor, the storyline flimsy. If anything the "story" was little more than a few words strung together to connect one sexual encounter with another. There is a lot of beautiful sexuality in the Arab and Muslim culture but this book made it tawdry. To think that people will read this book and consider this to be a window into the culture is disturbing. This book isn't even erotic and I would dispose of it in the appropriate receptacle fitting such trash. Or better yet, don't even waste your money.
