I have recently moved to Ecuador and thought this book might give me a better understanding of what is going on here.  There is plenty of information in this book--but it is completely garbled!  I have read many political science books, and this is the most disorganized, badly written, unedited one I have ever tried to get through.  There are outright misktakes, frequent repetitions, poor translations, and no clear storyline, chronological or otherwise. Could someone please write a better book about Ecuadorean politics? It should be a fascinating subject.
