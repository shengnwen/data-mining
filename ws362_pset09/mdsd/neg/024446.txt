I was really impressed with the professional reviews Indecision received.  They must have been written by friends of the author, because this is, quite simply, a bad book.  Witticisms are sprinkled throughout, but nearly always feel preplanned, and stand out from a silly plot and premise.  If you find my review lacking, it is because reading Indecision has made me dumber
