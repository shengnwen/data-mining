This man is another example of our over-affluent society's attempt to distract itself from existential angst via the myth that we should all be happy and feel good. Deepak Chopra has grown very rich catering to the alienation of misguided Marin County yuppies. Sleep is important, as is taking care of our bodies and minds, but do we need a smarmy swami to tell us this? Basic common sense (drink a lot of water...) is sugar-coated in pseudo-spiritual jargon, insulting the intelligence of anyone other than self-help-junkies and cult-bait. Can't sleep? Use the 17 bucks to buy a real book, and read it in bed. Or buy a vibrator
