ing clothes....think of the Butlerian strategy of it all! 

Are they undoing gender? Wow! And on pennies a day, too! 

Think of the androgynous gay boy who might wear the same clothes as his bestest girlfriend. Think of the subversiveness of it all! 

Consider the fact that maybe the slave woman in Honduras made those clothes! 

How Butlerian, indeed!
