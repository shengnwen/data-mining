This book gave a pretty good synopsis of Charlotte Mason's methods.  I guess if you just want some quick ideas on how to get started it will give you what you're looking for.  However, I believe everything she says can be found in For the Children's Sake, by Susan Schaeffer McCauley (in a section in the latter half of the book... no need to read all of the book before you start.  You can just flip to the section that summarizes Mason's methods).  And McCauley also has a wealth of other information on Charlotte Mason's philosophy and methods.  So I'd say, save your money and buy McCauley's book - you'll be getting two for the price of one, so to speak
