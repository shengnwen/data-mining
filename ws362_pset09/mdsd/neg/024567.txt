  Over the years I have had an avid interest in the paranormal.  I have read books by numerous authors, and looked forward to this book being one of the best.  I found however a book that seemed to wander as though lost,and the author was searching for a direction to go with it but never quite found it.  I have taken my law enforcement training and experience, and coupled it with other books on this subject, and found the scientific methods of investigation to be very similar.  I am afraid that this book,apart from the poor spelling, and composition would be confusing to novice investigators, and would give them erroneous information, on a subject that is complicated to begin with.  I am sure Mr.Taylor means well, but there are much better books out there for the beginner,or the experienced investigator. The later version is no real improvement eithe
