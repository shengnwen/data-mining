As usual, NT Wright has missed the Correct Answer in his quest to shore up the fading structure of Christianity.

In the Publisher's comment: "the early Christians' belief about the afterlife belonged firmly on the Jewish spectrum, while introducing several new mutations and sharper definitions."

In Judaism of the first century, there were many Resurrection cults.  The Pharisees believed in angels, demonic spirits and resurrection of the dead.  

Again:  "How do we explain these phenomena? The early Christians' answer was that Jesus had indeed been bodily raised from the dead. No modern historian has come up with a more convincing explanation."

Sorry, but we HAVE come up with a more convincing explanation.

The Resurrection cults were looking for new victims.  When they heard about Jesus, they started telling people that "Yes, we saw the resurrected Jesus."  Because they were dishonest, even dangerous cults recruiting victims... I mean, members.  

It's the kind of lie that a Resurrection cult would invent.  Even Paul said that Jesus was only the first-fruits of an imminent General Resurrection in 1 corinthians 15.

If Mr. Wright would stop trying to con us, he would have to admit that a LIE is simply a more convincing and believable explanation for the resurrection appearances of Jesus.
