The other reviewers were right! Thank God I only borrowed the book from the public library. Had I bought it I would have demanded a refund.

Is this really Evanovich writing? Or is it mostly Hughes? I find it hard to believe that she can write this bad after reading the Plum series.

Max is ultra rich, established right away in the first chapter who thinks he knows everything there is to know. As for his car Muffin... I'm not so sure what to say about a menopausal car.

Jamie sounds dumb, like a flat character trying to find dimension.

The story, plot, etc. leaves much to be desired. Good thing they put a limit as to how low your rating can get or this would be a negative
