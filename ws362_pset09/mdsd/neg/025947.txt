Lawrence Block is a very good writer, usually. This "mystery" is chockablock with padded dialog that often seems to go on endlessly and to no purpose. And, to top it off, the "mystery" ends on a totally unbelievable and silly note. 

There were four bodies total, that is people "killed" or otherwise departed from this realm of tears. Three were explained at the end, and the other one was simply left hanging, the explanation being that, well, some things just cannot be explained. Gimme a break.

That, on top of the bloated dialog, makes this one of Block's lesser efforts, to put it mildly
