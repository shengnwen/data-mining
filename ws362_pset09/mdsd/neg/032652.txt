Several of the reviews echoed exactly as I felt--too many apologies, not enough substance.  It's fifty-some pages into the book beofre the first substantial scriptural reference is made! 
Since I am currently dealing with my pet-loss issues, I feel as tho' several titles offered by Amazon were much more thorough and scriptural-based!  I've you're thinking of buying this book and need some real consolation, my advice is to buy another title
