I enjoy reading wiewpoints that vary in scope since all stories have two sides. This author's pretext leads us into his ideology with surreptitious restraint. But, the anti-Jew, brown, and black sentiment is pouring out by the second chapter.  Steele writes well and his ability to put together thoughts and list supportive data offers compelling credence to his white separatist resolve...especially if you're a white man. 
The book is an enlarged pamphlet, a trojan horse designed to broaden the whole "White" defense idea and get it out on the coffee table. 
Personally,I find it too much to digest without chocking on some of the strong anti-everyone else sentiment that takes over by the second chapter. I like middle-ground. I'm an optimist and not a fatalist. I dislike having extremists sneak up on me whether they be pro-white, anti-white, pro-God or anti-God, pro-meat, or vegan.  I felt that way after turning a few pages of this book which turned me off to it. 
Since I paid for the book, I guess I'm entitled to an opinion.
