This book is so far from Krentz's best romantic novels (Grand Passion, Absolutely Positively), that I would have believed it written by some other romantic novelist because it was so predictable and boring.  The heroine has this "amazing" ability to tell where people have been murdered, but there is no way for her to use this ability to try to solve crimes & contribute to her husband's detective business.  Her husband is a private investigator who somehow manages to stay afloat financially, since he spends most of the book picking out color schemes for his home (Ochre or gold, ooh, the mystery!).  There are a couple of romantic subplots where friends of the couple who have previously been unlucky in love suddenly discover each other & decide that they're perfect for each other.  At the end of the book, you end up with a clumsily-plotted attempt to kill one character, a bunch of references to some nutty mental institution where two of the characters were held captive, three soppily happy couples dancing in the sunlight and one majorly bored reader who wishes she had picked another book for her weekend read
