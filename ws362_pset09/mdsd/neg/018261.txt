I'm a big fan of Asher's polity novels, but I didn't find Africa Zero nearly as interesting.  This work seems to be mostly an expression of the author's political views, which are approximately those of the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front.  The hero of the novel, we are told, was responsible for saving the Earth by culling the human population with genetically designed diseases and preditors -- an idea that has emerged in some factions of the British animal rights movement.  In other words, he murdered billions of people for ideological reasons, and we are supposed to think he is cool.

I have to say, I will be harder for me to enjoy Asher's books after seeing how naive, hostile and anti-American his views are.
