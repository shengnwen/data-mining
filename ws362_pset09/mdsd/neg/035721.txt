apparently none of you have sensitive skin, because if you did, you would understand that all those receipes that include the use of alcohol would murder your skin!  especially the one for problem skin, my face hurt just  reading it!  i would also like to add that, for what you would need to put  on your skin to kill the bacteria that grew there from all the spoiling  FOOD you just had on your skin...it's not worth it. i was quite  disappointed with this book, except for the incredibly well known use of  cucumber...all you're going to do is damage your skin, upset it's natural  balance or give yourself an infection. it sounds really nice, but there are  tons of alcohol free, safe herbal products out there that would do a lot  better for you
