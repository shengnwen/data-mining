Take a step back from your revulsion (a healthy human reaction, so I do hope you were revolted...) to the detailed ritualistic torture of animals and children found in Hard Truth, and analyze the character development and plot development of the last 3 or 4 Anna Pigeon books.

Anna Pigeon as a person is fast becoming a 1-dimensional charicature of the person we met in the first few books; at the same time the author is digging a Natchez Trace of a rut in plot progression - repackaging over again the crazed killer whose insanity is able to drive him through repeated injury to keep after Anna page after page after page. It's as if an editor has said "the stylized nightmare is hot in the industry these days, so rewrite most of the story to be the 'bogeyman' chasing the heroine who just runs and runs and runs."  I can only hope it's an editor saying that, and not a personal problem of the author's. 

If one separated the pages of character development from the pages of "insanity-driven bogeyman keeps coming toward Anna" in any recent Nevada Barr book, would there be much more than a short story
