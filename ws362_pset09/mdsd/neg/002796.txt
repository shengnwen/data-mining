Kochilas' "The Glorious Foods of Greece" is the most frustrating cookbook I've ever tried to use.  The theme of a regional Greek cookbook is well taken.  However, the utterly useless index renders the book little more than a coffee table book - without photos.  And it's a shame, as the recipes themselves are quiet good, but trying to find a recipe is virtually impossible.  Or, even worse - trying to find a recipe a second time - was it in the Thessaly chapter?  No, no - it must have been the Cyclades chapter.  No - perhaps, Epirus.   The Complete Book of Greek Cooking by St. Paul's Greek Orthodox Church is still the gold standard for a useful Greek cookbook filled with wonderful recipes.  Except those who simply enjoy reading cookbooks cover to cover, this is not the one.
