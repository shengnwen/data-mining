I was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by Christiane Northrup in this jumble of a book. At a time when I needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body; I turned to Christian Northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause. A wonderful combination if Northrup had chosen to focus on menopause. Instead she is all over the map, taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life. If I wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers, husbands, and daughters I could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life. Instead, I sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock, as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life. If you are a middle aged woman who has "stuffed your feelings" all your life, and need help speaking up for your youself; this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice. But if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured, this book will shock you with its pettiness. I am quite New Age and believe in all the woo-woo stuff mentioned in this book; but when I turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue; that's what I expect. I can only hope that Northrup will re-read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication. I was embarrassed for her and returned it. I just don't buy it in more ways then one.
