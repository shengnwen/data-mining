I knew the author as a younger man ...has morphed into an amalgam of Dr. Ruth and Dr. Phil.  Death of a close relative effects people in profound ways, yet personalities are mostly immutable. Ann Arbor is a granola city, but please. I found the prose stilted and the examples right in line with the general tendency of people in the helping professions to generalize their advice to the masses to sell books.  Waste of time!!
