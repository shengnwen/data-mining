The book starts with 112 pages of very basic information, information for the totally clueless newbie. If you have more than 3 months of investment experience or if you've read 2 beginner daytrading books or if you've surfed investment sites the last 3 months, you won't learn anything new here. The next 200 pages are references, website addresses, and stuff that belongs in a phone directory. Page 189 to page 313 is a listing of NASDAQ stocks!?!?!? All it shows is the ticker symbol, company name and which sector the company belongs to. NOTHING ELSE!!! I would have rated it zero stars if Amazon.com had such a rating. This book is all bun and no burger, I read my copy at the library (313 pages in half an hour). Leave this PoS on the shelf!!!!
