I very much looked forward to the ending of this book not to see what would happen but so that I could be done with it and move on to a different book! I found this book pointless. After reading 482 pages, I can't even think of two adjectives to describe Sally and Clare. Moody does such a poor job of character development that I don't feel like I know all that much about these two women. I did not like the main characters and I didn't feel as though they had much of a real friendship at all. The book is way too long, the plot is unbelievable, the characters are unlikable, and the writing style is annoying
