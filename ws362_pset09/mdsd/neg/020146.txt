This book's premise is fundamentally flawed. The authors try to promote the use of shark cartilage to cure cancer, but they use bad science. In fact, as any zoologist or marine biologist will tell you, sharks do get  cancer! So much for accurate research. This book's information is dangerous  for two reasons: 1) people may use this unproven treatment when they need  traditional medicine, and 2) many sharks are being unnecessarily killed for  their cartilage. A dangerous book and a waste of money
