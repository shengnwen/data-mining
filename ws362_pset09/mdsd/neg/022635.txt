"That's the American disease as I see it: rampant, illogical stereotyping. We would not be America without it," writes Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez on page 6 of her novel "The Dirty Girls Social Club." She is right, of course, so perhaps is not surprising --although it is very disappointing-- that American-born Valdes-Rodriguez then goes on to write a book that contains the most annoying, stupid and inaccurate of stereotypes.

According to her, almost every Colombian man "has had sex with another man at least once" (huh?) and that doesn't mean they are gay (double huh?). She says all Puerto Rican women are fat (Really? How strange then that I'm size 2-4), all Cubans lie, and "all immigrants" (now there's a generalization that will almost always make you look like a fool) buy tacky furniture and then "cover it with clear plastic." I would invite Valdes-Rodriguez to visit my beautiful apartment, full of sleek, modern, uncovered-with-plastic furniture, but her book annoyed me too much.

And don't get me started on the basic mistakes of this book: she gets the population of New York wrong (I guess doing a simple search on Google is out of the question when you're writing trash) and, most stupidly of all, she says steering wheels in cars in Rome are on the right. Obviously Valdes-Rodriguez has never been to Italy, but didn't anyone edit this book? How ignorant can a person be? 

If you are in desperate search of something to read, get the phone book. It will be less insulting and more accurate than "The Dirty Girls Social Club"--and about as entertaining.
