Rebeccasreads highly recommends WHY WE GARDEN as an almanac of helpful tips from a Pacific Northwest gardener's decades of experience, along with musings on the "Zen of gardening", & yet it is much, much more -- it is the story of how to take inspiration from the history of the written word, & epiphanies from global cultures.

Come walk with this gardener (who, by the way, talks to whales) as he plants a treeling that will live a thousand years, & get a glimpse of TIME as you've not known it.

Come sit a while in his gardens while he shows us the "temporal charisma" of the PLACE wherein we finds ourselves.

Come wander in this gardener's wonderings as he unearths the roots of our ancient yearnings about paradise to our more recent ideals of utopia.

Month by month, Jim Nollman takes us out where the wild things grow,  where spirit, mind & body come together in the most enduring of our "pastimes" -- digging up healing, planting hope & harvesting contentment.

WHY WE GARDEN is a mystery -- no matter where we do it -- atop highrises,  in window boxes, on city blocks, or where the trees outnumber the houses -- wherever we garden, that is where we dig up our souls & nurture our own unfurling.

Much to learn, relish, think on -- all year long, for the rest of our lives. WHY WE GARDEN is the perfect gift for your gardening friends
