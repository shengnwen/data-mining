Complete waste of time!  I am done reading Robin Cook books for now..The story line for this book is so stupid I am amazed Mr. Cooks editors even allowed it to be printed..I'm not sure about the hospitals where Robin lives or works at, but in the area where I live, if just one patient died there would be an immediate investigation, but here we have several patients die from unknown causes and the characters just move along like it's no big deal..The Wilsons even allow their daughter to be admitted!!!  Give me a break!!  Like I said..don't waste your time on this one!!
