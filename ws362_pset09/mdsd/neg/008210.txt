If you do not know the true story of the Georgia and therefore cannot judge how biased and misleading this book is, better DON'T READ IT!! 

I was surprised how a book with scientific pretensions can possibly contain such amount of disinformation. I just wonder if the author has no idea of the subject or if it is deliberate.

Such a waste of time and money!!!
