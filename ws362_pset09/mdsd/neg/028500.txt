Some of the other Alex Rider books may have been a little predictable, but Ark Angel is by far the worst book in the series.  As if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head isn't bad enough, this book really "jumps the shark", not only does Anthony Horowitz yet AGAIN use the "corrupt rich guy" plot (this may have something to do with his childhood . . .), but at the end of the book Alex gets launched into space.  Save your $15 and buy Maximum Ride by James Patterson or a Scott Westerfeld book instead
