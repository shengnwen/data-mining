I thought the first three books by Slywotsky and co. were really good. But this one is really awful. The content -- digital business design -- can be summarized in one page. They just try to keep stretching the material to complete a book -- for the sole purpose of selling. The same point keeps being repeated again, again, and gain. Check the bibliography and read the sources. They are much better! Read the Profit Zone, Value Migration and Profit Patterns. They are much more relevant today though many principles are extremely difficult to apply in today's very unpredictable environment
