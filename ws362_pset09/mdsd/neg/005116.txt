Prof. Butler has many references to Hegel and Lacan but remarkably few to the play itself. Of those only one or two are in Greek. It is not at all clear that she is familiar with the language--for example: on page 8 of her book she transliterates Antigone's response to Creon as &quot;kai phemi drasai kouk aparnoumai to ne&quot;. This may be a misprint but in any case the last word should be &quot;mey&quot; (mu eta). Does Prof. Butler understand the force of the initial &quot;kai&quot; or the function of the article at the end? I have no sense of engagement with the line--instead she offers two translations, both inaccurate. . The problem is that Antigone is such an ambiguous text that even a reading in Greek using the lines as evidence is problematic. She seems to depend on what others have said about Antigone rather than going through the work of actually reading the play in Greek by herself. The line I quoted is I think -- apart from translating &quot;glory&quot; as &quot;kleos&quot;(correct as far as it goes though had she bothered to study the linguistic history and possibilities of the word she might have helped her argument)-- the only sign of any contact with the Greek. The passage she presents about the primacy of the brother over the child--a passage that has troubled readers of Antigone since the nineteenth century-- is given in English and her conclusion that Antigone's notion of Kinship is eccentric seems to suggest she has not read recent scholarship. Rather Prof. Butler has an agenda (nb her anti-Catholicism) which she presents using the play as a forum. She is certainly entitled to her agenda and entitled to argue that Antigone represents it. Problem is she offers no textual evidence and has I fear little or no familiarity with Greek. If you want to make an argument you have to back it up with evidence not hearsay--where's the beef
