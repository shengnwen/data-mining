My husband bought this book and its companion, If He Only Knew, since we need to work on strengthening our marriange.  I was glad that he took the initiative and was eager to read the book, but I found myself a bit disappointed by the content.  While the basic concepts seem good, I found the examples and suggestions to be rather outdated.  It was originally published in 1979, and, despite some revisions, seems to belong to a different time -- that of 25 years ago.  The book seems to lean too much toward the idea of the wife being submissive to her husband, and encourages her to look nice and greet him with a smile when he comes home from work, which sounds very much like the Home Economics textbooks from the 1950s.  I feel that the author's suggestions do not really speak to me in today's world
