I wish Mr. Gore had imbibed more of a biblical foundation during his growing up years in the Bible belt.

He uses the thesis, that the only thing which creates familial bonds is luvvvvv, to then say that families come in all shapes and forms....2 daddies, or 2 mommies...ughhhhh!

It is no accident that in the book of Genesis, the creation of the familial bond is linked to the sexual act between a man and a woman. "A man shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh." In the New Testament, Paul interprets this sexually, arguing that for this reason one should not sleep with a prostitute inasmuch as you would be becoming "one flesh" with her.

So, the Gores need to repent, return to the biblical foundation, and realize that luvvvvvvvvv is not the sole nexus where familial bonds are released. It is equally in the coming together sexually of male and female.

But then, if he were to say that, he would make certain "families" feel bad. Then he would lose part of his political support. Then he would be called "bigoted" "racist" "homophobe" and "dumb."
