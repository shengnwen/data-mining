When I ordered the books and checked out, there was no indication of the shipping cost. Since I dealt thru Amazon before, I assumed the shipping to be included. When I received my invoice, the shipping cost equalled the cost of the books.

I contacted the seller and was told that was the way it was.

I am very unhappy that I have to pay this cost as the books were already shipped.

If you are going to use this type of outside services, I would advise you to insure that the customer knows what he will pay, in total, before they complete their order. 

This transaction is a  negative for Amazon.
