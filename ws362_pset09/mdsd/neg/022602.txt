I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat.  The ending left me empty and unsatisfied.  If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area.  Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map
