There are so many other awesome books out there to read. So, why would anyone read this series? The writing is sappy, the plot nonexistant, and the characters unlikable. But, the author really isn't that bad, I mean her Canadian Series is very good. But this series does not deserve a movie status. Now before everyone get's mad, realize that I have read the entire series when I was 11 or 12 and liked them immensely. But now that I am many years up from that I thought to read them again, and was disappointed. Great for someone that hasn't read much great literature. Pride and Prejudice anyone? but not so good for those of us who have. Please don't spend your money on this series unless you've read one first. They are not all they are cracked up to be.
