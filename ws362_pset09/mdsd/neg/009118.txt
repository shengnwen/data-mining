90 percent (or more) of the illustrations in this book are black and white line drawings... the color drawings leave much to be desired in terms of any identifiable details.  I have found the book somewhat useful as a backup when I think I know what a flower may be, based on identification from another source, and want to check some details or the range of the plant.  If you want to try to identify something from a flower (picture) and don't have the plant in front of you where you can work through the details of the leaves, plant structure, etc. - forget it!  Had I been in a bookstore physically looking at the books, I wouldn't have purchased this one
