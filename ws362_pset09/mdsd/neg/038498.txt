Let me just start by saying I really like math, but this book did not help me to learn biostatistics at all.  It doesn't explain the issues and equations very well and it has absolutly no answers in the back to check with yours, that's a whole other book...and that only has answers to the odds.  Perhaps this would be a decent book for anyone who already has a handle on the subject and wants to learn more, but if this is your first exposure to biostatistics, like me, try another source to learn from, this book makes a difficult subject near impossible
