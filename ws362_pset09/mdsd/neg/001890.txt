This book has nice pictures, which might inspire you with some new ideas for arranging your Christmas items, or give you some ideas for things to purchase.  But the majority of objects shown are uncredited, so you might have difficulty with even that.  There are only a handful of actual projects to make, and these are certainly not the most attractive objects pictured.  Not worth buying, in my opinion.
