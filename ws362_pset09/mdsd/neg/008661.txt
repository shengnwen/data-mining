Soulless is a personal attack on Ann Coulter, The cover shows how un-original liberals are, it's supposed to be her dressed as Ann. It looks more like a cross between Ann and Meatloaf.

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. That's apparently the mantra of liberal authors who can't stop Ann Coulter's popularity on TV and in the book world. 

Ann Coulter is brutally honest. At times honesty proves to be most unkind. But that's just the way it is. Sometimes Ann Coulter treats the liberal left as they have treated her, and they don't like it. But I can't recall anytime where she was hateful as Estrich has been.
As far as her detractors calling her brainless, well, just consider the ignorance of the 
source.
