Having heard so many good things about this book, I was curious to read it and hoped that it would yield some valuable insights about raising our transracial family. 

Unfortunately, what I read was one man's bitter diatribe against his family and a conclusion that not only did his parents not love him well, but that he would never belong with them--a conclusion that both saddened and horrified me. 

I wasn't expecting for his road to be easy, but I had hoped that he would offer some more constructive, hopeful thoughts. Instead he comes across as angry and resentful.
