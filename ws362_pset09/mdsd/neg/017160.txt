I received the raindrop technique treatment, and the experience was wonderful.  The essential oils generate a deep heat that you can feel in your spine.  I've had chronic daily pain in my back since 1997 from repetitive motion injuries.  When I got off the table after the treatment, I had NO pain, and I mean ZERO pain, for the first time in years.  It was extraordinary.  My range of motion was increased and I just wanted to cry from the relief.  It lasted for about 2-3 days, which didn't surprise me all that much.. it takes more than one day to heal from years of pain and scar tissue.  HOWEVER...2-3 days after the treatment, I became extremely ill.  My lungs became so severely congested that it felt like they were being ripped out when I coughed.  I have never been that congested in my entire life and it lasted for almost a month.  I then did more research on the essential oils used in the treatment.  And I wish I had done that beforehand.  First of all, articles regarding Gary Young's complete lack of credentials are fairly easy to find online.  Secondly, some of the oils can cause allergic reactions if not used properly.  When someone has alot of scar tissue in their connective tissues and muscles, there are toxins such as lactic acid and metabolic wastes that are locked into those tissues.  If those metabolic chemicals are all suddenly released into the bloodstream, it can cause a detox reaction.  Many people might have a fabulous experience with the raindrop technique.  But it's really not wise at all to just treat anyone without consideration of these, and other factors.  I am a licensed massage practitioner.  And I'm advising other LMP's not to approach raindrop therapy like it's just a feel good spa technique.  Do your homework before you just start treating people with these oils.
