A rambling book, not very informative, with a marked liberal tone.  Not to mention disjointed-- as far as the editorial content goes, each chapter is a totally separate book with its own thesis.  I would have preferred a more  cohesive work supported by the weight of objective historical evidence  rather than repetitive tales of coffee house chats, anarchic newspapers,  and loud-mouthed ideologues -- written in a soporific stream of  consciousness
