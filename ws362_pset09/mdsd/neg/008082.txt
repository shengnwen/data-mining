Bought this on a clearance rack and can now see why it hadn't sold.  The characters were unexciting, and the story dragged on and on.  I read 4 books while having this one unfinished on my night stand.  I've never read any of Allison's other novels, but after reading this one, I don't think I'll jump on the chance.  Dede was the most interesting character, and even she couldn't keep me involved.
