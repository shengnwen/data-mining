I am glad that Elder recognizes that applying his concepts to short-term trading, such as daytrading, is much harder than applying them to a longer time horizon. 

His basic premise is that stocks tend to travel within channels. This is a volatility mean reversion argument, which when taken to its limit essentially argues that volatility does not exist - that stocks do not gap up or down and that when a stock breaks out of or down through its channel, it's automatically a long or a short (in the opposite direction of the respective move). 

I couldn't disagree more. 

If you apply Elder's concepts to daytrading, for example, you will lose all of your money. I did.

But, if you have a longer time horizon - such as a multi-day holding period, you could very well apply his concepts with some success - just be sure to apply his premise of stocks travelling within channels to stocks that recently FINISHED breaking out of or down through thier channels as opposed to stocks that are in a relatively tight range (primed for breakout). I'm very surprised that Elder doesn't address how volatility mean reversion can easily kill his style of trading if not applied properly to stocks that are consolidating. 

In any case, take this book with a grain of salt as it is likely the first important trading book you'll read, but certainly (hopefully) not the last
