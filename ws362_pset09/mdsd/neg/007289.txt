Th French Diet is an enjoyable read and does contain a few molecules of truth. Unfortunately, the French Diet is misleading in that it does not tell the whole story of why the French people have lower rates of heart disease, and are less overweight and obese than Americans. The book is "politically correct" in that the author does not explain that, for the most part, the French reject the lipid hypothesis, which is the belief that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease. Montignac over-emphasizes the role of olive oil in the French diet. Although the French do consume (and produce) large quantities of olive oil, they also consume large quantities of butter, cream, full-fat yogurt, raw-milk cheese, and duck fat. These foods are all high in saturated fat, contradicting the authors claim that the French consume primarily monounsaturated fats. The author also neglects to mention the ugly fact that the French smoke more than Americans and the potential impact this has on caloric intake.
