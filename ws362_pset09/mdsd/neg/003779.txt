Garth Ennis didn't just phone this in but just printed it on some fools scrape. I had liked very much the first five of the Max Punisher books he did but this is a stinker.  He completely lost the character of the Punisher and his motivations and conflicts and action. Avoid at all cost and a great disappointment after the great work he did in the The Slavers.
