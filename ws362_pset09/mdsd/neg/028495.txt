It's an OK book and if I'd read the title a little closer I probably wouldn't have purchased it.  Basically the book details how IBD became a viable business by teaching different (and better) investing rules and helping average people locate potentially above average stocks.  However, if you are interested in the hows and whys of stock picking get a subscription to IBD (I like the online PDF version myself) the information that comes with being a subscriber is far more detailed than what is in this book
