This "novel" is supposed to be about a personal assistant to the stars.

While I was excited with the premise, my first upset was to discover that this was written as a novel.  Would it not have worked way better as non-fiction? It was my belief that this book was based on the author's personal experiences.

Yes, it would have been a little dicey to make it non fiction, but certainly lots more fun.

As it stands, this book is full of stories about "make believe" stars.  The author has our main character jumping from one star to the other without much coordination and throughout the whole thing, we are also subjected to silly comments from the main character.

Also, are we expected to believe that the "star assistant" works for all these people and does not even have contracts with any of them? Smacks of plot advancement to me.

Overall, unfortunately, this book was boring for me. I did not even want to attempt to try to figure out who the "fake" stars may represent in real life.

Next time - try writing a non fiction memoir - that would be interesting
