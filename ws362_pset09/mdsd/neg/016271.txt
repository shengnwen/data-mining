Why doesn't anyone ever talk about the atrocities other countries and religions have done? No one talks about Darfur or what the head Palestinians do to their own people. We must realize that Muslims are just as much to blame for genocide and destruction as everyone else. I'm not just talking about towards Americans or other communities, but within their own community and families. Has anyone ever heard of "honor killings?" They happen all the time in supposedly moderate Muslim countries like Jordan. But it's okay to talk badly about Jews and other ethnic groups/religions, but not Muslims or it is an outright attack. Some people need to look at themselves and be truthful about what they are doing instead of blaming others. 

Israeli is constantly under attack (verbally and physically) and this instigates the violence. It's nothing new. I don't condone killing and violence, but I feel that people do make things worse for themselves by inciting it. What is happening in the middle east is nothing like what Hitler did or what is happening in Darfur.
