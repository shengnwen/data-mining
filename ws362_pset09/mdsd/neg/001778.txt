The sheer arrogance of van Tharp is enough to put me off. The tone of this book and the advice and insight he gives beggars belief. Van Tharp in no way understands the reality of trading, which after horse racing is probably the hardest profession of all. After reading this book I am absolutely sure that if he does try trading he will fail miserably.

Trading is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for most people. It is not a profession for everyone, otherwise everyone would be millionaires. Nor is it a profession to be taken likely, which most people are lead to indirectly believe when they read this book.

My view is that this book tells people what they want to hear, not what they NEED to hear, and I suppose for that reason alone it will sell
