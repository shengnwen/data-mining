Teaching children to read beyond the words is an important pedagogy, but one must consider the level of cognition of the audience.  Trites uses young adult and childrens' literature to highlight her points.  But her  analagies and metaphors are leaps and bounds beyond the realm of  understanding of youth.  In fact, many of her examples are difficult for  graduate students to comprehend.  Only a few analogies are comprehensible  to a youthful audience.  She is a genius at literary analysis, but she  needs to consider an age appropriate curriculum.  I will not refer to this  text in the future, nor will I recommend it to others
