While purporting to 'embrace objectivity and think critically', LeGault repeatedly fails to do either.  His gratuitous bashing of other countries based on single figures from surveys smacks of both sloppy thinking and chauvinism.  As an example, to substantiate his view that the US is unfairly maligned as crime-ridden, he quotes a report that Sweden, "the United Nations' perennial merit-badge winner", has double the assaults of the United States, 667 versus 313 per 100,000. Could this statistic, if it's real, result from differential rates of reporting crime?  Quite possibly. Would it be reasonable to mention also that many reports indicate that the US has a homicide rate that's roughly 5 times that of Sweden?  Probably, if you are a critical thinker and/or concerned about crime rates.  LeGault also uses an unreferenced survey that supposedly indicates that two-thirds of Canadians say the US is a negative influence in the world to justify a rant about the "myth and balderdash dished out by the country's legions of left-leaning scholars and pundits". How objective of him to conclude, "it is not enough to scream 'Hypocrites! Ingrates!'" As a Canadian, I suspect that we do try to maintain a balanced view of the contributions of the US, both positive and negative, on the world scene. LeGault's reasoning implies that that because Canada is "dependent on trade with the US", anything that hints at criticism of American foreign policy is unacceptable.

There may well be some value to this book, however, it will require a concerted effort by the reader to separate the valid arguments from many that appear to be invalid or based entirely on such emotionally loaded thinking
