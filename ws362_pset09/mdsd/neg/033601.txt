I used this book twice in two different classes, and it simply repeats everything one can find in a $20 creative writing book.  The readings selected are lackluster or horribly common in creative writing books already.  

If this book were even $30, the content would not be so reprehensible.  However, with the hefty price tag, the pages should be littered with helpful tips that are new and exclusive to this book.  Burroway's "Imaginative Writing" is just as boring and hollow, but it at least does not gouge the pocket. 

I would reccomend not buying this book if one is looking for a creative writing book.  Instead, check out "The First Five Pages" or "30 most common mistakes of Fiction Writers," both of which rest comfortably under the $20 marker.  For those who are required to use this book for a class, either don't buy it or purchase an earlier edition
