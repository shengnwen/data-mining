This tape set is actually one cassette of a lecture and one of an in-studio "interview" by a publisher's rep. I stopped listening after the first Q&A of tape 2.

Some reviewers have blasted this author for challenging a victim of child abuse. I have my issues with Dr. Myss and her presentations; however, I found her follow-up there valid. This woman had clearly taken on "victim" as an identity. Moving on to the larger picture, the lecture itself struck me as having no real point. She stresses forgiveness-as-a-healing-mechanism heavily at the end, yet the preceding talk doesn't support it.
As for Part 2, she sounded as though she wanted to be anywhere but at the interview. She appeared either bored or distracted. As a generalization, without going into impressions from her (and others' similar) work, there seems to be a level of burnout where the "expert" realizes that (s)he has said pretty much all there is to say, in as many ways as possible
