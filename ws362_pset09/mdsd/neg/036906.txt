I searched all over to find a book specifically about voodoo in New Orleans, and unfortunately this was all I could find...it's only 240ish pages and I still haven't even made it through it yet. Though there are  some interesting facts, I think it's poorly written -- and it's 50 years  old!  Would like to see a more updated version that is a better read.   Maybe will write it myself
