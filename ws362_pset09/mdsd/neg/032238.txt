So my girlfriend made me read this book. I almost broke up with her  because of it. I mean, come on people! Nothing happens in the book, the cats who are supposed to help solve the "mystery" don't lift a paw, the whole thing is so bad and convoluted that at the end, the author has to explain to you all the things that happend that she couldn't manage to fit into the book somehow, so there was no way for you to even have any clue at all what was happening.

Look, I love cats. They're cool. This book made me want to kick cats and the author. Don't waste your time unless you like falling asleep in the middle of scenes that are supposed to be "action" or getting really angry that you paid for this book. (I didn't...my girlfriend loaned me hers. I gave it back. Good riddance.
