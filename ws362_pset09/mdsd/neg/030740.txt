This book is just a clever rehash of his other books but just repackaged under "POWER AGING". Some of his books contain the title Gary Null Phd. and other books just say Gary Null- so this time it is "Phd"- the book jackets NEVER say from what University. Many of the supplements pluged in Null's book are sold by his company Gary Null Associates so it is hard not to look at this book as just another product placement. The idea that hundreds of  millions of people of diverse cultures should eat a specific way is ludicrous. Gary Null writes his book as if he has all the information, but scientists still do not have much of the answers regarding aging, yet Gary gives the impression he knows everything there need to know about health and mega- antioxidants may become pro-oxidants in the body. He sounds like the Jim Jones of health gurus. Gary Null knows that his diet is nearly impossible to follow for the normal average person working 8 to 6 pm 5 or 6 days a week and he creates products that fill the need. Instead of eating all those lbs. of organic vegetables and fruit each day just take his expensive concentrates and supplements and watch Gary Inc. get richer. CASE IN POINT: FOR OVER 30 YEARS GARY CLAIMED THAT CHOCOLATE WAS TOXIC AND AS BAD AS CONSUMING MEAT OR COFFEE-NOW HE SELLS A 'NUTRITIOUS" GARY NULL CHOCOLATE BAR!
