I bought this book because I liked the idea behind it, introduce the thinkers in a comic book fashion. Also, I thought the &quot;Introducing Postmodernism&quot; was good. But this one on Foucault is a great  dissapointment. The captions that narrate Foucault's development are mostly  confusing: the explanation of the ideas just aren't clear enough, and the  biographical anecdotes are mostly irrelevant. This doesn't give one a good  understanding of what Foucault was trying to do, what his books tried to  say, how his life influenced his work and v.v., and why, in the end, his  &quot;work has become a straight jacket,&quot; as the author asserts
