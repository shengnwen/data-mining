Although the book is amusing, it's so hostile to the opposite sex, I don't want my daughters reading it.  The princess is a spoiled brat that plays mean tricks on stupid men.  What is that teaching my children? 

Princess Knight by Cornelia Funke is a much more positive, upbeat book that gives young girls a message that they can be strong and independent with or without a husband.  This book portrays men as arrogant and ignorant.  I hope my girls grow up with a different idea in mind.  I hope they see the good in both sexes instead of demeaning the value of men.
