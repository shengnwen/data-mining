Somehow the lovely boy that was Larry got lost in the two years between this book and the first.  He's lost his patience, his tolerance, and thanks to the author's forced writing, his compelling voice.  The plot was a little too fantastic, with the constitutional ammendment and Larry's run for president, and the devices a little too pat.  It's easy to solve problems when you create them, as a writer can do when she appropriates real people and events for a work of fiction.  One also has to wonder why she forced it out ahead of the 2004 election when it's so obviously a problem.  Starting with Kerry and Dean at the primaries and then referring to Bush and 'the Democratic candidate' for the rest of the race made it clear there was no ending for the book.  And when even the writer doesn't know what's going the reader hasn't got much of a chance.  It could be revised in later editions to cover that but with the rest of the story being so lame there isn't much reason.  

The real problem of course is that Tashjian doesn't seem to have anything new for Larry to say and the book is really a rehash Gospel with a poor plot.  It was fun once but how much preaching can we be asked to take
