This was a complete disappointment. They reduced the size of the book from 8 ½" by 11" to 7" by 10". This in itself is not so bad, but they reduced all the information in this book as well. They no longer cover any antique toys at best they only deal in vintage / classic toys. If your ideas of antique toy cars are Red Line Hotwheels you will like this book. If you are looking for Aircraft, American Paper Toys, Animal Drawn, Banks, Dollhouses and Miniature Furniture, Erector Sets, Farm Toys, Lionel Trains, Movie, Radio & Television Toys, Ramp Walkers, Schoenhut, Ships, Soldiers, Sparklers and Plunger Toys, Steam Toys, Wooden Toys, Cast Iron Vehicles and anything else before the 60's forget it! This has been reduced to nothing more than a baby boomer's toy guide. If you enjoy Antique Toy World, this book is not for you! If you like Toy Shop Magazine, well that is all this is. If you own the 11th Edition of Collecting Toys, hold on to it and get a second copy before you waste your money on this dreadful price guide.
