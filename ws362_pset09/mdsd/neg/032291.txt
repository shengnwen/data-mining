In this book you'll read about a love story. Pathetic but at least a love story. You'll read about New Orleans, a nurses's life, a hit man that blunders once and again. But what about the main plot? Why everybody was interested in Karen's life? Why, you'd read about that at the last 50 pages or so. So if you only read the last pages you'll save a lot of time.

I think LH can write better than this.
