This book is irresponsible, and I equate selling this book to teens with selling them drugs.  Each could drive a troubled kid over the edge to suicide.  The premise of the first chapter is that for a teen to tell their troubles to a friend or anyone else is the same as "barfing on your friends".  As crisis center and peer counselors know, many teens hold their most disturbing thoughts and emotions to themselves, and in all too many that leads to suicide attempts or successful suicides.  Any useful ideas the author may have expressed in the rest of the book is more than negated by this irresponsible, lunatic advice.  Please Amazon.com, withdraw this item from sale to impressionable teenagers looking for advice in their troubled lives
