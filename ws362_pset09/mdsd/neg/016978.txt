I gave this book a chance, but in the end the inconsistencies and generalities plaguing this book were simply too much. Not only is it written in substandard English, but it also makes the flawed argument that the Japanese constitution, as it stands now, is sufficiently "Japanese" to justify its remaning unaltered. This is wrong and most educated and academic Japanese see the obvious need to pen the constitution by native and elected Japanese officials. The U.S. effort in Japan was intended as merely one to provide guidance and a framework for Japan, not as one to strip them of autonomy. Japan now realizes the distinct need to rewrite the constitution in its own words and through its own understanding and should do so. Ms. Inoue's case is colored through the lens of an ex-Japanese who has disowned her own culture and country to espouse the values of the U.S. While it may not be p.c. to say this, Japanese who still remain patriotic to their country should be the ones making the decision of how to handle their constitution, not someone who has disowned her country
