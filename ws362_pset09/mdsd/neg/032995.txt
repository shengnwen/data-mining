People - you are both wrong in what you are doing. Pro and Anti-muslim arguments really don't belong here. Information regarding the translation and accuracy maybe, but the Quran is not on trial here. Focus on the product - not it's teaching.

Frankly, it would be nice for people to know that there are no "original manuscripts" for translation and that the Quran is thousands of years newer than the Bible. I think it is interesting that there are contradicting passages that are not a contradiction because Allah can change his mind - but that isn't really a review of this particular book
