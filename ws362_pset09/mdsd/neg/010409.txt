We  hastily bought this book for a friend and just as quickly returned it after taking a look at it's content. If you're still on the carnivor boat and wish to expose your child to the high dioxin and chemical load found in meat, then this book's for you. If you're a bit more informed and concerned about the contamination of meat, then look elsewhere for alternative nutrition and recipe info.
As a pharmacist, let me tell you that children are exceptionally sensitive to the chemical contamination that is in U.S. produced meat. This ain't the good ol' days and meat has changed. Be very careful where your animal products come from or consider eliminating them altogether
