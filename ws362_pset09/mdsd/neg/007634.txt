I am a huge fan of both Leann Banks and Janet Evanovich....and actually I have purchased everything written by both authors.  However, this one should have stayed on the "drawing board" for an "OVER-HAUL" before it was published!!  

Best wishes to both and I will still buy all of your books....but this one STINKS!!
