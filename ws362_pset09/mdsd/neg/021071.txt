Coetzee is without a doubt a good writer and he has written many fine novels, unfortunatly In the Heart of the Country is not one of them. Not a author known for fast pacing who has made up for that with eloquence and  interesting caracters without being boring. In this book he fails on all  accounts. To enjoy this book you would have to be a absalut diehard fan  Coetzee
