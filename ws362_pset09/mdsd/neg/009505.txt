I usually cook everything from scratch and don't mind spending a few hours making several appetizers. BUT, to make just one  recipe in this book, you'd need to spend a couple of hours. The majority of the recipes are too fussy and complicated and just not worth the trouble. I made a couple of the crepe appetizers with different fillings. They were the least time-consuming but the result still wasn't worth the effort - no one took seconds
