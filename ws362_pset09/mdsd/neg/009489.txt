While I did enjoy parts of the book, I find it to be lacking overall.  Gertie is a believable character but lacks in courage.  She was supposedly a strong person.  She did face many challanges but didn't overcome then.  Instead she sidestepped her problems.  Not until the last page does she actually become the character she is portrayed to be but I barely made it to the last page.  The climax occurs far too early in the book so the resolution takes up far too much time.  The one star was given on pity alone.  Do not read this book if you have seen the movie.  In fact do not read this book period
