These reviews are all really suspicious to me.... 

when someone wins an election with one-hundred percent we call that...fraud.

Anyway, I've seen this book and it ain't all it's cracked up to be.

The consumer should be aware that Berlitz, INC has become a notorious exaggerator of its own worth.  Critiques of Berlitz-related products are often so gushy and ecstatic with delight that they leave the reader believing that they could only have been written by Berlitz staff.  

Berlitz products are notorious among foreign-language education professionals for their lack of exercises, their scanty grammatical explanations, their inflated prices, and the flashy pseudo-science of their famous "method" (a gussied-up listen-and-repeat scheme).  The informed consumer will take the time to compare Berlitz "method" products with other, often university-related course supports. The focus of university-generated products is generally less on the marketing and the cultivation of repeat-buyers and more neutrally, disinterestedly geared towards the linguistic enrichment of the student.

The business traveller is particularly ill-served by methods that promise enormous bounds in fluency across short time periods.  These travellers often find themselves seduced by grandiose promises--often while under high-stress conditions [foreign travel, foreign-language presentation preparations]--and end up rather disappointed for having been duped.  

Any "method" that claims to produce fast, effortless results is suspect.  Most "methods" are marketing illusions dreamed up by sales teams.  

The Berlitz method, in my opinion and in that of many language professionals, is the foreign-language-learning equivalent of a get-rich-quick scheme.   I have been disappointed by their products and teaching in every case I have ever crossed WITHOUT EXCEPTION
