A lover's betrayal. . . A killer on the loose. . . 

Eve Duncan was actually happy. She had a man who loved her, an adoptive daughter as great as her own, and her dead daughter's bones were found and safely buried. But then a letter in the mail opens her eyes to a secret her boyfriend, Joe Quinn, kept for two full years. Now she wants away from him, and when a job opportunity in a different state presents itself, she packs her bags and leaves. On her first night in Louisiana, someone tries to kill her, and they won't give up until she's dead! Will she uncover the secret in time? Or will death silence her?

When I picked up this book I wasn't surprised it got high on every bestsellers list. It was moving a mile a minute and between the hired assassins, secrets, deaths, and conspiracies, I knew I was reading a great novel. And then, after chapter 5, the book came to a stop and decided to creep at turtle speed. The character of Eve Duncan became uncharacteristically naive and immature, while her 12 year old adoptive daughter Jane was acting like a 50 year old, smart and mature beyond her years. The book dragged all until chapter 12. Once chapter 12 begins, the book takes flight once again and the bombs (literally) start going off. The ending was good and though I thought it was predictable, it was still somewhat enjoyable. It wasn't as good as the first two books in that series, but it was better then the third.
