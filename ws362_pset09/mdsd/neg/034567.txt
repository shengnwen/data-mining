Flash MX for Dummies is inexpensive, especially for a book complete with a CD. However, the book is over 90% fluff and very little substance, basically covering even less than the built in tutorials that come with Macromedia Flash MX to begin with. There is almost no hands-on training, using instead refrences to materials on the CD. The reader is assured that even a 'Dummy' can create fantastic eye candy for their website, yet there is no problem solving for when you try something and it just doesn't work. Also, certain blatant errors within the text, such as telling you to copy CD library files to the macromedia/flash 5/Libraries folder become a grim reminder that this is 'Macromedia Flash 5 for Dummies' with a few edited paragraphs here and there. I found myself reading through 50 pages to find a paragraph's worth of useful information. There IS useful information here, just not a lot. A much better choice for a 'beginner' book is Sam's Teach Yourself Macromedia Flash MX in 24 Hours
