I read the book, came to this site to write a review, and was flabbergasted by the people that wrote positive reviews.  Had they never encountered dietary information before?  Was this their first knowledge of how food is processed in the body, and what foods one should eat?  Even if that were the case, there are still better guides available.  I found this book to be a cheap attempt to earn a little money at the expense of people wanting serious nutritional information.  Maybe the positive reviews really were written by friends or by the author's own public relations firm...which advocates napping...induced by reading his own book no doubt
