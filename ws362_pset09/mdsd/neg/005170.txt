I made it to page two of the text (page seven of the book) and got disgusted with her style.

  From this page alone: ka-boom. And this man Skinner. maniacal psychologist. baby in a box so as to raise her. whatever humanity he touched turned to bone. [?].  This I know to be true.  This much we presume we know. Genuine court of law.  Boom-boom went the gun.

Note there is not one quotation mark here.  THIS IS HER WRITING and the editor's editing.  I don't know if I can go on!  I'm very sorry I bought this book.
