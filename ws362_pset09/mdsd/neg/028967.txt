In the whole book there were only one or two items that attracted me. Most items are pretty ordinary; some are distinguished by frills or other design elements that I don't happen to like. Not a terrible book; and maybe in time I'll warm up to it. But if I'd seen it at a bookstore, I wouldn't have bought it
