Generally, i find John Ringo's plots to be much better than his execution (with the signal exception of the "fantasy" series that includes "The Emerald Sea", and even there, i detect a trend toward what Tom Easton ([i think] referred to a "conanism".) -- the "March" series, in collaboration with my brother, David Weber, may be an exception, since i'm not sure who did what in their production.  (Which said, they are really rather better books than either of them alone has produced lately.)

I don't know which of the co-authors did the main plotting, or who did what in the writing, but i got halfway and then hit a brick wall, when it changed (in somewhat exaggerated terms) from "Sgt Rock and the Combat Happy Joes of Easy Company Behind Enemy Lines"  to "Indiana Jones meets the Predator"...

I think my sense of neatness and econmoy in plotting was somewhat tweaked by the introduction of so much plot mechanics built of at least well-coloured cardboard which all, apparently, had to be wiped out halfway through in order to let the real story begin.

When they pulled a similar stunt in the movie "Executive Decision", it was done early enough and plausibly enough that i admired their audacity; in "The Hero" i felt it came too late in the story to work right and felt as if it were forced by plot considerations, rather than growing naturally from the plot. (Rather as the "dirt-in-the-window" sequence in "Close Encounters" is really only there to write out the wife and kids, beause Spielberg couldn't be bothered to come up with anything more logical...)

I was enjoying it reasonably well up to the point when the antique gun* wasn't fired, but was instead pulled down off the mantelpiece and broken over the authors' knee...

*From playwright Anton Chekhov's saying that if a gun is shown mounted on the wall in Act I, someone better have taken it down and used it by Act III
