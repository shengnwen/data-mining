I described this novel to a friend as a mediocre novel that finally took a turn for the worse.  I kept hoping it would get better.  Each part, however, went further and further south.  Part 3, was ultimately, it's demise.  It felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Not the original, engaging Twilight Zone, but the new and contrived Twilight Zone.  

With all of the great literature out there, this was a waste of my time
