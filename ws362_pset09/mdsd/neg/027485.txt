Having read Frank's "What's the matter with Kansas?"---which I quite liked---I started this book.  I looked forward to reading a critique of the "Emperor's New Economic Paradigm": that the almighty *Free Market* is the answer to all of America's problems.   However, after struggling to stay awake through the first 50 pages, I cried "uncle".  Frank is not content to make a point but must go on to remake it again and again ad nauseum.  And to add injury to insult, the book's tiny, thin-line font is rather hard on the eyes even with my normal reading glasses
