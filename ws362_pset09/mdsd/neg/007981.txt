Considering Nora Roberts' reputation and clout, you would think she'd insist on only the best as a narrator.  To begin with, this is the third book, but the first two were narrated by someone else, so there's no consistency.  The narrator of the first two books, David Stuart, was ok, but this person, Guy Lemonier, STINKS!  He seems to be merely reading the story out loud.  There is no differentiation between characters, making dialogue hard to follow, and considering he's narrating on behalf of a character, Phillip, who is supposedly the son of a doctor, I find it ludicrous that he doesn't know how to pronounce words like Imitrex (a medication).  Also, all three books are abridged to the extent that many of the funnier moments are omitted, and all the dialogue with Ray and Stella as ghosts is not included.  Don't waste your money on the CD version
