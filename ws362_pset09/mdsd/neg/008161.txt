Looking forward to fun book along the lines of THE BOOK OF LISTS, I instead found myself assaulted by an opinionated trashing of a number of performers, a fawning over P-Funk that takes up three pages, (yes, a great  band but George Clinton's names for himself as a list, PLEASE!)This book is  far too involved with personal attacks to be interesting.  I finished based  on the idea that I wanted to see who was going to fall victim to the  &quot;critical axe&quot; and at the end found this less than rewarding.  Even factual errors like song titles (Zevon's &quot;Carmelita&quot; as  Carmelita's Way&quot; or Thin Lizzy's &quot;Jailbreak&quot; as  &quot;There's gonna be a Jailbreak&quot; were distracting. There is also  whole chapters dedicated to rap which is interesting concept in this book  of Rock lists. I read this type of book for snippets of info and a few  laughs but I just found myself annoyed at the end
