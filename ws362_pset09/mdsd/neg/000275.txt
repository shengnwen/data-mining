I would have to say that I don't particularly agree with this book.  I mean, in my opinion, the most important thing about an apple is that it is food, not that it is round.  Regardless, it did provide for an interesting conversation in my 2nd grade class, as well as a fun get-to-know-you activity.  After reading the book, disucssing differing view points, each student created a page about "The most important thing about me is_____".
