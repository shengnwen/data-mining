I was ambivalent about rating this book. Being an oversea Chinese woman of Wei Hui's generation, I was naturally curious and intrigued with the current scene of mainland China. I find it an easy read as it was like reading the society page at the back of a newspaper. I read the english version so I don't know how faithful it is to the original writing but I do think she overdid quoting well known writers to show that she is well-read and/or that she is "western". And the endless reference to classical music and fine wine to show that she is "cultured".  She should have written in third person to refrain from sounding self-glorifying as it's quite distasteful how she kept reminding readers that she is skinny, fashionable, and desireable. I don't remember which decade she is writing about but I get the impression that they sounded very 80's. Overall I think she got really lucky by having her book burnt and banned as it became the publicity she needed to attract international interest.
