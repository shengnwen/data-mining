This is not a good book about tennis.  It doesn't give any fresh insight about being a professional tennis player.  Basically, Vince Spadea just wants to trash the really great tennis players because he feels they don't give him enough respect.  That gets really tedious very fast.  Although being ranked 39 in the tennis world is a very good accomplishment, Spadea alienates the reader by his complaints and doesn't put himself in a better light
