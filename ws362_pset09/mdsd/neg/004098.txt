As an evolutionary biologist I was interested to read this book to see if it had any true merits.  Now that I have I see that it is a work of wonderful science fiction, not science.  It is quite apparent that the author has no formal training in evolutionary biology.  Much of the book is interesting and HIGHLY speculative, it provides little evidence for its wild claims.  In real science extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence but the author provides no convincing evidence for his claims.  Also, even if life did arrive here instead of the accepted method (which DOES have much evidence supporting it) it still does not refute Darwinian evolution.  Darwinian evolution is the ONLY mechanisms currently proposed which results in adaptation, the mere idea that individuals come to resemble alien life forms because their DNA is silent and &quot;remembers&quot; these forms is pure fantasy.  If this is the case how could there be adaptation on a foreign planet, and for that case how did these little &quot;seeds&quot; come to be created in the first place?  I could continue ripping this book apart but I've more important things to do.  I am very interested in astrobiology but as a scientist I realize that mere speculation is not science, no matter how enticing the theories may be.  Very good read if you're looking for science fiction, but don't bother if you know anything about evolutionary biology
