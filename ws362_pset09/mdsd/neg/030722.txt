This wasn't a BAD book, I was able to finish it, but it definitely was not a page-turner that I was unable to put down. I generally like this type of storyline but this one didn't quite make the grade. I would have felt robbed if I had paid original full price for it, maybe even angry. I found myself wanting to finish it just so I could start something else
