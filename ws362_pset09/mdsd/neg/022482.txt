The book was a page-turner I just wanted to turn the page. This book has a lot of excitement. No because I myself did kind of connect to main character he was just so cheerful. I learned that you could make the best of things. The genre is Fiction. The style of writings significant they use words like feminine. There was a good part with George singing a song about the new folks coming. The chapters did not end with cliffhangers. The story gets uninteresting at some parts, like how the animals talk about stuff. The plot was believable; it had a super good plot. I would recommend this book to people who like animals. It is a good funny book
