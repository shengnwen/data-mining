I didn't even have very high expectations.  After reading this I thought that people should leave well enough alone.  You cannot possible match up to Jane Austen.  The book was very disappointing.  The characters were annoying, I didn't like how colonel fitzwilliam was portrayed at all.  I would have thought he would be more agreeable. The daughters of Darcy and Elizabeth were not very engaging.  It is a quick read however.  It lacked character development and I don't feel I got to know all the sisters.  it read like a regency romance novel.  There was not natural wit to the writing.  Wow. . .I was pretty harsh.  I guess you should read it as a romance novel but not as a sequel to Jane Austen
