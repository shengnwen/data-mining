dispatches is boring. herr read too much kerouac and obviously writes stoned, as other reviewers said. the result: when you read this you think "what a wasted opportunity". it may be herr's version of vietnam, but it's so personal and biased that it can't really be considered a work of art. 
in between the lines he seems to say that he has endured vietnam - and there's no doubt about it - but in what capacity? as a reporter?  this is an important theme in the second half of the book, and herr gets completely lost in his ramblings. he also wants to tell us that vietnam is a hell, but the reader doesn't feel it's hell. one only feels boredom. it's almost like herr is saying, "forget it, I can't express on paper what vietnam was". So, why write this? (herr co-wrote the script of apocalypse now and full metal jacket and probably contributed the boring parts).
the book fails as a memoir and it also fails as a historical log - which we all know it's not.
could this book be succesful?: yes. if it had a structure, if herr didn't waste time on stupid details, if he wasn't so egocentric, if the rhythm was improved. 
contrast: the movie platoon is much, much better. or the deer hunter. those works capture hell. this book doesn't
