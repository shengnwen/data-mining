An awful yawner.  It shows all the reasons chivalry made for tiresome tales, and why the world needed Don Quixote so badly.

The Chretien de Troyes version of Lancelot is repetitious, has many loose ends, and is full of plot holes.  Lancelot jumps into a cart to shame himself in pursuit of Guenivere.  Before Lancelot jumps into the cart, the narrator states that "reason is the enemy of love."  In the scope of the book, and the code of chivalry, reason is the enemy of this genre.

Take with Nyquil.
