Definitively this book is a very bad fairy tale. For instance: The prologue has three chapters and the only one that matters is the Air Force One's chapter. So you can skip the other two chapters as well as the epilogue.

Once you just skip those three chapters, the book goes fast paced until the persecutions began. How many persecutions can you read in a book? So to keep this review short. After the third persecution you'll start to bore of reading.

But the book's finish is scrumptiously preposterous. I don't know if there is or not a lost world -myself wrote a book about that- but traveling in time is just distraught.
