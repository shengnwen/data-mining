I am a big fan of the Stephanie Plum series and was really looking forward to this.  This was BAD!  The characters try to be as quirky and funny as those in the Plum novels but miss the mark completely.  I'm surprised Janet wrote this.  I'll stay a fan of the Plum series but will pass on all the Full series.  I have no interest in finding out if the characters live another day.
