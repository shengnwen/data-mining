I can't even begin to put this book into a category...I will say that this is in no way a pleasurable read. I didn't find it haunting or even bothersome; annoying and tasteless is more of an apt description. It was predictable and plodding as well. The only reason I finished it was because it was short and I have a neurotic tendancy to finish what I start. So glad I got it out of the library & didn't spend my $ on it.
