This book is not only poorly written and boring..it also contains much of the same information that was in a much-better earlier book; &quot;Presidential Lies: The Illustrated History of White House Golf&quot; by Shep Campbell and Peter Landau. This book by Van Natta doesn't offer anything new or noteworthy and is not as exciting or amusing to read. Plus the author brags that he played with Clinton. So what? Clinton will play with just about any journalist who asks. For the real deal, definitely check out &quot;Presidential Lies.&quot
