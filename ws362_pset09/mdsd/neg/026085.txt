If I had not had to read this book for a class on Weddings, Marriage, and Family: A Feminist Perception, there is NO way I would have ever had bought this book.  Ms. Ingraham wants half the world's population to not marry AT ALL.  Yes, there are excellent issues she brings up regarding sweatshops, racism, corporate greed, etc., but to deny a little girl a dream of wanting to be a princess for a day is ridiculus!  She uses weddings and marriage interchangeably which gives a wrong impression.  This book was the last straw for my EVER wanting to take another feminist course in college
