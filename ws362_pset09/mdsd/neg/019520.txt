Noted civil libertarian Alan Dershowitz joins forces with noted civil libertarian Dick Cheney in "Why Terrorism Works" and calls for the "judicious" use of torture when dealing with our enemies. According to the Dershowitz/Cheyney school of interrogation, if a foe's testicles are crushed in a vice- a "sterile" vice-then he will tell all. What he will tell is whatever the testicle mashers want to hear so that they will stop mashing his testicles.  The good professor has evidently forgotten the hoary old legal chestnut about one drop of ink polluting the whole bottle of milk, usually cited by the trial lawyer asking for a mistrial because a witness has blurted out inadmissable evidence in front of a jury. Torture is wrong, morally and constitutionally. A wee bit of it applied to really bad people is still wrong.
