The presentation of the content assumes that the reader has some knowledge of this content area and at times leaves him/her confused as to what was discussed, making it difficult to understand. Examples that are used are often incomplete and do not provide a complete picture of how statements are generated. As someone who has no knowledge or experience in this area, I found it to be frustrating to read and comprehend the information. Not a good choice if you are a novice. Too bad I could not give it zero stars
