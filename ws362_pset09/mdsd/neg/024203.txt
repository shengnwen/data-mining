this was a stupid book hence the name stupid book a boy named cloyd is staying with walter and a new friendship formed it was dumb if you have to do a report that is due in 3 days and you have to choose between a 7,998,654,123 page book on taxes and the 90 page book called bearstone for goodness sake choose the tax book. All the book talks about is an indian sitting there on his butt making kissing faces.
