I was really disappointed after I got this book.  The only good thing is that the author did teach some new techniques.  The samples offered are mediocre and not very inspirational.  A lot of them look just like collages...not really rubber stamped art that I can learn from.  Maria Nerius' book on rubberstamping was much better
