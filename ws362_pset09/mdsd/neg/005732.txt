Okay if you want an idea of what this new series is all about picture a bunch of hi-tech hippies with super powers in space. Well that's the feeling it gave me at least. I mean there is this big social movement called the Legion that most parents despise as being a bad influence on society and the kids all think the adults don't get it and only they have the answers. And society is sterile and individuality is frowned upon. Sounds like a hippie rehash of the sixties to me. For me this trade just didn't have any kind of spark to it at all. Just a bunch of disfunctional future heroes arguing with each other.
