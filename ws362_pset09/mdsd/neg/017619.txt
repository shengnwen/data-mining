The liberation of Paris was a coup de grace for the Allies.  Paris did not suffer the fate of Berlin or Stalingrad, to name a few cities, in becoming a contested battleground.  Nor, as the book pointed out, did the German commander follow Hitler's orders to destroy the city's major monuments, bridges, and other sites.  It is interesting to note his actions in view of other German officers' claims that they were "only following orders".

However, this book is written by two journalists rather than historians, so it does not have the academic research nor analytical insight that a serious work might have.  Cornelius Ryan comes closer to the style of writing that might have made this a heavier book.  This is understandably difficult, in some ways, given the relative sparcity of combat and drama; or so this book would suggest.  Again, a better writer and researcher would find more material to include.

Some material that might be considered, for example, are Allied intelligence estimates, Axis intelligence estimates, operational orders, etc.  It is not clear to me, for example, how the German commander could fail to execute Hitler's orders in August 1944 when the Gestapo and SS were omni-present, especially after the failed July plot on Hitler's life.

Moreover, good research might show to what extent the Allies knew of Hitler's intentions.  The Allies had significant intelligence capabilities, not the least through Ultra.  And if they knew of the plans to destroy large parts of Paris, why didn't they send in commandos and special forces to disarm any explosives?  Indeed, the French themselves seemed to put a higher priority on erecting road blocks rather than disarming explosives.

This is an easy, enjoyable read; and one of the few on the subject in English.  However, it's about time someone else updated and added value to this book
