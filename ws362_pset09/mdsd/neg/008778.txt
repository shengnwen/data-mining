Much of the information about why aid fails is in fact close to the mark.  What is said of the failure of kleptocracies in Africa is true.  However, it is somewhat irrespinsible that the perspective on this failure solely blames Africans.  As a graduate student studying all of these issues, it is apparent to me that the author doesn't make the connection between the current state of Africa and its past.  Africa is failing today because the slave trade turned African kings and mercenaries into forces that ravaged the interior, turning group against group in wars to sell prisoners to the white man.  Colonization left African nations with extractive economies, no infrastructure, no experience at ruling, and behind a hundred years in political development.  And today most African economies are still completely subject to Western markets and decisions about them. Finally, IMF Bank Structural Adjustment Programs and social austerity programs are largely to blame for enriching kleoptocratic despots, fueling wars, and spending billion on white elephant projects. Also to blame are foreign investment groups and governments who backed dictators and armies useful to their foreign policy.  Yet all of this is ignored.

Caldersi is a good read for understanding corruption, kleptocracy, waste, and hoarding...however, it is one piece of the puzzle and ultimately fails to educate the reader on the whole picture.  I recommend this book, but only in conjunction with a wider reading selection that covers the rest of the picture
