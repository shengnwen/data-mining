My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this book to them in class today and they also made an adorable craft of the old lady with cut outs of all of the animals which fit into her apron.  I thought it was so cute and hung it on our fridge.  Soon after I noticed that my daughter was acting upset, when I asked her what was wrong she broke down sobbing about how the old lady dies in the end of the song.  I haven't seen her this upset about anything in a long time.  Even after I explained to her that it was just a story and not real  she still was upset for the rest of the night.  I know that death is a topic that we all need to discuss with our children, but I'm not sure that this is the appropriate way to deal with it.  I have removed the craft that she made so she doesn't need to be reminded of it.  I know that there are a few children in her class who have lost grandparents this year and it just seems like maybe this book could bring up sad feelings for them as well
