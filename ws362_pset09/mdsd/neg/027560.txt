Nostalgia usually hits people with warm fuzzy feelings and this book has its share of them. All in all, I don't think the book quite hit its mark. I was entertained by a few stories but I was expecting much more since many of the reviews here had such high praise. I think the warm fuzzies that some people get by reading about their childhood memories overshadows the point that the book really isn't all that great. This is a great topic for a book and hopefully a better one will come along later
