jerry hopkins has the fiery enthusiasm and idol worship of a five year old really digging barney, but as far as spelling and grammar go, he leaves much to be desired. he talks excitedly about how morrison was fascinated by such existential philosophers as 'friederich nietzsche' and psychoanalyst 'sandor firinczi'. also, his objectivity seems eh, a bit skewed at times? a passage on an airlines incident involving morrison and fellow artist tom baker goes something like this: &quot;the nincompoops and jerks who prosecuted jim were hard put to bring any real evidence against him, although jim's friend tom baker had indeed acted silly.&quot; he also lets us in on a really interesting incident involving jim in 1989! hmmm. i'm thinking the guy who published this book must also have been of the countercultural persuasion, and decided to release it for a dimebag provided by our boy jerry. this is good for those want to be well versed in hopkinspeak and the fine art of money making sensationalism, but for those who are after a real insight into the actual life of jim morrison, look elsewhere. anywhere
