The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world.  Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many &quot;high level&quot; meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows.  This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge
