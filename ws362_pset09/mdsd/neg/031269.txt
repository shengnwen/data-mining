I was fascinated by the topic of Tilly's book. The reasons we give for our actions surely are both important and interesting.

Sadly, I found his work to be utterly disappointing. His basic division into conventions, stories, codes and technical accounts is arbitrary and surely but one of many possible schemes. Yet he does not consider any other way of looking at reasons and provides scant rationale for this particular choice.

His poor framework then sets the trend for a terrible book. When I bought the book I expected it to contain some thoughtful insight into how we use reasons. What are good reasons and bad reasons? Which reasons are deliberate and the result of choice, which sub-consious or driven by social norms? It does not contain anything of the sort. Rather, Tilly provides a dull and haphazard collection of examples to back up his chosen categories. All delivered without a hint of incision

Even though I suffered every minute of it, I read the whole book. The topic is very interesting and until the bitter end I hoped the book would mature like a fine wine and suddenly come good. It did not and remined dull and vacuous throughout. I hope you don't make the same mistake
