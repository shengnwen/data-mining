This book purports to be a Dictionary of American political slang but should be entitled "Washington D.C." political slang.  To test out the book, I looked up some commonly used Chicago political slang terms.  None of them appeared in the book.  Had the author bothered to look outside the Beltway, he could have found words like "chinaman" (a political sponsor/source of clout) and "fetcher" (a legislative bill proposed solely for the purpose of generating campaign contributions from an affected industry)
