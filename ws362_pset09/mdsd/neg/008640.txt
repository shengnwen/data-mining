This book is so bad I don't even know where to start.  I bought it based on many of the reviews on this page, and since I had previously read The Master Of Blacktower and loved it, I thought that this book would be similarly good.  I was terribly wrong!  Right away the dialogue ticked me off because real people don't talk the way that the characters talk in this book.  The dialogue (mainly involving MacDougal and Bruce) is filled with pompous remarks and ridiculous attempts to sound intelligent.  It is so forced that it makes you want to cringe (when they start arguing about Christian theory and the Middle Ages while Sara is passed out on the floor from demonic possession, you know that you should just stop reading now).  It is like in one of those bad TV movies where, when something terrible happens, all of the characters stand around and say "I wonder what we'll do?"  I cannot believe how bad this is.  The possession/seance thing is completely hokey anyway.  Don't waste your time with this one.  I couldn't even finish it.
