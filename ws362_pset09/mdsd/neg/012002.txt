I would like to point out that this book is by HANNAH More, not Henry More as you have listed. Hannah More (1745-1833) was a school teacher, evangelical writer and political reactionary who was the author of large numbers of tracts and chapbook-style novels, such as 'Village Politics' (1792), designed to educate the poor in their duty of accepting a miserable lot in life and practising sobriety, diligence and religious piety. These works also warned of the dangers of political radicalism. 'Coelebs', More's only genuine novel, is directed more towards an aspiring middle class readership, and focuses on female conduct and education. More was also active in the campaign against slavery
