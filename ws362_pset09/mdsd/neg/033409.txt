I bought this book because I was born and raised in the Alentejo and I was so anxious to read about familiar places and perhaps to better understand my own culture.
I hate to say this but I read perhaps 20 pages, if that. Nothing made sense to me, and there was no flow.  I actually returned the book to the store.
So sorry to say this but I would definitely not recommend it to anyone
