Dr. Laura occasionally gives excellent advice, and I admire her willingness to stand up for what's decent and moral.  However, her supposition that husbands do not need a book or advice is almost blasphemous.  God created men and women and the institution of marriage, and even He gives instructions to husbands as to how they should treat their wives!  God "wrote a book" called the Bible which contains advice for husbands as well as wives because God knows the success of a marriage depends on BOTH parties doing their part.  

This book is great for women who are unkind to their husbands.  When unkind people change and become kind and considerate to all those with whom they have a relationship, it CAN have an impact on the behavior of others.  But this applies not only to women and wives but to men and husbands as well.

Many women are suffering because, after reading all the books they can and doing everything within their power, their husbands do not respond.  So the self-doubting and blame continues, and it's needless.  The attitude that a successfull and happy marriage rests solely with the wife is detrimental to EVERY marriage
