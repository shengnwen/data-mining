I can't say I was disappointed in the book, I just didn't think it had much information in it that the public didn't already know. 
I cried thru out while reading Sharon Rocha's book and I thought Catherine Crier's book on the Scott Peterson case was very well written and there was knowledge of things we hadn't heard. I just don't understand why these jurors felt the need to write a book especially when there was nothing in it that hadn't been put on the news. Was it just for money? Did any of them contribute what they made off of this book to any charities or non profit organizations. I thought it was poorly written,
and the fact that Gloria Allred was behind the whole thing made it even worse. 
I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Not worth the money.....
Especially if none of it went to a good cause.  I did agree with the verdict but what was said in that book was stated many many times on the various news channels and talk shows
