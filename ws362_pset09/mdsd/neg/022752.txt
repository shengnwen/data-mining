My 12 year old daughter received this book as a gift and I am so glad that I decided to read it first. The book is very "teen-friendly" in it's approach, but it's message is anything but innocent. Let me quote an example from the book, "Your dad or mom might have told you not to have sex until marriage, but....the question is, what do YOU belive is right for you?"  There are many exaples such as this throughout this book.  I find this appalling and totally disrespectful not only parents, but to teachers and community leaders who are trying to encourage girls not only to have respect for themselves, but also others.  I Strongly urge parents to read this book before letting their daughters even open the first page.  I plan on throwing our copy into the trash
