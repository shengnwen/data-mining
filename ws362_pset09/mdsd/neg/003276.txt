Read the book, What Would Jesus Eat, but don't waste your time or money on the cookbook.  The book contains great common sense and Biblical reasoning for correcting the way we as Americans eat, and it includes plenty of recipes and instructions for changing your eating habits.  The cookbook was very disappointing and isn't in the same league as the book
