THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTLEY USELESS. I SHOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED IT. I BOUGHT THE OTHER BOOKS AS WELL AND THEY WERE FAR MORE HELPFUL THEN THIS BOOK. IF I WERE YOU, AND YOU WERE LOOKING TO BUILD WATERFALLS AND FOUNTAINS, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY A 12 Y/O. NO ACTUAL PHOTOS BUT DRAWINGS. IN FACT I GAVE THE BOOK TO THE LIBRARY AS A DONATION....
