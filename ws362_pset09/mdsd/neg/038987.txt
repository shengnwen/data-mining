Peter Carey is a pungent and bold prose stylist, who never shirks from taking huge risks in composing his very wild and very Australian novels. He certainly found an interesting voice for Ned Kelly in this tale. It takes talent to make a success out of a novel ventriloquising the story of a 19th Century Australian folk tale (little known outside that continent), but Carey has managed it (helped, of course, by a second Booker). Whether you like the novel will depend on whether you go for Carey's choice of narrative voice. I find that highly articulate, erudite novelists usually mess up when trying to ape the style and tone of an illiterate narrator. It's so hard to do, lose all that natural flair and polished style. 

Carey has Ned tell his story in an impassioned vernacular, pretending that Ned's narrative was found in several dirt stained, weathered manuscripts. It is Ned's memoir to his daughter, telling how he became a farmer, bushranger, outlaw and policeman killer. Personally, I found the tale surprisingly ungripping given the potential quality of the raw material. The jarring, monotonous vernacular was an assualt on the ear on every page. Ned has no knowledge of the comma (that item of punctuation never appears in his account) but unfaltering mastery of the apostrophe, with all its nuances - 'wasn't', 'isn't', 'they're' etc. Is this plausible? 

There are moments of raw beauty, that capture Ned's hard fought and tragic life, and the wild Australian outback. But I found this a pretty shabby, failed stylistic experiment of a book to truly enjoy it.
