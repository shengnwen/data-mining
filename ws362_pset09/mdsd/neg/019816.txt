I was looking forward to reading an in-depth biography of Miss McDaniel - this wasn't it.  Very dry reading, and for some reason the author felt the need to use the subject's full name in every sentence.  If you didn't know who you were reading about just by the title of the book, you would certainly be sure of it by the end of the first chapter.  By the end of the book, you were sick to death of the name Hattie McDaniel.  Definitely written by a teacher, not an author who had any interest at all in her subject.  A truly boring book
