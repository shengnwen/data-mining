I love all the other Little Bear books in her series but this one was strange.  I'm sure that 30 years ago it wouldn't have seemed odd to tell your child a story about kisses being passed from one person to another but in today's age it just left a strange feeling with me esp at the part where the skunks kept kissing eachother back & forth.  At least they get married at the end of the story.  I took it back to the libray.  Glad I didn't buy it.  I own all the others she wrote however and love them
