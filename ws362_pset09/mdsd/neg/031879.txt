I bristle at the suggestion that perhaps Roosevelt knew of the attack but did nothing to stop it, as if a repulsed sneak attack would not have convinced America to go to war.  The conspiracy theory holds that Roosevelt had the carriers shipped out of Pearl, leaving the obsolete battleships to be destroyed in the attack.  The one glaring problem with this theory (actually there are several problems, but I consider this the most compelling) can be summarized in a single word: oil.  A HUGE amount of oil was stored at Pearl, such a huge amount in fact that the carriers and subs would have been out of action probably for an entire year, if the oil had been destroyed.  The value of that oil was tremendous, and Roosevelt would have been absolutely demented to risk it.  It was pure luck that the Japanese did not target it (they actually planned to hit it on the aborted third run).  Additionally, Roosevelt was a former Navy Secretary who referred to the Army as &quot;them&quot; and the Navy as &quot;us&quot;.  It is way beyond belief that he would have sacrificed the battleships and their crews, much less the oil.  It's always sooooo simple to monday morning quarterback, a lesson to keep in mind today regarding Iraqi WMD
