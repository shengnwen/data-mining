NOTE: pay attention to the distinction between the ratings. 

Either it's 5 STARS or it's 1 STAR. very little in between.

Why is that? The 5 star people appear invested in her book, many of them make their living talking about CHANGE Management and business related issues. Some of them talk about being personally associated with the author or her personal interests. Is this relevant data for a book review? If what they want is to write fan letters, then they should do so on their time. Or if they want to set up a BLOG and yammer their platitudes, they can do that. But a review should be that, a thoughtful discussion of the merits, the good and the bad of any work. The 5 star people appear wholly unable to be neutral. In my opinion, too many people here are economically motivated:

a) to be seen as an authority in this forum, 

b) to flatter their colleagues and 

c) by the publisher to post exceedingly glowing reports.

What I would suggest is that the lack of nuance from the supporters and the over-the-top praise suggests payola.

The negative reviews give far more insightful and substantive review --which in this case is deservedly negative.

I give more weight to the negative reviews if only for their discussion of the BOOK itself, and not their personal opinions of the author, her sports agenda, their lovely luncheon last year, etc
