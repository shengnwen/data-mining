Mike writes well and is easy to understand.  I appreciated his honest depiction space travel (e.g. vomit on the windshield).  My reason for assigning two stars is that he presents a very narrow perspective of the NASA administration/organization decisions and liberally ridicules the decisions made.  I readily agree that NASA has its share of shortcomings, but I think that Mike's view of them is more reflective of his own limitations in organizational understanding than it is of NASA.  Ordinarily this would be ok, if we were talking about a 'Letter to the Editor' or an op-ed.  For example, he was incensed that non-astronaut personnel were allowed on missions, accusing NASA of failing to respect the queue (line of astronauts waiting to launch) and mission safety.  One word Mike, payload.

When NASA sent John Glenn back into space, Mike goes on a tirade.  Now NASA was queue-jumping with geriatrics.  What he failed to acknowledge in his writing was that this was the publicity stunt of the decade.  Rather than sending a handful of nameless astronauts on a tax-payer joyride, NASA pulled off an incredible publicity stunt.  Its widely held that NASA got more press coverage and public attention than it had since Columbia.  Mike is entitled to his own opinions, and I won't say they aren't without some merit; just be fore-warned that there's a lot of pent up emotion, a strong sense of entitlement, and a very apparent lack of well-rounded perception.
