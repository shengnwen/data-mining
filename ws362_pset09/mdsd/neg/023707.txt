The Bourne Identity by this author was great but this is a contrived, monumental bore.  Intricate plotting is only worth following if the themes and characters are worthy of attention.  This book is some kind of desperately single-minded, looney-left hate fest.  OK, you can say Hoover was a monster, and say it again 10 times, maybe even 50 or 60 times, but that does not a book make.  The world presented here is sick, but the sickness is the author's monomania
