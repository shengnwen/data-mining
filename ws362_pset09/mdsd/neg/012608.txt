Ms. Levi's discussion of Japanese animation has a two-fold purpose: she wants to explain why Americans find anime so fascinating while she dissects the symbolism behind anime itself.  Ms. Levi obviously has great affection towards Japanese history and religious culture, and if she were to write a book on those subjects exclusively, she would probably have a winner.  However, Samurai From Outer Space shows a careless disregard for the facts of many anime.  Some mistakes are so blatant that it brings the author's own knowledge of anime itself into question, and it undermines the credibility of the other material in the book.  According to the book's cover, the author has written books &quot;on subjects ranging from the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers to the Japanese Communist Party.&quot;  This diversity may be why her actual anime knowledge seems quite limited.  Nevertheless, the author's attitude can be read as haughty, and disrespect for Christianity and Western culture in general is also very apparent.  Finally, the book takes an outsider's view of Generation X--it's full of speculation on why this group enjoys anime so much, but there is never a sense that the author actually sat down with modern non-Asian anime fans and discussed the topic at length.  This is not to say that the book is without merits--indeed, it is very informative about Japanese legends and ancient culture, and good chunks of the book are useful if that's what you want to learn.  Bottom line: it's a decent book on Japanese tradition, but a lousy book on anime
