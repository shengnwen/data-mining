This book did not live up to expectations.  The discussions of the rounds did not tell the reader enough useful information.  There were a lot of fun to know facts - amaze your friends and all of that - but not enough information on how to use the round, good ranges to sight in the various rounds versus potential uses, reloading insights (best loads, best rifle twists for what bullet weight) and more of that kind of technical information.  That is why I only gave the book two stars
