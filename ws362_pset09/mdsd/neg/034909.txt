Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:

"Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."

"Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."

"I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."

"You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ...
