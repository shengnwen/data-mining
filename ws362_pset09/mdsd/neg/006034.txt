Bainbridge's book is divided in two parts. The larger part is a boring and rather meaningless comparisson of all kinds of superficial common points that could possibly be found between members of the cult and the US population. The shorter and more interesting section deals in part with the history of the "persecution" of the Family in Argentina. Clair Borrowick, high profile PR person in the United States who was imprisoned in Argentina for about 100 days is presented as somewhat of a missionary hero. I have read carefully what Bainbridge writes about the issue of sexual child abuse in the group and I coudn't find any clear evidence that he believes that such a problem existed. I had hoped that this last book by Bainbridge might had been a move in the same direction towards honesty and openness about their past.  Respectfully, Dr. Samuel Ajemia
