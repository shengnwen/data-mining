This is more of a reference book Mostly with drawings on brown paper making the stitches hard to see and no actuall instructions to guide you if you have never done them before. There are Many more books better for first timers Such as "The Magic of Crazy Quilting" by J Marsha Michler. It has nice black & white Drawings and color photos showing the stitches. THEN maybe this book will be helpfull...if you can get past the brown colored paper and black drawings. CHECK THIS ONE OUT OF THE LIBRARY FIRST! There is a book called "The Embroidery Stitch Bible" by Betty Barnden. It is a Nice 250 page Full Color Spirial Bound Book Just Loaded With Stitches For All Types Of Projects. A worthwhile investment if you do other things besides just quilting
