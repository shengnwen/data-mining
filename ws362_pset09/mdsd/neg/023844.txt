I had high hopes. But this book does not deliver. First, it's a kind-of guide for parents traveling with VERY young children. Second, it offers only the most basic common-sense advice: &quot;Don't drink the tap water in India&quot; kind of thing. There is a book to be written on this subject but this is not it
