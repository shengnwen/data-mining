This story takes place in 1985 at Zito`s house. Quint was his best friend. He always ate breakfast over there. He always carried a marble with him and they go to school and when they come home he had to eat dinner over Zito`s house. So they go and have fun eating stuff.

This story is mostly about two boys that always make jokes all the time about scrambled eggs. And is a story about food all they eat. Then Zito lost his marble and he said that Quint stole his marble but Quint did not take it. He told the teacher that Quint stole the marble that he liked so they started to yell at each other. Then school was out so they went home then Zito said he was very sorry. He said that he left the marble at his house so they became friends again

In my opinion this story was not that bad it was kind of  boring but it was good  not awesome but who cares about marbles and eggs
