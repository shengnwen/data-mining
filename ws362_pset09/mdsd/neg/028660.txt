This book is composed by Prof. David Rutledge.  His class required the book, which is the sole reason for the book entering my hands.  This book, and the related course EE20 were the bane of my existence.  The book is useless at explaining the basics of electronics.  The book solely serves as a cookbook for the construction of a NORCAL radio.  It fails at teaching important conecepts, and could only be used by the most faint-hearted hobbyist.  On a related note, I have a spare book if anyones interested in buying one.  As for now, it just holds up one end of my dorm room bed
