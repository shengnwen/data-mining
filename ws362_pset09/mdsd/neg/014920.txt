I greatly enjoyed some of Varley's later work, so I decided to back up and try this series.  I am relieved I only bought the first book.  Its shallow characters and predictable plotline left me unwilling to read very far in it.  Worse, to my unpleasant surprise, it has line drawing illustrations clearly aimed at the fantasy life of adolescent males - don't read this in an airport where a child and her outraged mother might catch a glimpse of the illustrations.  Sorry I bought it but I give it 2 stars rather than 1 because there is at least some effort at a plot
