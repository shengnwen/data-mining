This was a waste of my time! I sat there and read about this boy and what he could do!  Then read about more kids and what they were good at. It should have another title about not labeling our kids or something. Not late talking children that makes me think that is going to help me with my late talker. Why was this even published. I could go and write about my son and how he is sooo smart but doesn't talk yet. WOW you would really care!
