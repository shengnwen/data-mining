The book may be entertaining to read because of the way Mankiw sets his examples. Unfortunately what we have in our hands is the same irrealistic exposition of how the economy works that has been dominating university curriculums from the first day Adam Smith was appointed at Glasgow. As an example I may cite my personal experience as a teaching assistant. When explaining the comparative advantage theory I obviously gave the Ricardian demonstration of the theory. But when I wanted to treat the absolute advantage theory, Marx's name was nowhere to be found. Even Samuelson devoted some pages to Marx's contribution to economic theory. President Bush's economic advisor seems to lack objective exposition when dealing with basic economic theories. I don't consider myself to be paranoid, but the economics curriculum, and it's instruments, such as this book, only serve a mode of reproduction of the dominant ideology, which we all know has lots of contradictions that everyday spring up in everybody's life. It is time to bring to the market a more balanced exposition of the various tendencies within economics, even if the course is described as being introductory. Most of the people who take these basic courses don't even know that there are alternative paradigms. They just finish their Mankiw's as if nothing else could be thought about how the economy really works
