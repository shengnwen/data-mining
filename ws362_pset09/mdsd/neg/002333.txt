This book does not provide enough examples, and the few they do give are nothing like the work problems. Every teacher I've had has said if they were not required to use it, they would use a different book. And on top of that, it is ridiculously expensive!  I have finally been forced to get another text book, and it is much better (and cheaper). Do not get this book if you have a choice
