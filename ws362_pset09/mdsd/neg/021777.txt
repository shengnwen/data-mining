I buy these kind of books to decide what activities to do on vacation with my family. I do  not buy these books to listen to an author complain about peoples religion, political beliefs, or any of the sort.    If this author  would have made the comments about a Black Community about a community that  has a large Mormon population he would have be censored and his writing  rejected.     Although the book does give some good information about local  communities, it pales in comparison to the detailed information given in  the Wyoming and Montana versions that I have.     To bad the author was to  busy bashing Amtrak, Mormons, and Conservatives, instead of giving accurate  information. The author fails to point out several points of interest that  I do know of
