This is not the translation by Arthur Waley (which is very good) but the one by D.C. Lau. Since Lau's translation was first published, a number of advances have been made in the field of Warring States Period scholarship which render a fair amount of the supporting material obsolete (see &quot;The Original Analects&quot; by Brooks and Brooks for the latest). As for the translation itself, it's rife with awkward and mystifying word choices -- for instance, in a passage in chapter 11 in which the disciple Zilu (Tzu-lu, in Wade-Giles romanization, which Lau uses) gets the better of Confucius in an argument, Waley translates the Master's retort, &quot;It is remarks of that kind that make me hate glib people,&quot; and the Brookses and Huang Chichung make similar choices; but Lau renders it, &quot;It is for this reason that I dislike men who are plausible.&quot; Similar mishandlings of connotation appear throughout the book. For an old-fashioned translation, Waley's is a hundred times better
