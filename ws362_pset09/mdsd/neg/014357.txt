I would like to totally agree with reviewer Veronica Anzaldua. Your weight, diet, and exercise has far more to do with your lifespan and the function of your immune system than marriage does. As a registered nurse and a Certified Health Education Specialist, I am far more qualified than either of these two authors to discuss the subject of health. Having worked at both the Texas Heart Institute and the MD Anderson Cancer Center, I can tell you that there are many married patients under 50 years of age who are very ill and have even died at a young age. My husband is a cardiologist at THI and he will also back me up on this 100% I am not against marriage by any means. Marriage is wonderful when it is a good one. However, a much more appropriate title for this book would have been Why HAPPILY Married People are .....Even in this case, a person would have to have a healthy lifestyle in order to ensure and long life and good health. You can have the best marriage in the world, but if you are 100+ pounds overweight and live a sedentary life. Guess What? You are still at risk for diabetes, heart disease, and cancer! Likewise, a single woman or man who leads a healthy lifestyle, is no more at risk for a disease than a married woman or man. By the way, cancer does not discriminate between married and unmarried people. I hope that no one would ever be dumb enough to believe that marriage is the answer all of their health problems. I can't believe that these two women (with ZERO medical credentials) are making health claims!
