One of the hallmarks of Chuck Pahlaniuk's writing style is to establish a few gimmicky writing contraptions in the first chapter and then build a plot around these repeating structures.

In Pahlaniuk's best works, like Fight Club and Lullaby, these repeating motifs add to the storyline and repetition drives home subtle points about each. But in Diary, I found these structures -- repeated faco-muscular descriptions, the constant second person reference to Peter Wilmot as You, and the emotional weather descriptions -- to be more of a distraction rather than an aide to the plot. 

And the plot is rather thin. The ending left me cold. I felt like I wasted my time. This book is all mood and smoke, dreamy, disconnected ideas and gimmicks, and not much else
