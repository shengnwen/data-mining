By even acknowledging the stereotypes, as the book does, it is perpetuating the stereotypes. You all should go read some post-colonial critics.

The--well I hesitate to call it a book, since it's actually a graphic novel, but for ease of writing I'll call it a book--book has a character that reinforces the stereotypes; and, although it does show the mean spiritedness of people/society, the character, which I'm not going to call by name, so strongly embodies all of those stereotypes that it forces the reader to view similar characters/persons through the same lens. You run in to similar problems with great works of literature as well--yes, I am saying that this is absolutely not a great work--like Heart of Darkness and As I Lay Dying
