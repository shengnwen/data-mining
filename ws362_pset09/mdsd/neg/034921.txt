My aim was to buy a PSAT prep book that would prepare for the test.  I, knowing very little about the reputations of various SAT prep companies, ended up purchasing this book because it was the cheapest on the rack at Borders.  I was, however, immensely disappointed on the quality of instruction it offered.  The first sample test was utterly glutted with errors and mistakes.  I also heard later that the questions weren't even real PSAT questions.  Personally, I plan on contacting Barron's so I can receive a full refund
