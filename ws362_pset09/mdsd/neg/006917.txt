The puzzles are great and a lot of fun for my two-year old. She loves anything 'princessy' so the princesses were a big selling point. However, after she did each puzzle a couple of times, the pieces didn't stay in the book. When we'd flip the page, all the pieces from that page would fall out. We ended up taking all the pieces out and putting them in a container, which is not the point of the book at all! At least the backs of the pieces are colored specifically for one puzzle in the book, and my daughter gets practice at sorting her colors for half an hour before we can play with her puzzles.
