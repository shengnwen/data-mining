I work as a stockbroker & currently study for an MBA at one of the business schools in New York. I was looking for an additional text on Finance to supplement my required reading list. I came across this book at a local bookstore last week & was quite impressed with the title...

As I flipped through, I found nothing interesting and of benefit for my MBA... How could this kind of low-rate work ever make it to the shelf?

What a piece of JUNK
