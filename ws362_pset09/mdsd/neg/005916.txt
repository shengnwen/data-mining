Ok so the premise for the book is a good one, one star earned there. But the execution is retarded. For one, HH has the United States progress through four years of industrialization in a matter of months, completely ignoring the obvious impossibilities of such a rapid change in 1861. Second, how the hell could three/four corps conquer America and reincorperate the Americans back into the British empire, the limeys were not stupid as they are in this book. Basically the book completely devolves into a series of mindless drivel, entertaining drivel, one star
