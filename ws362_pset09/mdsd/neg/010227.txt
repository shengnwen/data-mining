The title was rather seductive ... but I was disappointed, if validated. I am by no means mom of the year, but I think I already follow most of what the book suggests. This book is likely good for parents who are gobsmacked by newly emerged bad behaviors and recalcitrance, but those of us who have spent any time with the "Spririted," "Explosive" and "Active/Alert" child books will have seen/implemented most of the recommendations already.
