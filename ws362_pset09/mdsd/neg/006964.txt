Perhaps I'm spoiled by Dave Baum's great books but I found this book very frustrating.  Some of the bots are interesting but I was unable to build most of them because they require extra parts that don't come in the Lego Mindstorms RIS.  That'd be OK if the book told you what extra part syou need but I'd get 70% done and find myself short 6 #3 elbows (or whatever).  True, he lists the needed parts before each bot, but he doesn't tell you which ones aren't part of the RIS.  Baum does.  Also, the pictures in the book lack contrast so it is hard to see details and the &quot;steps&quot; aren't specific.  Buy the Baum books instead
