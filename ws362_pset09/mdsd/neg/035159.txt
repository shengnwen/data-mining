I wasted too much time on this book thinking there must be some great ending.  Wrong.  The main character narrowly escapes two evil men in her life to instantly blow her cover and fall in love with someone else almost as soon as she meets him.  I'm sorry, but I don't think the woman would be thinking ANYTHING about love and romance at this point in her life and I don't think she would trust another man for a LONG time.  This book has too many ridiculous, unbelieveable twists and turns.  If they were believeable it would be OK.  It just seemed like it was written by someone with no experience with the attitude "now what else can I make happen to her?"  Ridiculous, boring, and down-right stupid in my opinion
