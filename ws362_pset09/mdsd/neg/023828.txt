I have read several books on ADD and found this book to be full of the same old falacies and myths about Nutrition, medication and biofeedback as all the rest, and none of it works! It was a waste of my time and money. Don't bother!

The most helpful book that I have read is The ADD & ADHD answer Book by Dr. Susan AShley Ph.D.
