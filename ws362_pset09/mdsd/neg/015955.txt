This book is a feeble attempt to promote a philosophy that is contradictory to conventional judaeo-Christian values and tenets upon which this country was founded. The author has the brazen supremist attitude that her beliefs must be imposed upon other more rational Gof-feaing Americans. If she is unhappy with the progress and direction the country is taking she should buy a one way ticket back to he homeland. This country was built upon the idea that we are blessed compared to all other countries. The measures she is promoting we introduce into our society are in opposition to the views and ideals shared by the majority of the citizens of this country. She argues that we abandon our values and replace them with her heretical beliefs and standards. What a self-centered, empty person who is bereft of any sense of values. This book wreaks of a disconnect with the sensibilties of what made our country a model for all others
