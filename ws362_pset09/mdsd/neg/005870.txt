I own a lot of cookbooks and have honestly never purchased a more ridiculous book. Seven ingredients or less, yes - it's easy when you're using canned soup, prepared chili or bottled marinade. The recipes feature a lot of processed ingredients too like non-dairy creamer for potato chowder. And I don't need a slow cooker to make tea - 8 teabags, water, mint extract and splenda - 2 hours in the old slow cooker and voila, you have something that should take ten minutes to make. Convenient - maybe, Easy - yes, Delicious, no way
