To rate this item is a waste of time.  I read it.  It obviously came from a person who has no leadership qualities.  Leaders all believe different things.  I am, in fact, fiscally conservative and a staunch defender of freedom, civil liberities, and the USA.  So, when Fidel came to my doorstep as a topic, I knew he was dog. 

But wait....then I read history - Fidel's, his dad's, Che's, Kennnedy's, Jesus's, etc.  What marks a leader?  The label good or bad changes from decade to decade with each new generation digging into history differently.  Again, what marks a a true leader?

My conclusion was that a true leader defends his (or her) beliefs period.  History will bring to light different opinions based thereon forever.  Villians will become heroes and heroes will become villians.  But those men (and women) who are willing to stand alone against great odds and then inspire others to do likewise are true leaders.  Fidel is one, no one can deny that;  the question is could you stand alone on such a tough landscape as he did against such a powerful and physically close enemy as the US was to him?   Most likely, no.  His tactics, called communist, socialist, or whatever, were simply that....tactics.  He did not care what he had to do to preserve his country's independence from the USA.  From a conservative such as myself, Fidel is the strongest leader we have seen this century and definitely in contention with FDR, Hitler, and Stalin in pure strength.  If the USA were in someone else's shadow, I would hope that a leader would staunchly defend her so.  I can entirely put myself in his shoes.  Can you?  

Good and bad are definitions left to God not us
