Brown's work is nothing save self-serving, poorly written, half-thought out tripe: I would call it pablum for the masses, save that this seems to overstate the value of the work.  There is naught of value here.  This marks nothing more, or less, than a voyeuristic/self-indulgent (depending, of course, upon one's point of readership) excursis upon a tragedy.  Brown does no service to the memories of those whose lives were senselessly disrupted.  Much of his writing is spiteful, presenting himself as a figure of authority, qualified to comment upon the role of violence in modern American society.  

What credentials does the author present?  This I ask..
