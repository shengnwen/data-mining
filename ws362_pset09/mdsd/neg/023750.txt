If you used books by Lynda, you're expectations are usually high. This book is easy to use but at the expense of depth. To be honest, I could not go past lesson 5. The use of a poorely animated monkey turned me off. I could not imagine myself exposing this book to my students. After effects students are usually demanding. Most of them have been through Photoshop, premiere classes, etc. They expect a book that teaches them Hollywood style effects. I had to use the AE books by Meyer. They meet student expectations
