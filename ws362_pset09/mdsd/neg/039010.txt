I am shoked that this book got an average score of 4 stars.
Yes, I read it even after I swore never to read another dragonlance book again.

I wont get into the details of the book except to say it is yet one more disgrace to the once great Dragonlance saga.

If the book had gotten 2 or 3 stars I might think it was just a disagreement of tastes.  But 4 stars makes me think the rating system is somehow being manipulated
