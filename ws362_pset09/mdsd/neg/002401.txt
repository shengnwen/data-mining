Here's how it goes: the characters you've been getting to know the whole book, the mysterious Shrike you've been hearing about the whole book, the huge mysterious cataclysmic confrontation that's been anticipated and planned the whole book... DOESN'T HAPPEN.  And it's not as if the characters die on the way there or the planet blows up or something, no.  We see them... marching toward the climax... ready to face the Shrike... and then... boom.  It's over.  That's it.  This, by itself, would be terrible.  It's made even worse because, as the pilgrims near their destination, they hold hands, walk side by side, and sing... "We're Off to See the Wizard."  Yup, it's that stupid.  And, like I said, they don't even GET there.  The book abruptly ends.  I've read other reviews that say this and "Fall" are really one big story.  Not an excuse.  The ending is a total and complete cheat, the laziest writing I have ever seen.  Even if there is a sequel, there ought to be SOME kind of closure.  I'm not planning on reading any more Simmons books, as I have no faith whatsoever that he can write a complete novel.
