On the plus side, this book is fairly easy to understand and contains sufficient pictures of the exercises.  I was very excited at first, but unfortunately none of the exercises, massages, meditations, etc I tried seemed to help any of my health problems, even after a month.  The book contains inspiring stories of people who have quickly recovered from serious illness or injury, yet leaves me crying in disappointment.  I will probably keep trying a few of the exercises and methods for awhile, but I don't hold any hope of them suddenly starting to work at this point
