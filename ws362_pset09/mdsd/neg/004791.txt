	This is a horrible, stunningly horrible, book. It has, sadly, persuaded me 
	that I cannot simply trust the O'Reilly brand as signifying, if not the 
	best book in a particular area, at least a worthwhile book.
	The central problem is that this book has no idea what it wants to be.
	It tries to be a tutorial, a cookbook and a reference, all intermingled. 
	One paragraph it's trying to talk to newbies, the next it assumes you are 
	a long time Apache veteran. 
	One role, however, that it seems to have no interest in playing is that 
	of giving the big picture, of describing exactly what Apache can (and 
	can't) do in a given area, and why you might care, before getting into various nitty gritty.
	I'm afraid I can't recommend a good book on Apache to buy; I would 
	however urge you to stay away from this one. The worst shovelware out, 
	Sams Teach yourself Apache in 24hrs or Apache for Dummies, cannot be 
	worse than this sad failure.
	(This reviews version 3 of the book. I have no idea if versions 1 and 2 
	were less dreadful.
