This has got to be the worst book I've ever read. How convenient that Amazon lists the good reviews first. That means most people won't read this. However, I'll give my two cents worth anyway. Several previous reviews state this book is funny, it's not! The book has no plot, no ending, and only a very fragmented, mostly deranged stream of thought in between. I can only guess that Ms. Smith was trying to be clever with her rambling list of web sites, use of etc. every few lines and endless droning on about cliches. It all falls flat because it all leads to no where and nothing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Save your money for something by a different author
