This book is absolutely flawed in its arguements.  Schlesinger ignores the context of the times; he ignores basic truths; he is jaded in his outlook.  By all accts., Mr. Schlesinger is a New Deal Democrat who tries to firmly tie in the New Deal Democrats into the Democrats of old.  This is not feasible as the Democrats of old and the New Deal Democrats had differing perspectives and ideals.  He reaches and stretches with the intent of the Democrats in the Age of Jackson, that they were always for the laboring classes, when this is not the case, especially in Southern Democrats who were aristocratic in nature and outlook.  They could not comprehend the plight of the ordinary laborer, as their world view was quite skewed.  Further, divisions that were slowly emerging between Northern and Southern Democrats, primarily over the slavery issue, are discounted and Schlesinger merely goes back to his jaded perspective that the Democrats were the champions of the common people.  Schlesinger imposes his own view of politics and parties on politicians from the Age of Jackson.  There are other works out there that are 100 times better on the Age of Jackson that this work, such as The House Divides: The Age of Jackson and Lincoln, from the War of 1812 to the Civil War edited by Paul Wellman and Lewis Gannett or The Era of Good Feelings and the Age of Jackson, 1816-1841 by Robert Remini.

However, I will give the man credit where it is due, he does his research.  Pity he doesn't know what to do with it
