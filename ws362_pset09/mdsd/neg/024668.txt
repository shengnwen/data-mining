This book is the "official authorized guide" to the world of 007. It's just a pity that the authors are obviously not real Bond fans. The book casually glides past Fleming;s novels and the Bonds themselves and instead does a film-by-film recap. This would be nice were it not for the fact that you often get the sense that the authors were trying to divide Bond fans into 2 distinct camps rather than prasing the series as a whole. My personal tastes were also insulted as brilliant movies like "man With The Golden Gun" and "A View To A Kill" are slammed, mocked, and scorned, while later on they gush and sing the praises of the dull villain Carver from "Tomorrow Never Dies", and stop just short of calling George Lazenby the best Bond ever. I couldn't help getting a sense that this book was written to be deliberatley provocative and irritating, and really that's not what you want in a book called "The Essential Bond"
