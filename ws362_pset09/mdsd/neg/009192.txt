In "God Knows", Joseph Heller attempts to tell the story of King David through arrogant eyes.  Rather than finding David intelligent or witty, I just found him annoying.  In a long book, this is not a good thing.  The story seems verbose while lacking the strong social commentary of Heller's other works.

The attempts at humor made throughout the book missed the target for me because the characters were beyond my liking.  While I did find the occasional snicker on some pages, I found myself wishing for the pain to end.  The endless jokes about circumcision were almost as painful as the operation itself.

I have enjoyed Heller's other books including "Catch-22" and "Something Happpened".  To me, this book just missed the mark which may be why this is not one of his better known works.  Others may enjoy this book, but it is certainly not for everybody
