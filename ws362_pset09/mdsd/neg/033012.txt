Sorry to say it, but this book is not very good at all.  There is no depth or scope to it, not getting inside the people.  The writing it tricky and flashy and does not balance out with the horrors these people perpetrated.  I do not believe this author got to know his subject matter very well, and has offered only a glib, clever style to cover up for his lack of understanding his subject.  I have read the book, MANSON, by John Gilmore, and find it to be the best one showing the Manson side of the story.  HELTER SKELETR shows it from the police side.  Either are better than this poorly done book
