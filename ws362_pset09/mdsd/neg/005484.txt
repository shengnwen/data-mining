As a senior management exec, I'd have to say that this book was of no help at all. Although it has helped the supposed top ten companies with purchasing, I have used a completely different strategy using simple purchasing techniques. I suggest you read, "Managing and Purchasing Problem Solvers" by Jonathan T. Monczka. This book is much more efficent describing management principles clearly. I do not reccomend "The Purchasing Machine" at all.
