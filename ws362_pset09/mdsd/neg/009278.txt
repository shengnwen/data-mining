One year it's: Eat every 3 hours. The next year it's: Eat every 5 to 6 hours. I WILL try taking antioxidants before I go walking in the morning. Frankly, I get so sick of all this diet stuff--everyone wants to get rich on their brilliant ideas. The "elephant in the room" is: Eat less, exercise more. Period. If that doesn't work, eat even less, exercise even more. Sorry, I'm not going to waste any more money on diet books
