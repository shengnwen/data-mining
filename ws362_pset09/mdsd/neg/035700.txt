Greene is a conman, you dopes! You're being set up to buy this watered down Machiavellian compost, using the 50% of his "laws" that don't contradict the other 50%. 

He gets you to believe that your selfishness and aspirations to megalomania you possess are justified, desirable, and trustworthy. You're all going to die, sorry. Try to imagine what they'll be saying at your funeral, no matter how rich and powerful you (in your dreams) become by using the self-contradicting nonsense in this book. "Man, what a selfish prick" would certainly be among the most commonly heard expressions of sentiment.
