 I think the book touches on good stuff but I there's too much time referencing other people's works. Also, none of the information goes into detail; for example, the chapter on The Basics of Personal Reportage reads like an outline with the authors touching on key points and then moving on to different topic. The sections of the book are not even a page long. I just wish there were more writing help vs outline and trying to show their Knowledgeable by talking about other's work.
