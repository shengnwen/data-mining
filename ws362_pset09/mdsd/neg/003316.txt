Seems like people either love this book or hate it.  Unfortunately I am in the latter category.  This book was not what I'd expected or hoped.  Although I could relate to the author's constant state of chaos as a mother, I could not relate to her incessant analysis of the world, chronic anxiety and unnecesary self-examination.  I found it too sociological and political and not at all funny.  It is the first book I have ever stopped reading & returned to the store.
