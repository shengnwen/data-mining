This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.  

Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.  

Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!

This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did
