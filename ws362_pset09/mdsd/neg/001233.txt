Sally Mann hasn't a clue how to capture the souls of those she photographs!  If you are looking for artistic shots of 12 year olds then this book isn't for you.  The picture on the cover is deceiving about the books contents.  You're better off with buying the David Hamilton books (oh and by the way he is much better at photographing his subjects than Sally Mann could ever hope to be).
