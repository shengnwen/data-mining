If ESP, including remote viewing, telepathy and psychokinesis actually worked, we would be living in a much different world. Osama bin Laden would be unable to hide from the US military. Missing persons like Elizabeth Smart wouldn't go missing for long. Casinos would be out of business very quickly. But ESP doesn't work, and thus the world is as we know it.

So then, how can reports like those in Mind-Reach be explained? I have my doubts as to the accuracy of the account in Mind-Reach, but even taking it at face value, weaknesses in the experiments are obvious. In one remote viewing experiment, the viewer describes an A-frame building with a 4-sided ornament on the wall. This is matched to a windmill. In another experiment, the viewer describes an A-frame building with a 4-sided ornament on the wall. This time it is matched to a church. In another experiment, a viewer observing a nature sanctuary draws a tunnel of regular geometric shapes. This is matched to a utility tower near the site. Compare this drawing to the pedestrian overpass depicted in another experiment. One has to wonder.
