This book is a brutal read. It is so dry and dull; I only purchased it because of my Anthropology course required it. I never truly read past the 3rd chapter; after then, I just began skimming and trying to salvage my grade. The book is plagued with too many descriptions and adjectives, the book really never gets anywhere, nor does it pick up speed and get interesting. The book is written by an anthropology student who traveled to Puerto Rico to document its people and culture. This is seriously like reading a term paper. If you want to learn about Puerto Rican life.... I don't know what to tell you, maybe try to catch something on TV.
