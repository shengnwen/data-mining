I bought this book online and was not able to see it like I would in a book store. Had I seen it I would never have purchased this book and will never read it to my 6 year old son! It went from suggesting eating your dinner quickly to wiping a dirty jar on your close to cutting holes in a jar lid with scissors quietly so your mom won't catch you. One of the illustrations shows a boy holding scissors wide open with his hand on the inside of the open blades. I would never read it to any child and think the message is just horrible. Yes it is fun to catch fireflys but I know this could have been done better without the dangerous suggestions and disregard for listening to adults and being careful
