If the children in your life don't know the names of enough women singers or film actresses, this is for them.  Or if they need a timeline showing when poodle skirts and miniskirts were in vogue, this is the book.  For someone who professes to love history, and to believe  "A system of education that fails to nurture memory of the past denies its students a great deal," Ms. Cheney has written an apallingly bad book.

Okay, an alphabet book of women in American history is unlikely to convey any important information, and I don't normally object to books whose focus is women neglected in mainstream history.  But this book doesn't help.  If anything it makes it all worse.  Women of color are so clearly tokens here.  Harriet Tubman was a brave and noble woman, but she's mentioned three times, and her's are the only references to slavery in the book.  Three Native American women are mentioned:  Pocohantas, Sacajawea, and Wilma Mankiller.  There are more mentions of Hollywood actresses (all dead except for Lauren Bacall).  

This is the sort of book that brings up Amelia Bloomer repeatedly, while ignoring devlopments that affect millions, such as the criminalization of abortion and birth control in the mid-1800s, or the efforts of Emma Goldman and Margaret Sanger, or even the gradual end of childbed fever as the number one killer of mothers.  This is a book that mentions The Industrial Revolution for providing mill work to women and children.  I cannot possibly heap enough scorn on this work
