Not a book for the beginner. Used too many terms without giving any  reference. I had to refer to other books just to find out what the author  was talking about. Alot of medical, longwinded jargon that isn't useful in  real life when a simplified, straight-forward description would suffice. If  you have a horse and you want to learn how to take care of your charge I  would not recommend this book to do it. Great book for a medical student
