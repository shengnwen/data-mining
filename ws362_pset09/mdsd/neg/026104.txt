I am a first year veterinary student, and I bought this book thinking it would be a good tool for reviewing my anatomy.  Definitely not the case!!!  The book is not detailed enough to satisfy the veterinary student (at least not at Tufts!).  This is especially true for the nerves and bones.  I would recommed getting the Evans and deLahunta "Guide to the Dissection of the Dog" instead, and coloring in their black and white illustrations
