The inside cover makes this seem like a book where the lead is choosing between her two "first loves"--a man and ballet.  

It is a depressing, terrible read.  The characters are psychotic.  The family relationships dysfunctional for the most part and the characters are extremely needy in a way that is not entertaining.

I managed to skim the last half of the book and honestly, it just gets worse and worse with each turn of the page.

I'm almost embarassed to admit I've read this book
