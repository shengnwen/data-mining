My mom gave me this book and asked me to read it and give her my opinion of it.  Next time I spoke to her I had to tell her, "I'm sorry, I just couldn't get through it."  I slogged through the first chapter, but I grew increasingly fed up with Arthur's vapid writing style (to me, the book reads like the diary of a thirteen-year-old girl, and not a particularly clever thirteen-year-old girl at that).  I also couldn't stomach her constant use of the editorial "we" in a decidedly non-scholarly work.  She constantly talks about how "we feel" or what "we think" about Austen's characters, attempting to stamp me, the reader, with her own attitudes and beliefs in a way I found insulting.  I wanted to shout, "Don't tell me what I think!  Talk about what *you* think, if you think anyone cares, but don't insist that I follow sheeplike in your path and subordinate my own ideas to yours!"  The final straw was her moralistic attitude.  While it's only natural for the author's religious beliefs to inform her attitudes toward dating and relationships, I found her constant references to God and faith and moral character and God's plan for humanity to be oppressive.  I might have been able to tolerate either the giggly schoolgirl style or the sententious moralism by itself, but the combination defeated me.  If you're looking for a book that analyzes romantic relationships in the light of Jane Austen's novels, try _Jane Austen's Guide to Dating_ instead; it's not perfect by any means, but it's a much more enjoyable read than this one
