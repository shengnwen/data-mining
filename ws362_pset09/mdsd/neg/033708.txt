I will admit that I did not finish the book (a rare thing for me) although I gave it 150 pages of my attention.  Canticle for Leibowitz was wonderful so I was pleased to find this "sequel."  However, even standing alone, not being compared to the first, this book is meandering and confusing.  I was intrigued by the approach to post-apocalyptic sexuality (not something in Canticle) but that wasn't enough to keep me reading.  One needs good characters and a good story, and this book doesn't have either.

Read A Canticle for Leibowitz, but skip this one.
