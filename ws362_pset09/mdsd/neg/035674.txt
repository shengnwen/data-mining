I used this text for pre-med biology course-- I was simulataneously taking Biochemistry as well, but more on that later.

The text, while not overwhemingly as detailed as other reviewers write, was all in all okay, but fell short in many areas.  One of them is the distinct typographical and grammatical errors that riddled, what seemed, to be the only chapters we covered.  There were many sentences that were run-ons, which disrupted the learning and flow of the text (and, in my opinion, a textbook backed by such a major publisher as this, errors like that are out of the question).

Sometimes, for instance in the TCA chapter, I felt that the material presented on Oxidative Phosphorylation seemed out of order, and just a bit too condensed.

The photosynthesis chapter was utterly horrible.

The exercises at the end were poorly written, and seemed to ask esoteric questions about common topics.  The answers to these questions were esoteric still.

I felt that the only saving grace about this were the wonderful pictures: I liked how each chapter opened up an exhaustive diagram.  Other than that, this is book pretty much only a decent cell bio book, but no biochemistry one
