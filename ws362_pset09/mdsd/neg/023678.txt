What a wonderful book ODD THOMAS was!  What a total disappointment FOREVER ODD is.  What happened Dean?  Did you have to meet a quick deadline or something and just couldn't come up with an idea?  

If you really liked ODD THOMAS don't destroy your respect for it by reading FOREVER ODD.  It is really just a junked up piece up literature to keep the ODD thing going on.  

I love so many of Dean's books, but you can always tell when he is just trying to throw a piece of trash out there to meet a deadline.  This is one of them. Save your money.  Don'y buy it.  Go get your original ODD THOMAS book and read it again for free.

Sheesh Dean .... help us fans out a little here buddy !!
