I read 'Russian journal' soon after it was published and was thoroughly enarmored both with the content and the style of the book. Having lived in the Soviet Union for many years, I remember being impressed by the ability of the author to understand and convey the nuances of the life and atmosphere in 'mysterious' Russia. I've been watching out for and reading her work ever since. Reading her subsequent books, especially 'Interesting women', a collection of stories, gave me an almost secret pleasure, like I was the only one watching her talent grow and blossom.
So I had no apprehension when I started reading her latest. Good thing I borrowed it from the library. The only reason I bothered to finish it is that I couldn't believe it would not redeem itself, at least somewhat, before it ends. It didn't. It has 'tentative, hopeful screenplay' written all over it. But even if someone does option it, it can't possibly make for an interesting movie. It has completely unoriginal and cardboard characters, no plot to speak of, trite situations and language. Yes, sometimes I did encounter some glimpses of Ms Lee's former style and force of observation. But on the whole the book reads more like another romance novel than a work of a talented writer that Ms Lee undoubtedly is. Huge letdown. Did I say pretentious? 
And what's with this comparison, on page 80: '(Nick) Tall with his straight fair hair and a face that everyone in his office tells him looks as American as a baby's behind'?
For more reasons for my dislike of the book - see review by Vaughn A. Carney. A literary 'one-trick pony' seems like an especially apt description
