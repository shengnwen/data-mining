This is the most disappointing book I have read on the topic of discernment, and I have read dozens. The book's misleading subtitle is "Finding Answers to the Deepest Questions", yet the reader is given little if any indication of how to do so.  The author would most likely agree that we can't "find answers" in such a hard and fast way. Then why print this in the subtitle?

The vast majority of the book is spent listing what is "not", in the author's view, the appropriate way of discerning God's will. We are left with very little. 
It is unfortunate that the book is packaged the way that it is. The dramatic title of the book seems to be marketing to pop culture, yet it isn't written with the layman in mind.  The author's own views on appropriate discernment techniques aren't mentioned until very late in the book, which confuses the reader throughout the duration. I wish he spent less time criticizing Parker Palmer, and more time stating his own beliefs.      

I bought this book, in part, because I trusted Marcus Borg's recommendation. What a disappointment.
Instead I would suggest "Inviting the Mystic, Supporting the Prophet" by Katherine Dyckman and L. Patrick Caroll, or "Urgings of the Heart" by Wilkie Au and Noreen Cannon.  Advanced readers might enjoy "Spiritual Direction - Beyond the Beginnings," by Janet K. Ruffing. While some of these books are intended for spiritual directors, many who are interested in discernment may also find them helpful.
