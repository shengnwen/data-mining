I last read Dante's "Comedy" in college. I thaught it might be rewarding to read it again, 40 years later. Now everybody finds out what a low-brow I am. "The Comedy" is a collection of nonsense from an age so seeped in religious nonsense that nothing was in excess in the name of God. Considered a "Classic" by generations of Christian zealots. I consider it (brace yourselves) trash.
