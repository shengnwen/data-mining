I would have given this book *five* stars, had it not been for the shoddy - literal translation from Italian to English.  Being an Italian speaker, I sometimes had to re-read certain sentences with my &quot;Italian&quot; hat on to discern the meaning.  This would have been an excellent book if the translation had been both literary and cultural but it is neiter.  This, unfortunatly, detracts from the book a great deal as some references are not explained to the english-reading audiance who may not be familiar with Italian history.  Since Italians use a great many words to describe something that would only take a few in English- the literal translation makes them read like run-ons and often leaves the reader lost at the end.  If you are able to overcome all these obstacles, the content of the book is enlightning and educational.  I learned that industrial olive-growing in Greece was implemented when they were under Venitian rule and that the fork, was originally a small spear that eventually became the four-pronged utensil that we now know with the development of newer, longer, slippery pasta shapes
