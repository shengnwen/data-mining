I read a LOT of chick lit and knowing they're not all Pulitzer worthy, I was surprised at how boring I found Confessions of a Nervous Shiksa.  There's a LOT of skipping around in chronology which sometimes works but doesn't here, the characters seem undeveloped, and hello, the main character is mean to a dying dog.  Maybe some find that to be not so bad but how does that make me want to keep reading about this person?  By the end of the book I felt like the character hardly made any advances, and those that she did make were only revealed in the last 10 pages or so.  Don't bother paying full price -- this one'll be remaindered soon and you'll find it at a used book sale or outlet store
