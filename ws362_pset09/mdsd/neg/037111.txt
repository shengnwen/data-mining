I was so disappointed in this book, particulary after reading some of the glowing reviews. I can't believe it cost almost $40 for this paperback! I had to slog through pages and pages of information to find the recipes - and the amounts to make were in a different place in the book. The cat recipes are buried at the back of those for dogs, too - why couldn't he have separated out the info. for cats into a separate chapter!? The recipes are hard to follow (e.g., how much is 10 grains of bone meal? the only bone meal I could find was in a health food store and it's powdered - I have no idea how much to put in each batch). My cats won't touch most of the stuff I've concocted using this book and they still throw up the stuff they will eat (chicken and rice). I can't believe I'm stuck with this book now. What a waste of my hard-earned $$!
