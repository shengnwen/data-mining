This book is an interesting read - for anyone who is not initiated into Palo Mayombe or Quimbanda! It represents Raul Canizares' OWN INTERPRETATION of these traditions and represents Palo and Kimbanda - yet again - as being "dark and mysterious"! To hyped-up for my taste! If you are interested in Palo, find a good Tata and study with him or stick with Lydia Cabrera's books. For anyone interested in the Brazilian Qimbanda/Kimbanda tradition, have a look at NA GIRA DO EXU by Mario dos Vento
