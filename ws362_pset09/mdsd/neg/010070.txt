Two things about Mr. Tower's book are original. The use of menus to drive his narrative, and his food. Unfortunately, reading this book taught me more about James Beard's unmentionables than it did about Jeremiah Tower's food. Some things about Mr. Beard I just didn't want to know.

There was a bit of nostalgia to this book, since I remember Berkeley in the early 70s and can picture Mr. Tower fitting in perfectly with that environment. I am a fan of the Chez Panisse style of cooking and food presentation, and would be more than happy to give much of the credit for popularizing it to Mr. Tower. Unfortunately, he has engaged in a preemptive strike, and claimed it all.

I was not in the restaurant business in 1971. Actually, I was in the fourth grade business about then, so I can't say for certain that you couldn't get your tomatoes flown in from Ecuador back then, but I somehow doubt it. That there were produce markets in the city back then tells me that Mr. Tower wasn't the only one serving fresh produce. Did other restaurants buy their veggies and then sit on them for a week before serving them?

Still, I'll read through 224 pages of self love if I can learn something of the master's art. I learned this about Jeremiah Tower's food: Add salt
