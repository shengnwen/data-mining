Don't expect too much from this book.  This book is merely an advertising tool for ebay powersellers.  You get to know their history, their ebay IDs, their products and a sales pitch on how great they are.  Sure they gave some tips here and there but don't expect any secrets.  One seller said that the most important part of a sucessful ebay business is the source of product, but he doesn't reveal his source.  Another seller said that drop shipping is an important part of his business.  You don't have to touch the product and you can save storage space.  Great, did he tell us which company he uses to drop ship?  Nope.

Again, don't expect any secrets.  If you like motivational books and want to read success stories, then I suppose this book might do; but if you're looking for secrets to start or enhance your current business, get another book.  Try Marsha Collier and her various ebay books
