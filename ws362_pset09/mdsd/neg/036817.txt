   I was reading the reviews for this book, both 11th edition and 10th edition, and was surprised to be the only reviewer that disagrees with the quality of this book. The authors tried to teach Economics in a totally different way, no graphs, no tables, no data, etc. and failed miserably. 
     The fact that there aren't any graphs, pie charts, etc. makes it hard to follow especially if you're more a visual person. It has a hokey "down home" feel to it that doesn't connect, except in a geeky-dork way. And the book is disorganized in terms of the material covered. 
     In short, the book is written like a novel or a story, NOT as a textbook. If you enjoyed "The Worldly Philosophers" by Robert Heilbronner, you'll like reading this book. But to use it as an Economics textbook, BIG MISTAKE. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST TEXTBOOKS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY COLLEGE SUBJECT OUT THERE.
     I give it an F or 1 out of 5.
