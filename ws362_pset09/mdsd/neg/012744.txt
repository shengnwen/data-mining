Richardson's commentary on James has one redeeming feature: it heavily relies on key observations from other, better, commentaries on James. 

It is clear from the start that Dr. Richardson's strength is not the biblical languages. As a he is professor of theology, I assume his strength is in reading German instead. What is a total surprise, however, is that he doesn't bring his presumed theological expertise to this reading of James either.

It appears that the book was researched by reading other commentaries and compiling an outline of their contents - avoiding any detailed discussion. In short, there is nothing in this commentary a reader couldn't discover by spending a couple hours reading James in an NIV Study Bible.

Considering the quality of other volumes in this excellent commentary series, Broadman & Holman would be advised to toss this one and tackle James from scratch
