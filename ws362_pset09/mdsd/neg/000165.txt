I can not recommend this book to someone that is trying to overcome an addiction.  I could not find where the spiritual solution was in this book.  Meditation, yoga...sure I would recommend these to anyone, but they are not a solution.  What I did find in this book was the definition of what the author believed an addiction to be.  There are some really good books out there on addiction and this is not one of them.  In my opinion, look for books that give you information on how to get to your inner child.  Books with information on expressing suppressed emotions
