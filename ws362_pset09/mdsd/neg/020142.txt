I really didn't like this cookbook at all.  I am very into healthy, low-fat cooking, but I want recipes to be simple and turn out good.  Pretty much every recipe I tried in this book (except for the pecan pancakes, which are quite good), turned out flat and tasteless, and often I had to purchase special ingredients and put in a lot of effort and cooking time.  I also didn't find too much of a variety here--the recipes are categorized by mealtime so if you are looking, for example, for a lot of creative ways to make salmon or shrimp, you won't find it here.  The health information is useful and educational, but doesn't add much to the quality of this book as a cookbook
