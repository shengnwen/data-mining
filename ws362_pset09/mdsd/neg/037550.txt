 
Raeburn is a gifted writer and he tells this story well.  My problem with the text is that he himself is such a disturbing character in this story that is allegedly about his two kids.  His writing has "voice" from the very beginning, but there's something creepy about the way he talks about his family, especially his wife.  He tells us that the two of them fought, loudly, and that he blames her for many things---not having the kids wait to eat dinner when he got home, etc.---but the reader never gets any sense of the core of their marriage or his emotional attachment to her.  In fact, he seems very narcissistic throughout; he's cold in describing the people he supposedly loves.  He has many complaints and not many solutions.  I wanted to be more empathetic---certainly being a parent to two children with mental illness is a terribly challenging situation---but I found myself getting annoyed with him over and over.  He couldn't take off work to supervise a suicidal daughter?  He couldn't figure out somewhere else to live if the commute was such a terrible strain on his family life?   I was left feeling sad for this whole family
