We read this book for a graduate class on teaching other cultures. While I was disappointed at the lack of practical applications of the book, it did help to open my eyes to the idea of White Dominance. There are factors of a white-dominated culture that are invisible to us whites, and Howard does a good job of bringing those to light.

Much of the book is comprised of personal narratives, about Howard living in an economically-recessed area while attending Yale. It was then that he began to question his assumptions about racism, and the rest is history.

I do, however, believe that he is using this book as a way of marketing his REACH center, which is an organization that trains teachers in cultural awareness, and also designs curricula for schools.

Overall, this book is a good place to start when considering the implications and hazards of teaching other cultures, but just the book by itself does little to enlighten
