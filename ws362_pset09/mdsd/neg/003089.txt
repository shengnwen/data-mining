I agree with another reviewer here, Tiger flatten his swing. I don't know why Mr. Andrisani think Tiger changed his swing to more upright. Anyone who compares Tiger's 2000 swing and his swing now would see that Tiger's swing has flatten out. 

Yes, I do agree with Mr. Andrisani and think that Tiger has a fuller swing now than his old swing, which is more of a three quarter swing. But it is obvious that Tiger changed his swing plane from upright to a more flat swing plane and the fact that Mr. Andrisani thinks the opposite really baffled me
