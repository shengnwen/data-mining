If you're looking for real recipes using roses as the ingredient this book is pert near useless.
Yes, there are recipes, that the author has copied verbatim, in "olde world" language that is hard to understand. 
"Take drie rose leaves and keep them close in glasse" and what is a "grosse powder" how much is "twentie graines", or "half a drame"? 
What the heck is a "Taffety bag"? 
Very quaint, but can someone translate please?

I gave the book a 2 because it is pretty.
If you want more than pretty, if you really want to know how to dry roses or cook with rose hips and petals, this book doesn't deliver.
