This book is NOT everything you need to interface your PC with outside devices.  Like most of Myke Predko's books it is full of filler material and misrepresented.  It does contain lots of interesting information about computer interfacing, but no useful information to get you started on your own.  I am very dissapointed with Predko's books and feel that he writes to sell books and not primarily to educate and inform
