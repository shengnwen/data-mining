Batman has been a favorite of mine for many years, but I can only recommend this title to readers with a great deal of unsatisfied nostalgia for 70's-style comics. 

If your aesthetics have grown with you since the 1970s, you might be disappointed with BATMAN: STRANGE APPARITIONS. Amongst the host of other Batman graphic novels and collections out there, you will find fare more deserving of your time and attention.
