Chris Van Allsburg's books are some of the greatest in the history of children's literature. If you've never seen the Mysteries of Harris Burdick, or The Wreck of the Zephyr, you should select overnight delivery and get them tomorrow. But it seems a disturbing choice that, for his first book centered on African-American characters, he illustrates the young black girl lapping water from a dog's dish and otherwise behaving like an animal. Perhaps poor judgment is to blame, rather than racism; I choose to believe this is true. But I would have a hard time justifying this book to anyone
