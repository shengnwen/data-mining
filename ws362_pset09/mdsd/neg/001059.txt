While any rational parent would agree that today's children are confronted with an astonishing array of influences that wittle away their innocence, the appropriate response to this cultural phenomenon is far more complex  than the Medveds analysis.  There is a lack of distinction in the book  between what is merely age-inappropriate, versus what is just plain  over-the-top &quot;bad&quot;. Discussion of menstruation in a Junior Girl  Scout Handbook? Hardly the end of civilization as we know it. Environmental  curriculum creating unnecessary &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;anxiety&quot;  about the well-being of our planet? No; becoming a good steward of our  earth begins young. The Medveds miss the point in their many anecdotes: it  is the responsibilty of the parents to screen the media their children are  exposed to; to discuss curricula with their schools, and make informed  decisions about whether or not what is being taught is at odds with their  beliefs - and use these opportunities to reinforce with your children WHY,  as parents, you believe what you do. This book is infuriating because the  authors respond in a sensational and hysterical way to the most innocuous  things, and fail to logically address their basis thesis
