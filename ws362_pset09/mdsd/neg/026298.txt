I loved "Tailchaser's Song" by Tad Williams (although I did read it as a teen) and I like cats, so I thought I'd try this cat-character fantasy novel.  I really did not like it.  I read it to the end because I kept thinking "maybe it will get better and it will all have been worth it".  But no.  The main cat character was very juvenile and annoying.  He is a young cat, so maybe his characteristics were "realistic", but it was still annoying.  The whole "wild roads" concept was extremely strange and just not "believable" fantasy.  A fantasy world needs to be built up in such a way that the reader is drawn in and finds the world believable and compelling.  This was not the case for me.  I scanned a few of the reviews and several people seemed to really like the book, so maybe it is a "loved it" or "hated it" book.  I am still searching for a quality "Tailchaser's Song" or "Watership Down" type book.  I would not recommend this book
