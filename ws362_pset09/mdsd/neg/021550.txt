I have tried to pick up this book twice and tried reading it sincerely but I couldn't go past chapter 2.
I couldn't understand Tilo's worlds (more of a fantasy) and I felt very bored very quickly, which is usually a big sign for me to get rid of the book in my hand and find a better replacement.
Now I have even viewed the trailer of the film made on this movie, acted by Aishwarya Rai...I couldn't bear to watch it!
I'm sorry Ms. Chitra, this one didn't digest too well. Better luck next time, hun
