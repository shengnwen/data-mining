To tell you the truth, I couldn't make heads nor tails out of this book.  The language is too far away from even modern, and the characters are confusing.  I love sci-fi, even the new computer-oriented (some call it cyberpunk) stuff like "Snow Crash", but "Synners" is just strange.  Ala the Emperor's New Clothes..."Oh my, how strange!  It must be good!"  No, sorry, it's just strange.  I actually came here (to Amazon reviews) to see if anybody else had made sense of it.  I thought I might read farther if I understood it better.  I'm only to page 18, and I doubt I'll finish it.
