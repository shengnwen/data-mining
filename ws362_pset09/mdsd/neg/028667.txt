I have already put my comments into Blad's blog. The book, though well written, is too shallow. This is a pity as blogging could be very effective. Instead of telling us how to do the simplest of thing, which we could pick up in a few minutes in front of a PC, a deeper exploration of how to effecitvely use blogs would have really helped. 
Brad makes a big deal out of using photos in Wordpress. I found it straightforward: all I did was upload the photo and drag it into the post box, thus having it in both open boxes. Although I did not expect a lot out of this book, I did expect a little more. Loks like I will have to put this book on the shelf and spend time trawling Wordpress information sites. This defeats the purpose of buying the book
