This was the first and last Iris Johansen book I will read. I thought oh I need something to do at work since its going to be slow today (I work in a library). So I broght it with me and it was so boring I actually fell asleep! I will not be finishing this book. It has no substance. I do not recommend it to anyone. It is a waste of time and money. Although if your looking to take a nap then go ahead and read it
