I get the impression that the reader from NH is the only reviewer to have tried to solve some of the problems in this book.  There is no possible way to solve these problems.  They are on subjects and situations not covered in the book, and even if they were, good luck in understanding Bejan's writing.  He skips massive steps, giving only solutions and equations without explanations.  Not everyone like reviewer Jeff Booth was born understanding convective heat transfer, so some of us must learn from books.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one.  I only hope that Dr. Bejan reads these reviews and that they discourage him from making another failed attempt at text book writing
