First, let me state that I have been impressed by all the Canin I have read prior to starting &quot;Blue River.&quot;  The problem with this novel isn't that it follows pattern similar to Canin's other works, most notably &quot;For Kings and Planets,&quot; a far more mature novel, but that the protagonist is very hard to empathize with.  A successful California optimologist, the protagonist spends the too much of the narrative defending his materialism.  When he's not bothering with that, he's repeatly over-describing his less successful brother (After the first few times, I understood that the brother was violent and troubled during high school).  There's a good story here, but it's trapped under a poor, plodding narrative
