I have to read She Stoops to Conquer for school and it is absolutly terrible.  For a play that is supposed to be funny and one of the most comical plays of its time, I find it completly boring.  I am not discriminating against the &quot;classics&quot;, as I have read many which I have highly enjoyed, but reading this play is a waste of time
