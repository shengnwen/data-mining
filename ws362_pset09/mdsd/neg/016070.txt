Reading this book is like reading dry after action reports.  All I got out of it was how much ammo they expended on a daily basis.  The print is huge so it is good for those who are half blind.  It is only about 60 pages so I read it in about 3 hours.  It's like they took a chapter from a book like "Panzer Aces" and made another book out of it.  Don't waste your money
