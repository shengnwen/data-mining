This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read in my life. Pointless repetition page after page. This book justifies why some people unfortunately despise reading. In this case, it was like pulling teeth to read this trash. We all KNOW what this book tries to tell us. However, Lunsford feels the need to take a sentence, and expand it into 300000 more saying the exact same thing. Please do not buy this.
