This book seems to be cobbled together from Teitelbaum and various Web sites. It's broad and superficial. Major issues, such as the treatment of hormonal imbalances, are glossed over with a couple of sentences. Worst of all, she describes the relationship between depression and CFIDS and FMS as a "chicken-egg" thing--everyone who gets these was already depressed. There's no evidence whatsoever for this assertion, and saying it in a book damages advocacy and holds us back much in the same way as the dreaded moniker CFS.
