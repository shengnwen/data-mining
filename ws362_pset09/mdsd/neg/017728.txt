Shallow characters, plot uninteresting, interactions not convincing at all. In my eyes, Kellerman's best trait has been always the depiction of the anti-urban American landscape and way of life. His detective plots (decent at most) were just the vehicle fot this depiction. But in this novel not even that subproduct is achieved. As some other reader pointed out, the novel is little more than a series of "drove there-wore this-ate that" sequences that leave us wanting.
