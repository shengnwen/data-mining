This was, from my point of view, very boring and slow moving.  It really didn't pick up until one half the way through the book.  Personally, I was hoping for much more "hard" science and observations, but instead the book is filled with all kinds of "New Age" wisdom.  I am not being critical of the experiencers, nor am I questioning their validity.  My comments are on the substance of the book and the material presented.  You could, if you wanted to, write the book in a "Cliff Note" style...  I was asleep.  Aliens woke me up.  They floated me to their craft.  They conducted experiments on me.  They led me back to my bed.  I slept.

What became interesting was when the writer started to make claims to be a translator for a galatic federation.  Um...OK.  But still, even these unique insights were not able to provide me with the meat and potatoes that I needed and desired from this book.  I found the book to be a disapointment and I do not recommend it for researchers searching for definative hard observations
