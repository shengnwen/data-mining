	Picture this, you're a regular kid, trying to make friends and fit in, and the way you do it is by committing a robbery. That isn't the smartest thing to do, now is it? You decide that it won't be a big deal if you just "look out" while your new friends do the real robbery part. Then, your plan backfires completely on you and you end up in jail. This is what happens to Steve Harmon in Walter Dean Myer's novel titled Monster. This book is a realistic fiction novel and not a very difficult read.
Walter Dean Myers does an amazing job of showing what Steve is like. He makes Steve an easy character to relate to by making him like any other kid. That's just until Steve gets put into jail! 
This book is written as an autobiography that the main character writes...while doing time in jail. Why did Steve end up in jail? Simply because he was the look out of a robbery? Nope, you have to read the book to figure out with specifics! I would recommend this book to almost any type of readers of all ages. Especially for people like me that enjoy reading Walter Dean Myer's work. It is written fantastically and I think could be one of Walter Dean Myer's best!
