About two-thirds of this campily illustrated and ultimately light-weight book consists of inspirational essays on the girliness of traditionally female tasks such as gardening, decorating, cooking, and entertaining. In this vein, the odd "helpful hint" tells us to sew tassels to our curtains, toast bread crumbs atop our packaged mac-and-cheese, and hold gardening parties in our least-loved bridesmaid dresses. Oh, and let's not forget painting the garden tools pink with polka-dots!

Some of the advice conflicts. On page 25, we're told that Elsie de Wolfe believed in "plenty of optimism and white paint!" Ten pages later, we're told we mustn't have white walls at all -- so boring! Who's right?

This book seems destined to be given as going-to-college and thanks-for-wearing-an-ugly-bridesmaid-dress gifts, due to its high cuteness quotient. As useful housekeeping advice, forget it
