Though I agree with many of Hanson's points he blows his credibility by the following statement on page 31: "And Mexico is Catholic, America mostly Protestant or secular. The former believes fate is set at birth, the latter that man earns his condition mostly here on earth." If that isn't the most inane statement from a teacher of classics I don't know what is. If he really believes that the classical curriculum at Fresno State needs a second look. Catholicism teaches nothing of the sort and most educated Catholics know that.
