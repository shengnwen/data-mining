This book was a truly amazing stor...NOT!!!  I absolutely hated this book.  It was boring and didn't really have much of a point to it.  I am thirteen years old and I would never recommend this book for teenagers.  If you are younger and enjoy learning about japan and war, then go ahead.  Same for adults.  But for 12-16 year olds, don't even pick this book up.  In class, we had to write "cliff's notes" for it, and I skipped from chapter 12 to practically the ending because i didn't like it so much.  I am sorry if I offend anybody who likes this book, but I despised it every moment.  I hope my review helped you decide whether or not to read this book
