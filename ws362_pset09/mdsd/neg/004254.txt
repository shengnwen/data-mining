This is another "channeled" book but from recent times.  Psychologically and scientifically speaking, it is probably more likely that the informational content originated in the psyche (unconscious mind--either personal or collective or both) of the author(s).  Also, Edgar Cayce, when asked about channeling, said that there's no reason to think your uncle knows more after he's gone than when he was on Earth.  Nevertheless, the material, whatever the true source, should stand on its own.  There is some interesting material in this book, however, I believe Stewart Edward White's works (from the beginning of the 20th century) are superior.  And, of course, there is also "Our Unseen Guest" by Darby and Joan.  More recent books in the same vein include the popular "Conversations with God" series by Neale Walsch.  The best of such works create a consistent (though unverifiable) metaphysical world--though their interpretation of (usually deceased) spirits is actually unnecessary.  Interestingly, however, the Seth books are antithetical to the metaphysical world of the other works mentioned (though the others seem consistent with each other).  Based upon these books and others addressing metaphysical themes, I have problems with the metaphysical assertions of "Seth."  If you read this book, you might consider holding your opinion (either pro or con) of its source aside and assessing the value of the material as it is--disregarding the stated source
