This book had a lot of essays, but most of them were really not uplifting, and only perhaps 2 struck me as funny or laugh-out-loud hilarious.  It seems that every knitter whose writing was featured in this book endured some sort of hardship, whether they miscarried, had someone or loads of someones die from cancer, or some other horrid tradgedy killed them off. I would not recommend this book as way to beguile anyone into the craft - it made me worry that some horrid piece of luck will befall me just because I knit. I'm taking it back to the bookstore.  I don't need this horrid energy in my library.  I understand that these people worked through a lot of grief, and that's great, but since I am not surfing that wavelength, reading about their problems is just depressing.
