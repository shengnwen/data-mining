It starts out very well by going into the action and it is well written until you get to the center of the novel.  At that time I felt that I needed a college degree to get thru the rest of it.  The book goes into a metaphysical, scientifical, and all other ifical reasons and explanations for the origin of heroes.

Not what I thought when I saw it.  i read one other Justice League novel and it was almost the same way.  This has turned me off to this type of novel.

Use your money to go and get a comic book,  it is better in my opinion.
