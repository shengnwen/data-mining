I love the show Alias and had hoped the books would fill in some holes about Sydney's past, her recruitment, etc.  The books do provide some details but the books stay pretty general.  It's obvious they cannot provide too much detail or it might conflict with the writing for the show (which frequently draws from the past to explain the present)  The books focus on getting to know Sloane, her strained relationship with her dad, etc.  The writing is pretty bland--this is one situation where the show is BETTER than the book.  My final irritation with the books (and I've read several) is that they tend make Sydney look dumb and naive.  She will "save the day" and then we the reader see the final "secret email" proving she helped the bad guy, etc.  She comes off looking really dumb.  Read the books if you must but get them from the library...
