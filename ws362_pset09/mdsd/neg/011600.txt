I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem.  Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.

Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality.  His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close.  Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?

The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read.  By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend
