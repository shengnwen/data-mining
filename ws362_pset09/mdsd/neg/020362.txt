I got this book at a garage sale and I was really looking forward to reading it.  I heard so much about it and was surprised when I also found it in the library, multiple copies, under classics.  

I really like historical counts of the sixties counter culture but this never kept my interest to keep picking it up again.  If you finally got interested in something, to follow along like a story or a sensible account, it just dropped it.  I never found myself really caring about the people involved.  Everything was just there, but the people were acting like everything they did had some great meaning, and it just seemed tired.  

I got thru 150 pages.  I had to quit.  I skimmed the rest of it really really quickly to get the jist of it.  I looked up a summary of the book on the net, and I didn't miss anything in the plot.  I wanted to like this book. But, no go.

Maybe you just had to be there...or be "zonked"...
