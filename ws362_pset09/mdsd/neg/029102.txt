At first I thought that this book would be very good. The book actually turned out to be the opposite. I sort of liked the part when Herbert said Welcome to Saginaw, the End of the World because it was not the end of the world and I thought it was a little funny that he said it. I disliked the part when the Mitchell family cut their hair off. I liked this book and I disliked it and I cannot decide which to choose.
