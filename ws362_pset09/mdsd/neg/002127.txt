This book is absolutely painful to read.  If you have to purchase this book for class, be prepared for chapter 7, 10, & 11.  These are the most painful chapters in the book.  In these chapters it is very hard to follow the text (i.e. main points).  Other students and I got migranes from trying to prepare notes for these chapters for a test.  Just horrible
