If this is a brilliant debut then what else  these publishers are looking at must be really abysmal!  The characters are cartoons....the writing is glib and I just kept thinking...who cares?   I am just stunned by the positive reviews and the hype and I loved Secret History by Donna Tartt.  If there were minus stars I'd give it one
