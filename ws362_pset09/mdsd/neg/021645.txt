I was actually looking forward to reading this book.  I came with an open mind and yet the poor writing and lack of credible arguments astounded me.  How is this author a scholar and still able to write weakly biased material that is published by a major house?

I would recomend not reading this book no matter what your stance is on these topics.  If you agree with the author, you may be blinded by your beliefs to embrace his scewed logic, and if you disagree, you will get a bad impression of the actual arguments his side could give
