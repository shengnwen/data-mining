This book is entertaining at first, with multiple parallel stories. However, in the beginning of the second volume, it starts to get a little crazy. The protagonists are constantly drunk or eating mountains of meat. They are often crude and without reason, acting like bullies to those who do not sate their appetites. There are several events that make the protagonists extremely unlikable. It is outrageous how one of the protragonists would stick his neck out to help one organized crime boss over another, thinking that he is actually doing something righteous. In another instance that same character not only takes revenge on those who wronged, but also kills the women and children that live with them. He goes on to kill several more innocent people, and all the while gets off scott free. I just couldn't read anymore after that
