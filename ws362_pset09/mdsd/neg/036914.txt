By reading all of the other reviews I thought that this book would be right up my alley, and the actual story line was, but the execution of the story really lacks something.  I felt no real connection to the characters, and there was never any suspense to the writing that made me want to read further.  It's not that I disliked the book - it's that it didn't stirred my emotions at all.  I felt that it was a waste of time
