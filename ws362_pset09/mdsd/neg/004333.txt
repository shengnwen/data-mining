To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this book...

Don't get me wrong, I wasn't interested in a kiss and tell look into her life, but I have a feeling Tweed is much more interesting and entertaining than what this book suggests.

Most of the book covers her live moving from Canada to LA boucing from boring boyfriend to even duller boyfriend.  She finally meets Gene Simmons and she tells us how good there life is etc.

But she is obviously a hard worker, a survivor in LA movies, mixes with interesting people and is part of an intriguing relationship with Simmons - but there is little detail.

I found the "Family Jewels" DVD series far more satisfying and complimentary about her life.

For fans only..
