Yes, President Bush is a rebel.  He rebels against the people of the United States and the Constitution.  Here are just a few examples of his rebellious ways:

1.   He turned a record surplus into a record deficit.

2.   He cuts benefits to the poor in order to fund obscene tax cuts to the rich.

3.   He manipulated and cherry-picked intelligence data in order to rationalize starting an immoral and unjust war.

4.   He lied to the American people about the reasons for starting that war.

5.   He allowed America's real enemies to escape justice in order to pursue his own selfish and unrealistic goals.

6.   He refuses to acknowledge the reality of the consequences of America's (and the world's) dependence on fossil fuels.

7.   He defies the Constitution of the United States by ordering the illegal spying of Americans and the torture of prisoners who are being held indefinitely without being charged.

Nearly 150 years ago our fore-fathers fought a Civil War to stop the rebels in this country who rejected our Constitution.  Now we have a President in the White House who basks in his rebel status and thumbs his nose at those who dare to challenge him.  Meanwhile, authors like Fred Barnes praise his rebelliousness, and millions of Americans rejoice in their self-proclaimed righteousness because it happens to coincide with their president's, and millions more simply stand passively mute.
