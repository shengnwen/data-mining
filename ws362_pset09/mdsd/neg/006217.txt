Much like Cunningham's first guide for the solitary Wiccan, this book was disappointing. There is very little of practical use, just a lot of hypothetical philosophy and a few contrived chants. Maybe that does it for some people, but for those who, there again, don't live in the middle of a secluded woods with unlimited access to natural items, the book offers nothing
