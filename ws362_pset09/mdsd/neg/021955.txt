I love Dr. Roizen, and Dr. Oz, who both have appeared on Oprah many times.  Their not about fad diets, etc., but just eating right.  I was dissapointed with this book, though.  I thought I was getting a cookbook, and instead it was 3/4 reading and 1/4 recipes.  I thought it was hard to follow. "You" The owners Manual is a much better book to read, which was written by both Dr. Roizen and Dr. Oz
