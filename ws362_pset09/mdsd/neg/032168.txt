I have read this book three different times in the hope of finding ANY positive thing in it. (Whatsoever things a beautiful....) I cannot.  This is a book filled with resentment, bitterness and half-truths.  I suggest readers of this text read; The Psychologies in Religion by Dowd and Nielsen.  Reading my mentioned text immediately following Why Christians Can't Trust..., will be a TRULY eye-opening and BALANCING experience!
I can only hope that the authors of Why Christians Can't Trust (this would actually be a more accurate title!)will enter therapy SOON to deal with their existential angst issues
