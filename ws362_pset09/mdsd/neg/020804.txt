The writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense.  I thought something might change, that it might become an interesting ghost story, or there might be moral issues, or maybe even a character would grow or change.  The heavy-handed ending is, perhaps, intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in Amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones...but that's a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness.  Are we supposed to take everything that Ellie says about the Amish in court (peaceful, gentle, incapable of murder, loving, child-centric, willing to accept an out-of-wedlock child into the community) as lies?  The ending belongs to a much darker book.  My biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing, I kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story.
