While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous.  While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read.  It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe.
