Please don't have false expectations or waste you money on this book before you at least look it over in the local bookstore or library. This book is full of fairly elementary information on a wide variety of herbals. Containing one to three page entries on a wide variety of herbal remedies such as ginkgo, sol palmetto, the wonders of cinnamon and the like. Anecdotal tales that have been around for years nothing beyond what the average salesperson at your local health and nutrition store might tell you. This book's contents hardly qualify as, "new scientific discoveries." Easily as much or more information is available through your favorite search engine. If these things truly were miracle cures the information could not be suppressed, these herbs didn't land in Roswell, they have been around for hundreds of years. If these miracle cures worked beyond a psychologically uplifting level all of us would know far more people who had been cured by herbs than we do those who have had chemotherapy.
