Like a few others, I don't understand why this novel is getting so many positive reviews.  Perhaps I was spoiled by "Memoirs of a Geisha" and "The Good Earth", but I found the writing lacking and the dialogue boring.  Great plot line on paper, but I don't think the author did it justice!  Couldn't wait to just get through it and be done with it
