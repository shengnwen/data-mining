As a Renaissance scholar I was disappointed and shocked by the sloppy inaccuracies in Ms. Scotti's text.  While she tells an engaging story, she gets many of the fundamentals of history and architecture wrong.  The story, indeed, is one worthy of being told.  Ms. Scotti, however, does not have the teeth to do it well
