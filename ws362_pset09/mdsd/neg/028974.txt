"The China Threat" references President Clinton, ALWAYS in a negative manner, almost as much as China - despite this edition having been written after President Bush took office and, in some instances, his ADDING to the issues that Gertz was upset with Clinton about.  Further, there was little/no negative reference to Presidents Nixon, Reagan, or Bush I, either - for similar actions (eg. building trade).  Thus, my conclusion that the book is incredibly biased.

True, China has exercised INCREDIBLE brutality against its people in the past - Chairman Mao was responsible for the death of millions.  (See Jung Chang's 2005 book for details.)  However, the situation has since greatly improved and deserves rethinking.  (Gertz's recommendation that the U.S. increase pressure on China for democratization rings hollow, given the degree of gerrymandering and influence-buying in Congress, and deliberate law-breaking and lying by this Administration.)

Gertz also brings up China's support for North Korea's missile manufacturing (forgetting U.S. support for India's ignoring nuclear non-proliferation pacts), Chinese monies given to the Democratic Party (ignoring U.S. funds given to various candidates in former Russian territories and other locations), and alleged Chinese spying on U.S. atomic secrets (ignoring U.S. spy-plane flights along China's border, U-2 flights over China, satellite photography across China, and efforts to obtain information on China's nuclear programs).

And then there's China's "large" military outlays - one-eighteenth that of the U.S.!

Gertz, however, missed the greatest threats from China - economic.  Our large and rapidly growing trade deficit (over $200 billion in 2005), manufacturing job losses, and major borrowings of U.S. debt (about $260 billion - second only to Japan) put the U.S. at serious economic risk.
