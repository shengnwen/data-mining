I am halfway through this book and have decided to stop reading it.  Why?

The author apparently thinks it's a novel idea to not use paragraphs or quotation marks.  This is obnoxious.  I don't care what the "critics" may say.  I suppose if he started the book on the last page and finished the book on the first page 'The Cave' would be hailed as a work of genius.  Color me skeptical.

Oh yes, and the screed against capitalism is a big yawn.  While it is true that goods and services initially do become watered down and more homogenous as scale and industry consolidation increases, it is also true that in today's capitalist world, homemade niche products are experiencing a resurgence thanks to the "long tail" of the market.  As operations and distribution costs decrease (think internet), handcrafted goods (think micro-beers and yes, even handcrafted pottery) are able to reach new audiences.  Try typing in "handcrafted pottery" into your favorite search engine and see the results.  Capitalism 'tis a beautiful thing!
