John lewis Gaddis displays a lot of the most annoying features of the scholars who want to be remembered for their 'version/vision of history' rather than to take upon the (much more demanding)task of building knowledge through careful-if less appealing- empirical inquiries. This book thus exhibits overtly grotesque (especially when you know the author is a historian at Yale, no less!) instances of ethnocentrism in its generalizations about 'the American experience' and what seems to be haunting Gaddis: the undeniable superiority of American democracy and values over that of other countries. Since the author claims to be taking lessons from history in his analysis of the current strategical posture of the USA, maybe he should have remembered that America, for all its successes, remains an 'unfinished nation' as Alan Brinkley has demonstrated, and that its position of preponderance now is historically contingent to say the least, and owes nothing to a fantasized unique American genius. Ironically, what comes to mind when reading Gaddis is the pathetic pamphlets of French and German intellectuals before WWI, aimed at providing a ready to use intellectual rationalization of the most stupid nationalism.
