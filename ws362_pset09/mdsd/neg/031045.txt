Others have written reviews of the book.  I'll keep my comments to the narration.  Michael McShane's performance is TERRIBLE.  He constantly sounds out of breathe.  His cadence is wooden.  His Spanish pronunciation is terrible.  His accents are atrocious.

Please get a new narrator for the next Dale Brown book - hopefully this one will be better
