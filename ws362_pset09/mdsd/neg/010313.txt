If you are looking for a serious study of Cold War history, than avoid Robert Dean's &quot;Imperial Brotherhood.&quot; The idea that elitism and masculinity shaped U.S. foreign policy is absurd.  If the American populace did not approve of their leaders, than they would not have been voted them into office. JFK, and his entourage of ivy league advisors, no doubt were elitists and the U.S. expansion into Vietnam was a direct result of Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense, who was one of &quot;the best and the brightest.&quot;  LBJ was hardly an elitist, since he graduated from Southwest Texas State College, and Richard Nixon hated the ivy leaguers and RN and Kissinger purposely kept the elitists out of the loop.  Once again, more useless history that is out of touch with reality and, just as George McGovern was out of touch with American voters in 1972, Dean's views hold little interest to any serious reader
