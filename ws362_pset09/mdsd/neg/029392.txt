This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy.  I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned.  I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed.  After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines.  To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books.
