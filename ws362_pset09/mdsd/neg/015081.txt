I ordered this book because I am extremely interested in the
untold stories of the Partition of India even though the
reviews told me not to.  I wished I had heeded the advice.  The book is incredibly repetitive--to the point of being unreadable. I learned very little.  Not worth the time to read or money to purchase.
