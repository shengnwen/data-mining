I was thoroughly disappointed in Mirabai Starr's translation.  Her inability to comprehend Catholic Theology is evident throughout this translation; as a Catholic, I take offense at her politically correct terminology.  When you change the term "mortal sin" to "grave error" and "sin" to "missing the mark" for fear of hurting someone's feelings, something is lost in the translation and you have missed the mark (pun intended). I intend to purchase a copy of this wonderful work, but it will be one that is translated by a Catholic scholar that isn't interested in political correctness.
