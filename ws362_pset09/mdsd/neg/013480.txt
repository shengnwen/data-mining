This is not a review of Ms. Yates's writing.  Instead, I am awarding the single star to the physical book perpetrated by the University of Chicago Press in 1991.  The good news is that this edition doesn't cost very much.  The bad news is that the 1991 edition is a bad reproduction of an earlier edition.  The ink bleeds all over some of the pages.  There are diagonal streaks on many pages.  Sometimes the ink is light grey on one side of a diagonal streak, while it is dark and smudged on the other side.  Parts of letters that landed in the streak are missing.  A note on the back of the title page claims only that "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the ... Standard ... for Library Materials."  Does this less than ringing endorsement mean that the paper is acidic and will soon deteriorate?  If so, it won't be much of a loss
