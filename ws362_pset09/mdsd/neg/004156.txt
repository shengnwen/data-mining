I absolutely loved this movie and was looking forward to reading the book, but it was a big disappointment. All the beauty and mystery built up in the cinematography of the film and the restrained behavior of the characters is lost in this book. Selene ogles Michael. There are way too many descriptions of how cool her car is. And there isn't enough added beyond the basic movie plot to make the book worth reading -- what little extra character development is done in the book is mostly trite and cliched. (Spoiler alert!!) Michael even has the obligatory &quot;I became a doctor because the woman I loved died in car wreck and I couldn't save her!&quot; subplot, which is so cliched it's not to be believed. Save your time and money for repeated viewings of the DVD, and cross your fingers that if a second novelization comes out it's written by someone else
