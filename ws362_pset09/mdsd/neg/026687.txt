I won't get into a political discussion, although I disagree strongly with his beliefs.  Nevertheless, one thing about this book that agitated me was the complete lack of sources.

For example, Horowitz claims that shortly before his death, Huey Newton stated he shot John Frey in an interview to strike back at the white establishment.  Fair enough - but if you want to find the interview, Horowitz isn't going to give you any information whatsoever as to the location of it.

The same holds true for a similar claim that Jerry Rubin admitted that he deliberately stirred up trouble at the DNC in '68 to provoke a riot.  Fine.  Where can we find this interview?  Well, we can't, at least not according to Horowitz's book.  How am I supposed to respect a man who violates a cardinal rule of journalism (I am aware that this is a biography; that doesn't invalidate the fact that sources should be cited when necessary)?  Is he merely forgetful or are the interviews he cites non-existant or, under scrutiny, do they simply fail to uphold the claims he makes
