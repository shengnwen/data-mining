This instant-expert in Hawaiiana is evidently one of those people who move to Hawaii and think &quot;it's much too good for the Hawaiians so I'll sell as much of it as I can&quot;.  The photography is good but so many of the descriptions are soooooo wrong that I looked through it in slack-jawed amazement.  Don't fall for this phoney-baloney aloha - the real Hawaii is not for sale, no matter how many books you write badly about it
