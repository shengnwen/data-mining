Beware of this book.  I purchased it believing I was getting a paperback copy of &quot;The Professional Chef&quot;.  I waited over three months before finally getting my copy.  What a disappointment.  Instead of receiving a book filled with great tips on how to become a better chef, I get an outline of a CIA course!  Not one suggestion.  Not one how-to.  Nothing that would be of any help to anyone who was not sitting in a CIA class
