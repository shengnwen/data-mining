I am so disappointed in this book.  She was going along so good in the first two and to end this series with a dud.  

The first problem was that she spent way too much time "explaining how psychic powers work or don't work"  I was to the point of wanting to skip pages to get back to the "story".  

The second problem Hollis Templeton (from the first book) should have either been used more or not at all. Her part in this book was under done.  She did not really use her "gift/curse" to any satisfying outcome.  Wasn't our herione in this book supposed to help Hollis cope when she see's dead people.  Well, she was no help-might as well left the whole thing out.  And making our hero psychic too!  Yikes-Too Much!

The only positive thing was: I completely was way off base with who the killer was.  Totally took me by surpise.  It's ashame that the read to get there was so disappointing.    I look forward to Kay Hoopers next series and only hope she doens't bog herself down with "explaining" the abilites too much.  Leave the mystery in their abilities too
