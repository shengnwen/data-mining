James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers. 

I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?

Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree
