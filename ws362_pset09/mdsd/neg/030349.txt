The introduction pretty well sums up the fatal flaw in this book: "But [this book] isn't a how-to book, it's a what-to book."

You have to ask: How much good is knowing what to do if you don't know how to do it? Go rebuild the engine in your car. I told you what to do; you will have to find out how to do it somewhere else. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else to begin with.

I bought this book to learn how to market my novels. I get: "In this respect [promotion] novelists are luckier than nonfiction writers. Not much is expected from them in the way of promotion.(page 87)" How much less? None? A little bit? Which ones of the 100 "weapons" should I use? Though I forced myself through the rest of the book and its interminably boring lists, I never found the answer.

I will have to say the authors practise what they preach. I would bet they have used all the gorilla (my spelling) weapons in this book, and then some, to sell every copy they can; including, I suspect, many of the glowing reviews on this page from members of their "network." You push my book and I will push yours.

It is a shame that American literature has come down to who is the best marketer. Maybe that is why many new novels, which used to keep me glued to my seat, now get slammed shut after the first few chapters. Maybe the next one will be better.

This book is cotton candy: real yummy but no substance: sugar air. The best part is the money-back guarantee, which the authors proudly proclaim, is a safe bet because most people won't take you up on it.

I have to give it some credit for the appendixes. Of course, you could get the same thing with a few simple internet searches, but I hate to be all negative.

If you buy this book, you may find yourself saying: "I've been guerillaed."
