.....I should've read the reviews before I bought it:  

Unless you are pursuing a physics orquant career or some derivative of themit, not enough to interest the mainstream financial community.  As much as Derman talks about the mentality of traders or salesmen in his book, he did nothing to attract their readership with its content.  Just as I think he's developing an interesting anecdotal moment that coincides with some notable market event, Derman succeeds in finishing his thought without a big finish. 

His info on Fischer Black was of interest.
