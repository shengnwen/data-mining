I really enjoyed the first book in this series, and the second one was OK, but not as good as the first, but this one was just terrible!  I gave it two stars instead of one because I know that Ms. Myers is capable of much better than this.  This book is poorly written and poorly edited.  There are glaring mistakes in it, and the plot is so loose that you could drive a truck through it.  The last few chapters are truly terrible, and rather than feeling anything for the main characters, I just wanted to finish the book.  I will read one more in this series and if it's as bad as this I will not continue.  I did enjoy the first in her Den of Antiquity series, and will continue with that one unless the same thing happens with that one that has happened here.  It appears that Ms Myers is trying to make a slapstick comedy, and it falls flat
