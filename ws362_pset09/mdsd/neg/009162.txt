I have enjoyed many books from Howard and reviewed a few on Amazon.  But this one - no way!!!  Where did all these good reviews come from?  This one stinks!!!  I have never encountered a character as totally stupid as Sweeney!  The woman must be brain dead.  And the sudden love affair with Richard?  How come this came out of nowhere when she had known him and his wife, soon-to-be ex, for years?  In just days, they are professing love for each other.  And she stupidly lets the guy who works at the gallery see her 'mysterious' painting right after Richard warns her to hide it from everyone, including the police.  How is it she can so bravely defend herself againts the murderer when she has trouble putting two thoughts together? They never discover why her sudden 'gift' occurs and at the end, they don't seem to mind anymore that she sees the dead and paints these paintings in her sleep. No resolution.  Arghhhhh!!!  Bad, really bad.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  A much better bet...'Dying to please'  It was great.  Don't bother with Sweeney.  Sorry
