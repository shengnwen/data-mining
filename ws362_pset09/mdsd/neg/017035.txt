If an author choses to write a politcally charged novel, there will be bias. What I look for is some balance in the arguments. But, like his brother Rush, David writes with blinders on and misses the obvious contradictions in his arguments. The Democrats are not like Republicans! Of course not. The current Republican party is overwhelmingly an ideological, lock-step plutocratic mob who won't tolerate open discussion of an issue. Democrats on the other hand are diverse, open minded and welcoming of new ideas and thoughts. David Limbaugh would have you believe that is chaos. Open, intelligent discussions are what is missing in the Republican party right now.

A book does not have to be well written to put across the author's theme, and the ideas he is promoting, but when it is dully written, poorly researched and obvious in its misinterpretation of issues and situations it is difficult to give it much credence.

Basically I have read this book before, several times. There is nothing new, in fact it sounds like a few days of Rush on the radio, usually wrong and overwhelmingly insulting to anyone who can think for themself.

So, all I see here is an poorly written dull diatribe of the same old propaganda from the right - "Don't confuse us with the facts we already have been told what to think."
