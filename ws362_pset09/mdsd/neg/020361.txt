It is a well known fact among scientists that global warming is REAL and that humans are at least contributing to this planet's rising average temperature.  It is also a fact that the oil cronies are trying to spread misinformation that global warming is either not occurring or that humans are not having any affect on it.  These oil cronies also want everyone to think that if global warming is not a myth, it's a debate among scientists.  Furthermore, many of the scientific research that shows that WE are causing global warming have been suppressed by oil industry special interests.  Bush, who does everything to cater to the oil industry, has suppressed much of this knowledge himself.  This book is just part of this special interest propaganda.  The bottom line is this: GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL AND IS CAUSED BY PEOPLE, AND EVERY TRUE SCIENTIST THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS KNOWS THIS.  If you have any doubt about this, read the original research articles in PEER REVIEWED academic journals, and make sure that they are PEER REVIEWED.  PEER REVIEWED journals are where REAL knowledge and research get published.  This book is hogwash.
