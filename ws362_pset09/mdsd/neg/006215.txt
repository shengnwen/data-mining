This is easily the WORST casebook I have ever owned.
LOUSY for learning future interest and possessory estates.
LOUSY for learning mortgages.
LOUSY for learning adverse possession.
Mainly lousy, lousy, lousy.
Don't buy this book without purchasing a hell of a study aid b/c you won't learn jack from it since it's horribly written.
Don't buy this book w/out purchasing a hell of a good pair of reading glasses b/c the print is practically microscopic.
I can't believe I have to suffer through another property course w/this terrible book
