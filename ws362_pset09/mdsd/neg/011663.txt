I did not at all enjoy &quot;Slave and Citizen.&quot;  Nathan Irvin Huggins' writing dragged, and information seemed to be frequently repeated.  I was disappointed that the vast majority of the book was political in  nature.  Douglass' personal life was focused upon very little.  His time  spent as a slave and in childhood was touched upon only very lightly.   Likewise, his marriages and children were only briefly mentioned.  The rest  of the book, which could have been adequately summarized in just a few  pages, drug on and on.  I was disappointed, and will be searching for a  more personal biography of Douglass to read
