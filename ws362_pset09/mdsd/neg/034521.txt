I was so disappointed with the language in this book.  I had heard about it on the NPR "Splendid Table" show and looked forward to reading it.  What a waste of good money.  I can't get past the first 30 pages because of the filthy language.  I was insulted to have squandered money on filth.  If Mario Batali can't open his mouth with every other word beginning with "f", I certainly wouldn't want to eat his food as it must be as filthy as his language.  Wish I could get a refund
