I helped teach three terms of upper division biochemistry with this book and this book is terrible!!  Don't get this confused with the Stryer book (although he is listed as an author, the book IS NOT written in his style).  For non-biochem people, get the real Stryer book and for biochem people get the Matthews or the Voet book
