In my 49 years, I've read literally thousands of books on many, many categories, but I've never HATED a character before the way I do Llian.  I struggled through the first three books but couldn't finish this one.   Karan is such an exemplary character with incredible courage and wiles - and she falls for this [DUD]?  Puh-leaze!   Like I said, I've hated books because of lack of story line, lack of action, etc., but I've never stopped reading a book because I hated one of the heroes(?).  Don't waste your money on the series like I did
