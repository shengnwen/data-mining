I can see how some readers might be put off by all of the science and detail in this book, though I was personally not bothered by it.  There were several things that did trouble me however:
1.) The abrupt switch in the third section from first person to third person.  I felt separated from the characters, especially Claire, and more or less ceased to care about her.  Her behavior on the expedition didn't feel like the person that was established in the first two-thirds of the book, either. 
2.) The many parallels between Magda and Claire felt a little contrived.  Her quest to trace her family's history was compelling in and of itself, and didn't need to have those "clairvoyant" elements.
3.) The Ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting.  For a truly fascinating real theory about the Ripper murders, read Alan Moore's From Hell.  
4.) Absolutely no resolution on what happened to Nick and Christian.
5.) The Jack-Claire affair was just creepy.
