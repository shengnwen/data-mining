Not only are the recipes completely unoriginal (dried onion soup mix pot roast, coke pot roast, dump a can of something on a pot roast), I was quite disappointed to find that most of them call for heavily processed ingredients like the aforementioned cans of condensed soup or packages of dried soup mix. Nor is there any particular effort to present nutritionally balanced meals or menus. 

I guess they thought that including the nutritional breakdown for each recipe qualifies them for the 'healthy' title, but I heartily disagree.  This one's getting tossed or donated
