It should be obvious from the title that Debi Pearl does not understand the Bible.  In the King James translation of the Bible, God says "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him."  The word "meet" is an adjective meaning "appropriate," not just a misspelling of "mate" as too many people imagine.  So the question is "what is appropriate"?  If Adam is strong, intelligent, and independent, then (one might reasonably argue) so too should be Eve.  But, whatever you think is appropriate, Pearl has shown even in the title of her book that she doesn't really care what the Bible says or means.  (I guess her husband didn't correct her, so she had no other way of knowing!
