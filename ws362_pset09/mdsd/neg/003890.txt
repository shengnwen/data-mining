Frabato (Bardon) battles the Evil Lodge on the eve of WWII.  This book is written in a "Flash Gordon Vs. The Cosmic Meanies" style, further fractured through the services of a bad translator.  If this is Bardon in action, then imagine a scratchy sound track, really evil bad guys in black suits and top hats, and the ultimate good guys being Koot Hoomie and His Ascended  Masters gliding to the rescue on flying carpets.  Bardon's secretary wrote this one and I really believe she was planning to farm this script out to Fritz Lang. At most, quaint, at worst, a disappointment to anyone seeking enlightenment on the Hermetic front.
