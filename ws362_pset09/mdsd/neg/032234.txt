Is the Internet the last, best hope for the Democratic Party? The authors, who are the  founders and moderators of two popular leftist websites, would argue a most resounding yes. However, I'm not quite convinced that theirs is the best solution, even though they gave a rousing lecture on behalf of their book a few months ago before a friendly audience at a noted New York City-based progressive think tank. And much to their credit, both in their lecture and book, they  have offered at times a thoughtful, occasionally profound, analysis of what is wrong with the Democratic Party. But frankly, I think they've missed the Democratic Party's ongoing woes, which more thoughtful, conservative authors like Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter have noted in their books.

With much regret, I also think that both authors have become part of the problem, since they have ignored the significance of ongoing battles in the global War on (Islamofascist) Terrorism, acting as if these battles had no relevance to current American politics (Daily Kos founder - and co-author of this book - Markos Moulitsas Zuniga has taken a hypocritical stance by opposing Connecticut Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman's reelection due to Lieberman's unwavering support of both Israel and our participation in the War on (Islamofascist) Terrorism, since he and his co-author, Jerome Armstrong, have argued persuasively in their book that Democratic party activists must move beyond single issue politics.). Instead, for example, I have found a more thoughtful analysis of current partisan Democratic Party views on Israel's bloody, but necessary, war against Hezbollah stated eloquently in political pundit - and commentator - Dick Morris' recent column (http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/Comment/DickMorris/072606.html) co-authored with his wife Eileen McGann, than I have seen from those posting at either www.MyDD.com or www.dailykos.com. Since some of the comments on Israel's current war against both Hamas and Hezbollah  that I have seen posted at www.dailykos.com could be described as rabidly anti-Semitic, then I have to wonder whether potential buyers should purchase this book. My own answer is no, recommending instead, more profound works written by the likes of Dick Morris, Bernard Goldberg, Kevin Phillips, Peter Beinart and Joe Conason, to name but a few, who are more thoughtful scribes across the political spectrum than the authors of "Crashing the Gate: Netroots, Grassroots, and the Rise of People-Powered Politics"
