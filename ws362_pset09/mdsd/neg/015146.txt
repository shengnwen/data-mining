This book seems to be more about how to gain a birthmother's trust and confidence in order to get her baby, and how to work the adoption system. In so doing, the book loses sight of the fact that adoption exists in order to provide children with loving homes, not to provide infertile couples with children.

She does, however, help to explode a myth: that children placed for adoption are "unwanted." This is of course far from the truth, as Burns points out that birthmothers today usually aid in picking their child's parents and nearly always want to see, hold, and spend some time with their newborns prior to relinquishment.

Still, some of the advice can get potential adoptive parents into trouble, such as placing ads for a baby. In many states this is illegal. 

Some advice in this book is helpful, but I must still urge potential adoptive parents to seek the assistance of a licensed adoption agency
