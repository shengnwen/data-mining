Comprehensive references of bochemical pathways are not common, especially with well described cofactors, modulators, and interactions with disparate pathways.  This book could provide such a useful reference, unfortunately,  the quality of the layout is so poor as to make it very difficult to read.   Poor graphic quality, exceptionally small fonts, and poor color choices  render what should be a most useful reference into a visually challenging  document.  At the price, the book is a disappointment, although the content  is great. One  wishes that the editors would rerelease it after completely  revising the graphics and production quality, as the content is indeed very  useful
