We were recommended this book by our pastor as a part of our reading for premarital counseling. While it does contain good information on the basics of male & female anatomy, the helpful part stops there. The LaHayes perpetuate all sorts of gender stereotypes, one-sided arguments, and just plain odd understandings of Scripture. My husband and I were both offended by the way that this book characterizes women as "delicate creatures" who need to know nothing about sex save for the needs of their husbands. We were angered by the LaHayes argument -- supposedly based on scripture -- that all couples should want and attempt to have children. While children are indeed a blessing to many couples, it seems simplistic and unrealistic to assume that all couples should have upwards of five children. While we've both slogged through this book in hopes of learning as much as we can, it's been a disappointing process. While this book may be an interesting look at the conservative church's views on sex as of 1955, I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a helpful, encouraging introduction to married sex
