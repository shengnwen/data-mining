I normally don't put a book down without finishing it, especially one in the genre of classic American literature.  However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of "thy" and "thou" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, "How do you call yourself?" instead of "What is your name?" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is "How do you call yourself" better than "What is your name"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these "translations" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.  I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak Spanish.
