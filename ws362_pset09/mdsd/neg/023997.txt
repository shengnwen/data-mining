I ordered this book and received the Grand Rizzoli Larousse collegiate (335,000 entries).  I tried to exchange that for the Harper Collins unabridged (900,000 entries) and was told to get a refund from Amazon.  I did this.

I ordered this book again from a different vendor and again received the Grand Rizzoli Larousse collegiate wrapped in the Harper Collins unabridged jacket.  I tried to exchange this for the correct book and was sent yet another copy of the Grand Rizzoli Larousse collegiate.

I too would love to get this book
