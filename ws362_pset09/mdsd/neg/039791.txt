He accuses us of being a nation of whiners. This book proves conclusively that HE is a whiner, but he does not represent the entire nation. It is just another in a long line of pointless books scolding me and you for nothing in particular. If he were honest he would offer some constructive suggestions. He offers no suggestions for how we can overcome the sins he accuses us of -- unless you consider &quot;stop whining&quot; to be a helpful suggestion
