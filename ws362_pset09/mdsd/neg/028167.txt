Itsy Bitsy spider is probably the third most favourite rhyme of most kids.  The reason?  The words have such a wonderful rhythm about them and it sounds so plausible!  This book does away with that magic.  The new lines seem to have been thrust to sort of fit into the same rhythm, there is  no natural flow. To make matters worse the concepts are very confusing in places! fOR eg the the phrase "off came the fan", My son expected the fan to come "off" like his bandaid, not turned off.  I wasnt impressed with the art work either
