He says that the main-stream media exhibits a conservative bias.  If he thinks that ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, et.al, are lapdogs of the conservative movement then I don't even want to know what he considers "liberal".  If he thinks that the NY Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune have been kow-towing to George Bush, well, I'd like to know which versions of the Times & Post & Tribune he's been reading 'coz it sure ain't the same ones I see on a daily basis.

Typical, though.  Take a concept, turn it 180 degrees on its head, & shout it from the rooftops.  If you shout it long & loudly enough someone will eventually start to believe it.....
