Although I appreciated Helen McCarthy's inside information from interviews and her filmography list, I found her analysis of these films very superficial.  In short, I feel that any avid fan of Miyazaki could have written this book: it is simply a collection of facts and, as the other negative reviewer said, gushing about the films.  There is no in-depth, intellectual engagement with Miyazaki's work
