The premise and style of the book are very interesting and I applaud John for his creativity and ability to write from a feminine perspective (See John's blog 'The Whatever.'  He has a post up to a web page that analyzed the prose and determined the author was a woman.)

Overall I found this book a bit of a chore.  By chapter 4, I was bored, wondering where the amorphous narrative was going, and slogging through the rest was unappetizing at best.

I heartily recommend John Scalzi's other SciFi works, but not this one.
