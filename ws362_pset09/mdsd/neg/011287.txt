Ok, Some books should be judged by their cover. This is one of them. By the books own definition, bobbers are "a machine that had things cut or bobbed off." It then goes on to explain using a stock machine as a starting point. The bike on the cover, like about 80% of the bikes in this book, does not use a stock frame or front end as a starting point. Many of them are aftermarket raked and stretched frames using overlength front ends and mag wheels. Clearly not bobbers. This book should be called Art of the Custom Motorcycle. It is a decent book about modern custom bikes, but if I had the opportunity of browse the book prior to purchasing, I wold not have purchased it. I would categorize this book as a book written by people who are taking advantage of the recent bobber craze without knowing the true definition of the term. On the flip side, the book is a good value for what Amazon charges and if you are into custom bikes perhaps you should consider it. But don't expect to see traditional bobbers
