What can I say?  Arlie Russell Hochschild says some interesting things about the state of the family unit in the 90s, but I just don't buy it.  She writes pages and pages decrying capitalism and its corrupting influences after studying the employees at ONE COMPANY.  If that seems credible enough for you, maybe you'll swallow this convuluted book.  But even looking beyond her flawed argument, her writing style presents many problems.  She writes not like she's presenting an intelligent sociological phenomenon, but like a novel already slated for the best seller list.  And she provides case study after case study, in what looks like an attempt to bolster her thesis, but what turns out to be just boring.  So try and skip chapters 5, 9, 10, 12, and 13.  Actually, on second thought, just try and skip this book
