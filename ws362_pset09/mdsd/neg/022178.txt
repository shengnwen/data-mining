This is one of the oldest English title books on TCM Herbs and have been revised. It offers compilation of herbs and contraindictions and sketches of them. There is almost nothing of original research nature. The book has been used for those chose to take English language exam in the US for sometime. As China is opening to many foreign students and practioners, many can read Chinese text. The book is becoming outdated for many reasons: 1. Translation is choppy at best, 2. Sketches need to be less artistic and requiring more details. 3. Modern pharmacology terms are needed. 4. No interactions with other herbs are described in modern scientific terms. 5. No current reference or clinical data are to support the claims. 6. There are numerous PinYin, Latin and Korean terms typo flaws throughout the entire book(This is most unfortunate as students depend on them for survival- a sign that proof reading with foreign language processors was not aatempted or applied). The caligraphical terms for each section are problematic and can be fixed with something easier to read. I was also informed more herbs are included in the forth coming edition for $120.00 a book.  Many US registered LAcs return from China claim they can obtain Chinese pharmacology/herb books for ~US $5.00 with essentially the same information. The expectation for this and any new editions for supposed a high quality scholarly text is now higher or one can go back to $5.00 version with a Chinese-English dictiontary for a total of $10.00 not $120 dollars.  

This is a useful reference book which can be more scientific and modern (e.g., lists more recent sources, and clinical data to substantiate claims)to remain as authorative source. The book seems to suggest the authors compiled the text from classical sources and referenced to the text.
