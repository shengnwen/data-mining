Quiet honestly the one thing that makes Chrisopher Hart's books on Anime and Manga "less" than others is the fact that he isn't very good at it. Oh, he makes some good points, especially when comparing American comic drawing with manga style drawing, but there are better books out there. 

If this is all that is available then you won't be to dissapointed in buying it, but being as they are usually around $20 (at least where I am) then you might want to get your moneys worth and stick around for one of Hikaru Hayashi's many How to Draw Manga books as they are usually more detailed and better drawn
