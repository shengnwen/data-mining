Like the reviewer you will find below, I found the the first 75 pages boring.  It was all descriptive narrative and no real action--and describing the same thing over and over and over and over.  UNlike the reviewer below, however, I never found the remaining book as interesting as the first one by this author.  In my opinion we've got a one-trick pony, here
