This is not a book on innovation.  It is about building paper castles first and then trying to tear down with supoosedly empirical evidence. What it says at the end of all that boring and trivial reading is that a firm should not divert its attention to outside-the-firm areas of innovation and instead should focus on core innovation.  Eureca!  OK, but how are they going to do that?  Nobody knows.  Just be focused on your innovastion efforts and don't ask more questions.  Don't waste either your money or your time on this book and serve your nerves
