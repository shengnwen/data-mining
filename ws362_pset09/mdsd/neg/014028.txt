I just finished a read through of the entire Dirk Pitt series, and overall I'd say that as the series went on, it did not improve.

Now, I don't think that anyone expects great literature, but the author seemed to get caught up in the trap or escalating danger rather than variations of situations to approach.

And as the series progressed, more errors crept in.  Perhaps Cussler's reputation made his editors think that they no longer had  to edit his manuscripts, I don't know.  In this book, obviously the hurricane path issues are obvious.  Another item, for those who have read the whole series, is that Lauren Smith's father who's death was cronicled in Vixen 03 was resurrected to come to the wedding.

Oh, and although it might be cute, the ever increasing roles that Cussler wrote himself into got to feel just silly.

Overall, I can't say that I'd recommend this unless someone had read the rest of the books and just wanted to get the series over and done with.  Read the first couple novels in the series instead
