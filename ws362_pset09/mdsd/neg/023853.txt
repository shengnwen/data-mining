LOOK, ANYTIME AN AUTHOR TEAMS UP WITH ANOTHER ONE ( whom i don't know ) TO WRITE A BOOK THAT SHOULD BE YOUR FIRST WARNING .
MY EXCUSE THEN ?  WELL, I WAS IN A HOTEL ON VACATION, COULDN'T SLEEP ...AND THIS  PULP FICTION WAS THE LESSER OF THE EVILS IN THE GIFTY-GIFT SHOP WHERE I PAID FULL PRICE.  I SUSPECT I MAY EVEN HAD PAID CANADIAN PRICES EVEN THO I WAS IN WASHINGTON D.C.   LOL...THE JOKE IS ON ME .  BUT, PER USUAL I SHALL DONATE THIS  HARDLY BENT BOOK TO EITHER MY LIBRRAY,  OR IF THEY REFUSE TO TOUCH IT ...A PRISON WHERE THEY CAN'T COMPLAIN. I GAVE IT TWO STARS FOR CORRECT SPELLING ....LOL.
 I SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH INSOMNIA
