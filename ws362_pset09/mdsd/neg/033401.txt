This is not a novel?  Damn straight it isn't.  I'm usually the first person to applaud experimental fiction, but Markson's book reads like the literary journal of a manic depressive.  Not exactly groundbreaking, just pretentious.  For those of you not already aware, the book is simply a collection of seemingly disordered facts about famous writers, historians, and philosophers.  It turns out that the sentences are not completely disordered, because they tend to follow a very subtle arc that echoes the pattern of life.  However, aside from offering the occasional interesting fact, this book has no appeal.  It is the first book I couldn't finish in six years
