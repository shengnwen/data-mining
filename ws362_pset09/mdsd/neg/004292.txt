I had to read this book because of a class, and I could barely force myself to finish it.  This was one of the most boring books I have ever read - and I am a voracious reader.

This is not my idea of a memoir because there is nothing personal about it.  There is no sense of Ms. Didion or her family in this book, or who they are.

As a history, the book is disjointed, with disconnected chapters, an overabundance of quotes, and no sense to be made out of it all.  It is also extremely dry and full of facts that don't add up to any kind of whole.

I actually lived in California for twenty years and I loved it.  I couldn't imagine a less interesting book about such a vibrant and fascinating state.

I can only think that critics are praising this book because Ms. Didion is such a celebrated author.  I doubt that most people would find this book interesting.
