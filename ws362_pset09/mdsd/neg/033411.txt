The debate over the importance of participatory democracy is interesting, but does it really need to be debated in a 200+ page book? 

Sometimes Polletta provides some interesting history on various social movements tried to be collectivist, but most of her book is generalized, esoteric rambling. Somehow some sociologist with graduate degrees feel entitled to write long boring, theoretical pieces like this. This book offers no new insight and will be forgotten. Jo Freeman wrote a short article (about 20 pages) on the same subject and it was much better than this.
