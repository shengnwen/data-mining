This book is horrible.  It's badly written code wise and also in a literary sense.  The author takes good examples and ruins them.  Also he makes up his own terms to replace supposedly bad ones.  The code is poorly written and contradicts the authors supposed &quot;style.&quot; He make use of breaks when ever possible, and then tells you that the use of breaks is not good practice. He also typedef's beyond reason.  I would strongly recommending NOT buying this book.  I unfortunately had an equally idioic teacher who requried this book.. be warned steer clear
