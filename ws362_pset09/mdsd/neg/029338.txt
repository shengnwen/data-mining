while flipping through this book i kept getting this eerie three-ring binder feeling.  something about this book feels cheesy and self-published, and its not just the chapter heading fonts.  for one, being that this book is supposed to be about the photographs as well as the sory, i found the paper unsuitable for printing photos.  as well, though there are quite a number, they are all small and poorly printed
