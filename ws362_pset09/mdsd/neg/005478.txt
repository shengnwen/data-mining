I checked this out of the library & only read about 1/3 of it. That's about all i could take of this mean-spirited, one-sided, repetitive diatribe.

Please read the Pub Weekly review above. It gives a fair picture of this crappy book.

I have no problem w/ criticism of hollywood & celebrity, as long as it's fair & intelligent criticism. This book is neither. It's just a biased, unoriginal rant.

The worst thing i can say about it is that the tone is that of a smug, intolerant, finger-wagging, self-righteous hypocrite of the worst kind. Of course the authors, while condemning these  celebrities, have no problem making money off of them (& their misfortunes). These guys are the worst kind of blood-sucking insects.

If you're really curious, leaf through it at the library & then put it back. Please don't give these narrow-minded idiots your hard-earned money.
