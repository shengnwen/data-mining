We have "It's So Amazing" and I was looking for something more puberty specific for my daughter to read. I was reading it last night and I was SHOCKED at how blunt the book is.  Now, I consider myself to be a relatively liberal & laid back person, and openness about sexuality is not a problem at our house.  However this book reads like something out of an abstinence manual.  It starts off with the basics....the hows and whys....then slowly moves on to pregnancy....uh, huh, yep....then it starts spiraling downward from there.  Want to have sex?  You'll end up pregnant and need an abortion.  Still think sex is fun? Well look at ALL THE STDs you can get from having sex, and lets go in to it in the most graphic detail we can.  Haven't had enough?  Well, have sex and you'll get AIDS.  That's right, we've even included a picture of you, in the hospital, hooked up to an IV because you're dying of AIDS.

My take on the book?  Just don't have sex. You'll get pregnant. And it will kill you.

Seriously, all humor aside....this is a book that is supposed to be for children 10 years and up, and the subject matter is just WAY too intense for a young child.  Some of that stuff is info you will learn as you are older and can emotionally and mentally process it.  I am not too sure WHY the author felt the need to be so blunt....it starts off as though the reader has no concept of puberty and sexuality and quickly moves on to abortion and STDs.  In the reviews at Amazon.com a lot of people complained about "questionable morality" issues in the book.  Quite the opposite, I think this a great book for those who support abstinence.....I think.
