Another enjoyable read, quicker than most because you don't have to think. It's not much of a mystery, and the Siamese cats really have little to do with its solution but provide a clever title. Mostly they give Braun a chance to ooh and ahh over the inexplicable ways of cats. It was many books ago that Koko actually provided a useful clue to his host, Mr. Q, the genial bachelor billionaire who is every tame girl's wish. Mostly this is a tale from Moose County, 400 miles north of anywhere. If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is certainly not right place for you to pick up this series.  

Brrr is celebrating its 200th anniversary with Scots, a giant cake, bland good will from everyone, and Qwilleran's second historical disaster radio show up on stage. That's pretty exciting, too, when we get to hear the whole script. Oh, sure, there's a bad happening or two in town, but don't let that put you off for they occur well out of view. There's also good times with Q's good friends, and a subplot about an old lady, her fabulous antiques, and her mercenary granddaughter. There's no significant development in the relationships among any of Braun's stock characters--you know who I mean. To top off a pleasantly fluffy read, Braun appends two of Q's favorite delicious recipes. A quintessential summer beach read, guaranteed to pass a few hours pleasantly.
