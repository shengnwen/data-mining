This book covers very little of the subject for which it is titled. If one were looking for a pure molecular biology textbook with some developmental correlations, then this is the text for you. It covers none of classical embryology and development. It is geared more towards laboratory technical work than to understanding fundamental principles. I had to give it only one star because of the misleading title. In reading this book, you will not learn the steps and stages of embryology and development. This text expects you to already know them like the back of your hand. You will not learn any developmental anatomy. You will learn a lot of seemingly arbitrary chemical signaling. Also, this text contains no glossary. I don't know what the author was thinking with that
