Not one of Krentz's entertaining books.  I usually enjoy her stories immensely; however this one was not funny but rather depressing.  Phila seemed to me to be too opinionated in her views and unable to deal with  those of opposing views.  The characters were not portrayed as likable  individuals and made the storyline unbelievable.  The attraction between  Phila and Nick did seem genuine, but her dislike of the families and all  they stood for to her seemed too insurmountable an obstical for her to have  really overcome. Unfortunately I just didn't get any enjoyment from this  particular story
