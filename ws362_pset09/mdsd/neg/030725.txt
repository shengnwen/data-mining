THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES does, in its presentation, follow in the footsteps of what has been a successful formula for Rough Guide books. This guide is a thematic guide to movies in general. The book consists of over 80 categories of movies such as: animals, b-movies, cops, doctors, fantasy, horror, musicals, prison, serial killers, zombies, etc. Each category has a selection of movies which, for the most part, fit the subject. There are also various sidelights thrown into different categories which expand upon the actors, writers, directors, etc. Unforunately, although there is a spattering of cult movies included, most of the films covered are standard fare movies which fit the category. Additional mistakes, such as the wrong year for a movie, are to be found on occasion. The selection of movies for some categories appears almost random with gaping exclusions (the category for zombies lists CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD but excludes DAWN OF THE DEAD and Fulci's ZOMBIE; the category for 3-D lists JAWS 3-D but excludes COMIN' AT YA IN 3-D). Additionally, any information provided for a movie includes: title, director, abbreviated cast, and a short description, which in most cases is shorter than what you can find in a video review guide. If you are looking for a general introduction to popular films in a thematic presentation, that can be found in this book. If you are looking for a book about actual cult films and any kind of discussion about them or their particulars, it is not to be found here
