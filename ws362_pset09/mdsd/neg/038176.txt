This book has to be one of the most pretentious and self-indulgent books I have ever read. The author seems to care very little for her reader and just tries to show off her supposed skill with language. In the hands of Nabokov or Rushdie such experimentalism is genius and beautiful. In the hands of Ali Smith it is clumsy and self-indulgent. In fact, this book made me angry. Whatever happened to telling a good story or developing characters? It is as though Ms Smith just spewed up whatever was in her head on to the page with very little thought into how to make her characters complex, give the themes any depth or subtlety, or advance the narrative. And to think she received critical acclaim for this book. Ugh. Bring back Nabokov! I weep at the thought that this is the future of "good" literature
