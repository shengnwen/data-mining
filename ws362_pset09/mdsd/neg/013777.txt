I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.

Anyway. On to the review -

It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.

That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.

Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer
