My 3-year-old daughter loves the mazes she finds in her coloring and activity books, so I finally indulged her by getting her first book devoted to mazes.

To my surprise, she completed half the book in the first sitting. The book is of good quality, and the mazes are appropriate for beginners who don't quite have the patience or motor skills for complex mazes. However, for $4.94 I would have expected something with more mazes, or at least more than black and white pages with simple illustrations.

If you're willing to spend $5 on a maze book, I would recommend steering away from this one and paying a little more for one of the books by Kumon to get more bang for your buck
