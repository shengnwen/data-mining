This book is pretty weak.  It reads like a list of cliches taken from James Bond and every other cheapo action book you could imagine.  The women are all beautiful and mainly interested in sex with the hero; the Nazis (of course) wear big boots and are psychotic; the head of the secret government agency has to come to beg the hero to come out of retirement for one more job; there are shoot-outs and fist fights galore.....  I think you get the point.  The language is at its worst during the romantic scenes, which are barely one step above Romance novel cliches.  I will give the book the following.  There is a ton of action from stop to start.  But generally, this is a weak thriller
