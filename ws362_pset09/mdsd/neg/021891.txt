A sloppily argued, near-incomprehensible exercise in nostalgia, nihilism, and name-dropping.  This book has almost no explicit connection to the events of 9/11 or the titular &quot;Ground Zero.&quot;  Virilio may be right about the dangers of modernity, but his argument is superficial.  Be sure to read translator Chris Turner's footnotes
