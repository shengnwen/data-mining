The most painfully slow book I've read in years.  I don't think he made it out of first gear until about 3/4 the way through the book. With difficulty he finally shifted into second gear and by the end of the book was cruising at a not-so-exhilarating 30 miles an hour.  The medical and scientific details are accurate and fairly well-written.  The major subplots are &quot;what's for dinner tonight,&quot; and &quot;what will the plumber work on next.&quot;  The dialogue is artificial and irritating.  It reminds me of a dialogue from one of my third-grader's stories.  Using words like &quot;modicum&quot; and &quot;greasy spoon&quot; I wonder if Mr. Cook could possibly have been born in the same century as the rest of us.  I want my $7.00 back
