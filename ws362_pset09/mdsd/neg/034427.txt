I have read all of Bryson's books and loved them. Intuition said to NOT but this book since reliving childhood has been done time and time again.
In my opinion, the TITLE of this book is the only creative part of the book - sure, Bryson can be funny but this book reeks of being forced.
Really not worthly of what the author has done in the past. We have heard all of this before. Save your money or go to the library
