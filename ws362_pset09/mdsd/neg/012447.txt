I was searching for a few new quality books to read to my pre-school grandchildren. Chester's Way was one of 4 books I bought. I was enjoying the story and illustrations, but my heart sank when a character's solution to neighborhood bullies was to use a squirt GUN. She also states that she always carries one "just in case". I think that the author could have and should have found a more creative way to address the bulling issue.I plan to return the book
