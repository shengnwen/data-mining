Coming from a family of exquiste southern cooks, my Grandmother being the best of the best I was saddened and very disappointed in these books. Hoping to find a long forgotten recipe or at least a tweaked version of some of my long remembered recipes what I found was an exercise in opening cake mix boxes and soup cans. Sorry but with  these books "The Lady doesn't Cook"
