I eagerly awaited Southern Style's release ll/l only to find that the content was repeated from past issues of Southern Accents.  I was looking forward to new pictures/content but found very little that wasn't in old  magazines. I think the editors could have at least given us different  camera shots of those same rooms.  Big disappointment
