this book was like watching paint dry.  there was little to no suspense. if the author would have taken as much time developing the characters as he did over describing every little detail of rooms, desks or the elevators, maybe he would have ended up with a half way readable novel.  the characters didn't evoke any emotion from the reader except maybe disinterest
