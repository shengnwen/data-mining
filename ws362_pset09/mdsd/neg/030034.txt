A Shameful Translation

This volume is quite possibly the sloppiest, most disrespectful, and least reliable "translation" of Rilke I have ever seen.   The term "translation" can only be used in the most casual sense for in their notes on translation Barrows and Macy describe a kind of vague new-age method of translation consisting of a kind of collaboration between them and the original, full of interpretation and subjectivity (pg. 35).   At one point they even confess to doing away entirely with the accurate translation of one of the poems in favour of a "metaphorical" translation (pg. 40).   They admit to omitting lines, entire sections of poems, and even collapsing two consecutive poems into one (pg. 41).   Any legitimate and reputable translator would be horrified by these hackneyed techniques.

For example, in the very first poem, one which sets the tone for the whole book, Barrows and Macy, in their foot notes, admit to cutting out the entire last stanza, fully one-third of the first poem because, "it is not as strong as the first two stanzas, especially for the opening poem of The Book of Hours."   Rilke, his editor, and his publisher obviously thought it was strong enough.    The fact of the matter is that Rilke's work is what it is and it is not the translator's place, as any reputable translator knows full well, to make those determinations.   On page 42 of their notes on translation, commenting further on Rilke's supposedly weak writing, they smugly comment, "Since we could not bring him the chicken soup he needed on those long nights [of writing], we have done him the favour of culling."   One wishes they had done him the favour of a reliable and reputable translation instead of rewriting his beautiful and thoughtful original.
