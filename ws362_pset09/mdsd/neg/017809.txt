This book looks so deeply at the songs The Beatles wrote that it actually takes away from the magic of the music.  The author grants such genius for the way someone claps on a backing track or offers a dull explanation of the teenage longing felt in the lyrics of some of their earlier songs.  If The Beatles themselves had given this much thought to the music they were making then the magic would have surely been lost during the recording process.  Even John Lennon thought the critical press overanalyzed their music on many occassions.  He would probably turn over in his grave laughing at the amount of thought Tim Riley put into his song descriptions.  Make no mistake, I am a huge Beatles fan and wanted to like this book. But I could not get through the boring overanalysis of each track by the author.  He did something that I thought was impossible.  Take the fun out of The Beatles music.
