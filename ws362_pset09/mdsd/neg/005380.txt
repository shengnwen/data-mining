reviewer PTR said it right, but i'll say it myself: this great, ingenious novel, when we cut to the chase, really s*cks, is really beyond brutal. the writing isn't bad, it's frightening, reaching new heights of convolution and impermeability. i've read Faulkner and liked some of his books. "Light in August" was powerful and hypnotic, and I did the obligatory The Sound..., As I Lay, and another of his earlier novels, the title of which, for the moment, I'm forgetting (but I swear I read it).  Absalom Absalom, assuming you're not a Faulkner cultist, will drive you to near suicide, so keep away any nearby guns. In other words, you may be tempted to take yourself out of your misery, forgetting you've got the freedom to put the book down (i finished it, aware that it was taking months, if not years, off my life). Go ahead, Faulkner fans, rip me a new one.  I can take it
