I oppose property politically and found this book completely unhelpful. Its arguments are, without exception, specious, Proudhon's style is verbose and graceless, and his answer to the question of the book's title a verbal  wrangling which reduces the work to an attack a highly specific type of  ownership in favour of another. Proudhon is no anarchist and no anarchist  should look to this book for inspiration. It is of hitorical interest as a  stage in the development of radical philosophy, nothing more
