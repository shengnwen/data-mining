Esposito do not blame the fundamentalists only for the conflict but also he blames the misunderstanding of America and its policies toward the Muslims world for escalating the conflict.
Esposito has his own agenda, as he is the founding director of the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, he want to see a dialogue between the West and Islam. Interestingly that the center he founded is funded by a Saudi Billionaire Prince, a connection which makes Esposito judgments questionable somehow.
Also he tries to present liberal Islam  (he calls it reformed) as a strong candidate to defeat the terror creed embedded in fundamental Islam. While he forget that most of the Muslim figures he is referring to have little weight in the Muslim religious arena
