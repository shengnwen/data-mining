This book is one big advertisement for IBD.  The author makes it clear that he is the founder of Investor's Business Daily (it's in big letters on the cover) and mentions it throughout the book many many times.  The extent to which he pushes a subscription to IBD is almost comical and unless you can afford it's hefty annual pricetag you're out of luck on many of his suggestions.  I know the pricetag on the book is cheap, but do you really want to pay anything for the ability to be advertised to, heck they should be paying me to advertise to me.  My suggestion is to stay away from this one.  I would strongly suggest Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor.  It's by far the best investing book I've read
