I have most of EJD's books and I was definitely not impressed with this one. It actually took me a little over a week to finish it which is unheard of with me and my beloved EJD books. I'm just not feeling this one but I still buy the hardcover out of loyalty and because a bad EJD book is better than a whole lot of other garbage out there that's disguised as "good" fiction.
 
EJD chose to write a plot involving scams, murder and suspense like he did with "Thieves Paradise," wish was not my favorite either. The main character Driver gets caught up with married lover Lisa. She is a psycho to the tenth power. Reading about how she kept up with Driver's every move just made me shudder to think how easy it is for a person to stalk you if they choose. 

I like that the backdrop is Los Angeles. Although EJD is not originally from Los Angeles, he's lived there long enough to have effortlessly captured in his novels the love-hate relationship you can easily develop for this city. You can't really describe it, you just have to live there to understand and appreciate his descriptions. I do like the appearance of characters from his previous books such as Arizona, Pam, and Panther. I'll admit Rufus was funny for words. The twists and turns of the story was okay but when it came to the end of the story I couldn't care less what happen just as long I was done. 

 
The good news is that I am ready for another dose of EJD. The man is a great author who really takes the time to write books that the majority of black people can relate to in one way or another. Like I said earlier suspense novels are fine but I'm hoping the next one goes back to his roots and deals with relationships.
