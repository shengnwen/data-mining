Our son is 7 years old and wants to learn how to play the drums.  I thought this would be a great book (I did look inside the book through Amazon's viewer) and it looked great.  The problem is the CD, it's horrible.  The whole point in having a CD along with the book is so the kid can hear what his lesson is suppose to sound like.  The stuff on the CD isn't even drums, it's a whole variety of other instruments!  In addition to this set we also got Carmen Appice's Realistic Rock for Kids, which also comes with a CD, and we love that one.  Carmine actually narrates the book and takes the kids lesson by lesson like he was sitting right there with them.  He is also playing the lessons ON THE DRUMS so the kids can hear what they are suppose to sound like.  I recommend checking that one out instead of wasting your money on this one
