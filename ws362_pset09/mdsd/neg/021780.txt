I would have given this book 2.5 stars if I could have, because only half of it is good.  The first half is basically about Yorks life before, during, then after WW1.  It's entertaining, I looked forward to reading it,  and it is well written.  The author uncovers a fascinating history, but  after that the book goes down hill.  Now the second half begins to go  deeply, actually more than deeply - intensely, deeply, deep into his life  after the war.  The author puts in tons of information, some in which I  can't imagine anyone would be interested in.  The only way I could see this  whole book being good would be if  one had to do an in depth research  papper on a specific factor of Sgt. York's life after the war.  So skipping  the second half would make this book great
