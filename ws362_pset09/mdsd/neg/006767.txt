I am 88. All my life I have loved my English History & the English Countryside. I have travelled in all the old 52 Counties of England & Wales. Against this background I find that Alison Weir has written the best historical Biography & the best History I have ever read. Of the criticised detail; for me,the Topography is a bonus. Overall the detail provides the facts. Most Professional Historians patronise the lay reader by relegating the facts to references or footnotes. Then by a deliberatively cultivated oersonal style they present their interpretaions of the facts as the correct history. Alison Weir allows the reader to make his own interpretation of the facts as well as a judgment on her own interpretation of them. I have not yet even read all the book - as you know its delivery was delayed - but I have read enough to know that each remaining page will continue to give me increasing delight. I end with one of many personal experiences reading this superb book.

      "In August 1924 I had a family seaside holiday at Walton on the Naze. One evening there was an adventurous expedition with other families to walk 'Round the Point'. As a child of 6 I remember clearly seeing in the evening sunlight the grassy mound with a few rocks where the castle once stood. No mention was ever made then or later to this being the place where Isabella had spent her first night in England on her return. In fact our families' expedition was a memorable occasion as there were several children for the adults to safeguard & we were nearly cut off by the incoming tide. Now my memory of that shingled shore is enhanced,not by nostalgia,but knowledge.
