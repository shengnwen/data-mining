What was an exciting adventure novel back in the 1970's for a young pre-teen (was I ever so young?) on re-reading now turns out to be a silly James Bond knock-off/Summer beach book. The most grating conceit is the author's habit of giving every *single* female charactor a "clever" name (Anna Bidet - French, Randi Knickers-English, Jemima Brown-African American, etc...). It hasn't aged well
