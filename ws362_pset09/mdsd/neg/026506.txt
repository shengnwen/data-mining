Be warned!  This book is not about science!

I don't know know who this Henry Miller fellow is but he doesn't know anything about geography.  Imagine my surprise when I purchased this book--expecting to read about the earth's different latitudal circles--and discovered it has nothing to do with the Tropic of Cancer or any other latitudal lines!  In fact, the so-called "author" can't even seem to WRITE in a linear fashion!  I've heard that this "author" has a book about the Tropic of Capricorn out but I'm willing to bet that that one has nothing to do with latitude either!
