The back of the book first got me interested. Even the first few chapters seemed very convincing. But at one point I began to realize that Gott had lost his mind. He gets to a point where he talks about being able to travel to the past and even meet yourself and he even implies that you could interact with yourself. I am really suprised that this guy, who is an authority on time travel, actually believes that bunk. He fails to realize that there is a difference between light and matter. Whenever you view anything from the past, including stars millions of light years away, that is all they are - light and nothing more. It isn't physical matter. You cannot go back in time and talk with yourself as Gott suggests. Your physical atomic matter exists in only one place at one time. When confronted with how the universe started, Gott simply states, "it started on its own". They teach you in grade school that matter cannot be created nor destroyed, and here we have the same old contradictory argument. Once Gott lost sight of this simple principle, the remainder of the book became a fairy tale not worth one's time reading. Give it up Gott. God created the universe and mankind. He wrote the complex formulas that you are bashing your brains out trying to figure out, and then he set the whole thing in motion. Any scientist who fails to acknowledge the Great Almighty as the One who started it all, is traveling down a path of vanity. Even Einstein acknowledged that science without God was futile. We didn't evolve from monkeys, like Gott suggests. Don't waste your money on this hogwash
