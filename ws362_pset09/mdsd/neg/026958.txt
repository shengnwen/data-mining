I bought this kit with the hopes of learning how to knit--but alas, the instructions were difficult to understand and I ended up searching online to find out how to knit and purl. The nice part of the kit is that you have needles and yarn to start out with so you don't have to wander into a yarn store and stare cluelessly at the shelves. If you want to learn how to knit, get size 7 needles, a skein of cheap 100% acrylic, and "The Knit Stitch" and "The Purl Stitch" by Sally Melville. The website http://www.stitchguide.com/ has great video demonstrations of stitches as well, and was a great deal more helpful than the Reader's Digest booklet that came with the kit
