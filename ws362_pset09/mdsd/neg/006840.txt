I am a builder who was looking for ideas on cottage decore for sea shore homes.  This book would be more aptly titled "Modern Architecture by the Sea".  The homes featured in this book had nothing to do with most peoples' preconceived ideas of what a "cottage" looks like.  I am returning the book for a refund
