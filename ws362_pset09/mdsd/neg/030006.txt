This was a great let down. It is evidently an attempt to write a modern multi-cultural PC version of Margery Allingham's great London detective stories ('Tiger in the Smoke' 'The China Governess' and 'Hide My Eyes') but it fails. One of the child characters in 'The China Governess' is introduced into the novel as an adult and is an assembly of cliches. 
The sense of London, so profound and chilling in Allingham's work is lost and the presentation of the city is shallow and indeed journalistic. Worse, there are authorial interventions ventriloquised via certain approved characters which read like op-ed pieces for the Independent newspaper. I'd recommend that readers try Allingham rather than Stevenson
