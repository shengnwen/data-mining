Having read other Catherine Coulter novels, I expected this to be along her usual level of excellence.  I was wrong.  In the introduction she states this isn't a rewrite of the novel, just putting it in different clothes -- she should have done some rewriting!  The characterization leaves much to be desired, the hero or heroine don't inspire any empathy, the writing at times feels emotionless (her complete lack of emotional punctuation, such as exclamation points, is an excellent example) and the dialogue is clipped and underdeveloped.  While the idea behind the story is good, the actual story itself is not up to Coulter's standards
