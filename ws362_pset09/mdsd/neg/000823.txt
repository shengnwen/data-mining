Material is great, but the digital format is awful. First off, it took 5 days from the day I ordered this until I was able to access it. Amazon claims there was a server error that prevented me from getting it right away. I am not sure why they couldn't reboot. To access the document, you need a .net passport as the document uses Adobe DRM security. The kicker is, the permissions are set so that you can only print 20 pages every 30 days, 20 times. Additionally, you can only copy 5 selections (1 page max per selection) every 30 days, 5 times. That means that if you wish to print all 529 pages (which I only needed around 100 of), you could only get 80% there in a total of 20 months. This interesting fact of course was not explicitly stated in the item description. This was a major headache, but to Amazon's credit they did refund my money. My advice would be to purchase the print version and to stay away from Amazon's digital locker system until they explicitly state whether or not you are able to print, and to what extent. It is absurd that you would not be able to print this. You could buy the book and make a photocopy/scan to OCR -- why not print? The cost of printing on a laser printer is around two cents a page. That would be $10.59 for the entire text. Cheaper than Amazon charges for the new version, but I don't think there is much of a market for bootleg copies of a text on Legislative Politics in Latin America. If there is, we live in a sad world.
