Boooooooooring! Homechick tripped me out, sharing her lewd fantasies with the world. It was plain to me that Pac used her as a distraction while behind bars. If she wasn't beautiful he wouldn't have given her and her letter the time of day. And his constant requests for more pictures...what do you think he was doing with them??? Why didn't he try to make something happen with her upon his release? In the media I've heard about his relationship with Jada and even Keshia is mentioned. But no word of any Angela. She was straight up used and played. Maybe she thought having "exclusive" Tupac letters made her special but the book only served to bring to light how foolish she was
