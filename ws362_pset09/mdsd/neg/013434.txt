The previous post says nothing about the quality of this book and thus should be considered a definition of the XAML technology rather than a review.

In my opinion this book seemed slapped together. It was as if the tech writer of the documentation paraphrased the MS XAML Help. There was very little usage of metaphor or humour to make the topic interesting or easier to understand. 

The code examples are extremely simple and unimaginative. In one of the very few lame attempts at humour the author comments about an animated rotating square and states that, "It may not be very useful, but it sure is fun to watch." I found this attempt at humour insulting. Can you imagine having a conversation with someone who talked like this?

If you are like me and you really like to have a paper version of bleeding edge tech stuff, you can be can be forgiven for purchasing this drivel. If you want to save yourself some hard earned cash, just download the MS Expression Interactive Designer CTP and work through the examples. You will learn more doing this in less time. In fact, unless you are stuck on the bus, you are wasting your time with this book.
