If you think you'd like to decorate your home with cardboard tubes, construction paper, and glitter, this is the book for you.  Otherwise, you might not find it very useful.

The book does have some hints that I found helpful, especially in the section on home remedies (the things you can do with vinegar!).  Also, some hints on saving money were sensible, if obvious (if you don't read a magazine, quit your subscription -- sounds obvious, right?  If only I could follow that advice...)  

But for the most part, I didn't find much I could use.  For example, instead of simply saying "have a garage sale and advertise for it" as an idea to make some cash, they give five or six ideas for advertising for a garage sale, some of which are just absurd (eg, painting footprints on the sidewalk leading to your house).

Some advice just seemed ill-advised to me, such as using your 401(k) as a savings vehicle for college or a first-time home.  Sure, you're allowed to tap it for those purposes, but you shouldn't plan it that way!

And a lot of the advice just seemed to lead you down the road to a more cluttered life, for example, the tip to fill a 5-gallon bucket with sand and motor oil to clean off the metal parts of your gardening tools.  How are you supposed to dispose of that properly?  Who's got space for a bucket of oily sand?  Ugh.

If all the examples I've cited really excite you, then by all means, buy this book.  Otherwise, just check it out of the library.  Or just check it off your to-read list altogether
