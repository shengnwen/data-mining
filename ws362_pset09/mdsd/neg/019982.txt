The number of fallacious arguments in this collection of essays boggles the mind.But what do you expect fron the likes of Jeremy Rifkin,who has had a glorious 40 year record of failed predictions and doomsday scenarios behind him?What can you expect from a Jerry Mander,who sincerely thinks that life was better before plumbing,medicine,running water,sanitation and other manifesations of civilizations' corruptions that destroyed the "Noble Savage"?One truly fallacious argument is the idea that land should revert back to a "Commons",a policy that is directy responsible for the deforestation,pollution and shortages so common in many 3rd world nations.It is precisely private land ownership,along with restrictions of usage,that makes environmental solvency possible.Many of the authors continually bash multinational corporations,but it is precisely the inflow of investment capital that leaders of poorer nations have been clamoring for-capital that makes the building of infrastructure possible.Big business gets the blame for 3rd world poverty from these authors,somehow oblivious to the fact that poverty has been a way of life for certain nations for as long as history can recall,and that it is only now that material comfort,a safe and abundant food supply,medicine,a longer,more comfortable life is now becoming possible for peoples around the world.The "Noble Savage":impoverished,diseased,dead by 35;this  paradise these Luddites imagine more primitive societies to be only shows what conceit,condescension and sillyness is at work in their thinking.These elitists want others to live in a cultural musueum so that they can turn on PBS or the Discovery channel and coo 'Awww.Look at the quaint little villagers work their quaint little plot of soil.And look at their quaint little straw huts.Awwww.'
