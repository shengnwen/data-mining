This book is for the serious philologist and/or linguist. Less of an explanation of early German life and language than a lecture-made-into-a-book on the evolution of a handful of words.The book assumes much more familiarity with ancient texts and dialects than the casual armchair historian will have. Lack of preexisting in-depth knowledge makes this book too ponderous and obtuse
