The author's writing style is atrocious.  He doesn't make Jobs into a fun character to read about, instead he's annoying and the book is annoying to muddle through.  It's a real shame because it could have been a blast. Thank God it had a story about Bill Gates prank calling Jobs or it would have been a total waste
