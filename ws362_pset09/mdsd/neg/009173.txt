I didn't read the book. I was looking for a serious biography of Hoover, after seeing Oliver Stone's primitive representation of a dark perverted homosexual in "Nixon". I thought : "well, it's 2006, this should be a serious object for research now". Looks like I'm wrong. The cover quotes Newsweek: "Eleanor Roosevelt was right. Hoover's FBI was American's Gestapo." Well, this is appalling. I know that Eleanor was a Gestapo specialist, as I know Newsweek is a well-documented contemporary history magazine. I mean, those are the ones you should trust when you look for information either on Gestapo, or Hoover. It means the FBI/Hoover deported Jews and tortured thousands of people, doesn't it ? Do I get the information right ?  I just don't get it: either there's no serious american historians of the 20th american history main characters ; or there is a liberal new order of things on such publications. Maybe there's another possibility, just tell me what's wrong here. Please
