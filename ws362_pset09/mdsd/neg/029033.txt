Ms. Klausner's review gave me pause.  As satire, this book would have been interesting and would have merited her glowing review.  Unfortunately, I think the author was utterly serious with this book.  The turgid focus is mindnumbing, without ever being attractive or interesting.  The perpetrators of the central mystery are obvious.  And yet...Mr. Ryan can write.  He held my interest all the while I said "this is appalling, what a narrowminded, pig".  I would buy a paperback of the sequel in December to see how the lead character changes, now that she is leaving being a tigress behind
