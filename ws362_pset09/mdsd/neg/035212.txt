Just as sad and unfortunate as missing the wave-of-the-day on the last day of a lifetime surf expedition, The Perfect Day missed the opportunity to do something really important for the ocean-loving community. This glossy coffee-table pantheon of glory to Surfer Magazine focuses on the lame, inane and myopic words of the professional surfer like they mean or represent something. Except for a very small token of tribute to the heart and soul of surfing (Rell Sunn, Miki Dora) and the environment (&quot;turds in the impact zone&quot;), Surfer pats itself on its commercialized back offering no more than a &quot;me, me, me&quot; mentality of self-praise for being Surfer Magazine. Instead of using this fantastic opportunity to offer something back to the community for what surfing has done for Surfer or how we can help our needy Mother Ocean continue to offer choice surf, they blow it, missing the wave-of-a-lifetime in the process. While the quiet surfers were in the water, Surfer Magazine, with their sponsored pros, were lined up at the bank totally missing this &quot;Perfect Day&quot;
