Hmmm... I'm disappointed by this book ;( I really love the "Bible" series, especially books about Flash. These books has very broad-content, aiming on all from beginers to proffesionals. But the Filemaker Pro 8 is big disappointment... There is almost nothing about advanced techiques, for me it looks like it's intended for users who, for some reason, didn't want to read manuals which came with FM ;(..
