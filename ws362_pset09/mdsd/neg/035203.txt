While the appeal of the 'oxford' name and the attractive price/page ratio make this book seem like a good deal, I found it extremely difficult to get any useful information out of this book.  The authors give their opinions  on subjects, before (or in many cases, in place of) giving any coherent  summary of it.  Just for example, try to figure out who Draco was.  If you  don't already know, this book is not going to tell you.  The writing style  is not especially clear, either.  If this is one of the best texts  available, I can see why nobody learns classical history anymore
