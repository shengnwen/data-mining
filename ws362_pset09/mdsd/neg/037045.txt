In this book I was hoping to find useful information for new RVer's.  Things like the details of leveling, flushing blackwater, cleaning, packing, insurance, etc, etc.  You know, the millions of details that are critically important to a successful trip all gathered into a single book so I could avoid endless hours scouring the net.  Instead, I got a book where the author comes across as a mindless dolt who seems to believe that all RVer's are equally mindless.  The book is repetitious, talks down to the reader, assumes the reader wants to turn the kids outside and sit on the couch and watch a Bears game in the comfort of their RV.  Given all the good reviews, it was quite a disappointment
