I just finished reading this book, and I am so glad I got through it finally.  The daughter of Sandra, LaShawndra, was so irritating to me that she just grated on my nerves the entire way through the book.  Also, the book didn't really have that much direction.  I had a hard time understanding the point of the book for some reason.  I was just happy that I finished it, so I could quit reading.  I loved her other books, but this one just didn't do it for me.
