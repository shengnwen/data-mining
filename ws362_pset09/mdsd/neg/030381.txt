Unfortunately i bought this book before i read the reviews. Not only is the information overly specific and not what they actually ask, the format of the questions and practice tests in the book are completely different from the ones on the actual test. They ask wierdly formatted questions about maps and different speakers that are just plain outdated. The numbers of questions in the practice tests are even wrong.
