The author explains that in the 1960s, Syrians would challenge Israel by shooting at Israelis who lived near the border.  Now, it may be obvious to him that no decent person ought to provoke people by living near a border, but it is not obvious to me.  Actually, what is obvious to me is that such attacks violate property rights and human rights.  

In any case, Israel would fight back against these attacks by sending tractors into the area near the border.  These tractors would draw Syrian fire, after which the Israelis would shoot back.  Anyway, Bowen explains that the Israelis were not the only people who were violent.  Yes, "Israel set the pace, but the Arabs did their best to keep up with the violence."  He goes on to describe Arafat and his gang.  And I think that Arafat more than kept up with Israeli violence!  

Is Bowen kidding?

The author also tells us that "Israel has poured money into colonizing the Occupied Territories, violating international law."  

Actually, the West Bank is disputed territory.  If it violates international law for Jews to spend money there and live there, it violates international law for Arabs to spend money there and live there.  What Bowen is saying is simply false.  

Oh, but there's worse.  Bowen also explains that Israel can prosper only if the Arabs suffer.  That's preposterous.  

Is there anyone who might like such a book?  Maybe someone who truly believes that Arabs have a Divine Right, decreed by God Herself, to steal land as long as by so doing, they can deprive Jews of human rights.  Maybe the book will make sense to someone like that.

However, if you think truth has value, and if you think peace, justice, or human rights are worthwhile, this book is not for you
