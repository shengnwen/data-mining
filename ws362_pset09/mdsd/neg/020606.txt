Beware: If you buy the digital version from Amazon, it forces you to use Microsoft identity, and you will not be able to download the file then load it in your reader... No, you must open up a security hole in your firewall to make the pre-file send encrypted information to God knows where, then you can only read it on that identity. It is Microsoft bound so I don't know if you Mac guys or Linux guys are covered here, on PDA side, forget PDA that is not the right terminology, Pocket PC it should say.

The whole thing is Microsoft bound, and if you like me are behind a corporate firewall you are unable to get the book at all.

Customer service will read 1% of what you write and even ask you to include the order # on your replies... not via email, but like all corporations with customer service which really sucks. You must login to there webpage and email from there, no inconvenience to great... When you at the end ask if they can replace with the paperback version, they ignore it completely and send an auto- responder returning the money to your credit card... I wanted the book, but that is not possible unbelievable enough, the order I ordered it with which still is not shipped from Amazon could not have the paperback added, so if I wanted it they could send it as an extra for 12 $ in shipping costs on top, instead of helping me save by tossing it in a pack still to be sent!

I believe this book could be great, but due to the extreme restrictions on this e-book and lack of service mentality I will never find out. So for all I recommend you to buy the paperback version, to avoid the dissapointment
