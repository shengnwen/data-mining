In Ethan Mordden's past books of the "Buddies" cycle books, the characters were superficial and the dialogue was glib. Nonetheless, the tales of his "outlandish" characters were a romp through "overly fictionalized" gay New York caricatures.

However, this fifth book and supposed conclusion to the series is a diaster. Initially, Mordden strays from his formula because it appears he now is an author who "Has a Point to Make," with overly simplified, pop-psychology analysis of gay life, with each of his supposed insights reduced to a three-point outline, as in "there are three types of gay love." Mordden then attempts to justify his ridiculous analysis by using his characters to illustrate the three types of gay love, to no success.

Despite the years that have supposedly transpired since the previous book in the series, the characters, nor the writing, have matured in the least. This book depicts New York gay life as vapid and superficial. As a former New Yorker, I can attest that while there are groups of vapid and superficial gay men (and straight people, for that matter), there are many more whose lives revolve around more than their CD collections and their gym-toned muscles.

One of characters goes on at length against gay marriage, with the author's character merely saying that it was a wonderfully passionate position for which he (the author) would receive hate mail. Consider this review as one of those pieces of hate mail. If Ethan Mordden doesn't want equal rights, then I don't have to purchase or read his books, particularly if they're as dreadful as "How's Your Romance?"

There is no plotline to speak of ... just a series of unconnected vignettes ... with no resolution or conclusion at the end of the book. Very disappointing!
