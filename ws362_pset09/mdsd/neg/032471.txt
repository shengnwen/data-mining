This Tech readout is more of the same churned out of the FASA factory. More mechs than you can shake a stick at, and hopefully they get you to buy the overpriced minitatures. However, that being said, there are a lot of mechs here, enough for even the most ruthless player. Thankfully though they left out the &quot;Typhoon&quot;, and &quot;Gauzzilla&quot; mechs. Mechforce North America rubber stamped pieces of junk that get away totally from the spirit of the game. Good background information on the mechs however, and good illustrations.
