  Look, "Sweet Jesus, I Hate Bill O'Reilly" is a funny title.  Seriously.  It reminds me of Al Franken's "Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot."  Good for one quick forced chuckle, but nothing more.  Just the work of another hapless liberal zombie (What is the author's name again? Hm? Hm?) spouting juvenile hate and wondering why Dems can't get elected President.  If this is your thing then please, go right ahead...
  Me? I'm going to pick up Bill's latest #1 New York Times hardcover bestseller, "Culture Warrior," even if the title isn't funny...
