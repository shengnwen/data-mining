While the story line was tolerable and interesting at times, the preachiness of 'educating the reader' about the favorite 'special interest' of the author really comes across to clumsily that it detracts from the overall flow of the book (every few pages there seems to be a jab here and there thrown in to meet some sort of a PSA quota.)  The story line is not as good as Toxin, but this title is slightly less offensive in the constant regurgitation of the 'healthcare system= evil' message than it is in Toxin
