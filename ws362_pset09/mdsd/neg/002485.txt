I really don't mean to sound judgmental but this was the very worst book I have ever read.  I mean even Nancy Drew books have more of a mystery than this one did.  

I have always heard good things about the Jesse Stone Novels.  This was the first and only one I will read.  I don't know if the grammatical errors were the author's fault or the editor's.  Even the dialogue between characters didn't even have complete sentences.  Very poor sentence structure.  I agree with C. Richard's review..."Distracting" in that there are terrible grammar errors throughout this entire book and was hard to focus.

Ths story was contrite and very easy to figure out way before the end of the book who the culprit was.  This is the only review I have given that has been a poor one.
