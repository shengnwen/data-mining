Fr. Harvey has been involved in ministry to homosexual people long before such ministry was &quot;popular,&quot; and for this he deserves credit.  However, he deserves little credit for the contents of this book.  He does set forth the official teaching of the Catholic Church on homosexual orientation and homosexual activity correctly, but this is a minor part of the book.  The bulk of it is dedicated to his own views on homosexuality, and most of the time he does not make clear whether he is talking about his views or the official position of the Church.      According to Harvey, homosexuality is a psychological disorder, and he believes that sexual orientation can be changed, or at least that one can &quot;advance&quot; towards heterosexuality.  This view goes against that of the American Psychiatric Association, which Harvey dismisses as being overly influenced by the gay rights agenda.  Incidentally, he does not believe in civil rights for gays and lesbians.      I found the book to be very one-sided, if not outright biased.  Harvey makes sweeping generalizations from authors he agrees with, and accepts their conclusions with little criticism, while he nitpicks with those he disagrees with.  If you already agree with his position, you will like this book.  However, it is not for those who are more open-minded or want to form an opinion based on reading both sides of the issue.      Instead of reading Harvey's book, I would recommend Richard Peddicord, O.P.'s book &quot;Gay &amp; Lesbian Rights: A Question: Sexual Ethics or Social Justice.&quot;  It is much more scholarly, and therefore a little dry, but I think it gives a much more balanced view of the Catholic Church's position on and struggle with issues of homosexuality
