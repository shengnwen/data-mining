Just for those of you out there who don't know, Al Bielek has successfully been proven a fraud by a group of researchers.  These are not your typical skeptics, they all still believe that the Phila Experiment happened, but that Bielek was in no way involved with the whole thing.

It convicned me.
 
People like Commander X and Bielek are taking you for a ride folks, and they're laughing all the way to the bank.  I'm not saying there aren't conspiracies, and no, i wasn't sent here by the "New World Order," I'm just trying to tell you people to not believe everything you hear to be fact.  This is just science fiction
