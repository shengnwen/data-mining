Mr. Johnson writes these essays with a clear style.  Sometimes the writing is engaging.  I am disappointed in the low density of facts and ideas.  Insights that might justify a paragraph or two are made to carry entire essays.  An example is the assertion that Mark Twain was an entertainer.  So far as I can see this is the only idea in the entire essay.  It is repeated, I think, four times, and stitched together with some fairly weak anecdotes.  Everything else in the essay is familiar to one who has never made a study of Clemens, except the disclosure that he copied his pen name from another newspaperman. Declarations of judgments seem to me to too often take the place of argued considerations.  And, too, I admit, I was put off by the obiter dictum identifying Ronald Regan as "that great man" for no given rhyme or reason.  In trying to sort out the benefit of this book to me, I realized that it made me look back on Johnson's histories of Christianity and art with new found skepticism.    I wish that I had waited for the paperback or scanned a few pages in a library, first.
