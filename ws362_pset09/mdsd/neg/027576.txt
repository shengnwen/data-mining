I've recently discovered Krentz at a local library. I've read most of her works by now, and her formula is a little worn from being used so often. I keep reading her mostly because there are flashes of brilliance in her  works that promise to be something more, but all of them then get lost.  Grand Passion is the worst of the lot -- I figured out the mystery of the  paintings by the second or third chapter, and the suspense and romance was  so unrealistic I was skimming every other sentence just to have the relief  of getting to the end
