The school of bodybuilding this book teaches is very outdated.  Save your money!  Don't buy this book.  I was following the instructions in this book and I gained thirty pounds...in fat!  That's right, it tells you to eat anything.  You heard me, ANYTHING.  In the old school way, the bodybuilder eats whatever he wants to gain mass and later on sheds off the fat through aerobic exercise.  The problem with that is, during the rigorous aerobic training, much muscle mass is also lost with it.  The new way of bodybuilding (which makes alot of sense) stresses to eat alot and eat LEAN while you train.  It does offer some great exercises but nothing you can't get from other good weight training books
