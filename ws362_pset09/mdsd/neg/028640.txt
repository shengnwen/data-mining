The book has 7 shrine projects.  The instructions repeatedly send you back to the beginning of the book to repeat steps.  The dimensions are different so you have to adapt.  Pretty much a pain. Also, the dimensions given in shrine 6 are flat out wrong.  Tried to find an addendum on the author's or publisher's website but none given. Cool photos of some finished shrines but be prepared for extra work trying to figure things out for yourself from the beginning
