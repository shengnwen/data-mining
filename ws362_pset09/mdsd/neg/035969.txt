Like the HBO Show: Real Time with Bill Maher; this book too often cuts to the cheap joke. Maher, always a mediocre stand-up, can't resist an easy joke where a top comic would aim higher. Bill sets the bar comfortably low: keep the yucks coming, kiss the celebrity bum, but don't break a sweat or Heaven Forbid come up with something original.
