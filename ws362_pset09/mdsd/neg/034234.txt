as a transmasculine, genderqueer person, i found this book offensive. valerio adopts socialized male sexism and then justifies it as a product of hormones. it is full of objectification of women, trivialization of women's emotions (at one point, he attributes the fact that a girlfriend has accused him of sexism to pure "jealousy"--instead of actually interrogating and examining this accusation in a serious way) and straight-up misogyny. the book is also extremely heterosexist--much of what valerio uses to define a man is his heterosexuality and attraction to women.

of course, i should not have expected otherwise--in the introduction, valerio establishes himself as someone who loves the binary and gender roles. i can't lie--he gave me fair warning for what i was about to read. i give it 2 stars because for anyone considering going on testosterone, it is an important perspective. but i warn that it is offensive, old-school machismo. it feels to me like it would be offensive to ANYONE who loves and respects or is a woman
