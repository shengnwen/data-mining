I purchased this book based on the hype listed about how it will boost your stream of referrals.  Not only was this book disappointing it reads and written like a sales brochure.  The authors gives you a tid bit of information and then wants you to go to his website which bounces you to other affiliate sites where he stands to make a buck.  The information is very general and I mean very general no origional thoughts that I can give credit to this author.  He does a good job of listing all the real gurus in this business and quoting from there material and dropping links to there material.  This is the first book I felt compelled to send back to Amazon!   So these reviews that I'm reading must be planted by the publisher because this book sucks
