I swore to myself I would not read another DS book again but there I went the lure of a DS book in the shelves was to much for me so I went ahead and bought it. (Can I get a refund?) Ms. Steel your books lately don't come close to what your first books were. The Ring, Zoya, those were, are classics. You didn't spend chapters talking about closets or how much money they had or what the wine tasted like. You truly made us care about the characters. I suggest you take a real break and go back to the reason you became a #1 bestselling author. I know authors don't like to read bad reviews but this is a cry for the good stuff. We miss the Daniel Steel that brought us Message from Nam, No Greater Love. What have you done with her
