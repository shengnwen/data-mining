It would be easy to dismiss a book that teaches that dinosaurs and human beings were contemporaries. However, as the last laugh may be with the millions who find themselves in sympathy with that view, it would be wise to give this book closer study.

"D is for Dinosaur" is the desperate cry of a person of faith attempting to reconcile the unharmonious realities of a literalist interpretation of the Bible and an earth full of the fossils.

As a person of faith myself, as well as one who believes in the findings of science, I can only shake my head at some of the assertions put forth in the book. A sampling:
-	All animals were vegetarians in the garden of Eden - even dinosaurs clearly built for predation
-	Noah was able to take small and very young dinosaurs with him on the Ark
-	Fossils are the result of animals (including dinosaurs) killed in the Noahic flood
-	Tales of dragons are based on actual encounters between humans and dinosaurs
-	The earth is only about 6,000 years old

Like many good religious education books, this one is colorful and fun, and even has a section for parents and teachers. It was here that I came across some of the absurdities that undergird the book. On page 70, students are taught to challenge their biology teachers. If the teacher says that such and such an animal lived 25 million years ago, the child is supposed to respond with "Were you there?" This is supposed to reduce the teacher to blithering, as shown in the illustration of flop-sweating instructor. However, that the question could also be turned back on the author. "You say that dinosaurs lived in the Garden Eden. Were you there?"

The problem here is really one of epistemology - how we know what we know. If Ham's approach won out, we would be reduced to accepting only events that we had personally witnessed. We could not believe that our parents had been children, or that the Civil War had actually occured. We would not be able to believe that places we had not visited existed. The entire basis of science, technology and communication would fall apart. Perhaps this book has value for this reason alone: to help us understand the basis for our own beliefs, and thereby guide us to strengthen our arguments. That knowledge will come in handy on the day the literalists come to our towns to push their semi-logical views.

I admire Ham, after a fashion, for having the courage to put his beliefs into words and pictures and expose them to public scrutiny. I don't accept his thesis, of course, or his assumptions about knowledge. Believers must find ways to harmonize the two great sources of truth in contemporary life: Scriptures and Science. This book should be a warning to all who love the Bible and science, and a primer for combating those who feel they must subvert one on behalf of the other
