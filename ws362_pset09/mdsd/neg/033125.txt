Molly-Ann Leikin is without doubt a skilled songwriter, but her book 'How to Write a Hit Song' barely begins to convey the complexities of this particular art form.  Written with typical American hyperbole and  Californian eccentricity, I found the book more and more annoying and  irrelevant as I went through it.   Sure there are some good ideas and some  nifty tips, but when only eight pages are devoted to lyrics and four pages  to rhymes without any explanation or examples of the different types of  rhymes songwriters employ, one has to wonder if she is interested in  communicating her knowledge to others.  I was hoping for a book packed full  of examples of song lyrics - only two appear in the whole book!  How can  budding lyricists/composers be expected to progress in their chosen art  form if copious examples of excellence from others are missing? Her chapter  on making time to write seemed to be written from the perspective of one at  the top of her profession, with its attendant lifestyle.  Frankly, knowing  that she spent an entire flight locked in the aircraft toilet so she could  write in peace, or that a friend of hers parks by the Queen Mary  to do his  composing is of little practical use to me. The one section I was hoping  would be useful was on marketing and publishing one's work. Again, a  disappointment as everything seemed to revolve around Power Phoning, Power  Packages and Power Lunches. Well, it might work in the good ol' USA, but we  do  things differently here.  Ever heard of agents? Sorry Miss Leikin!  If  you want a really good book on writing songs read 'The Song Writers Idea  Book' by Sheila Davis.  That will tell you just about everything you want  to know
