I've read many magazine articles on domino knitting, and have made pieces in the past. The small book clearly, in word and in diagrams, teaches how to use this technique. I finally understand *exactly* where to pick up stitches and I liked the way in which the projects referred back and forth to each other.

My low rating comes from the format of the book itself. The book is so small, and the cover is so stiff, it is very difficult to keep the book open to refer to while knitting. Also, entire sections of my book were misprinted--mostly blank pages, but then another section was printed slightly off center
