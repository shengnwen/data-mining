Enthousiastic customer reviews made my choice of this book a no-brainer. Working for a major international news agency as a financial correspondent, I looked for some fresh methods, angles and ideas to incorporate in my  interviews and market wrap-ups from the equity and corporate world. But  reading through this (highly-praised) feature-writing guide I was  disappointed to see that the material is very boring, outdated and  repetitive of the examples used. The book may give some guidance for  one-story-a-month, relaxed writers. But it looks out of touch with the  modern world of editors demanding fairly speedy 'spot coverage' of events,  where the newsbreaks and the accompanying stories are written on laptop  computers and sent by e-mail
