This book was horribly written.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the analogies used... describing the American consumer as Wal-Mart's whores... that was great. However, a lot of the author's claims were highly unsubstantiated.  As a Wal-Mart associate, I know that a lot of what he said is untrue. We are NOT allowed to work off the clock, and we are not victims of Wal-Mart's corporate greed. I really like my job, and while I don't approve of all Wal-Mart's policies, I certainly don't think they're as bad as they are portrayed in this book. I'm sure many of the stories ARE true. However, if the author spent half as much time spotlighting GOOD things Wal-Mart did, this book would be much more balanced.  I'm not impressed by his research, the book is lacking in fact, and is full of baloney. The research he did do could have been much better presented. The book was rambling, he repeated himself constantly, and it just felt like the book was slapped together last minute to be rushed out onto Target shelves..
