Uninteresting recipes, uninteresting writing. So uninteresting in fact that I skipped whole pages and sections and never found out if she even got around to explaining that the word taco means wadding or wedge, such as the wadding that used to be used to stuff cannons. Visual image, stuffing a taco "wad of food" into your mouth.

The praised Delfina's tacos, which are a guisado of ground beef, onion, sweet peas, salt pepper and comino stuffed into a softened with oil tortilla and bake until crisp,well, it's an interesting recipe that I haven't seen before but a lot of work for not very much of a pay-off in flavor.  

Reading the book reminded me of times when I would be stuck having to listen to someone ramble on about whatever, and not having a means to extricate myself from the situation.  Fortunately, in the case of the book, all I had to do was close it and shelve it
