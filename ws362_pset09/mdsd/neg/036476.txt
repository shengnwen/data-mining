I was reluctant to pick up this book because of it's title, but I decided to read it because I had it in my collection. I was somewhat entertained, and finished the book very quickly due to the short length. It is a tragedy in which almost all are killed in the end. I did not care much for the plot, which involves an incestuous relationship between brother and sister. After reading part of the book, it was rather easy to predict the ending. It is not a tremendously detailed and emotional story. I'm not sure if this is a title that would often come up in conversations between friends or colleagues, but avid readers might want to pick up the title to have read it
