Sadly, this book isn't very good.  I wish it were better, because I don't know of a book that discusses "canyoneering" that is good.  I think Rock Climbing by Craig Luebben and Mountaineering - The Freedom of the Hills, both by the same publisher, provide more information relevant to canyoneering than this book, even though they cover many other subjects in depth.  There was only one page of information that was new to me, the topics on this page: one-rope rappelling and retrieving webbing.  I wanted more but didn't get it from this book
