I expected a more out or a historian like Romila Thapar. The whole book looks like biased Indian culture bashing boring read.  The information sources and references seem like they have been picked specially for a pool of India hating English historians library.  The real essence of Indian culture which has bought into this world Vedas, Yoga and beautiful art forms seems to be completely missing.  Definitely not a read for a person getting introduced to Indian culture (Wrong Views), informationless for a knowledge seeker (Colorless Views)
