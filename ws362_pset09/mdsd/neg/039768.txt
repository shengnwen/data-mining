This is my first---and most likely last---Cook book (sorry, couldn't resist). I recall enjoying the movie Coma, so when I saw this title in a pile of freebies at the local laundromat, I grabbed it. Living in Essex County, MA, the Salem witch hysteria was the hook that kept me going. The premise was intriguing, but the actuality did not measure up. There wasn't all that much mystery---it was pretty easy to guess/predict what had/would happen. 

I found Cook's writing to be sub-standard, especially the dialog. He said. She said. He said. Nobody exclaimed, cried, yelled, whimpered, shrieked, moaned, responded, chortled, replied, simpered, laughed, cajoled, pleaded . . . they nearly always "said." How boring! Anywho, Cook also has an annoying habit of dropping $5 and $10 words in the middle of humdrum sentences, thereby jarring the reader out of his/her tedium. A medical lay person expects to stumble over the technical jargon, but not over simple dialog. I found this very distracting, cumbersome, and awkwardly done. It also seems that there's way too much telling and not enough showing in Cook's writing. That said, just like Dr. Maxwell from Salt Lake City, "I want my money back" . . . and I didn't even pay for it
