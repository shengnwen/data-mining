The authors' thesis is correct. Yes, the real estate market, the stock market, and the dollar are part of one big bubble, and America will have gum on its face when it pops.

But the book is a repetitive, unimaginative bore.  Points are repeated again and again, ad nauseum.  After a couple of chapters, I concluded that the authors, motivated perhaps by fast money, slapped this project together, stretching what could have been a one-page magazine piece into a book.  "America's Bubble Economy" is largely bereft of original ideas.  The statistics and charts are simple-minded, the writing uninspired.  Several times, exasperated, I threw the book down and went to sleep.  But, almost certain that their thesis (though hardly original) is correct, I plodded on and finished it, like someone forced to take his medicine.

The only bright spot is Eric Janszen's engaging chapter on gold.  Recognizing that gold's value will be as a hedge against inflation, Janszen, slyly placing the words in quotes, says that investors can "make money" on gold.  That is, until, at some distant time, gold itself becomes a bubble and pops.

And so the book earns a single gold star, rather than none
