I picked up Lisa Goldstein's _Walking the Labyrinth_ unsure of what to  expect.  But I was both surprised and disappointed.  The story is certainly  original with some delightful twists in the plot, but much of the story is  lacking in depth and style.  Many of the explanations concerning the  &quot;magick&quot; surrounding the characters were far too superficial or  even at times nonexistent. The ending was just too simple for what was at  times a complex plot.  Furthermore, I was completely indifferent toward the  protagonist.  Goldstein gives the reader very little to like about her.  In  short, I couldn't recommend this book
