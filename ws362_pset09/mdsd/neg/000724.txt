I imagine there are some useful and perhaps even good ideas here. But the entire text is so self-obsessed that it's hard to see beyond the "travelogue" conceit. Franzosi seems to believe that his story-telling makes the book accessible - but instead it simply makes it annoying. Can one meaningfully go from words to numbers? No doubt the answer is yes. But the techniques for doing so will be best served by a more concise elaboration written by someone with less interest in sharing his stories with what Franzosi seems to imagine as an adoring readership.
