When I first bought it for myself and skimmed the first few pages, I was very excited about the book and thought that it would be a worthwhile read.   As I kept reading, though, it became increasingly apparent that this guy was just trying to sell copies of his book, and didn't have much worthwhile information to say.  He constantly repeats that he is showing you how to "get rich" without providing any substantive advice.  He repeats lists that have little or no value, including things like "Work Hard" over and over again.  

From the outside in it seems great, but after going through it you will have learned very little from the book. All of the worthwhile information in the book could be sufficiently summarized in two paragraphs. I find it hard to believe that most of the other reviewers actually read the entire book.  Do yourself a favor and read the better books out there, like Clason's the "Richest Man In Babylon.
