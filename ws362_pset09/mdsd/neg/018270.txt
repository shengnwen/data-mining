Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.
