I love many of this author's books, especially Fairy Godmother, and the concept of Tradition. However, in this book she seems to use the Tradition as a crutch. The story is entirely predictable and formulaic, which most readers would find annoying, at the very least, in any other novel, but it seems that because she acknowledges that weakness, it's okay. The book is well written, but essentially boring. I felt very disappointed by this novel. If you really want to know what it's about, read the inside cover. That's pretty much all you need to know about this book
