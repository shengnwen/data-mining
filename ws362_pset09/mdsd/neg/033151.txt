Peggy helped see the revolution through.  What she didn't tell us it was a revolution of the rich versus the poor and middle class.  Peggy and Ronnie should feel great in the fact that &quot;the revolution&quot; makes it so we either don't have health care or have terrible health care, but still have to pay high premiums for service which should be available to everyone.  That &quot;the revolution&quot; put many people out on the street and &quot;the revolution&quot; led to uncalled numerous deaths worldwide to benefit the wealthy.  May they rot in hell
