Richard John Neuhaus says all the right things when it comes to telling Roman Catholic dissenters that they may as well be Episcopalians if they want women priestesses and all the other liberal moral teachings they seek. However he shows his own delusions by essentially urging Catholics to toe the line on everything the popes and the Councils have taught over the last thousand of the two thousand years of Christian history. Major dogmas such as the infallibility of the pope, the Immaculate Conception of Mary and the bodily assumption of Mary are soft-peddled despite the fact that the Roman church teaches they are all necessary for the faithful to believe if they are to be saved (necessary for salvation). Most telling is the fact that Neuhaus admits that, since the time he was a young Lutheran, he could not detect any real difference between the way he and the Catholic boys across the street believed. That is either a slight to Lutherans or a sign of their decline in the Gospel. Their leader, Martin Luther, believed that his salvation was assured by the person and work (on the cross) of Christ alone. These days, many Lutherans, like Catholics, believe that their salvation can be lost, despite the fact that Christ himself clearly promises the contrary (John 10:28-31). Really want the RC Church to be renewed R.J.? Tell it to return to the biblical Gospel: Christ alone assures the salvation of all those who believe in him and what he did for them, namely; secured their salvation by shedding his blood on the cross. "By the grace of God alone, through the gift of faith in Jesus alone" (Ephesians 2:8-9) that hasn't changed since you were a little Lutheran, Richard.
