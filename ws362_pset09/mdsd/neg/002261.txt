This book is an excellent example of how to take a wonderful story and turn it into something close to [junk.]  William Jordan is a decent writer with a fairly decent story.  However, Jordan manages to spend most of his time trying to convice us of his intelligence.  I don't know how many times he pointed out that he was a biologist.  Big deal.  At one point he brags about how his cold intellect allowed him to sacrifice the lives of animals all in the name of science.  He also feels the need to recount how, as a child, he tied a dog's leg to it's tail and the dog became paniced and ran (painfully) away.  I got as far as page 97 before finally giving up on this book.  Sorry Mr. Jordan, I just can't buy this garbage you are trying so hard to sell
