Maybe I hated this book because I am a native of Fredericksburg. And a dog lover. And a person who does not place strenuous demands on beach-bag fiction. But I was looking forward to a pleasant escapist romp, and instead found myself annoyed on almost every page. The writing is horrible. The plot, even by the most forgiving standards, tests your patience. (News flash: the CEO of a major corporation does not negotiate basic contracts, much less personally sign them. The lack of awareness or interest in getting right even the most basic facts about business life is a distraction. Why not make him a member of just the idle rich? Why Fredericksburg? Why not Middleburg?)

Ugh.

The whole book thing was clearly a necessary evil to sell a screenplay . . . but the day the camera crews show up on location in my town, I am grabbing my torch and pitchfork and storming City Hall
