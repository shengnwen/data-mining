I read this while sick with a cold, but it seems like there was really no plot to this. I can't blame it all on the cold medicine I took.  All I remember was two rather flat characters meeting in a tower, each expecting another person to arrive instead. This causes a scandal, they are forced to marry, and then they move into his home in London. Not much happened after that. Then, all of a sudden, they seem to know who misled them into meeting in the tower, and the man is identified in the story.  I know I had a head cold while reading this, but I feel like the story escaped me. I know the girl's name was Jocelyn, but I remember nothing about her, and the guy was Devon, a Boscastle.  Everything else escaped me. Was it the book? Was it my cold? was it trying to read the book while sick with a cold?  I have never felt less involved in a romance novel while I was reading it.
