This book is just plain hateful, mean and nasty. The humor is of South Park IQ level. If you laugh at talking poop, you will probably think this is funny. 
I'm keeping the book because I enjoy the pictures (that is, the ones that are reasonably well reproduced). Were the 70's tacky? Yes. Were they fun? YES.
Lighten up Lileks. It's ok to have fun. What is your decor? Victorian? Now that's laughable!
