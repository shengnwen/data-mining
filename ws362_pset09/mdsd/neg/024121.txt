I am a classical fencing student and a fan of the works of Alexandre Dumas. I was really excited when I found out that he had written this book. Unfortunately, the story has nothing to do with fencing and everything to do with Russian history and architecture. The protagonist happens to be a fencing master, but that's all. If you're actually looking to read a novel about a fencing master, I would suggest Master at Arms by Rafael Sabatini
