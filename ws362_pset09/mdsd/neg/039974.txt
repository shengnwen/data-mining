I used to be afraid of dwarves.  But thanks to L. Ron Hubbard, I am now only afraid of things that come out of my butt.  While this fear has grown more intense, I have a strange urge to buy all of Tom Cruise's movies on DVD including "Legend" in order that I might play them backwards to reveal a secret message.  The message being L. Ron Hubbard's address, so I will know where to mail my check.  Speaking of which, I think BattleField Earth with John Travolta got a bum rap.  It was slightly more painful than placing one's testicle in a garlic press and squeezing.  So just ask homeschoolmum, L. Ron Hubbard is in fact our savior.  On Easter we celebrate his birth and best works of fiction like Dianetics.  On Christmas, we spend lots of money on his products and give them to fellow pagans.  It's not like any of us would dare give "Blue Lagoon" on DVD to another scientologist.  So do you think Brooke Shields turned Tom Cruise down?
