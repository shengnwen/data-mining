When I order this book, I thought I will get lots of ready-to-use "Goals" which I can esay to set my subordinate's Goals. But I am very disappoint. Lots of Goals listing in the books are actually the working items not goals. Like "Deposit completed backups...", "Schedule all planned shutdown...". Therefore this book help me to setup the work items of my subordinate not set the goals.
