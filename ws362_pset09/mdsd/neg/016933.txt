Improbable people in implausible situations driven by too-convenient motivations.  A thin veneer about anthropology, development, political philosophy, and Africa that drags the story along but does little to enlighten.  Obviously written with a well-thumbed thesaurus at hand, the author's vocabulary use is more tortured than inspiring.  (Or, as Mark Twain put it, "it grates on the fastidious ear.")  A decent plot, but a snoozer in its execution.  The characters are drawn with multi-layered histories that are informational but exact no empathy.
