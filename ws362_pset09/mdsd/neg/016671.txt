This book is a utopian, unrealistic, poorly thought-out, infantile piece of trash. It's an insult to the intelligence of any adult who reads it. Written at a third grade level with 16-point type, this book's contents would be better suited to a coloring book. The philosophy it presents a real no-brainer, and if you need to read this to learn these principles, you have bigger problems to worry about. The "story" is just that, a "story" - there isn't an ounce of truth or realism to it, so just file this book under "office fairy tales". Believe it or not, I'm not a pessimist, I love books, and I'm totally into "self/professional improvement" topics. But do not waste your time or money on this silly book
