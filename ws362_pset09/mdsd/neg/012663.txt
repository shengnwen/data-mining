It's hard not to like Doreen Virtue and all she talks about. She talks of many uplifting things. But then she downplays the role of Christ in the world. He is put at the status level of Ghandi and Buddha! Christians understand that this is a great falsehood. 

So even though some good comes of following Doreen, her Source is not Christian angels and Christ. If you keep reading her stuff you'll be getting help from fairies, unicorns and angels instead of God himself. You decide if that's who you want to set your faith in.

As I said I like the woman and enjoyed her books I read, but after much soul searching I realized I was subtlely being brainwashed into putting my faith in the wrong things. So I must give the book one star because it's the only option available
