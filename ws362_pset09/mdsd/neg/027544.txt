Yes, the story is pretty unbelievable, very much in the same class of the works of Fleming, Cussler, etc.  However, it is not the story or the character development that makes this a below average read.......the author really needs to change editors.  This book could be improved immeasurably by a better job of good editing.  Way too wordy, too many extra pages, scenes, action, etc, that do not add anything of value to the overall story and do much to impede the flow.  Did the author get paid by the word? Get a bonus for going over 300 pages?  Editing, editing, editing.
