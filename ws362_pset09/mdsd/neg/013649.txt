Despite the beautiful poetic descriptions of nature which are peppered throughout his books, James Lee Burke falls short as a mystery writer. An author shouldn't concentrate more on describing the environment than developing the plot, which is exactly what he does. And after you've read a number of his novels about the jaded ex-cop Dave Robicheaux, you start to realize that they all follow a very strict, formulaic pattern, so formulaic that I think I can summarize the generic plot of every one of Burke's novels. They all go pretty much as follows:

First, Dave Robicheaux unwittingly becomes involved in some sordid affairs, so he decides to start poking his nose around. He is threatened by criminals to stay out of their affairs, but instead of complying he beats them up and continues investigating. Despite the warnings, he is utterly shocked when the villains retaliate by harming someone close to him. The case having become more personal, Robicheaux begins running from place to place, making obtuse accusations and threats to various people until he earns the animosity of almost every character in the book. He eventually stumbles upon the solution to the mystery, and he never manages to punish those responsible because his hands are tied legally. Ultimately, it turns out that things would have worked out better for everyone had he simply not stuck his nose where it didn't belong, and there is nothing quite as disappointing as finishing a book and finding out that nothing worthwhile was accomplished by the protagonist.

Aside from this, Robicheaux becomes tiresome quickly. Though he is a decent enough guy, it is very difficult to have sympathy for a man who brings all his troubles on himself with his stupidity and unwillingness to stop poking his nose into other people's affairs.

If you feel that you absolutely have to read one of these books, my advice is to pick one at random, read it, and then don't read any of the others. Believe me, they are all the same.
