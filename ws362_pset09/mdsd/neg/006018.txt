Trying to break the cycle of reading a book until the bitter end whether I like it or not (and if I like it, there most certainly is not a 'bitter' end), I gave up on this one literally halfway through.  Part of me wanted to finish it because I had gotten so far into it, but I gave up and said 'enough.'  This book has so many elements repeating from many other Koontz books, thus it felt like a retread.  I did not care if the protagonist won the battle over his doppleganger.  I wasn't impressed by his perfect, adorable wife and children, or his career as an author of horror fiction.  And the afterword by the author seemed smug.  I'm sorry I read so much of it before I stopped, but better late than never
