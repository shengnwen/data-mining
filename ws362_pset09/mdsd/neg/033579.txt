As a fan of historical mysteries, I was looking forward to starting this popular series.  I was deeply disappointed.  First of all, the character of Amelia Peabody is not appealing, and through her the author reveals that she has only a very superficial understanding of Victorian values and thinking.  (Although if you don't mind an author sticking a character with modern sensibilities in period dress, maybe this is for you.)  Furthermore, the mystery was simply not that interesting.  I found myself reading only to finish the book, for I had little interest in finding out who committed the murders. The success of this series and the acclaim the author has received truly baffle me
