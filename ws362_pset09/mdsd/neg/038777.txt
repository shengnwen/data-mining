Despite all the gushing reviews about this book, a lot of it was just plain old common sense. As a mother to an almost 3 year old toddler (who, by the way was toilet training at 19 months and finished by 21 months without coercion), I found the book somewhat tedious. This book is a compendium for newbies but not for those who are more experienced and looking for "new" or additional information.

The section on toilet-training full of inaccurate old wives tales (from the 1970's when disposable diapers came into vogue). Too bad we DON'T take a cue from the 1960's and get our children OUT of diapers ASAP so that the landfills don't overrun with disposable diapers. It was offensive to those of us who don't wait until our child is 3.5 years old to toilet train them.  Her assertion that toddlers aren't ready for toilet training until they can control the anal sphincter muscles is untrue. Children CAN be trained by 1 - 2 years old, or those Europeans, Africans and Asians are doing something wrong!

She focuses too much on "fun and games" as if the toddler was not capable and interested in learning things like alphabets and counting (she makes it seem like if you do these things, you are an overbearing, overly ambitious and overly anxious mother). Do children HAVE to be entertained everywhere they go? 

There are better books out there. This is not one I would buy. I would recommend Infant Potty Training : A Gentle and Primeval Method Adapted to Modern Living by Laurie Boucke for a better approach to toilet training. I would also not recommend waiting until your child was 3.5 either.

BTW, I don't have to entertain my child. She does just fine on her own and is able to amuse herself everywhere she goes without lots of paraphernalia. I allow her natural curiousity to engage with what's out there
