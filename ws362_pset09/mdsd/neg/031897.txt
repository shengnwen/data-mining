Janet Taylor Lisle hooks you in with a story that evokes the best of popular fantasy with some Pippi Longstocking thrown in.  Then she sucker punches you with a depressing dose of misfortune devoid of fantasy and stripped down to a cold, sad version of reality that shocks and confounds.  The denouement involves mental illness, neglect and orphaning.  For more on this kind of approach to youth literature, check out "Welcome to Lizard Motel" by Barbara Feinberg
