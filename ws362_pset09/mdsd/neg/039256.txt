The book lacks good examples of what it is trying to say.  This book is required for a project management class I am taking.  It is mostly theoretical.  It tells what type of documents should be included at which points of a project but does not provide examples that make it clear as to what these document might look like.  Having examples from a variety of industries would make it more valuable. Reminds me of the PMO organization at work. They like to produce a lot of documents that really don't do anything to help get a project done.  If you are looking for a good book on how to do project management, this one is not it
