I had much anticipation of Butler's _Precarious Lives_ considering her position as one of the foremost cultural and literary theorists.  However, I was highly disappointed that the arguments she makes in the text are no greater than those of most academics, including those of grad students.  I'd wait for the paperback edition and buy it used as it is somewhat useful for citations.  Other than that, the argument is really over-stated these days and seems like much less than what one could or &quot;should&quot; expect from Butler
