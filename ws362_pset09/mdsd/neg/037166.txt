We meet Josie Flynn a soon to be divorcee, who is just starting to get over her divorce from Damien. For her winter vacation from work she is headed to New York for her cousin Martha's wedding. While on the plane, she is seated next to the charming and handsome Matt, the rock journalist, who is also recently divorced. They share their horror stories, and seem to becoming friends. Once they land in NY they decided to meet for an afternoon at the Statue of Liberty. After this point the book serisoulsy goes down hill. We are then treated to a cat and mouse game while Matt is looking for Josie. Throw into the mix an unbelievably lavish wedding, an affair (or 2 depending how you look at it), an ex husband who comes toting an expensive gift to win back Josie's affection, and a duck and it make a very unbelievable book.
