This book started really strong and started dying about half way through.  The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable.  About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused.  At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking "What?" Started strong, ended badly.  Too bad too, I really liked Booger
