Ethelberta is not a book I would recommend to most people, and certainly  not to someone who has never read Hardy.  The novel is tediously written  and lacks the depth pervasive in other works set in the country.  Only in  the last hundred or so pages did the story become engrossing.  Why then did  I continue reading? Deriving some measure of enjoyment from this book  requires that the reader look at it as an example of Hardy's development as  an author.  The scholarly introduction and notes provide explanations that  help with this analysis and make the novel more interesting
