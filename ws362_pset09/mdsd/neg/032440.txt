Here's a brief synopsis of this "novel":
1) Captain Mack Mackey (Imaginative name isn't it) is assigned the most advanced submarine ever made for the US Navy.
2) US and China go to war, and Mack is thrown into action.
3) Mack spots a chinese submarine. he fires a torpedo. he sinks it.
4) Mack spots 2 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them.
5) Mack spots 3 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them.
6) Mack spots 5 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them.
7) Mack spots 1,000,000,000 chinese submarines. he fires torpedos. he sinks them.......

Throughout this novel, the SSN submarine never faces a single challenge or sustains any major damage. one submarine takes out pretty much the entire chinese submarine fleet. At least this novel has realism going for it
