Teresa Norman's A World of Baby Names is an interesting collection of names from around the world.  However, the book suffers mightily from poor editing. There is poor coordination between sections, as though whoever read the entries from one country never cross-referenced other sections.  Within countries, there are frequent errors in how names are pronounced.  For example, &quot;sz&quot; in Hungarian is pronounced /s/.  In some names this is transliterated correctly, but in other names, incorrect pronunciations are given.  The Hawaiian section needs a total overhaul.  Many, many names are given with some other version as the preferred one with the correct Hawaiian name given as an alternate form.  In the book as a whole, some etymology is very good, but some is rather slipshod and, once again, inconsistent from entry to entry regarding the same root name. It gives the appearance to the book that the writer is poorly informed about her subject and relied on poor sources, with insufficient research into the accuracy of these sources.  The author would have done better to rely on speakers of the languages of the various countries as her editors and primary sources, rather than the books in her extensive bibliography.  For anyone seriously interested in the origins and pronunciations of names around the world, this book is of questionable value
