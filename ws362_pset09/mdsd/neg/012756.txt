Slavery in our country's history was grievously wrong, wrong, wrong...but this book was dry, dry, dry.  It left out very basic details and was bogged down in the author's repetitive, plodding musings.  My mind would drift trying to get through one paragraph (and the paragraphs are quite wordy.) I wanted to soak up this book and its information.  Unfortunately, it was just too dull and overwrought, and I came away knowing merely a bit more about the New Orleans slave market than I did going in
