My God, I was forced to read this book for a construction management class at a four-year university in the United States and struggled through every minute.  I don't know what was more frustrating, having to read this dull-minded and repetative junk or reading four words at a time because for whatever reason the prestigious author, Christopher Day, was forced to go against conventional thinking and put two columns on each page.  This was hands down the worst book I have ever read throughout my life.  The guy is hypocritical of everyone who lives in an ordinary house and works in an ordinary job in an ordinary office building.  Sorry Mr. Day, but most of us don't have the time and monetary security to write a 200-page book regarding soulful places.  We just trudge off to work everyday in our non-biologically inducing office buildings.  A bunch of junk
