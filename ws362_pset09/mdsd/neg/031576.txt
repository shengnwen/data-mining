Zacharias plays the puppet-master, manipulating his Buddha and Jesus characters to reach his own predetermined conclusion. He is neither fair nor honest in his depiction of the imaginery dialogues, misrepresenting Buddhism and giving a merely conventional depiction of Christianity that omits any hint from contemporary scholarship about the questionable authorship and authenticity of many biblical passages. Buddhists who read this book will not recognize the Buddha they know, while Christians will be deceived. Zacharias should do long penance for writing this tendentious piece of propaganda
