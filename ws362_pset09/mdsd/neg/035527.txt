Mr Wong is making a good living selling his book and working the lecture circut.  Some good ideas but a lot of impractical stuff included.  The reality of the classroom and the ineffectiveness of school administration make working under such ideal circumstances unrealistic.  Work in 5 classes of 40-50 kids each day who can't read (many are moved up so they can be with their friends) and such touchy feely programs quickly fall aside.
