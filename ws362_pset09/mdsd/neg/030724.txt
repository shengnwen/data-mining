I am very dissapointed with the poor spiral binding on this book, (4th edition)! As a dietetic student, I don't have much money to spend on books as it is. As much as this one is priced, the publishers could have put a higher quality binding on it, (or made it a paperback, like previous editions). Pages are falling out constantly, especially since it the type of book you refer to all the time
