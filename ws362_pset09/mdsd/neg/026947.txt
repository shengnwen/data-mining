This story bored the dickens out of me.  The writing dragged on and on about subjects which were uninteresting and depressing.  I agree wholeheartedly with R. Farmer.  I am not a Pollyanna who only needs sunshine and smiley faces, but this was ridiculous.  The characters were stuck in boring places with no desire to make things better for themselves.  Talk but no action
