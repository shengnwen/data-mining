This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed
