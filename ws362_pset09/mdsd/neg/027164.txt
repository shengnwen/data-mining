If you have read my past reviews you know I think it is pretty worthless to actually talk about the story, but to actually talk about the enjoyment factor of reading fiction.  I mean you don't read fiction as a means of actually furthering your education or anything.  You read it because it is fun and enjoyable.  You lose yourself it the book as a 3rd party observer and go for a literary ride for a while.  Well this ride was fun for about 3/4 of the book.  After that if feels like your are on a descent roller coaster of fiction going along with the story and then 3/4 of the way through the book Stuart Woods kind of hops the track and takes you on a path that has absolutely nothing to do with the previous 250 pages.  I actually liked the beginning and middle and should have stopped there and then made up my own ending and I would have given it 3 stars.  Don't waste your time or money on this one...or do if you want to chuckle at what a silly ending the books has.  I really can't say enough at how it seems Stuart Woods just really got tired of writing this book and then just farmed out the ending to someone that hadn't actually read the first 3/4 of the book
