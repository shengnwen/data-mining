I read this and thought, "Wow, this is more like a romance novel than a fantasy."  I also found the characters and situations quite two-dimensional and shallow.

I thought "Luna Publishing"?  Never heard of it.  It seems to be a division of Harlequin.  Enough said.

I can't imagine any guy enjoying this.  Good for a quick beach read.
