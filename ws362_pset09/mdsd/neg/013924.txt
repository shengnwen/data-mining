I am building my own house and find myself frequently referring to this book. There is much useful information; I only wish it were more up-to-date. It was published 12 years ago, but much of the info was out dated even then. And plumbing isn't exactly a rapidly changing field. The sad thing is that there aren't really any books out there that are much better.
There is some info that is just plain wrong. I followed the book's instruction to use 45's to keep my sewer line from sloping more than 1/2" per foot, at great effort and expense... turns out it is not required, just an old plumber's legend. Be careful about following any of the advice in this book.
Does anyone still use cast iron or copper dwv pipe? The book specifies a Kelly fitting for cleanouts. Is there any code which still allows that? Can you even buy a Kelly fitting? Most houses in the faster growing parts of the country are slab-on-grade and have been for years, but this book only devotes a few pages to this "new" concept. If you buy this book you need to be aware that much about plumbing is regional and code specific, and much of this book was out of date before it was published. It can still be a good source of info if you keep that in mind.
