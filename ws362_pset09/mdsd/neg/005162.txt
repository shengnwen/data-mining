The inaccuracies which plague this book are many.  The author has allowed a vitriolic personal bias against Christianity to take the place of historical accuracy.  In addition to the stunning inaccuracies, the venomous, contemptuous tone of every reference to the Christian faith is problematic.  In this day of tolerance, it is surprising that anyone would allow their personal prejudices to be so visible and so hateful, especially in a book for children!  In a book which is supposedly based upon history, it is surprising that anyone would print out-and-out lies such as are found in this book.  Why did I give it two stars?  Because the text, when it is not too busy attacking the author's imaginary archenemy, is refreshing and useful.  It is humorous, winsomely written, and fun.  The illustrations are great, too.  It's sad that the author's personal biases have marred this otherwise fine work
