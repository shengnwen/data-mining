I'm disappointed with this book for several reasons, first off, you'll notice the tiny tiny print, it is very hard and frustrating to read a lot of this book for a bit of time, second, many many records are missing,also quite a few groups and artists are missing,3rdly it seems quite hastily organized, and can be quite confusing, 4thly there seems to be more emphasis on the labels and the manufacturer than the songs themselves.I realize that there are and were millions of records and songs etc,but there is a significant bunch of major hits and minor ones missing in this guide.Some of the flip side of the big hits is what is given as the value, and not the hit side, I know, because I have a lot of records from years past, as I said , there has to be better guides out there, and of course they probably do cost more.I do not dispute the values given for the records listed, because, as everybody knows, value is a relative term depending on the part of the country, the music that one likes, how much one is willing to pay for something etc
