The wedding kit book constantly refers to chapters you should reread in the weddings for dummies book, so if you do not own BOTH books, it's useless. The wedding planner on the cdrom is only a demo version, and only allows you to add ten guests, and expires after a few weeks. I did however find some of the standard planning forms very useful, but you could find all and more of the info included in this book online if you really wanted to save yourself the money
