The first few times I made things from this book, they seemed off.  But Jamie is such the grab and go and not really measuring cook.  So I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  Then I tried one of his bread recipes... the Banana and Honey Bread (p.245) and using the basic bread recipe (p. 236).  Starting with the banana recipe, he says to puree 6 bananas and add water to equal two cups.  6 bananas pureed came out to way more than two cups... then I didnt know what to do about the water.  In the basic bread recipe, there it calls for 2 TABLESPOONS of level salt and 2 TABLESPOONS of level sugar.  The sugar I could understand, but I had to read the salt one over and over again.  I dont even use 2TBS of salt for a roasted chicken and I like salty foods.  Then the banana recipe did not call for the removal of the salt from the original recipe.  Needless to say, the bread did not turn out well was quite salty, among other things.  In retrospect, I think this book has suffered from the conversion from the British system of metrics to the American measurements.  I was really disappointed in how much energy and time and enjoyment I had poured into this book and Jamie Oliver, when someone did not care enough to proof the book and ensure that recipes were accurate and usable. I was so disappointed that despite the small fortune I used to collect the books, I decided to give them away with the belief that you should use the book for inspiration, and for recipes that do not call for exact measurements, otherwise, this is not really a cookbook but a selling of a celebrity or personality.  I was truly disappointed.
