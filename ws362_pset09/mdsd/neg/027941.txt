When I read stuff on the back of this novel like, "preposterously brilliant", "a classic comic novel", and "Amis was a genuine comic writer, perhaps the best", I immediately snatched this book up and started rummaging through the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters with heightened interest. The book was interesting enough for me to buy it from Borders bookstore 30 minutes after reading a bit. Even though I didn't laugh, I believed I just had to read it from beginning to end. So I took this book home expecting something hilarious; the result: a genuine cure for insomnia. I don't care for all these praises of "masterpiece" or "this book explores the complexities of human condition and human relations". I want an interesting read; I'm not calling for an action-packed Ian Fleming, James Bond novel, I'm asking for something engrossing. I didn't get what I asked for.

The visually descriptive details in this novel are thoroughly lacking. Amis doesn't bother to write about the setting, the atmosphere, the people (except for Bertrand, Christine, and Margaret to some degree); as a result I have no idea what Welch, Dixon, Beesley, etc. look like. They all could be wearing bedsheets all the time for all I know. 

All in all, this novel is not recommended: it lacks physical detail and humor. 

P.S. If you search all the previous good recommendations you'll see the high reviews were simply given by "a reader"; probably the same dude
