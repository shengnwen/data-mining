I was so looking forward to this book, after I read James and George's book, but what a major let down this book was. First of all they kept expressing in the book the age difference between Amy and Warren which I was trying to over look but couldn't. Secondly Amy was pretty much what we would called in todays society a stalker. Third the hero and his attitude was over the top. The only saving grace for this book was the appearance of the other Malorys James, George and Tony.
