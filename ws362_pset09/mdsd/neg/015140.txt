The characters and events are just too improbable.  "The twin who was supposed to be dead but is discovered alive after 30 years" is a premise that could have been made into a good story in the hands of a better writer.  This book starts out OK, then the reader gets sucked into the thrill-a-minute B-movie chain of events.  He keeps going, hoping it will get more real, but instead it gets more outlandish.
