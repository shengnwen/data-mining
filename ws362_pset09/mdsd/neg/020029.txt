I enjoyed the first half of this book very much, but by the time I got to the end 100 pages I was very very bored.  It dragged on to me once he grew up and became what he did, the ending didnt suit me  because I felt like I needded more.

  Plus I felt it had this strong side towards all african american's being this poor race, with poor chances (the father, his girlfriend,Monique,the thug street boys, on and on and on)  and then the white folk all being depicted as these white tennis playing rich folk with everything going for them.   It had a very sterotypical sort of edge to it, all the way down to the nanny from korea

The "brothers' was a nice tie and how it didnt matter who was what, they were brothers.  Other then that I felt this troublesome matter on what black and white see each other as, when we should be what the brothers see each other as.

One family, one people, nothing less

I feel like I missed a lot, ans also like thomas couldnt really fit in one or the other he was just kinda this special being who got caught up in the wrong thing, and with bad luck
