I was impressed and enjoyed Wiccan Mysteries (would give it a 5 out of 5 for what it is worth) by this very author and so I purchased this book and I thought it would be as well thought out.  Instead as I read it I found most of it was watered down basics of the foundation of &quot;wiccan magick&quot; and I would suggest many other books for a beginner before this one; which was written with out the background information. Overall I found that it didn't say anything particularly refreshing, ingenuitive or really thought provoking to keep me interested.  One of my disagreements with this book was a chapter on stones/crystals that was very inadequate.  If you like to read books that sound more like folklore then magick or a path to spirituality rather then a little stroll in the lifeless park of religion then you might just Like this book a great deal
