I guess I only finished it becuase I always finish a book I start reading (especially if I paid for it). 
It was so hard to read, the style is tiring, resembling a ranting inner dialogue more than a book on an economic category, even iof it is from a cultural and anthropological perspective! 
At the end of the day I can say I know what Aztecs used for money (and how they tortured children to death as children's tears were considered some sort of "rain magic". damn, I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW THAT!!!) and that coins were invented by Lydians (and a number of simiral pieces of information) but I also have a HEADACHE and am feeling frustrated and nauseated and extremely unhappy. 
I don't think that is how you are supposed to feel after reading a book on history of money! I don't feel informed or enlightened at all.
Having read other people's reviews I guess accuracy of information presented (unless it refers to social or cultural aspects of money) might also be problematic?!
