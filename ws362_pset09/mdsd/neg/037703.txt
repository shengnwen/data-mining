My god who knew cooking could be so harmful and disaterous. I admittedly generally have my servents cook for me but I thought I might surprise my good friend Lord Wosley by making a Yak soup. Sadly there was no recipe for Yak so I settled on a carrot soup. My god it went wrong...Nine hours later my soup was actually weapons grade plutonium and my kitchen had to be completely refurbished. I have had to move into my summer house a month early. What a pain. Naturally, I am now in a class action lawsuit against Mary Lane Kamberg for repairs on my kitchen and mental anguish.If I have saved one person from buying this book I have kept the world safe another day. However if anyone knows an interested party in weapons grade plutonium, please let me know.
