This book has a little bit of useful information for anyone above the beginner level. Very little. The book can be repetitive and the bizarre pictures just distract from the content. And the author is not even a graphic designer! I would think that would be a requirement to write a book of this kind. The author is simply not very qualified to write a book on web design
