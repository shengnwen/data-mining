I have always enjoyed the light humor and spontaneous comments that McCord brings to television commentary.  However, this is a boring, and disappointing book. Gary would do well to have someone else edit his transcripts for literary flow.  The choppy sentences and introduction of too many characters in each chapter, makes the book difficult to read.  I got through the first two chapters then tossed it back on the shelf to collect all the dust it deserves
