Anytime the Christian Right has a chance to undermine women,it will take that chance and run with it.Please read "The Myth Of Gender" by Fausto- Sterling.Your eyes will be open to new possiblities for your life and family.The whole point of Dobson's book is to controll people so they fall into a limited mindset - male or female,with no room for the individual.The individual is reality not this sexist nonsense.I have always found it more easy to be out in the world and explore.Dobson makes women sound like natural cowards and fools.Very insulting
