This was the first Ludlum book I have read.  I bought several and now am thinking I've wasted my money.  He took a realistic story and destroyed it with an unbelievable plot.  All the bad guys, who have so much power that they can have anyone in the world killed within 24 hours of the victim hearing about the Secret Plot to control the World cannot even protect their top masterminds from being kidnapped by a New York lawyer, his consultant ex-wife, and a couple of low-level military officers.  Then, each bad guy willingly spills everything about the Secret Plot merely upon learning that one of his colleagues has insulted him?  Give me a break.  Don't even get me started on how unrealistic the relationship is b/w the main character and his ex-wife.  Give the book as a gift to your 12 year old nieces and nephews, but don't waste your time or money on this if you are over 12 years old
