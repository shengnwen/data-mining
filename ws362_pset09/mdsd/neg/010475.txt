I almost wonder if I have the same book as the other reviewers.  I found this book very difficult to use. The chapters go on and on with theory and philosophy, but very little in the way of simple to follow exercises.  Also, the book assumes you are already familiar with Yoga and are comfortable doing long stretching exercises before you begin.

I became interested in breathing excercises from Andrew Weil's tapes that accompany the "8 weeks" book.  I was hoping for more exercises and perhaps even a couple of complete sets of exercises to go with what I had heard on the tapes.  I envisioned doing excercises at the office in the morning or at home before bed to improve health and reduce stress.  I did not need or want (yet) an exegesis of the theory of breath and health; nor was I looking for techniques that require special clothing, mats and pillows, and 10 minutes of set up.  

If you want the full dose of theory, spirituality, new age physiology, etc., this is the book for you (and probably a very good one at that).  But if you are looking for a simple breathing book to introduce you to breath work, this is probably not the book for you
