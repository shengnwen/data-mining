I am glad that someone finally pointed out that this book has an original publication date in the early 1920s. This is not a good history book - historical analysis has moved on considerably since this was written. The book is more fiction and opinion than anything else. Early Irish myths, for example are taken as historical fact and  his work on later Ireland, especially the eighteenth century, shows a total lack of knowledge of what was actually going on. Original source material is not something that the author apparently understood. If you are looking for a valid history of Ireland go somewhere else
