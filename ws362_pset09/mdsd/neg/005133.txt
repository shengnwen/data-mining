If you are looking for an encyclopedia of all things pre-calculus, then this is your book. Just don't expect it to teach you much if you don't already know the material. There are plenty of practice problems, but the actual "teaching" sections don't really help the average student like me. Some of this is offset by the DVD's included in the course pack, but not enough so to justify the $200.00 the book and course pack cost at the university bookstore. You would probably best be served by using a different book like Precalculus for Dummies or the Complete Idiots Guide to Precalculus.
