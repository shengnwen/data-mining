Norman Friedman deserves credit for the way in which he manages to explain the concepts of 20th century physics so well. Unfortunately, his interpretation of quantum physics is rather conservative. The result is  that he attempts to prop all of reality into a framework that is just too  narrow and limited. It is not the definitive book on the relationship  between modern physics and spirituality, but it's a good start
