This book appears to be the &quot; book&quot; from &quot;MUSIC MAN  from the way it is listed.  It is not however.  It consists of songs from the show with melody line only printed in extra large notes. Each note contains  the name of the pitch writen inside.  It is only marginally useful as a  teaching tool for children and is defintely not what it appears to be in  the Amazone Catalogue!
