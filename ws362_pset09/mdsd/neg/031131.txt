Hmmmm. "Conservatives" continue to applaud this sort of rhetoric as "facts." I continue to get e-mail from those who resent my characterization of Ann Coulter as a psychopath ("if she really believes the stuff she says, she's not taking her meds") as if Coulter is a logician, not a hyperemotional media figure with a "JD" after her name.

Well, this isn't quite as volatile as Coulter, but it's no more "fact" oriented. And it isn't "conservative" but reactionary statist. 

Why is it that, while the "right" seems to be powerful now, I see their days as numbered? I think it's because they take this stuff seriously. They'll become a product of nostalgia soon just like some from the '60s who're now making car payments, retiring, and living in Florida.
