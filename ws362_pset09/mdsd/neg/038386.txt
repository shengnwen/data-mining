Unfortunately, this "book" is not a very enlightening read !!.  Fortunately, I didn't buy the book, it was checked out of our university library.  I found it difficult finishing this drivel.   On too many occasions Torgovnick states her unsound opinion as absolute fact. She proceeds to mistakenly develop her point of view on the basis of that egregious erroneous opinion . (Big error there!!)  Her conclusions usually are drawn on nefarious and/or abnormal rational that border on the absurd.  Very close to being out of touch with reality!!    All in all, it appears the dictum "publish or parish" got the upper hand for this professor
