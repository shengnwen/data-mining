Not one of David Morrell's better work.  The ever tiring theme of a helpless, beaten, beautiful model whose goal in life is as shallow as a dish is rescued by a former special forces man who's physical ability has made him a legend among his former military comrades, but also an artist.  The story was predicatable, and annoying.  To make it worse, the narrator, Gabrielle completely took away any small points of entertainment through her monotonous whispery voice, and POOR accents and character variations
