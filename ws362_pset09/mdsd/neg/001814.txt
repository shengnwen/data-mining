Pretty weak overall. The middle 100 pages or so could have been left out, they seem to be mostly filler that doesn't advance the story much. Also the ending is quite predictable. Not in detail but what will happen in general.

Also Mr.Robinson should not have used RAH's name to preach his own political views. Esp considering that RAH would probably have disagreed with him.

If you want to read something that reminds you of RAH, read Red Thunder from Varley for example
