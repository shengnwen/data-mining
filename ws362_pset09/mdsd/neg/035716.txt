This "book" is 30 pages of general information about Hashimoto's, and a couple of vague pages on diet, all of which is easily available on the web.
The poor writing, lack of content, and the 80 pages of worksheets in the back of the "book" were disappointing.
This information should be published as a pamphlet, not a book. Don't waste your money here, just Google "hashimotos.
