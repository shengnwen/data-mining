Strange to say, I did not like this novel nearly as much as her earlier work.  I usually find her narrative voice and her attention to detail charming and engaging, but here it bogged down and just became tedious.  There are no fully-drawn characters, only types, including the heroine (or should I say "hairoyne" -- from a motif in the novel) herself.  And, while I found the dilemmas of her earlier characters regarding marriage and identity quite moving, especially in "Another Marvelous Thing" and "Family Happiness," I found Geraldine's crises to border on the selfish and self-absorbed.  Who knows what might have followed this swan song?  For all of that, I do love Colwin, and I still cook from her cookbooks
