"Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain" by Pete Egoscue is a timeconsuming book to read, because of it's extremely boring and messy layout. As most american books, the information is carefully hidden behind far too many unnecessary words. That's ok, scrolling throug content is easy. But, since this is a book that covers a number of different health problems, you obviously do want to start reading the most relevant parts. That seems easy at first sight, since there is a content list. But even if the advices seems to make sense, you fall asleep before reaching any conclusions
