I was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing (in an &quot;advice o'the day&quot; format) of tidbits of wisdom. The wisdom offered is good, mind you, but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you (eg on a long car ride) you will likely be disappointed. I can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before I lose interest
