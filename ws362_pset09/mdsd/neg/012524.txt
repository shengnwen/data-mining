   I tried this book and it was great until i started downloading files, I kept getting error codes. I'm thinking I did not have a file that i needed. I also read the chapter about playing dvd movies and online video not very helpful.every time you download something that some one mentions either on the web or in a not very well written book like this, there is either another file that you need or a conflict that has to be fixed
