This is an early work by a transsexual person but I did not enjoy it. Ms. Morris of course knows how to use the English language in an elegant manner but the book still failed for me. She treats women as nothing more than a shadow of men. Her book thinks it is perfectly acceptable for women to be sexually harrassed by men. She accepts sex role stereotypes pertaining to men and women. This book would not be  helpful to modern day transgendered youth.
