Extremely well-researched, and virtually unreadable.  This book is a never ending stream of figures on steel tonnages and plant openings/closings.

The author provides little in the way of explanation of the vast amount of industry jargon in the book (If you already know what is different and interesting about Continuous Casting, Finishing Capacity, Open Hearth vs. other blast furnace types, etc. this probably won't bother you).

There are some interesting story lines relating to the personalities, changes in American society, and the arc of the corporation as an entity over 100 years, but they are lost in the endless forest of statistics and the repetitive theme that the corporation was too big for its own good.
