As a beginner trying to identify plants without any background, this book is practically unusable to me.  Plants are arranged according to plant family.  The index only lists plants by the Latin names, not common.  I am supposed to use this book to identify plants on herb walkds but it is impossible to do so without knowing the families they belong to.  To use this book you must have prior knowledge of plant identification.  For the beginner like myself you cannot just walk in the woods with this book and identify a plant.  But once you find a plant in the book, the pictures are not bad; there are photographs and drawn pictures.  In the beginning of each plant family there is a page of discriptions (of the family) that is helpful.  Now once you can identify plants using this book, I am still not sure what purpose it serves because the discription of the plants include notes about the plant's leaves, flowers, fruits, and a "notes" section that is just a waste of space on the page for my purpose.  So if you don't have much knowledge of plants and see a plant that you want to identify, try praying, you might get an answer before you find it in this book
