This book has nothing to do with the plot to assassinate America's only Catholic President, John Kennedy.  Rather, it is a long winded attempt to hide the truth.  

Richard Case Nagell had nothing whatsoever to do with the tragic event that took place in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963.  We know this for certain, as Nagell was in federal custody for a bank robbery attempt in El Paso at the time of the assassination.  Author Russell here spins a convoluted and unbelievable tale suggesting that Nagell had himself arrested in order to provide a perfect alibi.  If you believe this tale, you probably also believe Elvis is still alive and living quietly in Holly Springs, Mississippi.  I, for one, believe neither.

In the corpus of this text, Russell insinuates that various and sundry groups and individuals may have been involved in the plot to kill the President.  His list of potential suspects includes, but is not limited to, the following:

The Soviets
The Nazis
anti-Castro Cubans
The Castro government
Right Wing Extremists
The Socialist Worker's Party
The Italian Mafia
Military Intelligence

Explicity policed out of Russell's account are the likely perpetrators, including the CIA, Mossad, and the Meyer Lanksy Crime Syndicate.  From this, we can conclude that this work of Russell's is nothing but disinformation.  We are extremely suspicious of its favorable reviews.  Nobody could plow through the "x-files murkiness" of this text and come out of it more enlightened as to the facts of November 22, 1963 than they were when they began.  The book is a waste of time and money.  Those truly interested in this terribly important mystery are advised to read carefully, the following:
