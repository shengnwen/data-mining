I saw this book when I was a child and wanted to read it then (it had a cool cover with a kind of blimp/airship on it).  Unfortunatley, life intervened and I only got around to reading it just recently.

Alas!  This book was a lot better and more wonder-filled in my imagination than it actually turned out to be.

The story is not very interesting, the setting is not well-painted, the protagonist's adventures are pedestrian, and the whole thing is swiss-cheesed with so much British slang as will likely put an American kid off his feed.

Skip this one
