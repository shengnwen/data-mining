I must say I was eager to read Ms. Bloom's work, but found myself quite disappointed following my completion of the work. The latter half of the work is significantly better than the first, but the former cannot make up for the flawed foundation on which she begins her project.

I credit Ms. Bloom with putting together many of the different approaches to the study of suicide terrorism (what limited work has been done in the area over the years) but I feel she seems to sway between analysis of suicide terrorism and terrorism in general- when making points about the evolution of suicide terrorism, it seems a stretch to include analysis of groups such as the Indian Thuggee who hardly fit the model.  It seems there was a desire in the author to have examples to draw on from different eras, regions, and religions/ideologies which led to her including groups that force her to "open" her analysis until it is to broad to be of use.  In the end the book has some good information, but the author's arguments, and explanations are weak at best.

As for the reviewer(s) who asked for those who were not impressed by this work to recomend other works/authors, I would have to say that this field has a seriously small number of true experts- though following September 11th there seems to be a plethora of so-called experts publishing works.  These are often just echos of theories that have been said enough to where they are viewed as "common knowledge" though they are often wrong in part or in whole.

I recomend Walter Laqueur. He has been well respected in the field for decades.  His "A History of Terrorism" is an excelent work, though dated.  He released a more recent work titled "No End to War" which would be excelent for you to read. 

I also would recomend Bruce Hoffman from Rand and Georgetown, and if you want to go in depth into groups such as Hizb'ullah (the begining of "modern suicide bombing") I recomend Magnus Ransthrop from the University of St. Andrews
