At first I was impressed by this book - but later quite disillusioned. I have been troubled for some time because I find the views and methods of the "christian right" to be quite out of keeping with my understanding of the Bible. As I read Robin Meyers book I found myself in close agreement with the ethical and political message he had to out across. But as the book progressed I realized that the Christianity I am following is a different religion from that taught by Rev.Meyers. 
     I would consider myself to have orthodox evangelical views. Rev. Myers is presenting the Bible as a series of myths to be interpreted along with the religious writings of other people. The Apostle Paul we are told was a repressed homosexual and his views on "gays" can therefore be disregarded. It is suggested that all worlds primary religions lead to the same God and - I think he is teaching - that the death of Jesus is glorifying the cycle of violence and revenge, and should be rejected as a means of salvation. 
      I came to understand that Rev. Meyers' is presenting a form of Christianity where the ethical teaching of Jesus (together with acceptable teaching form other sources) is the basis for personal morals and social/political action. While this is a perfectly reasonable philosphy - it is not the teaching of the Bible. This is a different religion from the mainstream teaching of the church for 2000 years.
     This is perplexing. Can an evangelical Christian work for peace and justice alongside people of a different faith. Yes, of course. Does an evangelical Christian compromise their faith by working with people of another religion - albeit with a similar name. I think the answer is "no". So why does it matter?
     As a manifesto for peace and social justice, this book is readable and compelling. But where must we look for a biblical understanding of these issues? Not in Robin Meyers book
