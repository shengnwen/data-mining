I thought the book would inspire me into healthy eating as much as the cover does.  little did I know that Carol is a MODEL and ACTRESS.  duh.  ok.  so it's not the raw food.  even when she ate candy, scotch and drank coffee she still (and i quote) "managed to keep up appearances".

ok?

so WHAT is the point of the cover??!

The book itself is unsatisfying, poorly written.  I find it rambling, cutesy yet unervingly technical at times, fluffy and self absorbed!  written in a patronizing tone it is as if she is addressing fat people and convincing them to eat raw and becoming repetatively angry at their (at times ignorant) questions.  If the author thinks their questions are so DUMB then WHY publish them - the same question THREE TIMES no less!  The one about "don't you get hungry eating just SALAD?".  UGH!

There is also NO credibility here.  She eats white bread, white pasta, white sugar, table salt one day then the next day quits those and happens upon a raw food diet.  OF COURSE her health will improve.  it will improve even if she still eats cooked food and eliminate white bread, white pasta, white sugar, coffee and scotch. there is NO SAY in here that credits raw to be the one to owe.  I mean, even when she ate coffee and scotch every DAY she still managed to be in magazine covers.  obviously, it's NOT the raw food
