What is Wilbur Smith's obsession with the word "escarpment"?!?!  (I stopped count at 37).
That aside, this is a pretty hefty adventure.  It caught my eye in the bookstore- the premise of a grand search for an Egyptian tomb really grabbed my interest.  That being said- the author goes a bit overboard with character/scene details, making for a 650+ page read.  Not that it's a negative comment, just a concern about length- there's no economy of words when it comes to Wilbur Smith's writing style.  He's a good storyteller, but it could be so much better with the proper editor involved (getting bogged down in the details slowed the progression of the story's pacing- something I don't appreciate in an adventure novel).  The excitement within the story is a lost a bit due to his slow-detail-oriented writing style. 
Don't misunderstand me, I didn't hate it; if the premise of the story didn't interest me from the start, this is a book I would have otherwise put down after the first 100 pages
