For one to understand why Hemingway wrote a book of this caliber, it must  be understood that Sherwood Anderson, whom Hem parodied, had just had a  contract signed by Hemingway.  An offer had also been made by Scribner's  which was more prestiegeous of the two literary firms.  To get out of the  contract, Hem offered this book, which he knew would be turned down by  Anderson's firm, thus giving Hemingway the chance to accept Scribner's  contract.  The book was not intended as a great literary work, and thus  must be examined in the light of which it is written.  There are many funny  idosyncrasies which Hem used for some of the characters in the book.  Most  of these came from people he knew there in Paris.  Entertaining?  Yes it  was to me.  A great literary work?  It achieved what he was looking for.   So you be the judge
