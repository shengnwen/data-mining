The story is gripping, alright... if you're a man in heat.  Every major character ends up either being raped, murdered or has major moral flaws.  If it was a movie, it would easily have an R rating.

My first impression of the literature by the way of creative language and sentence structure is that it's not impressive.  Of course, with an editor, the grammar is right, but the analogies are weak, and the literary skills of the author are average at best.

I kept trying to finish it, but (spoiler warning!!!) after about the half-way mark - after the pillaging of the town just outside the cathedral that was being built, and the death of the main character up to that point, I just couldn't bring myself to read the rest.  I figured that I paid for the stupid thing, I should get its worth, but after a weekend's reflection, I've decided to put this one on the bottom of the pile
