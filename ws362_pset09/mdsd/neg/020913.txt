I picked this book up from the library (thank goodness no money out of my pocket) because I thought it was a mystery. Talk about hiding the real genre of the book! NO WHERE does it say this book is Sci-Fi. I got about 40 pages in and threw it against the wall. It wasn't sufficiently interesting to persue and I really do not like Sci-Fi. Why didn't the publisher advertise it as such? Trying to sneak this stinker out? Yuck - now that I know what Reilly TRIES to write (he's a terrible writer) I won't bother picking up another of his "books." Kind of make you wonder who he knows in the publishing world to get this crap into print
