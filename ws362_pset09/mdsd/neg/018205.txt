Cute dog. Obnoxius owners.

OK I am one of the few that did not enjoy the book let alone finish it. My hopes were to pass it on to mother-in-law, nephew, wife.  I did not care for, let alone expect,a description of the couples sex habits & birth control strategy. Mix that in with a smattering of needless cursing and no one gets this book, it is heading back to the used book store where I got it.
