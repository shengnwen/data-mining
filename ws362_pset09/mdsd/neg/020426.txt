Filled with insider gossip and scatter-shot observations on the sexes, this is not exactly a work for the ages. In fact outside of the catchy title, I wonder who reads this stuff besides other chatty insiders who have made a cottage industry of feeding off one another like intestinal mites. So why did I read it. Well, I got it free, it's well written and I was "seduced" by the title-- okay, it was by the nubile cover that comes across like 1940's noir I used to sneak past my mother. In short, it was strictly a glandular decision and not exactly a flattering one, proving I suppose some testy thesis about men buried somewhere in the 300-plus pages. And that's the book's main problem. I don't know any more about how the author feels about these issues than when I started. I guess I was expecting something stereotypically masculine, like a cogent train of thought. But then, I suppose that just proves some equally testy thesis about women buried somewhere in the same text. In my fantasy life, I dream of voting out of town not only the whole greedy Clinton-Bush, Repubocrat axis, but the incestuous political culture that feeds off them. Most definitely, it's about driving out all those within martini-mixing distance of Pennsylvania Avenue. After setting down this book, my fantasies ran wild.
