Should have been titled: "The God Particle - Pg. 366-376"  The book speaks very little about the Higgs boson for which it is named after.  Instead Lederman focusses on the idea of the unsplittable 'a-tom'.  Lederman goes through 'a-tom' history from the early Greek philosophers to the year 1993.  

Here are some quick thoughts on the book itself:  
(1) As to be expected, the book is a tad bit outdated.   Since 1993 the top quark has been found and the SSC has been cancelled (which is unfortunate since he had so much hope for it throughout the book, oops!).  
(2) The book has its humor but I would not call it side-splitting.  I found it somewhat irritating that he often jumped to a side-story just to tell a joke.  
(3) An earlier reviewer said it contained "dense math" though the only few equations that are in the book are to show what people put on t-shirts or to show that the symbol 'M' is different from 'm' which he explains anyway.  Any particle decay 'equations' are to be taken as givens for the reader.
(4) The history is decent.

The book was worth reading, though I am not sure who it was written for.  On one hand, people looking for information on the Higgs would not wish to read the majority of this book's content.  On the other hand, people looking for history on the idea of an 'a-tom' would not pick a book called "The God Particle".
