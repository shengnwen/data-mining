I love history and am a history minor, and yet I had a hard time reading this book.  It did not devote much time to the Twenties or the Great Depression and spent too much time on the 1940's and the cold war.  I had the opportunity to read the fifth edition of this book, the 2004 edition, and the fifth edition is far better.  It appears to be completely rewritten and makes more sense.  It also spend more time on each area of history.  The fourth edition, to put it bluntly, stinks
