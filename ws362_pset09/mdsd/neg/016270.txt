I gave this 2 stars b/c I liked the author, but the story itself did not appeal to me.  I found I couldn't identify with Ali at all.  I thought her decisions and her actions were horrible.  This is just my opinion obviously, and again I liked the writing style of Carol Matthews but I was glad to be done with the story when I got to the last page
