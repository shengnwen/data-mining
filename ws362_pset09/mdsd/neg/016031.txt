I'm not Christian. I'm Agnostic and I picked up the book because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to learn something about Christianity.

This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. Let me be clear that I am saying nothing against religion in this review. I cant judge that, but I can review this terrible writing. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to have no concept of motivation, logic, or storytelling. It's as if when writing the book they had ideas of where the characters should end up, but then used the first idea that popped into their heads about how that should happen with no critical thought at all. 

As stated before, the names of the characters should have given me pause, the most egregous being Chang Wong, a name so stereotyped that I cant believe the authors have ever met an Asian. At this book in the series the world has devolved into a right wing nutjob survivalist fantasy, where the TribForce(...) is living literally underground, in rebellion against the New World Order(who call themselves, wait for it: the New World Order). 

The final battle of the Apocalypse is fought on ATV's and horses.

Jesus.
