I bought this book for two reasons:  I wanted to get more familiar with the whole pulp culture and the reviews here gave the idea that the plot was experimental in a kind of fun way.

What I found was no true characters at all, no memorable situations, no exciting action, no beautiful or unique places, nothing funny, very little of the stylish 30s/40s things I expected from it, very little anything.

Of course there were the recurrent pulp references, but the pulp never got a proper foothold either. Almost as if the writer was in a limbo between making it a slice-of life piece for pulp author fanboys/girls, a homage to pulp, Zhang Mei's life story and actual pulp action. Neither really worked in my opinion.

A few pieces I liked were in the start when he described a smokey bar where  the mysterious pulp authors gathered and where Walter Gibson told the story of the Sweet Flower Wars in the Chinatown, his description of H.P. Lovecraft's personal life and when they were making plans of what a The Shadow movie should look like... But moments like that were seriously really rare.

I may have missed the point somehow but I seriously couldn't read it for more than 20 pages at a time without putting it down. If you absolutely have to get it, at least get the paperback
