I read this whole book that had me intrigued and I really thought it was very good.  When I read the ending I was very dissappointed.  The ending was dumb and pointless and didnt make any sense to me that it ended that  way.  In my opinion this book should not have gotten the high ratings that  it got.  I strongly suggest to everyone who loves romances novels not to  read this one, you will be as dissappointed as I was
