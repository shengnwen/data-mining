This book is so bad. The first two chapters are good,But each page gets worse and worse after that. The only reason i finished the book was because i was waiting for it to get better. I live in new york. This book has nothing to do with new york in any way. When i first saw the books cover i thought.. this should be a good book. Boy was i wrong.
