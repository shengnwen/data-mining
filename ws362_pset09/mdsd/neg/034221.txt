I read this book years ago when it was first published.  Mr. Sick allowed himself to be taken in by a collection of Iranian liars as well as some phonies claiming to have experience in intelligence.  Some of the people Sick listened to were shown in the Iran-Contra hearings to be con artists who also took in Ollie North and Bill Casey.  These con artists are experts at saying what the listener wants to hear.  One guy claimed to have been in Special Forces and was an eyewitness to one of VP-candidate Bush's flights to meet with Iranians.  It turns out that he was not in Special Forces at all and he had been dishonorably discharged from the US Army.  In addition, he could not have been an eyewitness to the event he claims to have seen because he was in jail at the time.  The phony intelligence specialists have also been proven to be liars with no experience in intelligence or anything resembling national security work.  By the time I finished this book, I actually felt sorry for Sick because he had allowed himself to be taken in by these jokers.  He clearly wanted to believe that what he was being told was true.

This book does not prove anything except that even an experienced researcher can be fooled if he really wants to believe.  Subsequent investigations by a Democratically dominated Congress proved that there was no October surprise
