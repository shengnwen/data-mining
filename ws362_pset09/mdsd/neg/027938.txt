I was in the car the other day with a friend. We share different taste, but get along well. It was after school and I said I was going to have to do something if we do 'high school musical' as our musical next year. I listened to her and her mom inform me how it is the best thing ever. I watched it on my friend's ipod at her house. I wanted to turn it off, it was so very high pitch and predicable that is was horrible. She told be it would get better, but guess what it never ever did. There was nothing at all good in that horrible movie. I can't believe they call it a musical. Is this supposed to be a kid musical? Because I did not know that that meant a corny predicable thing. The songs have no meaning and I hate them. This by far the worst musical I have ever seen, no wait it is too bad to be a musical, it is by far the utter most horrible movie. What ever happened to real musical's : Annie get your gun, Phantom of the Opera, Rent, Music Man, West Side Story, South Pacific Wicked, Les Miz. Avenue Q., I could go on for ever. I hope this is not what musicals have come to. It is the worst thing i have ever heard or laid my eyes on. 
Thanks
p.s. don't buy it
It is soooo stupi
