As an amateur cello player, who picked up an instrument for the first time  3 years ago, I looked to this book for inspiration and enlightenment.  It  is represented as an amateur exploration of music, the discovery of real  music later in life.  Fact in point, the author is an amateur only in the  sense that he does not tour or get paid to play his instrument.  However we  quickly learn that this author has been playing one instrument or another  since childhood, and could at one point almost have made it as a  clarinetist.  This book quickly turns into a &quot;dig me&quot; diatribe  which left me in disagreement with the author:  despite his best efforts, I  was not ultimately convinced that he was a &quot;cool guy&quot; -- which is  really all he's trying to communicate.  For my purposes, this book was  unmitigated tripe
