This book proved a great disappointment. It contains nothing new, and completely fails to interpret either Daniel or Revelation. The author comes across as blinkered, bigotted and arrogant - a self-satisfied member of the 'elite' who gives the impression he will spend eternity smirking from his guaranteed high place in heaven at the rest of us, who will presumably be burning in hell! He is mistaken in thinking Daniel and Revelation only have any meaning for the present generation - didn't they have any meaning to those for whom they were originally written? His theology appears limited and narrow-minded. Don't waste your money on this book. A more scholarly and balanced view of eschatology is given in Craig C. Hill's book 'In God's Time'
