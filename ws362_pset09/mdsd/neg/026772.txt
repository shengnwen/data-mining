  Just because some folks don't resemble human two-leggers and only have a hickory nut for a head doesn't mean they aren't real people all the same! Miss Hickory, a doll-like plaything belonging to Ann of the Old Place, maintains her dignity and self-respect during a long New Hampshire Winter. Shocked by the news that the Brown family has moved to Boston until late Spring, Miss Hickory relies on her woodland companions and her own ingenuity to survive without her corncob house.

   The relations between Miss Hickory and Crow, Squirrel, Groundhog, a cat named Mr. T., Hen Pheasant and Robin provide light reading for children of a simpler era with its gentle pleasures and few dangers.  Underlying themes include the value of friendship and relaizing when not to be hardheaded.  Prim and resourceful Miss Hickory learns to recognize her own shortcomings and to trust to trust her friends, as she seeks to make a new life in the apple orchard.  This charming story offers literary safety in our modern age with its myriad threats to childhood innocence.
