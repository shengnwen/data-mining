This was the first book I bought when my grandson was diagnosed with spastic diplegia. I found no hope in it and continued looking until I found Advanced Bio-mechanical Rehabilition. Their web-site is www.blyum.com. We have been doing ABR for six months and the changes are miraculous. Finally something to actually help our kids physically instead of teaching them to deal with less and less movement as they age
