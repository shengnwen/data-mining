I threw this book in a bonfire after I discovered Goodman. Painful to read. Manages to be short on detail and current developments (buy Goodman if you want either) and yet somehow wordy and full of information you don't need. Horribly edited. If you wan't something concise buy Lippencott's review (though the info is a bit dated).
