Being interested in current events, I was chagrinned to find that this book is almost exclusively a historical review beginning at the start of the Cold War and crawling up to our present day. Having lived through most of this history, I found it not that enlightening, albeit somewhat useful, as it always is to review things long put aside. I found the book boring to read, not compelling like a lot of good historical writing often is, David McCullough's work as an example.

Given the Democratic gains from Rham Emanuel's handpicked candidates for the House, Beinart's views seem coincident with the arrival of some of these new representatives, so it will be interesting to see if he's accurately intuited the zeitgeist of the resuscitated Democratic Party, and how effectively it manages to reorient US foreign policy
