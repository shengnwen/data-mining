If you are taking an introduction to genetics course, this book is difficult to understand. It seemingly presents the concepts for those that have had previous knowledge of genetics. The chapters on Mendelian Genetics, Mitosis, and Meiosis are done well, but later chapters dealing with regulation, mutation, transcription, and translation are difficult to understand. The pictures are not very helpful, either. If this book is required for your introductory genetics course, i recommend getting another book in addition to this one
