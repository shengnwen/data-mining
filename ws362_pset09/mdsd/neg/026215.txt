The beginning of the book was written more like poetry rather than telling an actual story.  The sentences were broken up and scattered all over the pages, very inconsistant.  It's a little discouraging when you first start to read it and a bit confusing.  Towards the middle it began telling more a story rather than poems about how the "author" felt which helped you get into the book more.  Towards the end I just wanted to hurry up and finish it just to find out the ending without skipping to the end.  The story line is good but poorly written, true or not
