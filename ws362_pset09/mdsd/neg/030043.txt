If you like hard science fiction, I would recommend trying Permutation City and Diaspora by Greg Egan instead. Another book more similar to Eon but far more readable is "Rendezvous with Rama" by Arthur C. Clarke (not the sequels). Greg Bear wasn't able to convey the sense of wonder of the situation he describes, in fact, sometimes I have found very hard to understand his descriptions, as others reviewers say (not because of their technicallity, but simply because they are sometimes very convoluted). Also, part of the plot seems outdated, be aware that this book was published in 1985 (USSR, Cold War...). I haven't been able to read past a third of the book, so this review may be a bit biased ;
