Intersting style of writing as previouse reviewer indicated and at the same time obviouse he had no idea of what an option was. For anyone with the slightest knowlege of options it becomes apparent that the main purpose of this book is to get one to purchase Mr Groenke's option software. With out it which he constantly referes to, his formulia's would result in endless hours of tedious calculations. After spending $29 on this book and finding it is really a primar for his software would be disapointing to anyone trying to get a basic understanding of how selling options works. His software may be great and worth the money but its a little misleading to promote this book as a stand alone. I'm not a reviewer, just someone that buys and mostly sells options and can't figure how anyone could give this 5 stars, or buy this book without understanding you really need his software to get any benifit from the book. That of course assumes your not a proffeser sitting in an office somwhere as opposed to really utilizing options
