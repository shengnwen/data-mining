Twitchell makes some valid points about consumerism--if you can plod through this &quot;hard&quot; read with a dictionary at your side.  I disagree with his view that we middle-aged folks of today have selectively  forgotten how important consumption was for us.  Contrary  to his opinion,  I believe that we were not consumed by such materialism as the youth are  today.  It is quite a different &quot;triumph of stuff&quot; today.  What a  shame that we must give identity to ourselves through the things we  purchase.  Give me Elaine St. James and her book, Simplify Your Life
