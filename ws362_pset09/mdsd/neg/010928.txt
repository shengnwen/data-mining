I hate this book. it is racist. the snooty rich white Texans think their so fricking cool and big that they can boss around all the Mexicans. the book portrais Leslie as the hero, BUT, she is just as racist as any of them. White people just like to think that they are bigger than any other race. History shows that whites have been mean to every other race on EARTh. Im out.
