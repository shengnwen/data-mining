Ann, an aspiring writer, knew of Lucy, an aspiring poet, when the two of them were students at the same college.  Actually, everyone knew of Lucy.  She was the one who'd had cancer as a child and whose chemotherapy treatments had left her with a severely disfigured face that continued to need surgery after surgery until the end of her life.

Lucy was mistreated by her peers when she was a child, but it seemed that for the rest of her life everyone was trying to make up for that cruelty.  She was cheered for and spoken to warmly wherever she went, despite the fact that she seemed to have few redeeming qualities that would make her so popular.  Even Ann admits that she followed the gossip about Lucy's medical condition and she felt close to her even when Lucy had no idea who Ann was.

Ann couldn't be more delighted when Lucy decides to move in with her after college.  She continues to be thrilled and grateful for the rest of Lucy's life, as Lucy drifts through existence, needing constant reassurance that people loved her, that she was beautiful and talented.  She also needs money, and someone to clean her apartment, and someone to do her bidding after her surgeries.  That person is always Ann, who seems to simply accept that this is the way their relationship should be.

I was confused.  How could an intelligent, educated person allow herself to be treated so poorly?  What was Ann getting out of this relationship that I couldn't see?  Or was it simply that she befriended someone prone to depression and suicide attempts, so she felt she couldn't drop Lucy without putting her life in danger?  Ann is a much better friend than I could ever imagine being; I would have stopped speaking to Lucy after about the fiftieth page
