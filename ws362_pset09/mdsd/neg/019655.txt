What is wrong with u guys! Its an ON-LINE GAME! Your supposed to make mistakes and get strong the hard way! Thats what makes it FUN! I could understand you using a strategy guide to beat an Xbox RPG, but not on-line. It takes all the fun out of it! But hey, if your too much of a wimp to make some mistakes on the game, than buy. You'll get strong, but you'll never have true power
