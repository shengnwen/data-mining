I purchased this book -- unfortunately before I read the reviews here -- to prepare for the CISA. Despite the optimistic title, the book fails to deliver in just about every area. The book is not connected to the exam in any logical form or structure. One of the biggest draws for a book like this is the practice test software. Sadly, this book fails yet again. The software works, but the questions in some cases are just plain wrong! I wrote to the editor and they offered me an errata sheet that I could use to spot mistakes in their data???? What good is that? My advice is that you skip this book, avoid this author, and not patronize this publisher since they are not willing to make good on their promises
