I had bought a copy of Harold Evans "The American Century" which I enjoyed mainly for its excellent collection of photographs. After reading reviews complaining that it was too liberal, I decided to have a look at Johnson's book for a different perspective. I have been surprised and saddened by Johnson's tone. Unfortunately his book is not written from a scholarly perspective of investigating the complexity of American history with the purpose of illuminating the truth. All history is biased to some extent, but the language used by Johnson is beyond persuasive- its arrogant. I was hoping to find a reasonable presentation of a conservative perspective of historical events, but this book is written with such narrow mindedness  that it reads more like an extended diatribe.  I find it sad that talented historians sabotage their works with such strongly divisive motives.
