For someone who is reading the whole series at one time, this book might be great. But when I read this book, it had been over two years since I'd read the one before it, and I could not even finish it. I tried to stick with it, but I eventually put it down and could not pick it up again. Is this not the conclusion to the MITFORD series? So why can't a poor reader read about MITFORD instead about a bunch of characters we know nothing about, who we won't get to know very well seeing as this is the last book. I am a big fan of the whole series, but this book was simply painful.
