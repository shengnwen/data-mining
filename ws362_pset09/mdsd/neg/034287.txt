I am a big fan of Kathryn Harrison.  I've voraciously read Exposure and Poison and recommended them to everyone I know.  And that's why I'm particularly disappointed in her latest novel.

Who doesn't know about Ms. Harrison's memoir -- The Kiss -- a true-life recollection of her incestuous relationship with her father?  The author is a veteran of therapy.  And here, therapy-talk takes over.  None of it, however, rings particularly true.  For example, here's an excerpt of Will, talking to his 70ish father, whom he recently discovered was having an affair:

"Dad?  When you're working -- do you ever feel something being revealed to you?  That your consciousness is heightened -- augmented, maybe -- by a force outside of your own intellect?"

Who TALKS like this?  The book is filled with sentences that sound, not like the characters, but like the author.  Here's another, from a patient (Will is a psychoanalyst):  "(He's) very old-school, very houndstooth tweedy.  He's so central casting that it's actually cute in a kind of avuncular way."  What twenty-something do you know who would describe someone in that way?

The characters don't ring true.  They never come to life on their own.  The psychoanalysis is very "pop" variety -- a real surprise since Ms. Harrison knows the subject so well.  I felt irritated as I read along...especially knowing this talented writer is capable of so much more
