The bottom line: I really didn't like this book. I found the plot and action to be very slow moving and uninteresting. One thing I did like was Sheriff Brady. I thought she was a good solidly created character, but the plot just didn't have that exciting pace that a Hoag, Hooper, Johansen, or Cornwell novel does. Another thing that I didn't particulary care for was the whole eagle thing with the young girl. It kind of a gave off a somewhat ridiculous indian spirit kind of feeling. I also found it kind of unnecessary to have the part about Joanna's neighbor's death and his daughter. Of course if you are a fan of J.A. Jance, then I'm sure you'll like &quot;The Devil's Claw&quot; and these kind of &quot;small town&quot; mysteries. If you enjoy more hard-core suspense and don't like the &quot;country down south&quot; novels, then you won't like &quot;The Devil's Claw
