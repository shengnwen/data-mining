and when it's bad, it's worse!

As a Pagan, I was really turned off by all the Christian ideology and preaching found in the book, BUT because it had some good, solid information, I bought it anyway. I also was quite offended how the author states towards the end about using "Biblical Discipline" and spells out "S-P-A-N-K-I-N-G". Ummm... excuse me, lady, but corporal punishment is O-U-T!

As a mother, I liked how the author spoke in her own words and expressed herself, and admitted her own faults. We all have them. I really tried to like the book, but I found myself glossing over so much crap and fluff, especially the repeated references to order from Bob Jones University! ROFL! ROFL! ROFL! 

The Ultimate? Hardly
