This is undoubtedly the *worst* book I have ever read about writing or crafting a novel. 

It's hard to know where to begin when listing the things that turned me off. Perhaps it was the useless 'advice' that took up the first 1/4 of the book ["Readers want interesting characters." "Every novel needs a lead character..."].  Pretty self-evident to anyone who has EVER read a novel. Sadly, Marshall doesn't spend too much of his own time writing about giving characters depth and complexity.  No, he devotes a good portion of the book to charts that dictate how many lines each character should have, on what page each character should appear, etc.  The inside of this book looked like a diet book with weight and height tables, rather than a serious guide to writing a novel.  

With so many much better books on this subject available, I can not see recommending this to ANY writer, regardless of skill level.

I suggest anyone thinking about buying this book take this simple test - find a copy of the book in your local library or bookstore, and check out the "Sample Synopsis" of a novel written using Marshall's method in the book's appendix. If the novel outlined in this synopsis - with its 2-dimensional, stereotyped characters and hack plot - is the kind of thing YOU would like to learn to write, then by all means buy one of the many used copies up for grabs on Amazon.  The work you produce will be less competition for the rest of us.
