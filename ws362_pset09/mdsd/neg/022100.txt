I read all three of the "Sisters Grimm" books and found the first one quite interesting; the second one started to be mildly annoying, but the third one is really bad - and still no end in sight. It is very sad that some writers with a good idea write one good book, but then think that they have to drag it out until no one can stand it anymore. 
There isn't much consistency in the behaviour of the characters, Sabrina is unbearable annoying and the whole storyline is just not very interesting. At the end of the third book we really didn't care about any of the characters anymore
