Hey Noam, I was wondering if it worked the other way too?  If you tell enough lies about things, manufacture evidence, cite sources that are dubious at best and then sell them to your unwitting disciples do you manufacture dissent for the things that get in the way of your political ideology like truth, facts, common sense, and reality?   A falsehood well footnoted is still a falsehood.

Anyone that reads Noam Chomsky should also read the Anti-Chomsky Reader.  This man is an extremist political ideologue that is hell bent on spreading his anti-American and anti-Israeli hate messages.  Noam's motto is if you manufacture a lie and tell it in countless boring pseudo books enough times people will believe it.

Sorry Noam I took a pill called reality when I was growing up and it immunized me from the likes of you, Michael Moore and whoever else sells your drivel.  While you Rage against the Machine, I and others like me, Rage against the Morons.

For those of you that blindly utter that Chomsky is the most cited reference on the planet I counter that McDonalds is the worlds largest restaurant on the planet.  Over indulgence in one can lead to poor physical health, sampling at any level in the other leads to disastrous results in one's mental health.  Like smoking, there is no safe level of exposure to Noam.  At least McDonalds can claim that their products taste good.  Neither's claim is generally a good reflection on society as a whole.

I was just wondering about this statistic's validity.  Is this scientifically documented or is it pop myth like everything else Chomsky writes.  Does the statistic include Chomsky citing his own opinions from one book and then presenting them as established facts in another?  Noam would interview 1000 people that witnessed an event. If 999 said things happened one way with only one dissenter Noam would discount, ignore, or attack the 999 and present the 1 as the established version if it fit with Noam's agenda.
