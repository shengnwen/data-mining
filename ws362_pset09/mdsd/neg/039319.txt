This book is good for explaining which shapes of clothes look good on which figures, how clothes should fit, and how to tie a scarf. While that is helpful, I was expecting to learn some "secrets of style" as the title claims. Some tips on finding a style that corresponds with your personality or lifestyle, how to make it your own, shop for it, and keep it updated...that's what I thought I was buying. Too bad
