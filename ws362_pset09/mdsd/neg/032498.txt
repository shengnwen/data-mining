I think this book fails to supply the most important information to those with fibromyalgia. It makes the dissorder seem so mysterious, when it is not. Much is known about FM that this book skims over or doesn't mention. Sleep is the major component to FM, because of a deficiency of serotonin, preventing us from getting delta sleep, the restorative sleep that revitalizes energy, and heals/relaxes muscles. Check out &quot;Fibromyalgia&quot; by Daniel J. Wallace. That does a much better job
