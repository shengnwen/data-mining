This book has a compelling premise: capturing family recipes for the best  of Viennese pastry.  The big disappointment, however, is that the recipes  are all scaled for foodservice portions, without reference for reducing  them to domestic applications.  While I'd love to try an authentic  linzertorte, I don't have need most days to make 8 cakes worth.  I wouldn't  recommend the book unless you run a restaurant, pastry shop or other large  volume business, or you're interested enough in the topic to justify  reading it as an academic learning experience, without practical  application.  I sent it back - I wish I had known the target reader group  was not the home baker
