I found this book, and the companion piece Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Money and Investing, practically worthless. I have heard raves about this book's presentation. I think the presentation is far too simplistic. This book did not hold my attention one bit and I quickly put it down. If you are looking for a mature introduction to the Market and or Personal finance I recommend you keep looking past these two books
