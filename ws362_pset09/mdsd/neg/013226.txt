I normally do not want to say anything negative about an opinionated book, because, to me, it is okey for a book to be biased with conservative political agendas. But it is entirely unacceptable when a book intentionally distorts facts and smears the reputation of many leading academics. David Horowitz's book falls into the latter category. Let me use just one example. While Horowitz is ranting against zoologist David Barash (Univ. of Washington), who, Horowitz claims, has no credential to write a book about peace. One has to ask: What is the credential to write such a book? Must peace be studied only by certain professionals narrowly trained in political science? Remember, when the United States and the Soviet Union were locked in the all-out nuclear arms race, mathematicians such as John von Neumann made a great strategic contribution to prevent the doomsday scenario from becoming reality for Americans. If Barash is discredited for being a zoologist originally, can we discredit Newton as a mathematician just because he was a physicist? Can we discredit Goethe as a biologist just because he was a poet? Can we discredit Da Vinci as an achieved scientist/inventor because he was a painter? There have been just too many learned people who are successful in several disciplines. Barash, as an expert in zoology, has been working on cooperation from an evolutionary perspective. His personal dedication to world peace by seeking a new solution from the angle of game theory is particularly admirable. His new book about game theory is a solid piece of evidence demonstrating that he is more than qualified to write a book about peace. If such a person is considered to be dangerous, who is safe? Horowitz simply does not have an open mind.
