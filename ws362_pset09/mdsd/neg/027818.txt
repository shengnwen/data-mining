Peter Matthiessen joins a friend on a journey to remote Nepal in the early 70s, essentially to search for the bharal (or blue sheep) and the elusive snow leopard.  Pretty soon we realise that, for Matthiessen, this is a far more personal journey as he comes to terms with the recent loss of his wife and explores his own faith.

So, on the one hand you have a spiritual journey, recounted with great knowledge and conviction alongside a naturalist's diary of the many flora and fauna discovered along the way.

On the other hand you have Peter Matthiessen taking 300 pages to moan about porters, sherpas, his shoes, lack of leopards, missing his son (don't leave an 8 year old to go exploring only a year after his mother dies!) and the snow.  

If you are interested in Nepal and/or Buddhist and Eastern philosophy then this is quite possibly the travel book for you.  If a humourless adventurer with questionable parenting priorities is likely to annoy you then I would advise trying a different book
