This book went great until page 18, when it switched into high-gear, Christian bible-thumping mode.  It goes as far as to say "...it's only when we go after those ideals from the foundation of Christian faith that our efforts will yield anything worth holding on to."  I have no problem with books geared towards Christians.  I DO, however, have a problem with devious marketing.  There are no idicators anywhere on the cover that this is anything but a guide to choosing a career.  Instead, it is just another tool designed to shove Christianity down unsuspecting throats.
