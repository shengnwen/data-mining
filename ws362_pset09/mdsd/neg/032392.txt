I bought this book because I like to throw my PCs into differing environments to keep them guessing. While it does have a lot of rules for various low temperature environments, the book just didn't make me feel cold. The same goes for Sandstorm. The book didn't make me feel hot. The only environment book that ever succeeded in making me feel like "I was there" was Dreadmire, by Spellbinder Games.  Wizards of the Coast needs to take a hint from that book -- it made me feel like I was in a swamp.  Frostburn offers various rules for cold and ice, but it does not offer us anything of real value. We don't need many more feats and skills, if any.  We need substance, and this book has only redundancy and fluff. If you still have the old Wilderness Survival Guide and Dungeoneers Survival Guide, don't bother with Frostburn -- most of the rules in those old books are still applicable today
