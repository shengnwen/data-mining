A Feminist Examination Of Mae West, November 24, 2006
Pamela Robertson's "Guilty Pleasures: Feminist Camp From Mae To Madonna," published in 1996 is  a university press publication that examines Mae West's contributions to the Feminist Movement and evaluates her role as a female icon of the twentieth century. This treatment of West is a typical academic text with some research of textual sources, but with little or no interviews and featuring theory that is hit or miss. 
When Mae West was asked why she never wrote an article supporting the Feminist Movement she reportably drawled, "They never asked me."
