I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated
