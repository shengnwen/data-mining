I'll keep this review short and sweet.  This book is an in-depth academic discussion of how humans see and perceive things.  Although there were some interesting tid-bits throughout the book, I wanted to learn how to improve the composition of my photographs, and didn't find anything of use.  This book is probably well-suited to a graduate-level psychology course, but for me it has little applicability to photography
