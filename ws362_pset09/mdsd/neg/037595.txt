When will conservatives start trying to use facts, reason, and common sense?  Instead we get vitrol once more, sometimes disguised as reasonableness.  Anyone who tries to paint with the same brush the liberal embrace, temporary as it was, of Russia in the 20th century, and support for the UN in our current day and time is once again using misdirection, reading events in current history through the glasses of ideology...actually sounds a bit like those who chose communist thought while ignoring how it plays out in the real world when the theory is filtered through flawed humans.  We get the transformation of our democracy into a place where patent ideological claims ride rough shod over the plain facts in front of us.
