I'm a technically-oriented, DIY person and I was looking for a solar  electric book to help me with my small-scale, residential installation. I  already have most of the background on photovoltaic systems and needed more  of a &quot;Here's-how-you-do-it&quot; book. Although amusing and easily  read, I found this book useful for someone who is starting to think about  solar power and needs a light hand to make them feel more at ease about  what a system will and will not do. This is not a book for someone needing  a DIY guide or a &quot;How-to&quot; manual. It's not a bad book - just not  useful for my needs
