I did not purchase this book.  I had the luxury of checking it out at my local library for FREE.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME buying this book.  I've read the majority of the book & I'm sick & tired of these author type people capitalizing on other people's desires and emotions.  FACT:  Everyone wants to be rich and have a more comfortable lifestyle.  Do not lead people to buy your book if you cannot present them with useable knowledge!

I will save you the hours of time it takes to read this waste of time & tell you what the authors are trying to tell you.  This is their hidden message........"Find a really good idea & go for it!"

Wow!  Great idea!  News to me?  I think not.

That's it.  The whole book boiled down to that.

There are plenty of good books out there for any interested in becoming wealthier and/or living a more comfortable lifestyle.  This isn't one
