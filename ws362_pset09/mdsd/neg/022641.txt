This was not what I expected. I normally read either to educate myself or to amuse myself. I think this failed in both areas. I could follow (but not necessarily agree with) his logic about value systems, but had difficulty as to how that all relates to consciousness. Other problamatic areas where when the author dismisses interiority or innerness of (among other things) an automobile or a battleship. I think a great many car owners and sailors would question that. I also am not as confident that a misquito feels no hunger pains as the author, and there are major world religions where some people drink only filterwd water in order to not hurt smaller creatures. Maybe this whole book was just over my (layman) head.I finally decided to stop chasing my tail and end the feedback.

The book binding though attractive, was sloppy and most pages were stuck together
