The book, while full of interesting facts and data regarding traditional and indegenious religions in Africa, is quite frankly, a dull read!  The book tends to be overly clinical and does not delve deep into any one particular ATR.....in fact, one of the biggest sections on Yoruban religion is minimal.  This book would be wonderful for anyone researching Comparitive Religion within the continent of Africa or someone dealing with superficial data
