As a rule, I don't usually buy or read these types of books.   Not being familiar with Mr. Evans or his work I wasn't planning on reading this one either.  However, after seeing so many positive reviews and one or two negative reviews that launched into a tirade almost to the point of histerics it made me wonder why these few would be so adamant about someone reading this book, so I bought it to find out and I'm glad I did.

This is a great book, based on facts that anyone who wants to do the research can find out for themselves.   Mr. Evans is correct in his assessment of the situation surrounding the middle east and Iran and has put in an easy to understand format.   There's nothing in this book that can't be proven if the reader wants to take the time to search it out for themselves.

I'm not going to tell you to buy it.   I'm not going to tell you not to buy it.  Every person is a free moral agent and you can make up your own mind.   Those who would try to criminalize Mr. Evans or his work and coerce you into not buying it are either anti-semitic, pro-terrorist, anti-america or all three.   But you decide what you want to do.

If your interested in knowing the truth about the Iran Nuclear Situation, this is as good a place to start as any and better than most.   If your not, buy something else.

At any rate, I want to thank all of those persons for their ranting reviews against this book.  Because of you, I was compelled to purchase and read a wonderful collection of truth that I would have other wise passed up
