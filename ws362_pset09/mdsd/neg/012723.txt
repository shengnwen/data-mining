I don't know if it was because the author himself really thought this was a good book, or if it was because I had other things on my mind while reading it. Rex Johnson is a fair writer, and does provide interesting information at times. However, I found myself falling asleep, slobering while I was reading it. I guess fly fishing is not for me! Illustrations in the book are up to par. If you like fly fishing, maybe, borrow it before you think about buying it. Really
