A good example of why you would go to the library or bookstore and see if the book was any good, prior to purchasing. Specifically, author hits a  wide range of topics and delves into little. The book lacks summaries and  lacks a general direction. Some nice photos, which probably resulted in the  excessive price. Save your money
