Unfotrunately Shantaram did not grab my imagination at all.  Nor did I find it emotionally satisfying.  I realize Shataram is meant to be a kind of Bollywood story - over the top, flowery, cliched etc. but the Bollywood movies I've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying, despite their soppyness etc.  Shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story.
