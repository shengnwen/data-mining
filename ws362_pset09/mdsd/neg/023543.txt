This man calls himself a dog trainer.  Granted Devon/Orson came to him with problems, some of which he tried to solve by picking up the dog and throwing him.  I've never read that in any training book.  It seems that if he sticks to labs (stable ones) he can train dogs, if he ventures into the world of unstable border collies he is way out of his league.  Not all border collies are sheep herders.  Perhaps some of Orson's anxiety came from being forced to face his failures in sheep herding over and over again (kind of like kids whose fathers want them to play baseball even though their kids have no sports ability).  Rosie was a success story but she came practially herding right out of the box so to speak.  Then there was Homer who didn't quite measure up so he gave him away.  

If you can't manage a dog like Orson on a farm, where can you manage him?  And where does it say that those people had the right to swarm all over his farm uninvited?

Needless to say I was very disappointed with the book.  I have six rescue dogs of my own, I know they aren't perfect and need work and to his credit Mr. Katz did seem to work with Orson, but some of his work did seem misguided.

The work with the Shaman was interesting but at the end it seemed like it was just thrown in to make him feel better.  I won't be buying any more of his books.
