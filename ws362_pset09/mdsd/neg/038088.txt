I adore Ishiguro.  I was bereft when I finished The Remains of the Day.  Thought A Pale View of Hills was fabulous.  I absolutely abhorred the Unconsoled.  I confess, I read to enjoy myself.  I have a degree in English literature.  I don't have a problem with analysis, but this was too much work to get any enjoyment out of it at all
