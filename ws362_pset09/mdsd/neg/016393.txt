I bought this book with the hope of understanding what my wife might be going through, so that she need not travel this road alone. I am a doctoral candidate in a medical facility and have had several publications in scientific journals as well as peer-reviewed numerous others. Reviewing material objectively is something I have done extensively. This book describes thought processes of people having mid-life issues and addresses only one solution as being viable; go YOUR own way, do YOUR own thing, YOU are right, YOU are the most important thing in the world. If this is all there is for Vickers-Willis to offer, no wonder her marriage failed! There is no room in any marriage for just the I and the ME; it is a partnership between the spouses and children. If the husband just did what he wants to, it would be considered selfish and self-centered, but Vickers-Willis seems to send the message (several illustrations) in her book that it would be &quot;self-preservation&quot; for women to do it. The second half of life can be as profound, meaningful and rich (as the author suggests it can) as the first or maybe even more, if husbands and wives are encouraged to find some common-ground to compromise on, that way the family continuity and memories are maintained, and just as importantly, each person's self-esteem. Walking away, and convincing yourself YOU are always right is just TOO easy; where are the other options? Put yourself in the other person's shoes! Sorry, this book is incomplete at best because it hasn't presented the picture of the forest, only several trees within it. How can one solve a problem without getting a big picture? The situation may have been defused but the problem was far from being solved. The 1 star is only for the effort put into the book.
