I bought this book before moving to another house. It *IS* a funny, easy-to read diatribe about how to bring yourself to throw things away. It *IS NOT* a comprehensive method about how to organize your space and house. If you want to get organized, have a practical, functional and nice-to-live-in home, buy Julie Morgenstern's &quot;Organizing from the Inside Out&quot;. However, if you want to have a laugh and gain confidence about dumping the dusty junk in your cellar or attic, this is the book for you
