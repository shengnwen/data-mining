Sorry, but expectations from A carolyn Myss Archetype card system have been floored. This deck of cards has no inspiration, nor enough data to support the cards for a good reading, let alone an indepth serious one. Even the Graphics are not adding any spice, or direction to rev up your imagination, and/or intuition. Could do all without cards too. :-
