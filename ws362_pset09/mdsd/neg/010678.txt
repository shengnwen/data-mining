I have enjoyed T. Beck's previous novels, but this one, set in the Mall from hell is just one long bore. I just couldn't relate to anyone of the characters - they seemed shadowy, shallow, and not people I would be glad to know. Offensive label queens, pushy cellphone users, stridently ambitious over achievers - ugh! And why are they LIVING in the Mall? Jeez! The plot goes nowhere and by the time we are allowed to know why one or two of the characters act the way they do we're at page 300 and I could have cared less
