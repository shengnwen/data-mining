This book is soooo terrible! not worth reading AT all! First off, you have this image in your head of this guy and a girl... but Frank gets these people in HIS very own sdtory mixed up.... the genders you never are quite sure of since one is suppose to be a girl, but suddenly changes to "he says" "she says" crap! Frank get your chacacters sexes' straight before right a book. This was the biggest waist of time in my life to even read a sentance of any of his books! Just absolutely terrible!!!!!!!!!! Read it and waist time and money on something as pathetic as this book, you'll see what i mean.
