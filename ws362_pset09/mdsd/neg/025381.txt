This is a bad, bad book. I read 'My Side of the Mountain' numerous times as a child and throughout the years and never knew there were sequels which I happily raced off to request from my local library. The first book, published in 1959 and we as readers needed to assume that the story takes place at the time of the writing. Yet here in the third book, chronologically only two years after 'My Side', people now have push button phones, automated phone answering systems and cell phones. These anachronisms as well as the horribly stilted dialog (nearly insultingly simple in places and more reminiscent of Grammar School writing class than a world class novelist) ruin this book. I don't know what lead Ms. George to leap the story into the future but, at least in my opinion, it was a poorly thought out choice. 'On the Far Side of the Mountain' was a good if hard to believe sequel to 'My Side of the Mountain' this doesn't even come close to the quality or engaging read of the previous two. As my title says, this is only worth reading to complete the series. On it's own it's a poorly written, completely unbelievable story. I was terribly disappointed
