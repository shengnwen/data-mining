Trust me.  I've read them all, and this one's the worst.

A history book thinly disguised as a novel, this book reads at the pace of molasses sliding down a 3-degree incline.  The story "centers" around Ali, a fictional character placed in a historical context.  However, only a few pages of each chapter actually relates to him.  The majority of the book is a bewildered exploration of tangential facts.  Every now and then Mottahedeh will simply say, "Oh, by the way, all the information you could ever want to know about Khomeini's childhood belongs here, right next to Ali's experience at a lecture!"  Or how about a two-page discussion of the definition of a partnership?  With stilted dialogue and no plot whatsoever, this book does nothing to educate and even less to amuse.
