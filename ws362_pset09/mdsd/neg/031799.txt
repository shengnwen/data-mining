The title of this book should be "The Case For Racial Quotas in College Admission". As the director of admission at Cal Berkely, Laird destroyed the lives of many black, Hispanic and Indian students. He admitted them to Cal even though he knew that they would never graduate unless, of course, there was a quota system for graduation.Severl years ago, PBS produced a program on the S.A.T. It showed that Laird's office admitted a black applicant who had never received a combined verbal and math score of more than 800, and rejcted a white applicant who's combined score was more than 1,350.Of course, this black had no chance of passing his freshman year at Cal unless there was a quota system for promotion. Laird's data are not credible and his inferences are not logical. The inarticulate major premises of Laird's argument is that blacks, Hispanics and Indians are intellectually inferior to whites and Asians. If you accept his premise, you will enjoy his book
