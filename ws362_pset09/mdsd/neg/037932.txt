This book is a self-indulgent wallow in the mire of despair.  Wolfe starts with the supposition that "our earliest ancestors. . . crawled out of the primeval slime," that God is "an unwitting spirit" in "remote eternity," and consequently that prayer is useless and the earth is forgotten, and then whines when he is left with the natural conclusions of a godless world view: that life is accidental, without meaning and without hope.  The characters fumble around, looking for salvation in "a stone, a leaf, an unfound door," (tragically rejecting the Way, the Truth, and the Life) only to find at last that there is no point in looking for salvation at all, since "There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger," "YOU are your world."  This book is unorthodox, unwholesome, and unhealthy.  Avoid it for your own good
