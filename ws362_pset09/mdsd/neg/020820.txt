I read this guy book, I do not buy for a second that he was a Muslim, he is very shallow as far as it concern Quran, he did not quote any chapter of Quran that he has problem with and all he talks about is his personal experience!!! just mentioning 13:3 7:11 like he is quoting from a bible, shows he is was born as a Christian (No Muslem or ex-Muslim refer to quran this way, we say Al Fateha Sura 3 and not 1:3, if you know what I mean). Despite the fact that I'm an accountant, I believe my knowledge about Islam and Quran is far beyond his knowledge.

Furthermore we never heard his name in Egypt, no Muslim would believe him. His book can be revoked by any young Muslim child. Just few pages of his book to be read by any Muslim shows that this guy has nothing to do with Islam, not to mention his PHD in Islam. I'd rather say if he really got this PHD and did not buy one online from [...] it's more likely to be PHD in B.S.
