I had just read A Year in the Merde and loved it. My husband and I go to France very year, love everything about it, especially the differences between the U.S. and France. So many of the customs are unexplainable to us, one being that whenever we go to anyplace in France, we expect it to be closed.  The hours the stores keep I cannot figure out, and the hours of the restaurants vary also. We see a sign that says(in French) open all the days, we go the next day and the place is FERME(closed). A Year in the Merde points out so many differences, I just laughed and laughed, as none are serious, just something you must deal with.
  We were told that 60 Million Frenchmen was also a very funny book. It is not. Not one bit. Do not buy it if you are looking for something light.
