The central theme of this and many other books is that anyone who disagrees with or criticises the USA or its government, at home or abroad, is motivated by one or more of the following: self interest, envy or hate.[...] Facts and statistics are in short supply, unless applicable to the story line. This book is therefore entertaining proof that democratic process is, contrary to popular belief, alive and kicking in the USA. While the hysterically skewed themes of the book range from laughabley absurd to deeply offensive, it is, of course, entirely valid and relevant to have these points of view represented. I would therefore reccommend anyone who reads this book to read any of Michael Moores, for example, not to mention a few history books. After all, what's democracy anyway if you don't read and digest all sides of the story? 

Further proof of the extreme political view points in the USA. Read this with a very large pinch of salt and tongue firmly in cheek, then have a cup of coffee and reflect that anyone who writes anything is only doing so to sell copies of the book and make money. Anything a politician says or does is primarily aimed at winning votes.
