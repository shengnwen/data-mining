This book is a real letdown.  As other reviewers noted, he wasn't running a typical hedge fund strategy.  He just bought and held tech companies, either public or private.  And he did this during the .com boom. He had the sense to wind down the fund before the crash. Gosh, he made a lot of money. As I think he himself says, never mistake talent for a Bull market.

You don't find out much of anything about his approach, because I don't think there was much too it.  

The chapters jump around without much coherence. He seems to be building up to a point, leading to a big 11 page section that entirely in italics, in case you were going to miss it.  We have higher margins than the developing world, so the trade deficit doesn't matter.  That's it.

One of the least interesting books I've read this year
