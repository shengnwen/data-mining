This book is what it would be like if McDonald's wrote his biography for him. It's poorly written. Canseco glosses over many issues, where more detail would be welcome. Some parts of the book are difficult to believe. For example, his first wife to be as fiancee didn't know he played baseball for a living and assumed he was a drug dealer but still wanted to marry him. In addition, her father was one of his Little League coaches. Yet, she claims not to know he was a ball player. Please.
    He's arrogant and self-serving, naming names of people who did him no harm. Example, Walt Weiss running an old lady off the road and getting away with it.
    It's your basic crybaby trash.
