This book is very thick and very difficult to read.  I do not reccomend this biography because of how confusing it is to read.  There are too many dates thrown in here and there and not enough simple facts to keep the reader focused.  I have read many biographies but this one must surely rank as the most perplexing!  Try another biography of this interesting woman
