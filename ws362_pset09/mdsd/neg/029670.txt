My stepdaughter got this book and brought it on our recent vacation.  It's an "okay" book to read on the beach, but don't expect any serious depth.  It nearly lost me halfway through.  Ms. Burana is a lovely wordsmith, but the overall story here is saccharine-sweet and not very interesting.  If you've got a "cowboy" thing, you might be more entertained than I was, but it read more like a tween book than anything to me.
