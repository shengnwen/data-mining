I hate to be negative about a book from the German prespective, as they are rare, but I feel I must for others not to waste
their money. The book is a general and basic operational
overview of the end stages of combat in the Silesia area. If you
are only looking for dates, places, and names of units involved
this book is for you but, if you are like me, there are ZERO
personal accounts included, which are needed to "flesh" out a
book like this, to give you a better understanding of the various battles described.
