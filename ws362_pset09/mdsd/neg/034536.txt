Why would a photo artist choose a large format for Polariod-sized pictures?  That's what you get with Andreas Bitesnich's Pola Nude.  There is not one picture in the entire book that takes up more than half the page.  With approximately 60% of the pages what you get is two polariod-sized pictures side by side-- quarter-inch white borders and the rest is black background.  I get so tired trying to see what the picture is about, that I literally get fatigued looking at this book.

Many of the pictures seem interesting.  However, with much of the magic of the human form obscured by small format photos lost in a sea of black, there are too few rewards to justify the price.
