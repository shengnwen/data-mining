I read the book and I am convinced this Author did not read The Quran Shareef. She has no right to show her anti-islamic views to the world. I challenge her to read The Quran first then write. Islam is the only first religion which gives inheretance rights to woman. On one hand she does not belief in Allah, then she thank the God at the end of the book for helping her.She should apologise to Muslim poeple for lying about ISLAM &amp; THE QURAN SHAREEF
