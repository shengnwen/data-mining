Despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon, I really cant appreciate the value, usefulness or practicality of this book. The proposed framework, that each difficult conversation is really three (The "What Happened?", The "Feelings" and The "Identity") Conversations, is complicating rather than helping to solve the problem. You may think I am a contrarian or a poor communicator. However, with my very positive experience (and reviews) on books like "How to win friends and influence people?" by Dale Calegie, "Get anyone to do anything and never feel powerless again" by David J. Lieberman , "How to talk to anyone?" by Leil Lowndes and so on, I am obliged to warn potential buyers, in particular regular readers of relevant books, of a big disappointment.
