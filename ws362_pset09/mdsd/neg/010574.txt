  I give it 5 stars for being "complete" (i.e., The idea of having services for every holiday and every day of the week in one volume is wonderful). Ultimately, however, I give it 2 stars because: This paperback edition is totally useless to me. If you need reading glasses and are thinking of ordering The COMPLETE ARTSCROLL SIDDUR (paperback edition), make sure to visit your eye doctor and get those bifocals before this book arrives!  The description of this ARTSCROLL edition uses words like "clear"...and "crisp type..."... but it is only clear and crisp if you can read miniature words or you have young eyes that haven't gone through "the change" yet!
