I was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching. First of all, I thought it's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom. Secondly, the things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh. I never had problems with students in my classes, I always tried to encourage them to like the subjects; I am sure they learned many things, as well as I learned from them, too. This book was just a waste of time.
The worst thing is that the teacher I am talking about, the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is, doesn't practice what the book preaches! She is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to. How is it possible? She didn't learn anything from it??? 
Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious. But being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states, I could imagine it wouldn't really be that good.
