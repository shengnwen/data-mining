I read "The Scar" as my first taste of Mieville's work, and was blown away.  I have to say that this work is not up to the level of his later work, but still evokes interest and images.  

While dark, it did not grab me by the throat the way his other work did.  And I felt very little association or empathy for the characters.

This is a good book, but worth reading more as a glimpse of where the author started from than as a work itself
