THE GOOD:  This book gets two stars ONLY because (as the previous reviewer said) there is a lot of information. Had there not been so many facts, the book would have gotten 1 star. The book is laid out well and there are some very interesting illustrations and pictures which are well supported by informative captions.  That's about where the "good" ends...

THE BAD:  The problem with this book is that it is not written in a way that allows the reader to really sink their teeth into this wonderful period in history.  I tried...I mean, i REALLY tried to get into this book but reading it was an excercise in frustraion. Reading this book was like reading the most boring high school text book that could be found.  What frustrated me the most was that some of the chapters had real promise.  I started such chapters - like "Seige Warfare", "Chivalry" and the like with great anticipation thinking that finally the writer had broken his trend (explained in THE UGLY) only to find out it was more of the same style of writing...which brings me to...

THE UGLY:  Here is a snapshot of how each chapter is written:  Title:  Rewards...in 1053 King X gave so and so this much money...in 1104 King X gave so and so this much money...in 1223 King X gave so and so this much money...etc...Next Chapter - Infantry:  In 1104 King X had 5000 infantry...records show in 1223 King X had 2000 infantry...etc...you see the pattern?  And this dominates throughout the entire book!  I wished the author would have broken it down by periods so it could read more like a story. The way it was written really prevented me from staying interested, which was frustrating because I really wanted to be.

Ubermonkey says you can probably find a better book which covers this topic in a way which does it justice.
