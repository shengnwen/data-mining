I bought this book after using the Girlfriend's Guide to Baby Gear.  I was impressed with the book.  As a first time mom, the guide was great in a sea of baby items that I didn't have much of a clue about.  Saved me lots of time and money.

I bought this book used with the expectation that it would be in the same vein as the baby gear guide.  I want my $6 and my time back.  What a monumental waste of trees and time.  This book was so bad that I threw it away-didn't even make the Goodwill pile.  She denegrates men to the point you wonder if she's either a hard-core, man-hating lesbian or has *that* terrible of a marriage.  With comments like "of course you'll be the only one watching the baby!  Your hubby will be so clueless that you'll want to snatch the baby from him before he can harm it!"  It is heavily laced with mom martyrdome.  No thanks.   

Do not waste your money on this book
