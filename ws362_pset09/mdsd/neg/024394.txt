I wanted to like this book more than I did, but I just found a lot of it to be, like, lame! Savan has some good points but she repeats herself so much, drowning every sentence in 'pop words' that offset other 'pop words' reminding her of even more 'pop words', that large parts of the book are a convoluted mess!
Much of the ground has been covered elsewhere, in greater detail, and in less headache-inducing style!
I did find some interesting nuggets, but had to skim through a lot of tedious material to get there. Fans of language should check it out if they're curious. People who can do without socio-political commentary should skip it
