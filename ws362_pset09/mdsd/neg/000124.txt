The book provides a lot of really useful information about Southwest Air. The problem is that the 'relational coordination' construct has no theory. Southwest is successful for lots of reasons from a clearly defined product, well specified work, good structure, a focus on 'set-up' time (which is what Toyota excells at)...all of these are useful specifics. But when the concept/construct of 'relational coordination' is developed all those situational details are stripped away. The result of this are 10 well described but abstracted practices that hold little value in guiding what a firm should do first/next.
