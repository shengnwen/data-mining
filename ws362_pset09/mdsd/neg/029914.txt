I've found this book to be poorly documented, full of unsuported radicle claims and circular arguments. Souri makes no effort to explain what he calls Japan's inherent military and industrial suporiority afer other Asian nations but meerly accepts it as an axim and proceeds to explain it. Add to this a translation that fills to book with convoluted sentances that don't seem to fit well where they are and I found it to be an unplesent experience.
