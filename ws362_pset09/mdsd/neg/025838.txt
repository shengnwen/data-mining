What a disappointment. I've read everything published by Ms. Picoult and loved nearly all of it until this book. She fails to create a plausible picture of the factors compelling Em to be desperately suicidal, and why-oh-why wouldn't Chris try to get the woman he loves help? -- that is help to live, not to die? Unlike Picoult's usual work, The Pact is awkward and slow-moving, and the plot is full of holes. Too bad; not up to Picoult's standards.
