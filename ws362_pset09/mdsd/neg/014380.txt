As a long time mathematics tutor and teacher I know this book very well. I don't think the material is presented or explained in a way that is especially helpful for young people. As a tutor I have to constantly reintroduce the topic and/or try to stay ahead of the student's class. Beyond that, the students are asked to do only the simplest of proofs. Additionally, a new topic will be introduced and then no problems appear in the exercise portion of the section to help the student test and practice his or her understanding of the newly introduced topic (and of course, those problems invariably will show up on the chapter exam and the final). 

Moreover, I think the book just fails the kids. It seems to omit certain standard concepts by being "accessible" and undemanding of even the most minor critical thinking skills. I believe that both of these shortcomings will leave the student unprepared for the challenging problems on standardized tests and on college entrance exams. Not to mention any sort of subsequent advanced work in high school and college.  Another thing about the Larson book is that the answers to many of the problems are so arithmetically peculiar that the student has no feeling that maybe they actually got the right answer. Good problems reassure the student that they are on the right track. Also, once a new concept or definition is introduced it is never repeated.

Overall, I think that the more capable students will be shortchanged and misled into thinking that they know more than they actually do and the less capable student might pass geometry but will perform poorly on college entrance exams and be unable to successfully progress in mathematics if they need to do so.
