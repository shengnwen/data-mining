Don't be fooled by the title of this cookbook.  First, it is filled with exotic and gourmet, not to mention expensive, recipies.  The choice of ingredients might be fine if you live in New York or San Francisco, but here in northern Wisconsin many ingredients just aren't available.  (And if they were, would you fix squab or fried rabbit for Tuesday night dinner for your family?)

A second disappointment is the copious use of butter, oil and heavy cream.

This is the first time I've ever been so disappointed in a book I ordered that I will be returning it
