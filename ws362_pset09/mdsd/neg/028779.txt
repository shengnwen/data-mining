The title and premise of this book is to put Family First. Yet I just read an interview with Dr Phil in one of the major national woman's magazines. He says - very proudly - that in all the years of their marriage he has only spent a day or two with his wife's sister and her family because he prefers to stay home and let his wife visit on her own. He feels time with them is wasted and he put his foot down from the very start of their relationship that he would not visit them. So, that is putting family first??? How incredibly sad for his wife, her sister and all their children. The entire clan has suffered because of his attitude. And what a shame that he sells this attitude as good advice
