If you have no experience in any market, this book is for you.  Takes 2 hours to read/skim.  I learned a little about the background of commodities.  Book is also annoying to read because of it's unorthodox style of font (block lettering), strange page layout (Sentences are sometimes indented in a ladder-style, like poetry), and repeating of information.
