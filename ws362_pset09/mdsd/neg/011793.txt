I agree with the comments by Prolific Reader...it's time to get away from the old asylum and find a new story line. Based on the epilogue, it sounds like that's not going to happen.

I also agree that almost everyone in the book acted dumb: The cops trying to get Cole, Cole for never pointing out to Eve (or resenting) that she cost him his house, money, job and car, and Eve and Kristi for making stupid decisions.

Her plots, characters, and general writing were better before she started on this continuing series about the asylum. One problem is the books come out a year apart and the last one wasn't memorable enough for me to immediately relate to all the backstory she put in Absolute Fear
