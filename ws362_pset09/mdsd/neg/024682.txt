When I read this book several years ago, I had no idea what I was getting into.  I had seen the movie, and although I didn't love it, the movie was ok, and a book is always supposed to be better than the movie.  At first the book seemed merely very unlikely.  Then as I continued reading I began to feel a little uncomfortable with certain characters.  The one friend who was supposedly a compulsive eater sounded no different than me, and I am not even considered chubby.  The one new girlfriend was disgusting, not only in what she did, but in how she lived her life.  The only saving grace to the entire book was the general plot.  Although very unbelievable, it was also very satisfying to see these men get what they deserved in life, but honestly the women did not deserve the satisfaction they experienced from the men's downfalls.  Thank goodness I had just borrowed the book from the library and not bought it
