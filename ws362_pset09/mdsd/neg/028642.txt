i just bought this book.  i wouldn't say it's crap, but it isn't worth much. first, the images aren't as luminous as ingres actual paintings, at all. whoever put the images in this book is an idiot because almost every piece has been significantly cropped. what made ingres especially interesting were his compositions. it's very hard to admire his compositions WHEN THEY'RE CUT OFF! the figures skin doesn't glow, many of his most important pieces aren't in color or are very shrunken down (not even 1/4 of a page). plus, there's so much bullcrap written in this book and there really aren't many color plates!  this book is HUGE (fat)-the only book i have that's larger is a catalogue from the morandi museum in bologna. however, there's probably fewer color plates in this book than many I own HALF that size. there's several drawings, which are excellent, but it's really easy to find books of his drawings for a fraction of the price. 

this book isn't horrible, but i'm especially frustrated with having spent over $200 last week on sargent books and this one, and both have lousy quality images, very few that one could learn from. i'm a painter, so when i look at these books, i look for technique, skill, good quality, clear images. this book, in addition to the sargent 3 volume portrait series, seriously lack images that one could learn anything from.
