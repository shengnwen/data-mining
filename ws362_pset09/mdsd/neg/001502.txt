There's no real new ground breaking stuff here.  The wit and eloquence mask work that is rather shallow.  While the language is first rate and provocative, a careful analysis of the factual information presented shows a glaring omission of so many more facts that most of his premises are undermined when viewed in a larger, more realistic context.  

The best way to put this in perspective is that this author is  a black man from poor, humble beginnings who's trying to make a case for how it is impossible for blacks to succeed in the very society that has made him into the wildly successful multimillionaire, author, speaker, professor, radio personality he is today.

And the reason is the usual cop-out: it's someone else's fault.

Two stars for wonderful use of language
