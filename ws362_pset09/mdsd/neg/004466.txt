I would much rather be considered nice and earn my way through this world the way I am.  Being myself in the business arena has worked well for me thus far, and I don't care if the trend is to deviate from feminity.  I think we should respect everyone, and not propegate the evolution of a sexless society.  All in all, I would much rather be a nice person and have people like me than be a b%tch with a nice office.  People remember you by how you made them feel, not by how much money or power you had
