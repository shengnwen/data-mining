As an electronics engineer, responsible for education at university level, I was a bit disappointed after reading the book. From theoretical/technical point of view, the book starts at a very basic level. For instance phase cancellation and definition of decibels. I did not find anything that was really explained in depth. As far as I can understand, the book is not intended for technicians or engineers dealing with design and analysis of electronic music systems. 

On the other hand, musicians with no technical background that will mainly buy and use a synthesizer can probably find some useful information about common technical terms and buzzwords. However, from my point of view, I am not convinced this book really is The Ultimate Reference for Sound Design.
