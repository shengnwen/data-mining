A compilation of few interesting ideas and very hard to see illustrations. Poor quality reproductions.  No measurements at all.  Furthermore the contact information in the back was not cross-referenced with the designs & listed no phone or web contact, just mailing addresses.  Seems like the authors took the cheap and easy way out with a good idea.  

Taunton Press's "The Cabin" is a much more inspiring & informational book.

I do not recommend this book.
