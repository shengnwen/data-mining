It is odd, and perhaps a bit sad, that John Irving has become or became American's literary sweetheart.  Given his narrative concerns, it would seem a wide readership would have never been his fate.  For one, he is fixated on the mutilation of the human body.  This mania with mutilation borders on the near fantastic in The World According to Garp. And more disturbingly still, is it completely infiltrates the narrative's sense of sexuality.  For the narrator of Garp, sex and bodily mutilation are nearly synonymous.  And what is the purpose of this overall fixation with the lopping off of limbs and the act of sex?  In The World According to Garp, sex is not viewed as a healthy or even human impulse.  It is only when the major characters divest themselves of lust, or sexual activity, that they extricate themselves from most of their mental woes.  It's a grim vision.  It is hard to envision flocks of readers gobbling this book in the late 70's and early 80's and viewing it as the great voice of our (or their) time.  The novel is also written on a high level of generality.  No reader should expect to plumb very deeply into the human condition in this novel.  Like Garp's writing itself, Irving's prose is witty and salacious, but never really gives the reader any serious human dilemma to masticate and digest.  There is something to chew, but it is light fare.
