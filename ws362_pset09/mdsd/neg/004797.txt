I have read and enjoyed all over Mr. Lowry's books and I was eagerly anticipating his newest collection of thoughts and writings.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by his latest effort.  It seems like he has nothing new to say about traditional budo and instead is reaching further into the esoteric and rehashing with excrutiating minutia what he has already written in previous books.  For example, the chapter about "what is in a name" just tells us about the convoluted origins of Musashi's various surnames.  It seems like Mr. Lowry has exhausted all insights into the man's life and contributions to budo and is now latching onto the potential signifiances of his very very long name.  

With that said, there are some interesting chapters in this otherwise tortuous book.  The chapter on "Nakaima" or the eternal present is classical Lowry as he explains the link between past, present and future in the continuing lineage and legacy that defines traditional martial arts.

All and all I would recommend that the reader browse this book for the highlights at a bookstore.  It is not worth buying and keeping on the bookshelf for future reference and re-reading.
