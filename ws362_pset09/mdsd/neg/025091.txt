I picked up this book because of Rodale's reputation for excellence. However, this one's a real disappointment. The recipes are not low-carb  and  the nutritional data doesn't add up correctly for many of them.  And, it's hardly smart - since when is half a bagel a &quot;smart&quot; choice? Or half a cookie? And who can eat half? That's like giving half a cigarette to a chain smoker and calling it a &quot;smart choice&quot;.  No- pass on this one. There are so many really good choices now, that  purchasing this one would not be very &quot;smart&quot;.  I would suggest Dr. Atkins and the Drs. Eades programs, that  are backed by research, clinical documentation and  a great track record for success
