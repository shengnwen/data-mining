Someone wanted to make a buck without coming up with a new book, and I confess I bit.  OUCH! The short stories in this book are all cute, but I couldn't find one I didn't recognize: they are taken from the "oral histories" collected in the regular series, so if you are an avid fan, you have read these already. Do we really need all the "yarns" in one place?  I think they add flavor to the mysteries, and are just fluff on their own. (Supposedly there is one short that is original, but it blends right in!
