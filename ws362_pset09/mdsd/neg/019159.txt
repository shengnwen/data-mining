I believe in a lot of the topics in the book and Julie Soskin did a nice job introducing every topic there is. It is nicely layed out, but VERY brief and corny. For example, one of the eight questions for Rating your pet's ESP is Does your dog howl or hide during a seance or other psychic happening? I was excited to go through this book, but ended up extremely disappointed. The worst part is I lost the receipt and can't take it back
