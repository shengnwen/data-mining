Actually, I would give this "book" NO STARS, but there's no tab for that.
Let's begin with the title to Chapter 29: "Who Needs N*ggers?". I asterisked that so it wouldn't get edited out - he of course spells it out. That should pretty much wrap up the essence of this fabulistic screed of pseudoscience, limp-wristed white racism, anti-semitism and a surprising anti-Christianity. This epistle to the mindless is at least written so that its target audience can read it: it is an endless series of single paragraphs. I am presuming this is so it can be read with one's finger pointing out each word, and thankfully for that same audience there aren't any big words, either. 

If, as a previous "reviewer" said this is "the second greatest book ever written", obviously that Dick and Jane reader was the only other book they ever read - and slowly at that. What "white man's bible" seems to mean - not to give away anything important - is that the existing bible is too "polluted" with Jews. What a briliantly racist revelation! Or is that Revelation? The only other major criticism is that the paper is too stiff to replace that Sears catalog that's hanging in the outhouse..
