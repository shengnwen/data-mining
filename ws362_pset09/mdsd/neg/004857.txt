This is not a children's book at all. The pictures could be upseting, there is not story behind it, the language is not what you want your kids to learn at an early age or ever! I have never read this author before, but I will certainly won't do it after this book. I am glad I did not buy it, my son picked it out at the library misled by the front picture.
