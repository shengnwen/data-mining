This book thinks it will be useful to computer programmers (experienced practitioners as they call them), unfortunately it is not. Apart from the numerous errors, the authors use a notation that will be unfamiliar to most programmers. The code samples are a joke (of which there are only a few). The algorithms they describe are not practical and it would take a lot more work to implement code you'd want to use in a real application based on the author's descriptions. I wish there were a geometry book that could combine theory (using a familiar notation) and practical tips and hints plus real code. I know how difficult it is to write a book and they are to be commended on the intention and scope of material they cover. It would do the community a great service if the authors could publish a second edition, taking into account some of these criticisms (As an example of a book that combines practical as well as theoretical knowledge, look at Numerical Recipes by Press et al). In its current state the book is really just a book on geometry
