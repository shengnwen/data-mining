To be perfectly frank, I cannot help wondering whether the fifty people who rated this book five stars and called it the best they'd ever read, read the same book as I did.

I had to force myself to even finish it, and I've always liked Sinclair and the resolution of his arc in 'War Without End'. The story offers neither surprises nor tension, the romantic subplot seems forced, even distracting, as far as Sinclair's character development is concerned. What's more, for me Drennan's take on the events on Minbar doesn't even satisfactory fill the blank between the end of S1 and Sinclair's reappearance in S3; rather it makes it harder to connect the Sinclair at the end of the book with the man in 'War Without End'.    

The style is flat and uninspired, the story-telling lacks B5's trademark subtlety, twists and emotional impact: every thought and emotion is spelled out in excruciating detail; the repetitions are endless: e.g., Sinclair's "the arrow that springs from the bow" metaphor is horribly overused in a way that doesn't even make sense.

MJS describes his wife as 'relentlessly logical' in his introduction, he also mentions 'late-night conversations, too many to number'. One wonders if the book might not have been better if its author had not been in such close association with B5's creator and had focused a little more on story-telling instead of attempting to logically tie up each and every loose thread. 

If not for the fact that this is Drennan's first novel, it would have been one star.
