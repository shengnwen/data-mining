You'll need Viagra to get up to speed for the exam after reading this one. I am an MCSE, CCNA and a technical writer for several leading tech rags, and I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. The author spends more time trying to &quot;make it interesting&quot; than giving you useful info that you can actually use. Example: During the discussion on Site Links the author fails to inform you that if you plan to use SMTP to perform directory replication that DCs need to be in different domains and in different sites. This minor oversight could have a huge impact both on the exam and in the real world. Another example is the complete lack of a discussion on how the tombstone setting of directory objects affects the effective shelf life of your backups. Hello???? It's like Sybex just followed the bare minimum in order to call this thing a study guide. The software is ok, but the free practice exams were weak as expected. I like books that I can keep as reference material after I read them. The only thing you will use this one for is lining your garbage can. Don't waste your time with this dribble. Get a real book
