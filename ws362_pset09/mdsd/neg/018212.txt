This book is not for firefighter's or fire officer's. This title is very misleading. A more appropriate title would be, Human Resource Managers Manual. This book was put on my departments Lt. and Capt. promotional test strictly by its deceiving title. I asked our Chief to read it and he agreed that it is horrible. I will never read another book or article by Steven T. Edwards
