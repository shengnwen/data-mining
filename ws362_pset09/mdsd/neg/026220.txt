I bought this book because I love making miniature foods.  My major problem with this book is that on the inside there are only a few color photos and the rest of the book is pretty dull to look at.  The recipes seem okay but just the dull look of the pages make it pretty hard to get inspired to try any of these recipes.  I recommend just finding it at a library and not spending any money on it.  I have a book called "Finger Food" by Katharine Gasparini.  It has more savory recipes but there is a section for sweets.  This book is also fully photographed
