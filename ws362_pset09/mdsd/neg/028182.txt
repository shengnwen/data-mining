A urologist by training, Dr. Silber is not trained as a reproductive endocrinologist, making his techniques very technology oriented as he is not trained in reproduction, only reproduction technologies.  He would do better to stop promoting technology as the answer to reproduction (quite a money-maker for the doctors involved) and stick to doing reversing vasectomies as he was trained to do.  While he offers alot of good technical info the book is utterly lacking in medical and surgical treatment options, something he apparently doesn't believe in.  The medical evidence points to better results and better health for mother and babies when medical/surgical intervention is used--lower reimbursement but much better for everyone involved except centers that promote IVF and tech based medicine
