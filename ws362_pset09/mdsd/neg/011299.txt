Well, truth be told, I am a die hard Barbara Michaels fan (aka. Elizabeth Peters).  I exausted my Barbara books and decided to switch to one of her Elizabeth Peters novels.  Since I didn't want to get into a whole series like the Peabody series or what not, I picked this book. 
   What a let down!!!    OK, it kept my intrest and wasen't a total waste of time, but the story was predictable from the middle of the book.  Maybe even the beginning. Normaly when I read one of her books I feverishly tear through the last 20 pages or so.  Yeah, this one contained the quintessential explination and the "wrap up", but there was no basis to it.  I came to the last page and thought  THATS IT, you gotta be kidding me.
