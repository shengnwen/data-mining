This work is overrated.  It does importantly remind Christians to stay on task as the Church.  However, there are serious problems in its construction.  Hauerwas has recited ideas, and Willimon has written them down.  The scholarship behind the work is weak; the wording is often sweeping, generalized, and misrepresentative -- particularly in the condemnations of Paul Tillich and H. Richard Niebuhr.  Niebuhr particularly spoke out against confusing our Christian commitment with nationalism, but Hauerwas &amp; Willimon present him as someone who cannot distinguish the Gospel from the world.  Take their assessment of other theologians with a serious grain of salt
