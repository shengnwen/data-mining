I'm not dissing what the woman is saying about teaching reading but when a person truly has dyslexia, it is a neurological disorder.  No one can teach it to you and that's what this woman is stating.  Where's the research?  Does the National Association of Dyslexia back her on this?  I've emailed them about her quote and they say they have no research to validate her claim.  Don't believe everything you read, no matter how badly you want to believe.  People who are dyslexic have to bust their buns to figure out how to read
