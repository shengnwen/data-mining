I dunno, I read all these raves and wonder if everyone read the same book I did!

The first story about Tully Mars is terrific, the second about a small town football team is pretty good, then...the book falls apart with repetitive filler material.

Stories that are honest or heartfelt doesn't mean much if all the characters feel the same....and WAY too much detail.

So, Read the first two stories, then put it down, you won't miss anything....probably just needed enough pages to justify a book rather than a short story or two in a magazine.

For the record: I am a moderate fan of Jimmy Buffetts music, his best stuff is legendary, but I am not a fan of every single song
