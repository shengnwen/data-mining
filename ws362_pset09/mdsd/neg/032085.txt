I'll agree with some the other reviewers that this book has a lot of valuable information, especially relating to business valuation techniques and contracts and forms.  But it's almost too detailed!  If you are a first-time buyer and want to get an overview of the process and increase your comfort level, it's practically worthless.  In fact, it's worse than that...it will probably scare you away.  It's also very densely written and dry in some parts...so it could bore you away too!  I'm a first time buyer, and that was my experience -- I absolutely could not get through this book.  Then I went on to read Smorenburg, and &quot;Mancuso's Small Business Basics&quot; and things became much clearer.  I wish I had started with one of these other books.  Then, when you want detailed checklists, legal language, and valuation formulas, turn back to this book (although you'll probably want to turn to an attorney and accountant first)
