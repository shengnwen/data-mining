I bought this book based on reading others' reviews of how great it was, how the author's storyteling "pulls you in from the start & never lets you go." Others gave the impression that it was helpful to those going through a difficult time.
I have to say - I don't get it. It was very short (I read it in less than an hour) and kind of pointless. The basic point of the story is that God is a mystery, and we don't always know why he lets certain events happen. Yeah, I get it already. Have since I was little. I can't believe I spent $10 for this book.
