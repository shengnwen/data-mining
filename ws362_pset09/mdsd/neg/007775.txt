Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again
