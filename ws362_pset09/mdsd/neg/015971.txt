Plot summary; magic girls + monsters + school girl outfits, basically all you need to know.

This is just a review for volume one, not the entire manga series.  For those who are not aware the anime and the manga for "Mai-Hime" are almost totally different so if you're a fan of the the series I'd definitely say check out the manga as well for a different perspective on their world.  There's a lot more fan service...a lot more...  I'm a sucker for that stuff so I'm not complaining but be warned those of you who are turned off by it.  

At this point I'm really not that into the story and it has been my interest in how the manga and anime differ and all the pretty pictures that kept me turning the pages.  My friends have told me it is quite good but unfortunately based on volume one I cannot say I would recommend this to anyone except hardcore Mai Hime fans and probably people who enjoyed Ikkitousen.  Hopefully things will change with volume two
