I have taken yoga classes for years and it is nice to see the medical doctor values such a art to help back pain suffers.This book is okay for someone new to yoga and has back pain but it is over 10 years old. needs to be updated. I recommend other up to date books on the market today that shows the reader all forms of exercies to use to over come back pain
