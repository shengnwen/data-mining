I purchased this book because I am interested in environmental issues and I saw a favorable newspaper review.  I found Ms. Royte's style so rambling, long-winded, and anecdotal that it was difficult to stay focussed for the kernels of real information that occasionally popped up.  And now I feel badly for the energy wasted and trees harvested on account of my purchase.
