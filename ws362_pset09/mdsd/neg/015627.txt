I got through most of this book before giving up. My 30-second review: Having a Ph.D. might get you a book contract, but it sure doesn't make you any of the following: rigorous, searching, expert, or wise. There's no  command of the youth development lit here; there's no comprehensive  understanding of the lives of young people today; and there are few  sentences and paragraphs that don't beg for good editing! What's here?  Generalities and platitudes abundant. Don't waste your time as I did. There  are many better books out there
