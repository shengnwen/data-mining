Are you looking for a book that you can sit down with for three weeks and try to get through just to learn what you could have learned from any other book on the same subject? This is the book for you! Boring and SO long-winded. It doesn't tell you anything more than any other book on shyness. I would not recommend this book as a self-help book on shyness. I would, however, whole-heartedly recommend this for anyone suffering from insomnia
