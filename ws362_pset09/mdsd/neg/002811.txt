This book seemed pretty much like a fairytale, the reason it is not accepted by the scientific community is because these experiements are full of faults.  For a theory to stand the test of time and be proven, it must be attacked from every angle.  These people did basic experiments giving one simple answer; plants respond to a stimuli.  They just throw out a solution as to what must have caused that stimuli and never found the real reason.  Futher experimentation must be conducted from all angles if these ideas are to be accepted as fact. Please further your reading into chemistry/biology and physics to understand why or why not these theories are correct/incorrect
