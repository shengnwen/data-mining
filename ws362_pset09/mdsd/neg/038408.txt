I turn to these reviews to help me decide on a purchase.  Unfortunately, in this case, the reviews are almost worthless because they are obvious plugs by the publisher, author or their friends.  There are even two identical reviews back to back.  This system needs some screening to make reviews of these types of products relevant and not self-serving hype
