This is my first Nick Hornby read and I was very tempted to make it my last.  I had a really hard time getting through it.  I usually read a book straight through in 2-3 days and can't wait to read them at any free moment.  But, I had to force myself to get through this one.  The book didn't flow very well and seemed to skip all over the place.  

Seeing negative reviews from people who have read his other books has helped me decide to give Hornby another chance.  

I wouldn't recommend this book
