My daughters and I love the book Dragonology. We also love the handbook. So we were thrilled when this kit came up!  But what a disapointement!!!! The book is tiny (less than 3" X 3"), softcover and no good spells in it.  The talisman is ok. The two other things this kit includes are dragon powder and a sliding cardboard thing to translate the dragon alphabet. THAT'S IT!!! Save your money for another book in this amazing series but the kit is NOT WORTH IT!
