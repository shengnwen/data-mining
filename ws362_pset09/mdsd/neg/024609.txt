This book is one of the worst cases of feminist propaganda and male bashing that I have ever had the chance to review.  This book is loaded with problems that are present in society and the author seems to make sure that it is blamed on sports and men who participate in sports.  If you where looking for a well balanced text on sports look else where because you will find no other opinion but the authors and the feminist in this book.  The major reason that I do not like this book is because it blames men for everything that is wrong and makes sports out to be just this real evil event we participate in.  Much of the information in this book is dated as well with much of the case studies done primarily in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, which makes much of the information irrelevant.  It ignores any other point of view and is completely biased and is a dishonest book that passes its information off as absolutes but rarely backs up any of its claims.  This is a Feminist propaganda book plain and simple and should not be considered anything else
