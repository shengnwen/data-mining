I have always been a fan of Zig, that is until this book. What ever happened to Zig's own Network Marketing Company? That's right it went under. Not even the marketing power of his name could save it and now he wants to tell you how to build a solid business? Zig is a great sales trainer and motivator but it's evident from this book that he didn't have much hands on experience in this business. At one point he says that you should be proud of being in the &quot;sale profession&quot; and then in another part he says the Network Marketing isn't about sales. Network Marketing is a legitimate business not a get rich quick scheme. Unfortunately too many people sell it as the latter and this time Zig goes along. As a seven figure earner myself I would recommend other sources like Leaders Club, for honest information about what it takes to really make it big in this business. If you want a great Ziglar book get, &quot;5 Steps to Successful Selling.&quot
