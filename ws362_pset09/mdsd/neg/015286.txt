I used to love all the different books written by this author, whether she was writing as Amanda Quick, Jayne Anne Krentz or Jayne Castle.  Now they are all so dull - almost over-detailed.  This book is no different.  While the premis of &quot;para-psychology&quot; could have been interesting the language developed by the author to describe the different types of psychics is confusing and over-used.  I found myself skipping huge chunks of this book just to get to the point of the conversation.  Don't waste your money -borrow it if you are a die hard fan or wait for it at the local library.  I only gave it one star because her heros are usually the strong, silent type - a personal favorite of mine
