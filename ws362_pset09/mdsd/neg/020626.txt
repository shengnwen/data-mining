Two stars because it's readable, but there's little here that adds to Gardner's biography.
 Any admirer of John Gardner who doesn't get that he was emotionally scary has missed something in the novels and may want to read this self-absorbed book, but Gardner fans may find themselves increasingly annoyed with Thornton to the point of nitpicking: looking for flaws such as the many redundancies, the failure to make either Susquehanna or Binghamton seem like real places (Gardner did Binghamton with a single phrase: "a beautiful old lady with her teeth knocked out." ) the freehand with which she condemns almost everybody else with close personal ties to Gardner, including his parents and his ex-wives, even the variations in time-length between the hospital scene at the opening of the book and its reprise near the end. 
To some of us Gardner remains a literary giant, using his erudition as a literary tool in much the same way Conrad used the sea, and with the same meticulous attention to language. Books like this one remain peripheral.
