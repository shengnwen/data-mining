I consider myself an intermediate level crocheter and I really like a lot of the designs in this book.  However, I made the &quot;Learn to Crochet Afghan&quot; and found A LOT of mistakes in the instructions.  Even some of the basic stitch directions have typos.  I'm hesitant to start another project for fear of having to start over due to pattern mistakes
