while the history of Roger Bacon was interesting and the  other historic figures(Aristotle, Soccrates, etal) I was expecting more about the actual manuscript and how it was deciphered and those around that quest. Instead the book spends over 2/3s relating stories of how various famous figures interacted, political climates and philosophies. This is nice background but it could have been shortened, in this reader's humble opinion.  
If you want to know more about the Manuscript, look to another book.
