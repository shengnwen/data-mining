I love Star Trek, OK?  This should have been a really great book, since there are so many important lessons in the series.  But Marinaccio completely misses many important lessons, in my opinion, and gets several other lessons mixed up, and generally dilutes whatever lessons remain to the point of vapidity with his self-indulgence and self-absorption.  Sorry, Dave, but not everything in Star Trek relates to some insignificant detail of your small little life in a Marketing company.

Not to mention that the book stops short.  "I think there's a new series called DS9 or something, I'll have to keep an eye on that."  Seriously, he says that.  To me, watching the later series greatly expanded the "lessons that needed to be learned".

I threw this book away in disgust after reading it.  Really.  Lierally threw it in the trash.  It was that bad, and I didn't want to be embarrassed by having it sit on the shelf as my complete DVD collections of all the Star Trek TV series.

Please do NOT buy this book.  It's really HORRIBLY STUPID
