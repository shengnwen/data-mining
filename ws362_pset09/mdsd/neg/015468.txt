I was not satisfied with this book after having read Paul Benzequin's book about the same subject.  More time is spent
on the court trial of the owners than necesary.  Very little time is spent on the treatment and identification of the victims.  What about Dotty Myles, Shirley Freeman and Jacob Slate to name three of the victims that were treated in hospitals?  What about the index card system that volunteers set up to help identify victims that were mentioned in Mr. Benzequins book?

If someone wants to choose between Mr. Benequin's book about the fire and this book they should read Mr. Benzequin's book!
