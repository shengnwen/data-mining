I've enjoyed John Kotter's work in the past. I've found his work useful and effective. However I learned nothing new from this book. The story line is poor and the approach outlined in the narrative to effective change management does not provide any better or new approach.

I'd suggest Stephen Denning's books on business narrative (eg the Springboard) for those who are looking for a narrative-based or alternative approach to facilitate change
