Mr. Reichheld has impressive credentials and I respect his intentions, yet in this book he recommends using poorly-developed surveys to understand customer or employee loyalty.  That's extremely misleading!  That process and the results gained will only mislead management and will not truly indicate how loyal customers or employees really are.  The only true way to understand and manage customer or employee loyalty is to talk to them and let them express their own thoughts! Mr. Reichheld has missed the mark
