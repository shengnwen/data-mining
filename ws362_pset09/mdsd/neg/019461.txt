A pathetically boring book. It just carries rhetorical dialogue between the two main characters & never really develops the main story well. The bickering between Kerry & Silver becomes boring drivel & is endless. The Firestorm, & how it's carried off, remains mostly a mystery hidden away. There's a devious North Korean who remains faceless and is never developed. The author tries to save it with a twist toward the end, but by that time you're so bored it's anti-climatic and I didn't care. The best thing about the book is it's cover. Bottom line? Save your money, unless you have trouble sleeping, that is.
