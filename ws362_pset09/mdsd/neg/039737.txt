Gray matters is disappointing in many respects.  First, the cartooning is crude and not up to standards set by syndicated strips.  Second, there's not a single laugh in the whole book -- this is no Dilbert.  Third, the advice is common sense to the point of being patronizing -- it features such brilliant insights as "listen to people."  Wow, who'd ever think of doing that?  Finally, several character actions are highly unethical and could get you in hot water if you did the same, such as breaking into a co-worker's computer, or moonlighting without your boss's knowledge at a customer company strictly to get inside information.  You want to talk lawsuit?  Read "The Dilbert Principle" instead -- its insights are hilarious and telling
