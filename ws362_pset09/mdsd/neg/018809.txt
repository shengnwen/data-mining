As a rule, I'll give a book 50 pages to get interesting. After that, I'll put it down.

I went to 75 with this book and it still disappointed. 

It was excessively laden with detail and not light reading. Other documentaries (notably those by Iris Chang) have given a lot of historical detail and yet still were interesting and easy to read.

I've not suitable alternatives to suggest, but I know that at least one other book has been written that has been as boring as this one. And that's not because I've found that book, but because I know that no other book can be as boring as this one was
