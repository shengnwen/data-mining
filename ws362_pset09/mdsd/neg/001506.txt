I admire Dr. Virtue and her Healing with the Angel cards are absolutely incredible.  But when I purchased this tape, I expected something a little more educational.  

The message I took from this is that if you pray and visualize, your negative karma can be taken away.  It seems like the meditation just focuses on and repeats that message, which I found overly simplistic.  

The tape is ok for neophytes -- but if you're looking for something with a little more meat, try some of her other materials.  Even for neophytes, I would highly recommend Marianne Williamson's Return to Love tape over this one.
