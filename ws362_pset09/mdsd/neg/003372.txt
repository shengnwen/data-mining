First of all there is no such word in Websters and I do agree with some of the other reviewers.  I did read Blindsighted and found much repeated word for word from that.  The people in charge of solving this do indeed have too too many personal problems and not enough swapping of information.  When the doc hears something, she doesn't know what they are talking about as no information was given her by the detectives.   After all she was at the scene of most the crimes and should have been given a better handle on it.    Then I hate the way the perps get away with stuff right under the noses of the surveilance.  This author sure leaves you dangling.
