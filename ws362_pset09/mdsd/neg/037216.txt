I fell in love with the art work of the Miss Spider books and bought a few for my son.  When we saw this book at the library I figured it was another good book in the series.  I was wrong.  The content of this book is definately not aimed at children.  It hints at intimacy that young children don't need to be exposed to and some of the pictures are rather scary.  I stopped halfway through the book, noticing some of the pictures.  They could very likely give a child nightmares.  Children do not need to be exposed to this content and violence depicted in the story.  Let's keep them young a little while longer yet please
