I thought this book was going to be a wonderful improvement on an 800 year old ideal, modernizing it to fit a less hostile and disgusting world. I was wrong. If you're against republicans and war, this book will infuriate you like it has done to me. Don't pick it up if your morals are not Christian conservative, do yourself a favor and find another mentor. I'd recommend anything by Gandhi or the Dalai Lama. 

I give this book two stars only because the author presents his viewpoint well enough to be useful to those that agree with him. The rest of us were at a loss picking up this book
