I did not enjoy this book as much as other Elvis biographies that I have read. It is simply a hash of a number a biographies written over the years by the people surrounding him and hashed together by a writer -a good one at that, but at what -700 plus pages long it seemed to actually reveal less than some of the more personal, shorter and even judgemental books around. The Elvis biographies I personally liked best and would reccommend are "Elvis and Gladys" and "Child Bride" as well as Alanna Nash's book on the Colonel.. Strangely those were not included as the source for this book. Therefore I think it's wrong to call it definitive as has been in previous reviews. It's not bad but I don't think it's the best bio -even if others says so
