Although I enjoyed the prequel, Metropolitan, this book made me want to throw it across the room about half-way through.  I found myself skimming whole sections of the book that described the various battles and politics  of the book, when the important questions go completely unanswered. The  author keeps mentioning the Shield and the Immortals, but we must wait  until volume 20 to find out the answers to all the mysteries he presents.   This book is obviously a filler while he writes the next sequel.  Don't  bother
