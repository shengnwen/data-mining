Feiler's book is entertaining at times and tiresome at others. The entertaining parts are the stories he tells about his experiences; however, his attempt to analyze Japan sound too much like a regurgitation of other books that purport to introduce Japanese culture. 

As others have pointed out, the information is quite dated and Japanese high schools have changed greatly. It suffers also from some rather curious translations, which mystify rather than clarify. I'm not sure I'd call shiso "mint" or edible chrysanthemum "a bright yellow daisy". Even more mysterious is how he manages to translate "higaisha" as "one who receives pressure" when the characters literally mean "receiving injury person". A much better translation is "victim", and in fact Japan's "victim consciousness" is an important theme in how they understand WWII. James Orr's book "Victim as Hero" explores this theme carefully.

If you're interested in finding out about Japanese culture, read something by a trained anthropologist. If you're interested in someone's experiences in Japan in the late 1980s then parts of this book will serve you well
