Sorry, but I really hated this pretentious, boring, and useless exercise in academic masturbation. It's all just an excuse for the writer to drone on and on about her favorite books. A lackluster lesson in literary snobbery, this lifeless thesis paper includes iffy interpretations of dry excerpts, unhelpful writing hints, and zero sense of humor or drama. If you don't love the same books, stories, and writers that Francine Prose loves, you're pretty much screwed. As a published writer myself, I often check out writing books for inspiration. This is one of the worst. I prefer something lighter, more engaging and motivational to light a fire under me. I like Ray Bradbury's book, with its infectious boyish enthusiasm, and the terrific book about publishing, "The Forrest for the Trees" (the first half is inspiring, but the second half a little depressing.) Either way, skip this yawn-fest
