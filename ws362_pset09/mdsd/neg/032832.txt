I was very excited about 'Victim in Victoria Station' and could not wait to get started.  However, I was soon disappointed.  The reason for Alan not being there was very contrived and I cannot imagine anyone rushing off to  keep an appointment after her experience on the train. There were too many  characters in the office to keep track of, especially since they were not  very relevant to the story.  The murders and motives are never explained,  yet we are taken ad nauseam through endless (fruitless?) late night  searches.  Not one of the best in the series. Missed the hats as well,  although I did enjoy the red one near the beginning
