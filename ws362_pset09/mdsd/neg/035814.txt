This poorly researched book of straight up fabrications and quotes taken out of context has one thing right, some radical 60's leftists are trying to take over America, namely David Horowitz (former left-wing radical and Black Panther) and his band of 'former' socialists turned neos.

David doesn't even write this dribble, he just puts his name on it and hits the television machine and air waves.  If you've heard David talk about his book then you've heard all the best parts.  Media Matters ripped this book apart for its butchering of quotes by the likes of George Soros to state an arguement that could not exist without pure editorial manipulation.  It's been over a month and David has promised a 'full-blown' rebuttal to Media Matters findings but so far he's been unable to stretch the truth any further.  

Wake up sheeple, David and Poe are coming for your children
