This book is not what it says it is!!

While the title suggests that it's the real Sternberg and Williams book, in reality, it's a thin "study guide" for the real book from some clowns called "Cram 101".

I have nothing against study guides in general, but when a book is not identified as such, I have a big problem.  I was shipped something that I did not expect, and I had to then order the real thing and wait even longer for it to arrive.

What's worse, this book is a lousy study guide.  It's a sparse collection of glossary words for each chapter.  There is no outline or even a hint of the content of each chapter, just a list of generically defined keywords that someone thought were important to the relevant chapter, roughly presented in the order of appearance in the chapter.

I needed to study the concepts of the real book somehow, so I took those keywords and did a bunch of 'net searches to try to learn the topic.  This approach didn't work.  When I ordered and then received the real S+W book, I was able to compare the content of the chapter to the glossary words, and there were some important omissions and distortions.

This book should be banned - it's a waste of paper and the "authors" should be ashamed of themselves.  This "study guide" could have been cobbled together in an afternoon by a third rate college student.  If I turned in work that shoddy to one of my teachers, I would surely get a failing grade.

Amazon needs to change their representation of this book, since it suggests that you are getting a somehow bargain priced version of the real thing.  I honestly thought that it was a closeout version, remainder, or other bargain priced book and not some shabby attempt at a study guide for the real book.

AVOID THIS BOOK LIKE THE PLAGUE!
