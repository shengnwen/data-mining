Now, if I want to know about all the movies Cary Grant did, all I have to do is go on the internet and search. This book is mostly about the chronology of his movies and very little about who Cary Grant really was as a person. But one fact remains... behind all that elegance and charm, his personal life was a mess to say the least. But I will continue to watch his movies because, to this day, nobody ever equalled such elegance and magnetism on the screen.
