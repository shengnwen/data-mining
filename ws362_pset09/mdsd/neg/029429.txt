?The Storm Upon Us ? everything seems new and strange ? nothing seems certain ? masses of people are tangibly deprived of their claims to self-sufficiency ? this revolution is steadily creating the predicate for its own collapse ? the prospect of an economic or political cataclysm of unknown dimension ? .? These and similar claims are found on just the first two pages of the book. To be fair, Mr. Greider also references the ?great fortunes? thrown off by globalization and the fact that millions escape poverty, but right from the start you get the feeling that he is working backwards from his conclusions and choosing his rhetoric and his examples to sell his point of view. It?s almost as if Mr. Greider is suggesting that, now that the West has gone through the very sort of radical transformation he describes with shock and dismay, the rest of humanity should just stay where they are at while we in the industrialized world figure out if and how they should reach for the security and the lifestyle that we take for granted. If you are looking to validate an anti-globalization bias you already hold then this may be the book for you, but I think it?s fair to say that most readers would like to benefit from Mr. Greider?s considerable experience and expertise without having to interpret his selective or overly cynical presentation. In a nutshell, my problem with the book is not that it argues against globalization and is wrong, but that it is as committed to persuasion as it is to education. I chose not to finish the book and will look for a more neutral resource
