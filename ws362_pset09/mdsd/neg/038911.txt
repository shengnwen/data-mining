Better than Bloodlines, but still not that great.  Poor character development, and the fact that Conant has a tendancy to ramble make this book less than what it could have been.

I'm also getting rather irritated with the author's constant free advertising plugs for Eukanuba, Iams, and some other major brand names in the pet industry.  Are we reading an novel, or an informational brochure by Iams?  Is she getting paid to do this, or does she really believe that Eukanuba is the best dog food on the market?  (If she does, she's very ignorant on the subject of dog foods.)  I don't like my novels to tell me how I should be training or what I should be feeding.

I probably will not ever purchase any books written by Conant again
