Unfortunately, amazon will not let me give the zero stars this book deserves.  It is a waste of your time.

This book pretends like it's a new idea that sports metaphors can transfer into other areas of life.  It offers no depth, only canned answers that would be better expressed on bumper stickers.  Read absolutely anything else in the mountains of management lit for real, practical assistance in the workplace.  Read absolutely anything else in the mountains of self-help lit for real, practical assistance in the rest of your life.

For those of you who are assigned this book in class, I apologize on behalf of all educators
