This book is about Lance Armstrong winning the Tour de France seven times. This book was disappointing. It probably wouldn't have been if I hadn't read his first book, It's Not About the Bike. It's Not About the Bike was a great book and I loved it, but Every Second Counts is repetitive and the first half is basically the second half of It's Not About the Bike. Lance Armstrong is a smart, brave and in my opinion, a cool guy, but this book doesn't show that. Lance gets cancer and then goes on to win the Tour de France seven times. This is an amazing feat, but the descriptions of all seven Tours are very similar: Train hard, go to the Tour, win, and celebrate.
	I do not recommend Every Second Counts, but I recommend his first book. For the reasons stated. It's repetitive, boring, and not exciting. The same thing could be mentioned more than once. For example, survivorship is stated in the book several times. Frankly, this book wasn't hard to put down, but hard to pick up. A reason that it's boring is that there were no surprises or cliffhangers. This book didn't live up to my expectations, nor will it yours.
