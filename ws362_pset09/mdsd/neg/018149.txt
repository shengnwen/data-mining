Book is big but only fair.  A lot of text -- somewhat interesting, but not profoundly so.  The photos -- none are really titillating, if that's what you're after.  The best art -- clothed or nude -- of this type is Bougeureau.  See books (there are only a couple) about him.  (I reviewed one.)  Waterhouse is also good.  But Waterhouse's women always have the same androgonous hard unfriendly faces.  Bouguereau has more variety than Waterhouse very pretty faces as well as other parts.  Even if all you want are titillating nudes, you are more likely to find it with Bouguereau than in this book.  If lots of mood, but unpleasant faces is OK, Waterhouse gives you plenty of mood.  Bouguereau also gives mood but in a greater variety.  And all his body parts are beautifully rendered.  If you want lots and lots of text, this book is fine.  But even the text about Bouguereau is more profound than what is here
