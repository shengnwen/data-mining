In the past, I have purchased several of the Gazetteer maps. One of the chief reasons I purchase a Topo type map is because I am a Rockhound. A large portion of good minerals and rock formations are generally located at or near mines. The Gazetteer has always been a quick and easy reference for roads and trails to these areas. Not so with the New Mexico version. I have found no mines or quarries anywhere within this map. I feel cheated for if I had looked at it prior to purchase, I would not have bought it
