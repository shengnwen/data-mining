As a young 40ish woman I looked to your book for inspiration.  The title says "100 Most Important Women of the 20th Century", well I think you miss counted. I see listed about 40 or maybe 50, but no way 100 MOST IMPORTANT WOMEN.  The list you provided offended me beyond thoughts.  For you to put some of the most inspirational women of the 20th century in with the likes of Jane Fonda, is truly BAD journalism.  I am a PROUD Female Veteran of the US Air Force and my father fought in Vietnam.  

Putting her name in the limelight does so much injustice to any fallen hero of our country during War time or not.  Her actions not only hurt the past generations, but they will also live on to hurt the generations of our future.  I will continue to let my generation and the future generations know of her actions against her own country.  

If you and your publishing company were true to the Title of the Book you would have NEVER added her
