If you are looking for a practical, concise book explaining how to get the best possible match between what you seen on screen and what gets printed, this is NOT the book. It spends loads of time discussing background theory and how to create color profiles. Most people just don't need or want to get into this much detail or to control the process to this extent. If you just want to use color management tools and existing color profiles--which is at least 80% of us--this book is too long winded and not nearly practical enough. If you are in the elite 20%, this is a great book (see the glowing reviews for details)
