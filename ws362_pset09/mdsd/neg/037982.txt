I was very disappointed with this book.  The author places emphasis on the use of one brand of irrigation equipment, seldom mentioning other options that may better fit the application.  I also found several errors in the  enclosed calculations... not simply a typo, but in the methodology of the  formulas. I would not recommend this book..
