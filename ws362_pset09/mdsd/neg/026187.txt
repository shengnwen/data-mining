This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last
