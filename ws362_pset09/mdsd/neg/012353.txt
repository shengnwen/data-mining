I bought this book to prepare for my relocation to Qatar (from Australia).

The book is so out of date it is downright useless. For example, even basic information such as visa requirements is wrong (you *can* get a tourist visa when you turn up at Doha airport). And recommendations about what's on, what's good, what's bad are meaningless - many of the things described don't exist any more or have been superceded.

I was seriously considering sending my book to Lonely Planet and asking for my money back, but it's easier to hop onto the web and complain instead. More useful too!

Having said that, I don't know of any other guides to buy instead. My suggestions are:

If you're planning on moving to Qatar, do. Quality of life here is fantastic, except that outdoor activites are curtailed by the heat most of the year. Recommend you get in contact with someone who lives here for tips.

If you're planning on a holiday to Qatar, don't. There is almost nothing here for tourists, except for 4WD'ing on the dunes which is unique and fun (go for Arabian Adventures, they're the best operator). I would recommend instead Oman (for the scenery and Arabic culture) and Dubai (shopping, astonishing real estate developments)

Back to the book: Completely out of date, and you can pick up the history bits off the net. And I'm just talking about the Qatar section here, no comment on the other two countries (but I would *really* question why you would want to go to them
