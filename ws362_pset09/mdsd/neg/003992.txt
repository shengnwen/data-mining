I so agree with clockwork bluejay's review.  I had such high hopes, being an O's fan and a Brooks Robinson admirer all of my life.  I moaned and groaned throughout this book so much my husband suggested I send it back.  From Baltimore mentioned several times as "Maryland's capital", to the poor Los Angeles radio listeners having to "make do" with Chuck Thompson instead of the author's preferred Vin Scully, I forced myself to keep reading only because I knew of the happy ending that lay ahead. It seems that the Orioles only won the Series due to the litany of injuries to the Dodger pitchers (2 of the 6 chapters are about poor Sandy Koufax and his problems) or the fact that the Dodgers were tired from their long season - don't all teams play 162 games? While I appreciated the author's crediting others for much of his information, the 400+ footnotes were really distracting.  The book jacket lists the author's home as New Jersey, but I would swear he is a true blue Dodger fan from the slant of this book.  Save yourself the time and money.  Go to the library if you feel need to read it, but don't say you weren't warned
