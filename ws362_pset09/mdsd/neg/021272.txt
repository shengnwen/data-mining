This book begins with a poem in an unidentified language that is never translated.  Take this as a clue to what you're in for throughout the book.  Chock full of abbreviations, acronyms, waffles and other items of geekspeak grammar, this book is possibly good reference for super technicians already familiar with the topic.  For a user who is taking his first course to become familiar with the basics of computer security, however, this book might as well be in another language.  After reading two bad books on this subject, I am beginning to doubt that anyone really knows much about computer security.  By the way, I could make the effort to find out what language the poem is in and what it says, but as with the more technical items in this book, isn't that what I paid the author to tell me?  This book is a poor value for your money
