First of all, I just need to state that "Odd Thomas" is one of my favorite novels ever.  That said, "Forever Odd" was a pretty big letdown.  It lacked much of the intrigue of the first one, which is what I was expecting.  By the end of "Odd Thomas", you pretty much know all of Odd's secrets and clear portrait is painted.  I had a feeling that Koontz would not be able to do this novel the same way, and I was correct.

What bothered me the most about this book was that it had little to do with Odd Thomas.  If you cut out the first few chapters, last few chapters and change the names of the characters, you would have a book that would not even remotley remind a reader of "Odd Thomas".  In fact, I think that Koontz probably should have done just that.  If he had taken the plot out of the Odd Thomas universe and developed a stronger relationship between the main character and Datura, it would have made a good story.

I also felt that a good third of this book was nothing but space filler with Koontz describing Odd wandering through complicated water drainage systems and a burned out hotel/casino.

I thought the last three chapters of the book were amazing, but it didn't make up for the less than satisfactory sixty chapters I had to read to get there
