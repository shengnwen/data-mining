As a Spanish teacher and native speaker I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst student. I had the "pleasure" to teach this book for 3 years (formerly named "Bienvenidos", "A bordo" and "Buen Viaje")and I didn't like it the least. The publishers came up with a new format this year but although it looks more attractive you can still find many of the SAME old activities and many of the old pictures. The vocabulary section at the end of each chapter don't have the English translation what makes it quite difficult for the student when reviewing vocabulary. They have improved the culture sections,though; but still it is not good enough. If you learn Spanish using this book, please THANK your teacher, he/she has a lot of work to do when using this book. Buena suerte!
