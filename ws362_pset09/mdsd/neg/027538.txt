If you like books that aer mysterious, funny, and action packed... then The Wheel on the School is NOT the book for you! This book is boring to read because these people who live in a small town called Shora are trying to find a wheel to put on top of the local town school. The reason they are going to put a wheel on a school is because they want Storks [ a bird ]to come to town and stay there! how dumb is that? It took me about a month to read this book because it was hard to understand! sometimes i found myself reading a page two or three times to try to understand, but i just didn't get it! The ONLY reason i read this book is because i wanted to make a good grade in English class!
