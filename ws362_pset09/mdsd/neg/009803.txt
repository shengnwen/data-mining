What a frightening view of the world, and of women, this book presents - consumerism glorified and magnified to the nth degree. I find it sad that anyone could see the world, women, and women's relationships purely in terms of pushing products. Endless materialism and consumption aren't qualities that the world needs, and therefore I found this book a rather sickening read. Its two stars are because, to be fair, she certainly knows her stuff, even if that stuff strikes some of us as the stuff of nightmares
