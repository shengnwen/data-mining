This is one of the worst books that I was required to read for my MBA program. I didnt benefit anything from reading the book. The authors of this book should not be considered "authors", and people should be paid to read such a book!! 
When you read the book, you will understand what I say (if you have to read it).
The Authors think that readers are coming from the moon or maybe Mars, and that they don't know the clear obvious in their life
