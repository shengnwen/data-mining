I've made 2 of the recipes so far and am reluctant to try more. If I had known what I now know BEFORE I bought the book, I'd never have bought it. 

The first recipe was a complete bomb: the Tofu and Vegetable Curry, p. 105. I found it too hot and also bitter. Thin, watery gravy; very hot; and a nasty, bitter taste -- yuck! I love curries, but this was by far the worst I've ever tasted. I'll never make it again!

The Butternut Squash Soup, p. 98, was a little better. I liked it, but my husband didn't and wouldn't eat it (complained of a sour-milk taste). The soy milk and perhaps also the margarine had curdled over the long hours of cooking. And since cut-up squash isn't available in my town, the recipe took an hour of hard work, mostly to dismember a fresh butternut squash. I'll make this again when I can find cut-up squash, but I'll leave out the soy milk and margarine during the slow cooking. When the slow cooking is done, I'll puree the soup, then add the soy milk and margarine, and reheat gently on the stovetop. I think this will avoid the curdling and yield a creamier product.

My recommendation to others: don't waste your money on this clunker
