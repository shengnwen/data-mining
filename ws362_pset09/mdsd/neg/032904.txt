Why would we want to teach our children how to use poor english, disrespect their elders and call each other potty-mouthed names?  With all the quality options for children's books out there, don't bother with this series.  While the United States educational system struggles to teach children to read and write correctly, our schools offer them things like this.  If you want to teach bad grammar and manners, go right ahead.  It's such a shame.  These funny stories could have been told just as well, without any schlock included.  Thanks, but no thanks
