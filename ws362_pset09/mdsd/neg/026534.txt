I based my purchase of this book on the review here on these web pages by psychologist Craig Chalquist, based on his comment (in effect) that life well-lived necessarily has highs and lows in it, one must accept, even embrace both dark and light phases, as a tree needs both sunlight and dark night to fulfill its potential.  It was with that understanding well in hand I began reading St. John of the Cross.  Other reviewers have said it's difficult to read, perhaps because of the tranlator's stated goal of being as true to the 16th-century Spanish as possible, not rewriting it to make it more accessible and losing the literary voice of the original which, apparently, is the more important value of this work.  I don't have a problem with the language, and it's not a big book, just over 200 pages, but I haven't quite finished reading it and I'm not sure if I will (oh, I probably will) because something about it makes my skin crawl.
I reject this sort of ascetic mysticism on grounds that it's philosophically flawed--it's the tortuously convoluted path of a labyrinth from which one exits by the same gate as one entered, and for what?  To me it suggests nothing more than pathological, compulsive, sado-masochistic auto-eroticism.  Union with God, indeed; get your hand out of your pants, go outside:  God is everywhere.  Turn off the computer, get some exercise; let God find you.  I shall serve no god who demands obedience from slaves; my god loves me for my willful independence.  If we are made in God's image, does that mean God is a self-flagellating crybaby?  Get up!  Get on your feet!  Be Lightning!  Be Thunder!  Be Earthquake and Avalanche!  Be Iceberg and Volcano, Tidalwave and Twister! Make God proud!  Don't buy this book!
