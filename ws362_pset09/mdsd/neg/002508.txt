I have found this cookbook to be both unspiring and a little misleading.  None of the recipes are really that appealing or all that wonderful.  They are okay, but nothing too fancy.  Often the quick and dirty process of this cookbook involves you using a lot of canned, frozen, or pre-fabbed ingredients, which hinders the taste of the finished product.  There are only a few recipes in the book that really pique my taste buds--everything else is either just average or far below average.  A talented cook can probably enhance the recipes with a little spices, fresh vegetables, and a little creativity, but then it misses the point of getting your meals done in 30 minutes or less.

That brings me on to the next point.  The whole concept of having dinner in 30 minutes or less is misleading.  Most of the recipes in this book are not main dishes, but instead side dishes.  To fill you up or to have a balanced meal, you'd most likely have to cook 2-3 of these dishes, thereby resulting in a meal that takes a lot longer than 20-30 minutes to cook.

I was able to get this book on clearance at Sam's Club for dirt cheap.  I also collect cookbooks, so buying this wasn't so draining on my finances.  However, unless you're either a hobbyist that likes to have a variety of cookbooks or if you can find this book for dirt cheap like I did, I can't justify spending the money for this book.  There is really nothing exciting here
