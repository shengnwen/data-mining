I couldn't get the next Stephanie Plum book so I tried this one. I threw it out after 10 pages. Maybe I didn't give it much of a try but anything that starts off as that bad of a romance novel (the equivalent of "it was a dark and stormy night" would have been 100 times better) had no potential for me. Romance fans, have fun. Plum fans, give it a second thought
