I was a big, big fan of the original RiftWar series and the Empire series co-authored with Janny Wurts, so I thought I'd check out what Feist had written recently. I now wish I hadn't. To be blunt, I was disgusted by this book and couldn't finish it. The writing is good enough, but the whole atmosphere is nasty. 

The whole book reads like a long S&M fantasy. Talon is a hopeless character who is constantly used and bullied by the people around him, the supposed "good people" in the world. He doesn't stand up to them, rather he seems to think it is his place to be put down and humiliated.

I was particularly revolted to see Pug, a character I had grown quite fond of in previous books, acting so cruel and callous.  

I do not recommend this book to anyone
