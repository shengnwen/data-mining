I have found it very challenging to get through this book.  It is written in a very academic style and focuses considerably on previous research.  I cannot understand from the discussion exactly what is being put forward as relevant understandings in today's world.  I wish I had a dollar for every time the author says 'as I argued in...'  or 'what I will argue in...'.  This is driving me nuts. I have had a couple of tries at ploughing through this book but I just can't cope with the writing style
