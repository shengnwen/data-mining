This book contains almost nothing specific to the Chen style. The Authors' understanding of Tai Ji Quan is about at the beginner level. No descriptions or photos of the Chen style forms are included, only a list of the postures. The photos are a real joke too... like photos of a family vacation. It is written well though, and it starts out good enough, but after a few chapters it is clear that the Authors don't know what they are talking about with regard to intermediate or advanced practice. Nothing new here. If you have studied any of the classic Tai Ji styles for more than a few months you probably know everything in this book. Some of the descriptions of advanced practice and weapons are really laughable. It is so obvious they don't know what they are talking about as they stumble all over themselves looking for some way to describe things that they have never actually practiced or learned. I was disappointed because I was hoping to learn about the specifics of the Chen style as promised in this book's promo. Sadly, the promo promises alot but the book delivers very little. There is a photo of a guy (not one of the authors) doing the &quot;xia shi&quot; form, however, it is mislabled as being the &quot;shang bu qi xing&quot; form. This makes me wonder if the authors have ever even learned all the Tai Ji forms or if maybe they just visited China for a few weeks here and there to &quot;study&quot; Tai Ji like as a hobby or something. This book totally lacks any exclusive insight or original information regarding Tai Ji and nearly every other paragraph contains a quote from the Tai Ji Classics or some other already published work. Very disappointing. But the Authors are good writers and as far as basic Tai Ji goes, they did a decent job of explaining the fundamentals, so I gave it 2 stars
