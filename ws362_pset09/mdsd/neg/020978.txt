this book was boring.  Evrything in here was either stuff you could look up in the dictonary and that you wouldn't need to because the terms went by other words as well, or common sense that you would know by guessing.  This book reads similar to books made in the era of black and white television whos goals were to dispense facts and not to entertain thus saving space and money.  Because of this it sounds just like an instruction manual except for the fact that most instruction manuals arent this long.  If you plan on reading this book all the way through good luck its a 282 page instruction manual. If I could have I would have given it a negative one star review
