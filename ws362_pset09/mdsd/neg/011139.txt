I was very disappointed with this book. I had already made the decision to breast feed before buying this book, so I was bored reading the lengthy text about why I should breastfeed. 

Breastfeeding is tricky and frustrating in the beginning. You will have a lot of questions about what you can, can't eat, how often you need to breastfeed, what signs you should look for to determine if your baby has an allergy to food, and how to start weaning if you are going back to work. The book doesn't provide enough detail to answer these questions. Also the organization of the book didn't make sense to me and the index is not helpful. 

I found the website kellymom.com much more helpful in terms of providing breastfeeding tips and answers to breastfeeding questions.
