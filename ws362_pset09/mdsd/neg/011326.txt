As the mom of a 25-month-old late-talker, I have been searching high and low for information to help my child with his delayed speech.  Sure, this book was entertaining; these kids are indeed fascinating.  But after reading the Einstein Syndrome, it was clear that my boy is not one of the children Sowell is describing. Overall this book left me with more questions than answers on the subject of delayed speech.  

If you actually want to do something to help your child, and not just read about other kids who turned out to be super-intelligent engineers, buy "The Late Talker: What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet" by Marilyn C. Agin, M.D., Lisa F. Geng and Malcolm J. Nicholl.  This is a book that gives parents real answers about how to help their speech-delayed children
