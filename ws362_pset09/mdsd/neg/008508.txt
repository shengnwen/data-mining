Other folks have weighed in on the content of the book, so I have no need to do that.  My comment will center on the aspect of the photography that spoiled the book for me.  The crew obviously had applied little colored circular stickers to the various instruments so they could be coded for the captions.  That was all fine and well, but 75% of the photographs were taken with the stickers still in place.  It was sloppy work.  Carping, perhaps, but I expected better.  The same comments apply to the volume dealing with Cold War aircraft
