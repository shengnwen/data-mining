If you are a Christian looking for information about certain Bible topics then this dictionary is not for you.  There are even some sections where the author doubts the validity of Scripture and claims that there are faults in the Word of God.  If you are looking for wishy-washy details then this is the book for you.  If you believe the Word of God is just that THE WORD OF GOD, then don't buy this dictionary.  There are so many other Bible dictionaries out there that will be of much more help and guidance.  My suggestion to all....give this one a miss
