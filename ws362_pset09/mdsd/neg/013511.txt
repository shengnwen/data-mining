Am I the only reviewer who wonders why Back Bay Books of Little-Brown didn't use an editor? This is repetitious beyond belief. The characters are also beyond belief. A character named "Falk" is the first person narrator who tells the same empty story over and over is so twisted and shallow as he kills arabs in the name of protecting Jews that I would have liked to shoot him myself, not just to put him out of his misery but to punish him for wasting my time. Yes, I did finish the book, if that's what you want to call it.
