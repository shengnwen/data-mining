My twins are 3 1/2 and have not wanted to start potty training. I thought I would buy this book and see if I could have success. The day after I ordered the book, I bought my daughter some princess underwear and she suddenly became very excited about the prospect of not wearing diapers. My son immediately followed suit. Unfortunately, the book had not arrived yet, so I just had to use some common sense and good instincts. Lucky for me, this worked and my twins were potty trained by the end of the week and ready for school after Easter Break. I offered no rewards other than praise. I did not use a doll. I did not do any of the ridiculous things suggested by this book which seems very outdated. At the end of the first week back at school, the book finally arrived. I decided to read it just to see what it said and was glad it arrived so late. If you have not bought a book yet, don't buy this one. Just use common sense, don't try to train too early and let your child's success be its own reward
