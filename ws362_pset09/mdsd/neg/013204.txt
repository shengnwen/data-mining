Like Bernard Lewis, this author likes to portray a clash between West and Middle East.

But look at the other countries:  nobody is fighting the west, not even the Chinese.

Does anybody really think we can't get along?

This book is true only for the Middle East.  

As for the rest of the thesis, that developing countries catch up with developed countries, this is a well known economic phenomena, nothing worth fretting over
