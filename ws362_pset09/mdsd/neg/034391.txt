We have used White House Nannies and they did a fine job. After reading this book, however, I would be reluctant to use them again. I own a business and would never dream of violating my clients' privacy the way Kline does in this book.  She is quite nasty, and unnecessarily so, as many of the stories speak for themselves. Sure, it's easy to mock power couples, but this is Kline's main source of income -- shouldn't she show a little more class?

Some names are real, others (I think) are not. Given the highly sensitive nature of the book, some clarity on this point would have helped.

For those not bothered by the ethics or the tone, there are some interesting stories and genuine insights into the nanny-parent relationship. Still, I'm rather sorry I contributed to the author's profit for such a mean and self-promoting book
