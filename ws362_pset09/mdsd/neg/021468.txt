This book is very difficult to follow.  It isn't intended for beginners, I guess, but even novices will have trouble following the information here.  The circuits and ideas are good if all you want to do is build someone else's circuits, but if your goal is learning about microcontrollers, this one is somewhat poorly written and tough to follow.  Also, as other reviews have stated, expect MANY typographical errors
