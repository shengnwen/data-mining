I consider myself to be the biggest fan of Tarantino and his art. I've purchased many biographies on him and filmographies and when I found out this was coming out I almost pooped my pants. I ordered it and when I finally got it I was very dissapointed. 

This book is a one sided bashing of the writer/director. How could this pass as a biography? There are many times where the author takes a quote from a Tarantino movie and deeply reads into it. There is no problem with that except, he gets the quotes wrong. If you are going to take someones quote out of context you should at the very least make the quote correct, or at least close.

All in all this book is trash. Pick up Tarantino by Jim Smith or The Pocket Essential Quentin Tarantino. Actually pick them both up The Pocket essential gives a better view of his life and a concise overview of the movies. Jim Smith's has an extensive view of his filmography and almost no personal life. They go together great. Like Mia and Vincent
