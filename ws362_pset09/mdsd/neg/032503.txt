I found this book to be a great letdown.  Flipping back and forth between "master" recipes and the actual thing you want to make is annoying and might lead to errors.  I made the Lemon Pound Cake (so-so) and the Baumkuchen (which bore no resemblance to cake when finished.)  I wrote twice to the publisher asking for help with the Baumkuchen.  On the second request, the publisher wrote back, apologized for the non-response, and said Ms. Yard might or might not get back to me.  Better alternatives for people who want to make great desserts that do not disappoint are the Nancy Silverton books, the new Gourmet collection, or the Collette books. Or even Martha Stewart--but not this.
