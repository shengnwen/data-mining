A Murder for Her Majesty is exciting but completely unreliable as a historical novel.  It is full of major and minor anachronisms:  the choir sings carols that weren't written till the 19th century; York Minster uses an order of service appropriate to late 20th century American Episcopal churches but totally inaccurate for Elizabethan ritual; the political organization of the church ("the Queen could not appoint bishops herself") is completely backwards--bishops WERE, in fact, appointed by the Queen--Alice is portrayed as eating a potato and drinking tea, both of which were not in the English diet till 100 or more years later; there are house numbers (a 19th century invention) and on and on and on.  It's outrageous not only that the author's own research was so sloppy but that nobody anywhere along the editorial process caught any of this.  What's the use of a historical novel if the history it teaches is so utterly inaccurate
