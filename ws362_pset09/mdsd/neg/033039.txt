This book is not awful.  But it is not a replacement for Strunk and White's Elements of Style.  Elements of Style has many advantages-- It's clear, it's short and the direction can steer no one wrong.  Adios, by contrast, is a long, dense book, and might do for helping established students or writers, but is simply too large for a beginner to use.  With the Elements in place, a writer can go forth and choose his or her own path.  The authors of this book seem to be informed by television and video games and the magic of computers and miss the fact that good writing is good writing, no matter what the flavor of the month in popular culture might be.
I have taught writing, and I would no more use this book to teach writing than I would throw typewriters at my students to teach them typing.  I had high hopes for this book, expectations that were not met.  If nothing else, this book serves to show that The Elements of Style is still a valuable tool for the modern writer, one that remains useful and the first book of choice to turn to when looking for a beginning guide to writing
