I had high hopes for this book when I bought it, but I am somewhat disappointed.  I usually like unique female heroines, but for some reason Fox was incredible unappealing.  I think if she said "fricking" one more time I would have thrown the book out the window. I think the author used superficial elements to try to convey Fox as a spirited, unique, independent woman, i.e. bacon grease, rough language, cigars etc. I would have preferred the author to use a bit more character depth to convey "true grit" and independence.  I agree with the other reviewer whose visual on Tanner sucking on sweaty toes says it all
