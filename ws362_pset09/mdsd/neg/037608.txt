The titled of this book should be "Creating a Cottage Garden in North America unless you live in the south.  If you live in the south, this book is usless to you."  If it were titled that, I would have saved my money.  What a disappointment.  The are few pictures and the narrative is really boring.  If you live in zones 3-4, you may find some vage (very vague) interest in this book but there are so many better books out there.  I bought the book based on the recommendations on Amazon.  I hope you save your money or review this book at the book store before spending your hard earned money on it.
