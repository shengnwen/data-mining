Josh McDowell's "Handbook or Today's Religions" is a comprehensive book, and covers a lot of material. Each religion covered is necessarily brief, but the main points are covered and should give someone a basic idea of what each religion is about. 

It should be remembered that McDowell is not writing from a purely intellectual and neutral stance, but is attempting to show why non-Christian religions are false. This really could be termed a work of polemics, though somewhat softer than the venomous prose of Tertullian. Before considering buying this book, it should be remembered that McDowell does have an agenda in writing it, and he is not neutral about the religions he discusses.

As an adjunct to that agenda, McDowell will attempt to show why, from a Christian viewpoint, these religions are "wrong". That he would include his opinions should come as no surprise to anyone, seeing that he is a Christian and has a purpose other than merely describing these religions.

One the bonus side, McDowell does not get into the overly technical language, and keeps it aimed at people who have had little to no exposure to the religions concerned. He has written a very accessible book.

For Christians, the book has undoubted value. For others, there are much better and more neutral books available that do the same thing. Or even better, get the information straight from the source itself and read the religion's books for yourself. They are far more interesting, anyway, despite the large amount of time that it may take you
