This review is of the HANS-FRIEDRICH MUELLER edition published in 2005 by Modern Library. Simply, the book is defective, the pages tear out of the spine. I thought it was a one-off and returned for an exchange and had the same problem. I returned it again and instead bought the 2003 edition (Modern Library, Mueller) which is not as thick; it has fewer, larger pages, the spine holds together as it should. The problem with the 2005 edition is the spine is so thick because the pages are smaller the perfect binding seems to fall apart, probably a fault of the printer. I dont know if they are all like that, but the 2003 edition is IMO exactly the same just not as thick and easier to open and read
