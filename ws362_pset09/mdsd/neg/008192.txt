this is the first book from connelly that i picked up
i like the theory and revelation leading to the painter who coincidentally was also bosch.. i also enjoyed the interpretation of bosch's painting but what i don't enjoy outweighs what i enjoy about the book...
the thing about the owl and bosch was really fascinating but i was dissapointed on how the story was told..it wasn't really interesting and there's no flow to the story..
i also thought the scene where bosch was in court was too long and boring, again, the way the story was told was very very boring..at that moment i really wished sidney shieldon had wrote the scene in court as he portrays lawyers as alan shore-like which is such a delight to read...
i was so dissapointed as the elements of the story was top notch with owls, religion, darkness etc but the way it is told was just plain boring.
