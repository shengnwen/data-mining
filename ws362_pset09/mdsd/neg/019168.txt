I was highly disappointed with this audiobook. I had been expecting it to open up a personal insight into the author's experiences that others could perhaps relate to and help them cope with tragic personal loss. Instead it was chock full of copious detail about irrelevant and meandering topics that showcase Ms. Didions outstanding literary research capabilities, travel and life experiences, but deny the listener an insight into her real feelings and experiences. 

I kept listening hoping to warm to the author (I was trying very, very hard to do so let me tell you) and empathize with her experiences but she kept the reader very firmly at arms distance in their place from start to finish. This audiobook is full of so many facts and figures (all in a  minutia of detail) that is reminiscent of a writer who is a talented Googleer and research technician, but who can't relate to real people in a down to earth manner.  

The end product is a meticulously detailed and clinical exposition that has the warmth of a bag of ice.
