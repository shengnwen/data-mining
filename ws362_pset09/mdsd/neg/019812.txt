Save yourself some time and money and pass on this nonsense.    The author puts forth the idea that the Catholic Church will not ordain women as priests.  That is not the issue.  It is not a case of will or won't.  Halter tries to spin othewise, but fails miserably in this thinnly-vailed anti-Catholic tome.  

There is no issue, only one simple fact: the Catholic Church cannot (repeat CANNOT) ordain women as priests because it is doctrine and dogma.  While church tradition can be changed, church docrine cannot.  A male priesthood is doctrine.  Here's an example, it is doctrine that Jesus is the Son of God.  The church cannot change that doctrine or it would cease to be the church.   Don't like the fact that the Catholic Church cannot ordain women?  Leave.  Join another church.  There's plenty of other churches out there that have women "priests."  At least Protestants had the fortright integrity to leave the Church.  Modernist liberal "Catholics" need to learn from their example
