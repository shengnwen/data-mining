If you are looking for a book to read about poker, pass on this one unless you are desperate for any poker read.  Do so for a very simple reason:  there is surprisingly little about poker in this 'poker book'.  

There is a detailed account of Ted Binion's murder which courses through the book.  In fact there is much more about Binion than about poker.  But this book was not found in the mystery section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.

Or you might like some insight about going to a jewelry store to pick out an anniversary ring for your wife.  This is covered in more detail than McManus' coverage of his WSOP satellite tournaments.  In fact, the author's wife Jennifer's ring size is six, a fact which for some reason I can't get out of my head.  But the book was not in the weddings/anniversaries section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.

Are you curious about McManus' childhood, his parents and grandparents?  Then this is the book for you, although it would usually be found in the autobiography section.

There is even a fascinating, endless chapter on whether A. Alvarez should have had intercourse with Sylvia Plath, and whether such coitus would have interrupted her eventual suicide (our  author thinks not, but we all know it depends).  But this book was not in the self-help-for-sick-poets section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.

In all seriousness, I could go on and on with examples such as these.  It's not a bad book; in fact the sections on poker are really quite good.  If the author had edited out three quarters of the book, I would give it five stars.  When I go to the poker section of the bookstore and buy a book about poker, I want my goddess poker to be the topic.  

If you're looking for one person's experience with poker, mostly but not exclusively in Vegas, read Anthony Holden's "Big Deal".  It's a great read, and it's even about poker.
