I was appalled by the poor editing of this book. The author is from the neighborhood where the story is set..rural North Carolina.  The basic plot is fine, being about a black man in 1947 being accused of attempted rape by a white lady because he didn't get off the sidewalk when she passed by.  This is supposed to be based on a true event where said black man is arrested, hauled out of jail by the Klan to be lynched, but escapes to the swamps and then to the North.  
  However the 12-year-old main character interejects her own stream of consciousness into the first person present tense story.  These are the problems I had:  She says when her mother gets mad at her, Mother hits her with a plastic spoon.
  She says that if she isn't good, she doesn't get to go to grandmother's house to watch RV.  She says Grandmother gets a phone and it's YELLOW, and that the phone number is 919-555-1919.
  I remember the 50's pretty well and this story takes place before that.  No one had a TV in 1947, much less a poor black family who had electricity but still had an outhouse in the back.  No one had plastic spoons...they would have been wooden or maybe metal.  Phones didn't come in color until the end of the 50's and then they cost more each month.  And it was the 60's when prefixes came into play.  Before that, it would have been KE 8-1919 or TR 7-5616.
  So, the author is interjecting her own memories into this story, and the editor was too young to know the difference.  This is too bad, because, while the children reading this may not notice any one of these anachronisms, having done the research on the time and place would have lent a lot of authenticity.
