Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization.
