This book falls into the classification of most French Revolution books that I have read. It loses focus in the complexity of the revolution and gets bogged down in way to much detail. Even if you know a lot about the revolution the analysis is too much and distracts from whatever his overall point is which was lost by about page 20.  I had a hard time getting through it and if I had not needed to read it for class I would have stopped after the first 50 pages. Try the French Revolution and the Ancien Regime by Collins for a much better look at the French Revolution.
