This dictionary may be good for the layman, but it is far too general for a law student or lawyer.  Only the most common legal words are included, so most of the words are familiar to lawyers.  Those words that are obscure enough to require a dictionary are not included.  I would recommend this dictionary to a layman who wants to understand simple legal terms, but not to a lawyer or law student
