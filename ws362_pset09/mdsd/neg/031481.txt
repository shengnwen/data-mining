Others who note problems with recipes are absolutely right. 

These recipes never saw a test kitchen. 

I suspect the authors reduced the quanties of ingredients in their heads to allow for smaller quantities than they produce in the resturant. )

Many of the recipes call for ingrediants you will need to hunt for, the instructions are missing steps, the measurements are waaaay off, often prep time is very long, and the result can be a disaster; an expensive one if using organic maple syrup. (I've had two things I just had to toss out.) 

Do NOT make "Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie, page 188.

Results can also be heavenly. Phyllo Traingles are outstanding. They take HOURS to make, but you end up with enough triangles for about 3 parties. Non-vegans have no clue they are anything but delicious. (Allow time to practice handling the phyllo dough, if you are new to using it.) I ended up cutting the sheets differently than described, in order to allow the 2 tsp filling to even fit. Lots of wasted phyllo, but still used all the filling and made more triangles than you can imagine. If you are going to make them for a big reception, practice a week ahead on a half recipe to get your method figured out. They freeze very well
