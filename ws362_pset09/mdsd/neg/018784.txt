This and part 1 is merely repackaging of the 1st hard-bound book [Eye of the World].  The advertisment reads as if it is a prequel.  Wrong.  The publisher just figured another way to make a few more dollars.  The Eye of the World and all of the remaining books of "The Wheel of Time" are outstanding.  They didn't need / require this treatment
