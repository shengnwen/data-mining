An author can write a short book and it will be well received (i.e. The Gift) but this book falls very short of that lofty expectation. I felt while reading this Steel took her formula of putting wealthy people into everyday situations and just wrote a book to get it out to her publishers for some deadline. I read this book in an hour, and at the end of it, I found myself extremely disappointed. It's one thing if the book is good, and short, but this was not that. I would advise you not to waste your money on this book, but if you do want to read it, borrow it from your local library or a friend
