I was very disappointed in this book because I felt like the title itself is very misleading. The title of the book is called &quot;FREE MONEY From the Federal Governement for SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS&quot; By  Laurie Blum. The book description clearly states that there are hundreds of  millions of dollars available FREE!  to small business and entrepreneurs,  when in fact the only thing that I found in this book pertaining to small  businesses were LOANS and ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, and the last time I checked  LOANS are not free. This book description needs to be more clear as to what  kinds of grants are available and the title &quot;FREE MONEY&quot; should  not be used when this book is filled with mostly loan options. From reading  the book description I was under the impression that this was a book filled  with nothing but grant information!  I was very disappointed and  unsatisfied with this book. If I'm wrong or misunderstood this book please  fill free to correct me and direct me to the pages where the business  grants are supposed to be located
