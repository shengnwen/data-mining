Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one
