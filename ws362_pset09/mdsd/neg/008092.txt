I guess I'm that 5th doctor.

I have recently begun getting back into comics (after a twenty year hiatus) via graphic novels. Batman: the Dark Night, The Watchmen, Powers, Bone, etc... I have loved them all. Based on any number of recommendations I thought I'd give Ronin a try. 

Ughhhh.... I hesitate to slam a book so many others have praised. For me it didn't live up to even half of what I would have expected. Art, story, nothing memorable. Please don't take this personally. It's not you, it's me. Maybe you will like it. Maybe you will love it. I didn't.
