I couldn't even get past the introduction for this book.  The first part of the intro discusses Anti-Americanism abroad, and the second part proceeds to discuss domestic sentiments.  "Discuss" probably isn't the best word describe the junk printed in this book.  Hollander's "discussion" of domestic anti-Americanism consists of simply quoting various people and labeling them as anti-American.  Because these people disagreed with American policies and actions, they were smeared.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a common response from conservatives--if anyone disagrees with policies, they are smeared and labeled as traitors or anti-Americans(see the reviewer below, who was promptly labeled as a "liberal blowhard" by another reviewer).  In actuality, it is extremely American to question the government, to disagree with it, to protest.  As Americans, we have a responsibility to question our leaders, not blindly follow them.  I was hoping that this book would provide an objective, educational view on the issue of anti-Americanism.  However, the introduction proved to be quite slanted, and I don't think that any of the material in the rest of the book would provide me with the objectivity I was looking for.  Paul Hollander had and opportunity to put together a book that would educate the public, whether they were red or blue, and unfortunately, he botched it.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
