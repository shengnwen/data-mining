but after only 18 pages, I had to give up.  I love clan Malkavian, mostly because it is a rare person who can truly play one.  A subtle clan to comprehend.  I saw only one great Malk character in the novels so far, and he got killed in the first book (which tells me it's a rare author who can truly write a Malkavian).  But this story is told in first person, which breaks the entire feel of the series, and of course, the teller is a mad man.  I couldn't understand what he was talking about, or even how one sentence related to the next.  Such an incomprehendable waste
