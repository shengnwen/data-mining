I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books.  The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.

There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.

I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end.  The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.

The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.

I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve
