Yeesh. The title of this book, Suburban Sweatshops:  The Fight for Immigrant Rights would lead you to believe that it's an expansive look at a *nationwide* problem - would it not?. Well, it's actually a very cerebral discussion of the author's own (commendable) work setting up the Workplace Project, a small resource center for immigrant workers in Long Island. Still sounds interesting, doesn't it? Well, it might have been, in other hands, but we actually learn remarkably little about the workers.  We meet a few individuals - or rather, "case histories" - but the author is a lawyer, not a writer, so while we're told a lot about the workers' grievances, we learn very little about their actual lives (and nothing whatever about the other side of the story, if any). Mostly, it's a lot of chin-rubbing about legal and organizational strategies for increasing the influence of Long Island wage-earners. Perhaps the publisher thought that giving the book this broad title (it ought to have been called something like, "MY Fight for Immigrant Rights") would increase sales. It worked on me - 20 bucks later I have a book I don't want and my only way of defending myself is . . . this indignant review. The reason it gets two stars instead of one is because Gordon has done so much good work for our country and, in particular, the most exploited and neglected among us. I would much rather have contributed the 20 bucks directly to her organization.
