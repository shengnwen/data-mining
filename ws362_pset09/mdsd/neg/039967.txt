Theory wise, the book exposes things relatively well.  However, I cannot get over how thoroughly maddening it is to be second-guessing the answers in the back of the book when you're trying to learn by doing.  For ...sake, it's the 3rd edition and it's still full of errors!  Inexcusable!  There's no way to build confidence in problem solving when many of the solutions to the odd numbered problems are wrong!  No matter how clear the theory, it's still a work in progress, incomplete at best.  It is, quite frankly, shameful to be passing this book off as some sort of learning tool
