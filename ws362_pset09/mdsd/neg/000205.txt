Although I am not a professional decorator, I do have a large collection of various cake decorating books to support my hobby.  This book was an entire waste of money unless you prefer to read directions instead of having pictures to demonstrate the techniques.  There is not enough new information to make the cost worth it.  The pictures and diagrams are so small and poorly labeled that you have to read lots of text to decipher her instructions.  Enjoyed her cookie book.  But would definitely not recommend this one
