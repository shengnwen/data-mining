So does the author work for the RIAA?" Was my first thought when poking throught this book. Nice content overall, but I simply cannot recommend this book based on one thing alone : The author uses the term "stealing" when discussing copyright infringement. Get it straight! There is a clear legal difference between 'stealing' and 'infringement'. To state things in this manner is not only misleading, but an out-and-out intentional falsehood. Just because the author feels a certain way does not make it law. 
In this day and age, there is absolutely NO EXCUSE for using incorrect terms like this in a book specifically about the legal aspects of music. Thumbs way down:(
