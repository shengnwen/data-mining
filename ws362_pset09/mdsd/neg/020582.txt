I'm sure this was a great book, 8 years ago (i'd give it 4 stars then), but it's taken me forever to get through the book when every other technique is a film-specific technique like "duplicating slides", "pushing film, or "cross-processing", or is referring to specific cameras, film types, etc to get desired results. most of this can be done in photoshop with one dslr and a couple lenses.
thankfully, i just saw that Frost has released a new version of this book specific to digital photography. i probably wouldn't buy it though. i hope i can sell this used
