What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!

Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!

This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed
