I find this book extremely confusing.  Many names were utilize throughout the book which makes it hard to follow.  As an individual who is not familiar with the Mongolian  history, the author fails to elaborate or explain the details of why a character does something.  In this sense, I find the book disappointing.  It is also disappointing that it does not go in depth of Gengis Kahn's warefare strategy.  TWO THUMBS DOWN
