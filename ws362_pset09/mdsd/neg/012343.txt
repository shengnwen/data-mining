Jim Hightower has become another spokesman for the unhappy left. This limousine liberal who lives in Texas and poses blue collar, is now complaining about "trailer trash rednecks" who have taken his country from him. Since when was this Hightower's country? Yet so many misguided people are giving this book four or five star reviews. Why does this even deserve one star? Just like all the other liberal socialists, Hightower complains about dog-eat-dog economic corporations, the religious right, and capitalism. He has decided not to support Bush in the war on terrorism against Osama bin Laden, Zarkawi and his evil thugs. How dare he do such a thing.

And second, who has stolen this country. NO ONE! I am sick of people saying that Bush stole the election. Rubbish! Bush may have not won the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but he won the electoral vote. Gore may have won the popular vote but he did not win the electoral vote. The presidential candidate who wins the electoral vote wins the election. That is what our founding fathers decided. Bush did not steal the election. 

And about the Republican-controlled Congress. Congress is ruled by Republicans not because they stole their way there. But because they were elected by the people. The American people decided to elect Republicans in Congress. There is no way that the Republicans have stolen the government. It's nonsense! 

Please take my advice and don't waste your money on this trashy book. Go to college and get an education in political science. I would only buy this book if I wanted something to destroy. But I would not buy this book because I am not giving Jim Hightower one cent of my money. And also because this book is not worth one cent of my money.
