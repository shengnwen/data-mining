Please don't waste your money on this book, especially if you have little prior knowledge regarding linear regression. It is poorly written and seldom gives proper explanations for the various aspects of regression analysis. Weisberg wrote it keeping brevity in mind, so don't expect to find many details; this book is definitely not for beginners, and even people I know with more experience have noted that it is often difficult to understand.
