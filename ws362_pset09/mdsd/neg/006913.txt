I've recently come into the TTC group and have sought out many books to get prepared...this book looked good, said all the right things on the cover but when I got it home, it was very hard to stay interested!  It was like a textbook, not a very difficutlt read but difficult to want to keep reading.  Now I'm ordering new books because I dislike this one so much.  I'm sure if has useful information, but I'd rather read something more "personable"
