I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there
