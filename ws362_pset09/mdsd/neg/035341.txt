If you are reading these in order, this one is anticlimatic! you know that they are going to be together and the back story is horrible.  I really enjoyed the first 3, but the stories are becoming so much the same that I am giving up on this series!  I enjoyed sherrilyn kenyon's series so much more (which is also a little repetitve), but better written.  Christine really needed an editor to get rid of the same old statements over and over again AND to speed up the boo
