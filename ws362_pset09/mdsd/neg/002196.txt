This children's book about Galileo has very beautiful illustrations, but the history leaves much to be desired.  It's a perfect example though of how myths about the past take on a life of their own independent of historical evidence or historical context.  Sis offers another variation on the "warfare" of science versus religion  with Galileo representing the modern rational scientist (which he was not) and his opponents in the Church representing ignorant, dogmatic tradition.  Of course the reality was much more complex, especially considering that Galileo did not have proof that the earth moved.  This book shows why children are so often misinformed from an early age for the sake of telling a good story
