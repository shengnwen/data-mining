I got this book because of its promise of more in-depth information that would be of use to an advancing Pagan.  A lot of the information was new to me, including specific reasons we do certain things in ritual and how they pertain to the elements.  However, the writing in places is quite dry, and I found it difficult to get into the book.  Deborah Lipp has some very strong opinions about ritual and how it should be done, and she can be very biting and almost offensive in her language.  For example, she talks about the quarters and things that can be used to represent the elements, like feathers, shells, etc.  She says that the covens who use appropriately colored candles for the quarters instead of objects to represent the elements, are "lazy" because they are using fire for each element.  To me, this religion is about personal growth and interpretation, and she made it seem like everything MUST be done a certain way.  This is an interesting book for someone studying elemental magic in more depth, but don't take everything she says to heart
