some explanation.  I am having this terrible time of getting past the first few pages of this book.  So help me those of you who own refrigerators.  If you, or some unknown enemy, shuts down your "at work" fridge late on Saturday, and you for some unknown and bevildering (but deep, yeah deep and unfathomable) reason wake up at 4 A.M. on Sunday to go to work, do you think that at 6 A.M. you wouldn't be able to enter your workplace because of the PUTRID stench from your perishables?  I don't know about you but one of my problems with my fridge is the time it takes to thaw before I clean it.  Never, ever, has it made my food putrid in less than 12 hours.  And for some reason, I don't know why, I thought that fridges were as close to airtight as you could get, you know, to hold in all that cold air you pay electricity bills to produce.  FOR CRYING OUT LOUD WHY NOT MAKE IT A WEEK or better yet, a month.  And will somebody explain also why the author hates her sleuth so  much she makes her dumb enough to wake up at 4 A.M. to go to work when she clearly has not enough to do.  I mean Goldy gets knocked out, calls the police, calls Tom, calls Marla, goes in and cleans up her catering place while simultaneously getting rid of dozens of mice AND MAKES UP A WHOLE NEW BATCH OF LUNCH FROM BEGINNING TO FINISH.  If she had time for all that, why not wake up at 6 A.M.? I hate stupid books and this one makes it to the top of  the list.  However, I will get past page 20 if somebody explains to me why the laws of physics and common sense don't apply in America
