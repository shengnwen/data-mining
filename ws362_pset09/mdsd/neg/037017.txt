This book exposes nothing.  There are way-better books out there, better written and better researched.  I bought it after watching her much needed bashing of these retarded Neo-Cons on Bill Maher's show.  Here's the lowdown:  She grabs one subject and repeats it dozens of different ways, adding new twists, puns and jokes.  The book has no cohesive structure.  Like an ADD-sufferer on coffee. Worst of all, she was part of that system.  She gets divorced, and boom.  Her politics take a 180 degree turn.  How's that supposed to work?  If the payoffs from these interest groups are providing for your cushy life, it's good.  But if you divorce your Neo-Con husband, then, all of a sudden it's bad.  Honestly, I see a lack of integrity here.  So, if tomorrow she marries a communist, will she be singing Lenin's praises?  Or how about a devil-worshiper?  Will she go satanic? Then, I watched her devolve on Maher's show, constantly doing nothing but vent her anger at her ex-husband in a thin veil of politics.  She ran for Cali governor and her points were high.  Then, she started opening her mouth, and her points plumetted.  For good reason.  Because she ran a negative campaign against the Governator. (Which is exactly the same thing she acuses Neo-Cons of doing in this worthless book). But, of course, knee-jerk liberals love her, because they see her as a repented sinner who sees the error of her ways.  LET ME SUM UP THE BOOK FOR YOU:  A party holds on to power too long, it becomes corrupt.  Campaign reform is needed.  End of story
