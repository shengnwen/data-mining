The first page of this book reinforced my belief that no one should attempt to reproduce Jane Austen's writing style.  The cumbersome results always sound as if they were written by Mr. Collins. Presumption: An Entertainment is no exception. Hopefully, someone, someday will have the good sense to keep the wonderful characters that Jane Austen created, get out of their way and allow them to tell the story. It would be that simple if the right person chose to do it.
