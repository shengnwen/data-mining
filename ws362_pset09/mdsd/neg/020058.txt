I have never felt that I could participate well in guided visualizations.  That is exactly what this CD is.  If you visualize well and can imgaine well and summon raw emotions at someone else's mere suggestion, this may work well for you.  But it doesn't for me.  It just feels silly and like a waste of my time and money.  This is not my modality.
