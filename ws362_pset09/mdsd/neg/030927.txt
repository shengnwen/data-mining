I have read everybook Karen Kingsbury has written and I have to say that I struggled to finish this one. Most of her books are written with many plot lines, this book sad to say was very slow and boring. She attempted to make so much out of one thought and it did not work well. I hope that she returns to her previous style of writing. I would not recommend this book to anyone if that had not read her before. I am positive that they would be "left deflated.
