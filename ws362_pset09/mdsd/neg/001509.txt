This book was indeed a quickie, in more ways than one.  First of all, the romance came together too quickly.  Chapter two ceased the intensity of the infatuation stage when the two characters were already touching.  BORING.   Not that touching is boring, but when you read a romance novel, you like a  little bit of anticipation and challenge between your characters.   Secondly, I would liked to have read more about Graham and his relationship  with his long lost daughter.  Seems that the plot was quickly thrown in at  the last minute and wasn't very interesting to read.  Tug at my heart  strings with rekindled love, between family or intimates, and give me an  ending that will make me sigh.  Don't get me wrong, the story was cute, but  I think most romance readers like a little temptation and saavy, not a  steeple-chased love story
