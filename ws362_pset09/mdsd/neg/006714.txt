I found the story to be somewhat  flat.  I finally gave up  and put the book down permanently around Chapter 7.  That said, I found the reviews to be over-rated both on here and elsewhere.

Much like some of the other reviewers, I found the author repetious to a fault in her attempts at making Christopher the pig sound intelligent, cute, and cuddly. I think her inclination in doing so was a detriment to the story overall.  Besides---maybe it's me, but after reading a portion of this pig's antics, and from viewing a smattering of photos, I seriously doubt I would use adjectives such as "cute", and "cuddly" ever in describing him.  Some might argue that I missed something in not holding out and reading through 'til the end.  But my gut told me that by Chapter 7, things were pretty much as good as they were going to get, and I was wasting my time plodding along in hopes that things might actually improve.

I'm sure this pig did indeed bring alot of love and joy in both the owners, as well as other's lives.  However the book's retelling of Christopher and how deeply he influenced so many  others left alot to be desired, at least for this reader.
