This is one of those times when book reviews can be misleading. Fortunately I paid little for the book. I do realize this is suppose to be for "beginners" but I can't imagine anyone not understanding a subject this simple. There is also information I found questionable. In the section where he's talking about psychic attacks (what this has to do with using a pendulum, I'm still not clear on), the author claims that one of the ways you may be under 'attack' is: "Repetitive dreams are another indication". In all the years I've studied dreams, PSI and other related subjects, not once have I ever read this before, nor heard anyone mention this was a symptom of a psychic attack of any kind. There were far more ideas I questioned but there were so many, it would be impossible to list them all.

His ramblings on the subject of "psychic attacks" is pretty much just that, ramblings. In fact, the more I read, the more it became apparent the entire book is basically just rambling about - not much. I bought the book  partly based on the reviews (bad idea) and partly because I had hoped to add some more information on the subject to my library. Sadly, there was nothing in here that anyone couldn't find elsewhere and in far better books on pendulums and dowsing in general (which the author of this book mentions and I suggest you check those out if you are actually serious about the subject). 

This is another one of those books that helped give Llewellyn the reputation it finally achieved by paying just about anyone to write a book to make money, not to sincerely educate anyone. This publisher has produced a few good books, but it's books like this one that keeps a serious student from buying their products.

I did find it amusing that Mr. Webster did not/could not list other reviewers of his book besides himself. Unfortunately, I was not looking for amusement
