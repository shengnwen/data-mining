I adored the movie Moulin Rouge and the soundtrack is one my favorite CDs but the book was a great let down. I was hoping to find a written explaantion of how Moulin Rouge was made and to see pictures from this glorious film. Instead it seems more like an overpriced graphic novel. The fact that there is not one clear photograph of either Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor is ridiculous. Hopefully some one else will write a real book about the making of the film
