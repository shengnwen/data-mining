i usually never leave a negative review, but i'll make an exception here.  i loved the movie, a thousand acres, which motivated me to want to read something by jane smiley.  i chose horse heaven because i love horses.  i'd read seabiscuit a couple years before horse heaven, and really ejoyed that book.  horse heaven, i found, just dragged on and one with a myriad of characters that never developed into anyone that grabbed my interest or concern.  i kept thinking it would get better.  i plodded on.  then it became a goal just to finish what i'd started, but i didn't enjoy it much.  i bought thousand acres on dvd becuase the story was touching and realistic, not to mention the acting which was phenomenal.  this book was a waste of time and money.
