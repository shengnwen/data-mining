Unfortunately, this book misses the mark and is of little value.  Some of the information on the making of the documentary might be of remote interest to those interested in such things but the author is too enmeshed in the politics of the present and therefore fails to shed light on the past. For that reason, this book will probably have more value many years from now as people look back at the politics of the battlefield in the 1990s but even with that, it is limited as it lacks objectivity. My hardback edition has nice maps on the inside covers and a nice layout of photographs but that is hardly a reason to buy this book. 

For those interested in Indian primary source accounts on the Little Big Horn as a means of better understanding them and the battle, see the following:
W.A. Graham, THE CUSTER MYTH, a classic, no Custer library is complete without it.
Greg Michno, LAKOTA NOON, c. 1997, an excellent effort at bringing about a coherent synthesis of testimony and matching it to a plausible timeline of events.  Testimony summarzied and augmented by an excellent narrative that keeps everything on track.  Maps galore that are highly useful. 
Walter Camp, CUSTER IN 76, contains his notes on various interviews he conducted with Indian as well as soldier survivors.
Richard Hardorff and his numerous and excellent books that contribute to our knowledge, especially CHEYENNE MEMORIES OF THE CUSTER FIGHT; LAKOTA RECOLLECTIONS OF THE CUSTER FIGHT; INDIAN VIEWS OF THE CUSTER FIGHT.  With the recent placement of markers appproximating the places where Lakota and Cheyenne warriors fell, his book entitled HOKAHEY! INDIAN CASUALTIES OF THE CUSTER FIGHT is essential to have when visiting the battlefield.
