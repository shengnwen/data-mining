Ok I bought this as the download version instead of the cassette because I thought I was buying the version that alan rickman reads. instead there is this awful robotic voice that you can hardly understand. I've read the book myself before and loved it and figured it would be that much more incredible hearing it read by someone with a brilliant voice but I was of course mistaken in thinking this was it. Buy the cassette version and don't waste your money on this download
