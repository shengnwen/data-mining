While the  idea of having two of the most knowledgeable scholars of the noir film host a coffee-table art book on the topic sounds promising, the resulting product is heinously flawed.  Despite the brevity of the text, a blocky font makes it difficult to read.

Further, the large reproductions merely expose the grain, scratches, and dust spots that any skilled retoucher could have removed.
