Great idea for a book, but it felt really wooden. THe writing was stilted, the sister with cancer felt like a clumsy attempt to make the heroine seem likable and the whole thing felt really disjointed, like the author was putting in all the ingredients for a romantic comedy without really thinking about how it was all going to come together. None of the magic of Marian Keyes or Sophie Kinsella
