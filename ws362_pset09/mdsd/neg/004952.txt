This book is 692 pages and, I swear, it could be 69. The chapters are very tedious to read, though there is some useful information in it and ideas that anyone interested in the topic needs to know, but it seems like there'd have to be a more interesting and less repetitive (not to mention cheaper) way to do it. Typical dry, dry, dry textbook (the sole exception being the accounts by real people of their experiences with family members with special needs..those were very interesting and moving)
