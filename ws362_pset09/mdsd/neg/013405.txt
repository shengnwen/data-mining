As a student learning about signals and systems I needed a text that would supplement the teacher's lecture and help me learn more in-depth about the topic.  This text only skims the surface of every topic, as if to give a  brief overview.  Also, it talks about certain topics early on, but does not  go further into the topic until several chapters later in the book.  So  several chapters later, you are jumping back and forth trying to reference  the illustrations from long ago with the topic being discussed currently.   Though several references were made concerning an Appendix, a thorough  search of the book failed to produce one.  So all of the topics that say  &quot;go to Appendix B for further discussion&quot;, are not covered very  much at all.  I only opened this book a few times, if at all, during my  entire semester.  It was not worth what I paid for it
