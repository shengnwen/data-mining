1. It didn't teach me anything I hadn't already read in other books or learned on my own.

2. Stressed the importance of medication and ignored the plight of those (like me) who have tried pretty much every med on the market and experienced no relief from symptoms.

I was personally offended by the brief discussion of antidepressant side effects which, when mentioning sexual dysfunction, focused solely on MALE sexual dysfunction and completely ignored the fact that most females on antidepressants cease to experience orgasms. Apparently I'm a filthy whore who shouldn't be concerned with my sexual enjoyment
