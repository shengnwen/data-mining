I was very disappointed in this book.  I'm all for the light, "chick-lit" genre, but this book was really sub-par.  I felt like I was reading a grade school book report, where one re-words encyclopedia entries to avoid plagerizing.  The characters and movies depicted were laughable they were so bad.  I almost didn't finish this book and I honestly cannot remember the last time I did that. Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library and did not waste my money on it.  Rachel Pine should look for a different career.  Writing is not her forte
