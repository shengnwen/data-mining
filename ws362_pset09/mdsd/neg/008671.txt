while the subject matter of the book was interesting -and there are plenty enough reviews here without me adding to/detracting from that- my comment is a fundamental problem with the publishing/printing of the book: there are numbered notes of sources of the various claims made at the back of the book, but the text in the chapters of the book HAS NO REFERENCE NUMBERS. so, basically, you have no way of validating the claims unless you dig around the notes at the end of the book hoping to cross-reference the parts you're currently reading. every other non-fiction book i've read numbers their notes; why doesn't this book? steven d. levitt would ask to think about this, and maybe, just maybe, it's because some of his claims are tenuous at best. or maybe i just got a badly printed/published book. for the record, it was the hardback edition, published 2005
