I tend to agree with your first reviewer as to the "Adam and Eve"
features of this novel.
It is quite readable and fast paced, but its picture of 30,000 BCE
is "way off base" by the standards of modern knowledge.
As far as I can find there is no trace whatever of the "wide men"
(Neanderthals) in Africa.
There is no indication of Neanderthal stupidity, savagery and endemic canibalism ( they had bigger brains than Homo Sapiens sapiens).
"Modern man" dates back far beyond 30,000 years even according to the somewhat discredited "Eve" hypothesis.
For example Australia was actually settled as early as 80,000 BCE
by the Aboriginals, who are effectively modern man biologically.
As to the protagonists inventing clothing for the first time as recently as then, well that is farcical.
 Neanderthals in Europe were living on the edge of the ice sheets for a whole ice age before then!
 Perhaps they were very hairy indeed!!!
Over all the cover very much sums up the book.
Jean Auel did a much better job, especially in her later books.
