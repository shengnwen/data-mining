I am angry to say this book combines excellent information with some very grave anti-Christian bias.

On page 185, it introduces Matthew 12:24-26:

24: But when the Pharisees heard of it, they said, "This fellow drives out demons only in the name of Beelzebul, the head demon."

25: But [Jesus] knew how they thought, and said to them: "Every government divided against itself is devastated, and every city or house divided against itself won't survive.

26: So if Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself.  In that case, how will his domain endure?"


THEN in the commentary, on page 186, you read:

"The fellows themselves were divided on these options.  Scholars divided against themselves send mixed signals."


IF YOU ARE REALLY A XIAN AND STILL DON'T GET WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU, OH MAN, YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO READ JEREMIAH 5:21 AND EZEKIEL 12:2 AND PULL THAT BEAM OUT OF YOUR EYE RIGHT QUICK.


The above "humorous" "mixed-signal" is far from the only one.  The book may be worth having if you can't find any other study guide of similar depth.  But think "used", lest your money go into their pocket and support them in their deeds
