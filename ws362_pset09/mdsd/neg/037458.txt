I read this as a relatively young woman, and Lord did it make an impression on me.  It features many passages endorsing beastiality, something I find morally reprehensible.  If you agree, then BINGO! You now know to steer clear of this garbarge.  I'm not an advocate of book-burning, but I wouldn't mind throwing a few copies of this on a bonfire.
