I had the chance to meet Dr. Gill while at college in Ill.  While his prose is academic, but solid, it is not the book that is in question but the source.  Dr. Gill is a relativist, a liberal who supports special interest political views of the left.

While the title of building moral character is an admirable one, I for one question the moral character of the author himself.  Known to pursue projects with naked self promoting ambition, these personal traits defy the content of the book.

Accept the content, question the author
