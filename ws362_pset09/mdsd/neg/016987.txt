Not since St. Augustine has there been such a whining, carping screed begging for Christian inculcation by a celebrated intellect. I'm not even sure why this is a book. A cranky letter to the dean, and president of the alumni association would have served his purpose, and saved a few trees as well. 

Without going into detail, or needing to, you will find in a nutshell that Mr. Buckley feels it's fine for Yale faculty of faith to gently shepherd students toward Christian beliefs within their science and math classes, but it's a sin for the other, heathen, atheistic masters, to rampage through the clay of young minds and, in one semester, destroy the fragile faith of 18 to 20 years of Christian indoctrination. Pu-leese!

I'll grant you he was only 25, and at that time standing up for one's individual ideals was new, but why is it still in print!  On the other hand, in today's renewed climate of monkey-brained hysteria in the classroom perhaps it might seem to be time to dig up an old reactionary guru or two for validation. In fact, soon I wouldn't be surprised to hear that some addlebrained congressman was trying to pass a law mandating the teaching of Buckleism in schools.

Cool book title though!
