The Power of Gold is full of amazing and entertaining stories, so much so that I started to get suspicious about the scholarship of the work. I haven't got the patience to track down every story, but suffice it to say that the one story I did bother to research turned out to be bunk. On pp. 29-30, Bernstein describes a meeting between Solon and Croesus. I recall that Nassim Nicholas Taleb, in his book "Fooled by Randomness" (p. 10 of FBR) mentions that it "was chronologically impossible for the two men to have been the same location." Turns out, Taleb was right (no surprise there), but this casts serious doubt on the many wonderful stories that Bernstein blithely reports as fact. Bernstein should rename his book, "The Power of Cute Fairy Tales about Gold."
