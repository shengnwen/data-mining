 This book is old. Perhaps that is the only good part about it as it contains the scoring standards of the Army almost two decades ago. This book has only generic information on the topics of nutrition, grass drills, guerilla drills, cals, running, strength training, and rucking. The information is so basic that, provided you have any background in physical fitness, will be common sense to you. There are three workouts in the book which overlap each other and contain little or no detail. Do not purchase this book if you have any sense about military fitness
