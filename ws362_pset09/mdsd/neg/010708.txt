I typed in the ISBN of my text book SOM which is one of my most favorite books in the world.  I found the electronic version and bought it immediately as I will be taking a course on the Roots of Science of Mind and wanted an electronic as well as hard copy version.  Unfortunately, the electronic version is NOT the full text.  It does not even follow the full text version.  I was very disappointed and am still searching for the complete electronic version
