If you like stories then this is the book for you.  Gould does not discuss training until you are half way through the book. The training starts with introducing the dog to the field and the waist cord.  You will do better to look elsewhere for more in depth training information, especially if you need to start training at the basic level of come, sit and stay.  I would recomend "Game Dog" by Wolters.  He is precise and compasionate in his training techniques
