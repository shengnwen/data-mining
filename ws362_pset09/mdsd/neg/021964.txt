My Gawd!...Morrel apparently has lost his touch, that must be why he hasn't written much in the last 15 years compared to the Ludlums or Follets. The story itself was FANTASTIC, incredible, fast at a break neck speed. I read it in 2 days and I have never read a book that fast. But two things turned me off and they are, in order, as follows:
1. The hero (Chase Malone) in every face to face confrontation withg the Bad Guy(s), gets his ass whipped, repeatedly. Yet on each oppurtunity he is able to dispatch the good guys (C.I.A.) with one smack each.
2. The ENDING STUNK! All the reviews I've read mention something about a 'surprize ending'. The only thing surprising about it , was that IT STUNK.  

I guess I'll just go in the closet and dust off the old paperback copies of Brotherhood of the Rose, League of Night and Fog and Fraterity of the Stone...or are they in the basement?...Wait, no...I better check the garage....
