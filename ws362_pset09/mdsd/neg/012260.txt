I ordered this book along with Down the Rabbit Hole.  All the promotions would lead one to believe that I would learn more about the movie and the information in it.  The author is on a mission to discredit everything about the movie and the people and organizations associated with it, including me, the viewer.

This book is not worth the paper it is printed on.  I am disappointed that someone would take the time to write it.  The author says she is amazed that such a movie would be made.  The movie has much more credibility than this book. She has used the Bleep's populatity to promote and sell her useless book.  Any good review has to be planted.
