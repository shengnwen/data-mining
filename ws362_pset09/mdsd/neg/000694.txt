I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I feel the need to steer people away from spending money on this book!  This was a horrible waste of money, and of time spent in reading the first third or so I read before I quit.   Patricia Gunn Allen is not simply hooked on Political Correctness (which I could deal with).  She substitutes it for decent scholarship and for writing ability.  After the pointless detours into the legends of her own New Mexico Native American clan and 21st Century Physics, the attempt to relate the "myth" of Pochahontas to the Legend of one of the Kngihts of the Round Table (I think it was Gawain and the Green Knight, but I'm honestly not sure) did me in.  I wanted to know something about Pocahotas -- the Woman!  Or, as the title of the book says, the Medicine Woman, Spy,  Entrepeneur and Diplomat!  And that is what I could NOT glean from this book at all.
