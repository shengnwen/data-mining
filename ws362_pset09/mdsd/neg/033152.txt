As a stand-alone story (not a "prequel"), this book is relatively fun - if you can ignore the countless glaring grammatical errors and typos. I can't believe this made it past editing! 

As far as being a prequel to Barrie's Peter Pan, this book misses the mark. There are too many blatant inconsistencies for this to be anything but a shallower "re-telling" of Barrie's richly woven classic. These are not the characters we knew and loved; this is not the Never Land we dreamed about at night. Pixie dust is now nothing more than "space dust" which causes strange and unpredictable genetic mutations on contact. Need I say more
