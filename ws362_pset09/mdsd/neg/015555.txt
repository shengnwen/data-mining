If you are an animal lover, beware.  After reading part of Chapter 5 "Will You Be Amazed?", I closed the book for good.  Yes, I was amazed.  The author doesn't believe that animals have eternal souls.  Out of all the multitude of books I've read, this is the only one that eliminates the idea of our beloved animals in heaven.  Rest assured, if we make it to heaven, they will too, indeed.  In fact, we are also animals, mammals, just as our beloved dog & cat friends are!  So what I've read in Chapter 5 doesn't make any sense.  I'm very disappointed & won't ever recommend this book to anyone
