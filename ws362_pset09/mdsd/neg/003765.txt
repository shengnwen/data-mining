Macbeth V.v 25-30:
"A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." 

Stream-of-conscieness technique (no punctuation), southern accents (no spell check), mixed and matched timecrawls (flashbacks without warning), sequencing narrators (voice change with no scene break), first and third person viewpoints (confused yet?), and slapped-your-faceee! symbolism.

For literature, I choose Hemingway (who can be subtle or direct, but is always clear).  Good books should be enjoyable and understandable.  I understand the story Faulkner was trying to tell about a Jerry-Springeresque southern family, but I didn't like the novel.  If you want to enjoy dsyfunctional American families with blistering social commentary watch 'South Park'-- much funnier.  I'll let one of Faulkner's contemporaries speak:

"Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use."
--Ernest Hemingway

Unless you are forced into this book for a literature class, don't buy it and don't read it.  If you look hard enough, anything can become meaninful, even this tripe.  Victor Hugo, Shakespeare, and those ancient greeks are excellent in that their works have themes and meanings already.  You don't have to overanalyze and create meaning where none exists in order to enjoy those works.  

Faulkner is babble and murky and opaque with circular symbolism fading into tempestous violence only an idiot pretending genius or an eleemosynary prententious genius enjoying idiocy might love and obtuse run-on sentences longer than this one are exactly what you'll find all over this classical work
