The writing is very competent, but I had a major issue with the main character. Perhaps because I am so sick of seeing real life people in positions of power abusing their office, I have to give this book only one star. Cate Fante is a federal judge, yet when a man she picks up in a seedy bar dies under suspicious circumstances, does she come forward? No. Instead, she endangers the people around her. The other thing I took issue with was the casual way people address themselves in her private chambers: "Hey, girl, "Whatcha gonna do?" ad nauseam (OK, so that's Latin, but anything is better than this street-speak in halls of higher learning and judgment). I'm half way through the book and was curious to see what other readers thought. The only reason I might finish the novel is in the hope that this judge gets her just desserts, but somehow I don't think she will as the story is so contrived and manufactured
