I was expecting a workbook full of poems, instead there are a handful of poems and the rest are activities and coloring pages about the themes of the poems... which are great, but I wanted more meat... I was expecting poems along the lines of the &quot;Goose on The Loose&quot; and Bob Books. I guess I should have read the description more closely!! If I wanted a coloring book and activity book, I could have gotten one for far less than $10... 
 
 Maybe I am being too harsh, I will surely get some good use out of it as rainy day activties with my kids that will help reinforce some phonics. I guess it just wasn't what I expected
