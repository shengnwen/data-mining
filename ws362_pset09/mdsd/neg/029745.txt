If you want to read a book chock full of "company X did Y with a great result" with no followup on the long-term viability of what company X did, this is the book for you. Frankly, some three years after publication, I find it dated (unlike, say Blink, or Paradox of Choice). The book seems writtne around the 10th grade level. Perhaps of help to the pure consumer insight neophyte, but if you have studied CB at all, skip this title
