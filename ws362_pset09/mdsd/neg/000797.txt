Carp tells adopters exactly what they would like to hear: that adoption is a wonderful solution.  However, as an adoptee, I can tell him that the &quot;flawed studies&quot; he chides tell the truth.  People are hurt by  adoption.  Mothers have a bond with their children that transferring legal  rights to raise the child cannot  break.  When a mother loses the right to  raise her child, however, the child and mother suffer.  The &quot;genetic  bewilderment&quot; that Brodzinsky talks about, for instance, is something  I experienced firsthand.   Only after reading the term did I know how to  articulate the pain I've always felt.  Carp needs to talk to the adoptees  I've met in my life, and to the mothers who've lost the rights to raise  their children. I wonder what interest Carp has in promoting adoption
