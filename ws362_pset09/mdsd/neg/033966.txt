The typical airplane 'thriller', but on the long side, and 
unfortunately not thrilling.  The author hates government,
hates the French and the Chinese, and has an overdeveloped
sense of sadism.  The tone is flip/cool but the author lacks
even the modest talent of an Ian Fleming to pull it off.  The
hero is infallible, independently rich, and invariably 
attractive to beautiful but dangerous women, which only
adds to the dullness. There are much better books out there.
It is a sign of trouble when the gushing inside-the-cover 
reviews are from Booklist, Library Journal, a few paid sources, 
and the Shreveport Onion-Harvester Monthly. It is hard to
believe this was ever on an NYT best-seller list, but that's
what they claim
