Certainly it's possible to hallucinate or imagine one was abducted by "aliens," or to have false memories of such encounters. But, that's like dismissing all UFO sightings as a bird, plane, swamp gas or the planet Venus. I refer the reader to an outstanding book review by well-known physicist, author and UFO researcher Stanton Friedman. His review of ABDUCTED is posted on his website (which isn't hard to find.) He blows a whole so big in Dr. Clancy's conclusion that it leaves her book in shreds. Clancy's book is another example of a scientist who doesn't explain the Big Picture. Unfortunately, regarding aliens/EBEs, scientists are among the last to know what's going on. To balance Dr. Clancy's book, you are encouraged to read "ABDUCTION: HUMAN ENCOUNTERS WITH ALIENS" by John E. Mack, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School's Cambridge Hospital. (See Editorial Reviews of this book here at Amazon.com) This book is pretty good :-
