A few words to describe this book: vulgar, crude, and boring. I was truly excited to read this book when it was suggested to me. The idea of reading a sexual autobiography that was praised for not being another watered down censored bore, excited me. It only took me a totally of 50 pages to realize that I was stuck in the middle of someone's sexual nightmare. 

The book is exactly what it is, a blurred recollection of someone's sexual history from roughly about 20 years prior to writing the book. So what's so amazing about a women's sex life that it should be an entire book? Well Catherine M. was not interested in conventional sex, she was involved in countless acts of group sex, orgies and sex clubs. Interesting right? Sadly, No. Catherine explains that her remembrances of these encounters are vague due to her ability to block out what is going on. Her memory is a blur of sexual activity. Parties, men, women, sex, sweat, faces, [...]is, kissing...it's all a confusing mess of events. The entire book is paragraph after paragraph of vulgar/crude descriptions of her involvement during each sexual act she tries to remember. It's not sexy/steamy or interesting. Though my boyfriend seemed to be really interested in reading how raunchy she can describe getting DPed while sucking some guy off. Catherine M. should stick to Art Reviews, not autobiographies
