The Soul Weaver was a horrendous disappointment.  Although I dearly loved the first two books of this series and am a great fan of her 'Rai-Kirah' series (didn't care much for Song of the Beast), but this book falls apart at the seams.  The action is disjointed and the book feels sloppy.  To tell you the truth, I rather wondered if Carol Berg had died or was sick and someone else wrote into an outline for this book that they found lying around her house.  It feels as if someone else wrote this book.  At this point Daughter of Ancients (book 4 of the series September 2005) appears to be a risky venture.

They can't all be good reviews..
