This book, like many such collections (especially those that bring together papers from a conference), is tremendously uneven in quality.  There are a few good essays here--and they are by persons who have written illuminating and substantial pieces in the past.  And then there are a lot of weak essays here--pieces which do not get de Beauvoir right or which attempt without success to advance certain themes that are supposed present in her work.  The volume's introduction is especially flawed in this respect--as a piece of intellectual history or contextualization it is not bad (though not original either), but as a piece of philosophy it is . . . well, not philosophical.  Volumes by Arp, Berghoffen, and Bauer measure up very well to this collection
