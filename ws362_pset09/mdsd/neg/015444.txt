Mikhail Bakunin is often called the father of anarchism. To say the father of a theory, based on pure unrestricted freedom, is a man who has no belief but in socialism and the necessity to tear down religion/faith brings shame to anarchism. Many great quotes and thoughts can be taken from this book; on the other hand a multitude of delusion can be taken as well. To have the freedom of faith, to live as you choose; that is anarchism in its purest form. Bakunin's main attack against god(s) is their usefulness to the ruling party. A party that rules will pervert anything to keep that rule. So should a party use the name of anarchism, is that to say Anarchism is a tyrannical theory? Anarchism, faith, and religion are but words. The intention behind the belief is where a man should look. In Bakunin's world we would not have religion, or faith; we would not own property; we would work for the good of the whole at the expense of the individual. Our world would enter an atheistic priesthood, forfeit of all individual rights. Tyranny wears many masks. Bakunin's anarchy, his socialism, is nothing more than control. The greatest oppression an anarchist can ever force upon his/her person, is the belief that anarchism and socialism go hand in hand. In every theory, in every great thought for freedom, there will always be those who pervert a name, a word, a doctrine. I recommend this book as an example of such perversion
