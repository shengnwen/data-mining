Having read some of Richard Shusterman's previous books, I have to agree with the previous reviewer that Shusterman is one of the brightest, most interesting philosophers writing today.  However, this book, PERFORMING LIVE, is a disappointment: it reads like a boring grocery list that could have been written by a mediocre grad. student.  Where is Shusterman's usually sizzling, incisive intelligence?  Hopefully, his next book will be better
