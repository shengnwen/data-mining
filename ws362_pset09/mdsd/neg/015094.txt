I bought this book taking a real gamble that there would really be something in it about motorcycle riding and its affect on the soul.  If you are into eastern philosphy, you may enjoy this book.  If you are looking for a good book about motorcyle riding, this is not the one I would recommend.  I will say the author writes well - I think the title is very misleading
