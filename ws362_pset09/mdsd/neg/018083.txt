Extemely thoroughly researched, but author has gone astray with his novel, burdening the narrative with extraneous detail and long digressions that have nothing to do with the plot, which is convoluted and unconvincing. Characterization is weak,and, overall, the author seems to have ventured too far afield from his own expertise. That is, he seems to lack most of the tools of good fiction writing. Astonishing that the publisher seems to have put a fair amount of money behind pushing this book.
