I back-up a previous review stating that this is far from "A complete guide" to flipping properties.  I did a lot of research on the web prior to getting this book and found that there is a lot more valuable information out there for free than what I paid for in this book.  

For instance, he talks about assembling your Team.  He didn't even list a CPA as a member of your Team.  

Waste of money in my opinion
