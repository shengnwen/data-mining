It's a very informative book if you disregard the political tone of it. I wanted my husband to read something more than I could tell him about the Philippines but was a bit shocked with the amount of anti-Americanism in this book. The paragraphs on the Japanese influence was a little disconcerting. Have they forgotten that the Japanese came not to liberate the Philippines but to expand their empire? My grandfather fought the Japanese in the 2nd world war and my father remembers as a boy how they were so badly treated that his short history regarding the japanese influence is an insult to those who fought and those who perished under the Japanese. Instead on focusing on that, he focuses on the "evils" of the Americans. Looks like he'd rather have the Spanish and the Japanese rather than the Americans to have dominated the islands. Don't believe that people think that way in the Philippines. It's almost like Michael Moore writing a cultural review of the U.S. of A
