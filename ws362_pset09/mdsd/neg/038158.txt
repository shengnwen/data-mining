   This, however sad and compelling has some untruths, probably to enhance its dialog. Key elements mirror more of fiction rather than fact. There is no connection between Mr. Jilani and the late Mr. Pearl. Neither the FBI nor CIA has ever filed and charges against Mr. Jilani. An investigation was done based on a lie started by a group of nameless, faceless, unknown reporters. Sources in government have neither been quoted nor agreed to any of these allegations. Verses referencing a linking between Mr. Jilani the Daneils death should have been omitted. There is no official documented information by the New York Times showing they were even aware of any such meeting. One must ask themselves why honest publications choose to print unsubstantiated, unproven (alleged) facts and truths. Mr. Jilani himself has never been reported by any media; world wide in any documented statement approving, participating or celebrating Mr. Pearls death or events leading too. Nor did he ever express any anti-American or Semitic remarks that would suggest this was his character. Today's media is reluctant to mention Mr. Jilani has done many interviews in the past with out incident. Be care full of fact over fiction
