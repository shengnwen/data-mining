I am not one who can't handle any sort of violence or sexual deviance. However, after half of this book i had to toss it away because there was nothing redeeming about it. Every Character we encounter is wicked and sexually deranged. I need a shred of hope to contine reading especially if i am to endure such explicit rape scenes. ugh
