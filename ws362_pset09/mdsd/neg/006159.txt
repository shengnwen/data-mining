I really wanted to enjoy this book- I love historical fiction, am interested in this period of Italian history as well as in art history, and I love reading about 'impossible love affairs,' a la Romeo & Juliet, etc. Unfortunately, despite sticking with it far longer than I truly wanted to, I had to put it down and couldn't even finish it. 

It started off well and had a great premise- infamous maestro Rafaello meets his muse and his match in a poor baker's daughter despite being betrothed to the powerful Cardinal's niece- that never delivered. It was boring and drawn-out, predictable and lacked the ability to draw the reader in and allow connection with the characters.
