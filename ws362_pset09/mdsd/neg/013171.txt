I found this textbook to be utter garbage and a complete and confused mess.  Easily the worst text book out of my recent courses.(Campbell's Biology and Pasachoff's Physics are world's better.  I find it difficult to believe this is about as good of a book as an organic chem professor can write.  Very sad if this were true.)  A dearth of example problems make learning this far more difficult than it need to be.  This is made worse given the fact the problems for students at the end of the chapter don't build up bit by bit from earlier portions of the chapter until it ties it all together.  That's not even discussing just how few of these problems have any answer in the back of the book.(Since it's so easy to get a completely wrong but reasonable looking answer that's a big problem and pretty much means the solution manual has to be bought with it.  Almost seems like a scam to trick students out of over $200 by splitting the cost between two books.)  Also I get the impression that the authors have a crippling phobia of math and equations.(Just look at the end of chapter 7 where 2 pages of text could have been replaced by the equation for doing a SODAR calculation.)

Just utter garbage which isn't good given that organic is trying enough as it is
