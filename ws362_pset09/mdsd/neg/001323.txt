As a first time Baldacci reader, I expected at least an enjoyable read.  What I found was a book so poorly written, I couldn't complete it.  I skipped to the end to discover if the solution would be as predictable as it seemed from the outset.  Bingo!  

I could have accepted the unrealistic characters if only the dialogue had been believable.  Sadly, it is unimaginably unskillful.  

This is a banal, predictable, formulaic book.  If you are a reader who values words and style, best skip this one
