Delightfully short in length, "The Good Body" takes a mere hour to peruse and completely read...which is a blessing.  The repetitious cliches used to re-assure women that whatever the body form or shape, the body is good.  There is nothing new to enlighten or educate the reader, and nothing one hasn't read or heard beforehand.  Regardless of how compelling an argument in favor of an unaltered natural appearance the author puts forth, the bottom line is that in our global community looks and body shape DO still make a difference in a woman's life choices and success.  This feminist rhetoric is no different than that which has been preached since the onslaught of "Feel good about yourself" books in the 1960's, 70's and 80's.
