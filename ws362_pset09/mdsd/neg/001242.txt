On multiple occasions they recommend wearing "a dress over slacks" as a "contemporary style," ironically using the outdated word "slacks." Have you ever seen anybody wear this? I mean, without people pointing and laughing?

The dress over slacks idea generally summarises the character of What Not To Wear's fashion advice: Gross. Frumpy. Sometimes just plain weird. Granted, the outfits they "correct" in this book are worse, but only because the original outfits are inappropriate for the occasion in question. Their advised outfits are not technically inappropriate, just ugly, and certainly not the only stylistic alternative to the original like they seem to claim.

Their choices might not seem so disgusting to me and make me feel so defiantly resentful of everything they portray as "fashionable"  if they didn't claim to be some sort of godlike aesthetic authority, despite having no tangible style. But they DO seem to claim that they are taste embodied, which is clearly impossible. If such a thing exists it certainly won't be found in anything do with the What Not to Wear franchise
