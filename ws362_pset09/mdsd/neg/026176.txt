I am forever disappointed with the artists Mr. Moore pairs up with. I really wanted to like this book, I'm always thrilled when sex, especially female sex, gets the treatment it deserves as an acceptable, some would say necessary, part of fiction. But I've really had it with the artwork. Time and time again I've suffered through the graphic novels touted as fill with high literary standards but third grade artwork. I sincerely wish Mr. Moore would just write a prose novel as the artwork in this particular collection is so astoundingly bad that I could barely read it.

I believe that good graphic novels are a mutually beneficial pairing between good text AND good art; but what passes for good graphic novels, the ones that college professors feel comfortable regarding as art and literature, tend to be ONLY good text. Where are the standards?  I wish I could say I'm astounded that hardly anyone else has mentioned how bad the art is but it has been my experience that, for some reason, the masses cannot tell good art from bad. Or perhaps people are just so eager to flatter the V for Vendetta writer that they don't care what the art is like just so they appear avant garde and deep.

If you're looking for an interesting story and have no artistic bone in your body, then sure, buy it. But if bad art makes you cringe and weep, then you'd better leave the Lost Girls on the shelf
