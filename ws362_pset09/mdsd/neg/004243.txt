If this is the FIRST book you read on Competitive Intelligence - it is not that bad; It covers much ground at a fast pace.  However, if you have read any of the other books out on CI (Fuld's CI Blue Monster, or even Michael Porter's On Competition) this book is rehashed material that is too elementary to gain any sort of knowledge to furtherer your CI knowledge base.  I commend the authors for a good start - but was hoping for much more detail
