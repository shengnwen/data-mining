Overall I am disappointed in this volume, Hush Returns.

I collect all Batman Graphic Novels, and this is distinctly the least successful of any I have read in the last year or more.

It does not compare to Loeb's original "Hush" collection, or continue on from the conclusion reached in that collection. Do not buy it expecting a third part to the Hush story. 

Most graphic novels tell a tale (albeit sometimes with an open ending or as part of a series) that follows a story arc.  You have your traditional introduction, the bulk of your story, and then your conclusion. "Hush Returns" has no conclusion, the ending is far from satisfactory.

It's not all bad - the art is good, and some of the characterisation is quite enjoyable.  The timeline is interrupted by the happenings in "Under the Hood", which doesn't make it easy for the author.

I was shocked to see the Joker's backstory introduced, and didn't at all like the humanisation of Joker - which is very much at odds with his portrayal elsewhere in the DC Universe (ie as an inhuman maniac).

Having said all that - it's a Batman Graphic Novel, so if you're a Bat-fan, you'll probably buy it anyway.  Just don't expect brillance, and you won't be disappointed.
