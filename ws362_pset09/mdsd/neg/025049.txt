I am on amazon right now because I need to find a new textbook that is worth reading for my inorganic chemistry course. This book is garbage, it reads like an encyclopedia that was written by someone who already knows inorganic chemistry inside and out for someone who already knows inorganic chemistry inside and out. I had no idea the book was filled with errors because the book does such a bad job of explaining inorganic chemistry that I don't know what is being talked about most of the time. Avoid this book and if you can name a better inorganic chemistry textbook let me know.
