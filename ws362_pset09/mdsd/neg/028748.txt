I've always asked questions to my parents and pastor at church.  Some of the things we learned in school just didn't seem to add up with what was in the Bible.  Dinosaurs and fossils for example always fascinated me.  I still am interested in the ID/evolution debate and want to become well read on both sides of the debate before coming siding with on ideology over the other.  Behe fails miserably for the ID side, his several examples are all reiterations of the same idea that never is able to prove that evolution couldn't happen.  Either he doesn't understand the concept of evolution (doubtful) or he tries to appeal to an audience whom is not well read in science philosophy.  His arguments are faulty and logically can not lead one to believe that life could not have evolved from lower forms.  It seems to more I try to understand the ID side of the debate, the more I lean toward the evolution design side
