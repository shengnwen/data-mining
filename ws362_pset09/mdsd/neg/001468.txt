Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist.  He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution.   His retelling of the Divine Comedy, which appears to be based on earlier translations, is reasonably accurate and readable.  The problem comes with his notes.  They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive.  Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications.  This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as "that most heinous of sins".   And there are other similarly personal and inappropriate remarks. This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally of tune with Dante, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD.

There are many superior translations out there.  Mandelbaum's is excellent and has good notes.  Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and informative of all.  What the Modern Library had in mind when commissioning this translation, which is neither scholarly nor distinguished as poetry, remains a mystery.
