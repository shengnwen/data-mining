Of all the books I have read and discussed, there is one book that we never should trust...when I got this book out from the library I was all geared up for a great read...therefore was greatly disappointed as I read this book.  MacDonald is unfortunately negative about all of The Beatles songs, and in particular has it in for George and Ringo's numbers. I found that he did not have a single positive comment about any of The Beatles songs - no matter who wrote them. It makes one wonder why he wrote a book on them. If you are looking for a book with a positive approach to the Beatles masterpieces, this isn't the book you should be buying. I reccommend &quot;A Day In The Life, the Music and Artistry of The Beatles, by Mark Hertsgaard, instead of MacDonald's sloppy, single-minded musings. This book should be put to shame
