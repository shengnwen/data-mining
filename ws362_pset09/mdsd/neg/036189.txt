I am married to a Marine officer who is currently deployed to Iraq for the second time.  As you can imagine, most of our friends are also Marine families.  Additionally, my mother-in-law was a Marine wife for 35 years.  This book is not representative of myself, my mother-in-law, or of ANY military spouse either of us know.  Do not look to this book for an accurate impression of military life.  

I don't want to slam Ms Smiley.  She is entitled to her own life experiences.  HOWEVER, they are not typical "military spouse" experiences (far from it) so I am writing this review to make sure potential readers aren't duped into thinking this will give insight into the military life.  It doesn't, and it won't.  The spouses I know are the anti-Smiley.  The spouses I know are educated, capable, strong, witty, caring, giving, women.  The spouses I know would never behave this cowardly toward their military service member or be this careless with their marriages.  I shudder to think that readers would think that she represents me, or any other spouse I know.  

DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you want to learn real, interesting things about the military.  Read "Making The Corps" instead.  

Do not read this book if you like inspired, compelling story-lines.  Regardless of the military angle, the story is weak and the writing is bad.  Am I qualified to judge a good book?  Maybe.  I read about 25 books a year and I am fairly well aquainted with the best seller lists.  In the end, though, it's all about your personal taste.  Read this book if you like non-best-seller-list chic lit
