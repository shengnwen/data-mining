One has to admiire the longevity of Paul's career, but most of the images just lacked the dynanmic impact of Steranko or Neal Adams(2 industry icons)...not many can come close to these guy's but Paul's work always looked stiff and expressionless to me, although sometimes very pleasantly stylized. His finest work to me was the SABRE graphic novel and the MASTER OF KUNG FU comic series. the book just didn't do it for me. But do check out VANGUARD's other books, there are many treasures to be found
