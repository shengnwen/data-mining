Love the beer but found the book to be more a rambling stream of consciousness that doesn't really have a point.  It really seems to be just Sam's rambling thoughts and recollections of his startup.  There are some great anecdotes woven through the book (and I'm sure he has plenty that aren't shared).  He goes over some of the many questions that any startup should answer but the business advice in the book is fairly basic.    At the end of the day I'm not sure what the point of the book really was supposed to be as several subjects are visited repeatedly.  It dosen't go into the brewing in any depth and there's certainly not enough substance to call it a business book.  If your a really huge fan of the beer you may have some interest
