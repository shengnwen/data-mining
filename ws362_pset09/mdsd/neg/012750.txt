I find it necessary to include the fact that I read this book for class and not from personal interest.

Though I agree with previous comments that the book was well written regarding style and grammar, I found reading this book to be a laborious task.  The author subjects himself to an experience with drugs, vomits, does not wake up for several days, and then continues to subject himself to this...repeatedly.

If anybody wishes to know what it is like to experience various narcotic trips after a white rabbit and is not inclined to read Alice in Wonderland, this is for you.  The book is basically a series of accounts of one man's experiences with wacky weed and magic mushrooms
