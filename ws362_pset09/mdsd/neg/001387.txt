What made me buy the book was the cover for the sarong. I thought WOW, I already had ideas. Then when I received the book, went through the pics, [which they give closeups on the stitches] I was thinking, [Ive been had] The poncho they have only 1 though I dont like the pattern it gave me ideas and the yarn Richesse et Soie impossible to get,which I want for the high content of cashmere, from K1C2, and the silk ribbon form Artemis, you can't even find I dont think they do any more. I was truly disapppointed and have entertained the idea of sending the book back. There is more accessories [wristband, small pouch bag, alot of edging] than there are clothing. I was hoping for sweaters, better designs on hats/scarves. Save your money! :
