I don't keep up with every single Ludlum book, and when I bought this in paperback I'd just assumed it was one of his earlier ones that I'd missed--since I was aware that he'd died.  About 15 pages into it I found myself looking back at the front to make sure I had the right book--the writing style was juvenile.  It felt like a high school kid's first attempt at a spy novel.  

Then I looked at the printing date and realized I'd been ripped of by the publisher!  Ludlum did not write this, and it is so painfully obvious.  I trudged through another 100 pages or so--you know--figuring that I'd invested some time in it and it might get better. It never did.  

I admit to not finishing it and I know I'm not missing anything. Just to get as far as I did was a tedious chore.    Robert Ludlum would be writhing in his grave if he knew the slop that St. Martin's Paperbacks is peddling in his name
