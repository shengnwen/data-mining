What can you call a woman with a Bryn Mawr education who makes fun of a 10th grade drop out from the south because he, like about half of the other people from his socio-economic background, mispronounces the word "ask" as "axe"...?   An arrogant idiot!  And one who knowingly and for profit perpetrated an indelible stain on an American tragedy, and further muddied the waters for future researchers.

And unlike contemporary audiences of this unfortunate work, the modern reader now has access to the knowledge that both McMillian and her husband have been exposed as known CIA assets and propagandists.

This book is a good way to waste 6-8 hours of your life that you can never get back, is based on what the writer knew to be bald-faced lies, and is presented in an insultingly smug manner.   This book isn't worth the matches it would take to set it on fire.
