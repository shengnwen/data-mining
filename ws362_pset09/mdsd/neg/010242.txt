A friend recommended Sue Grafton. So, I read her latest, and after the first chapter I nearly put it down. The ridiculous love life of an 87 year old stud almost did it, but then the crap about his family...well, I wanted a mystery, and all I got was soap. Fortunately, I checked the book out at the library, otherwise I would have asked for a refund
