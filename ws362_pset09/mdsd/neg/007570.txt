I'm an ACE-certified personal trainer and was looking for some good information and new exercises to use with my client who is in their 60s.  This book took basic strength training exercises and had a picture of a senior doing the exercise.  Nothing in this book was new to me.  If you are a physically active senior, this book may be all right for you.  If you are a senior who has been sedentary or who is looking to improve upon daily activities of living, this book may not be right for you
