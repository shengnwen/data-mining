This book and Hogg's parenting philosophies if anything induces stress and guilt in new moms. Some of it isn't even really logical. Five archetypes of babies? Take your new baby on a tour of your home? And her foolproof E.A.S.Y.? Jeez! IF it only were as easy as she claims it could be. I didn't like her condescending tone in her anecdotes about parents that can't or don't embrace her "E.A.S.Y." plan. Parenting by acronyms--rubbish
