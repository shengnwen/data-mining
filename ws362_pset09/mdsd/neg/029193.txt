I just wonder if this would have been published without the author's being married to an author;  I find his stuff repetitively boring as well.  This is a simplistic story of an orphan wife who acts as though she can't stand her husband and seems to glory in anything she can do to upset him  Her friend in these endeavors is an obviously manic / depressive (sorry, term has been replace by bi-polar victim ) whose wealth seems to make her the star.  Their enemy is the EVIL (can't use that word either) Eagle Forum which is trying to close down the local store where the kids get their drug paraphanalia.  It seems that both
ladies have problems (oops, not allowed any more by the political correctness police, I mean 'issues') with their male counterparts.  They act like they hate their husbands. 
I'd recommend this to anyone who hates Religious people and loves to see kids getting in trouble with drugs.  A dog . .
