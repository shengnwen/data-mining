I was very disappointed with this sequel to Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife.  Berdoll spends far too much time developing new characters that she has created, and far too little time telling much new or interesting about the title characters.  More than half of the plot lines are spent on people far removed from Pemberly or the family, only to bring them together for a brief if memorable encounter in the end.  I think that the characters had some merit, though I picked up this book to hear about the Darcy's family life.  I found the entire first half of the book to be extremely tedious and had a difficult time getting through the chapters.  One main complaint is that the author takes the same information and re-examines it, then re-examines it again, and so on, and so on.  Often from a slightly different perspective, but very dull all the same.  I am appalled that she has bound it as a "new" story and feel that she saved herself a lot of time and creativity by not including nearly as much original material.  
As for the over-attention to the Darcy's sex life, well I guess I am not a devotee of romance novels and though I like the characters, I get very bored very quickly with the repititious love-making.  It is too bad that these dominated the chapters written about the Darcys.  Overall, I found the second half somewhat interesting, but am sorry that I wasted my money on it.  It could be worth borrowing though
