I recently re-read this book because the moment I read "The End", I forgot everything that happened in the book.

My initial purchase of To Marry the Duke was based upon the lush, sensual cover and the fact that it was based on one of my favorite historical eras; the Gilded Age of America. 

Based upon my re-reading of this romance, I was disappointed. MacLean has a clean, coherent prose and dialogue that had it's shiny moments, but the shoddy plotting and the one-dimensional characters overtook it most of the time.

I would have believed Sophia's instant infatuation with James if his (false) courtship had been a contrast to the cool treatment she recieved from the English society. Consequently, once James has married, bedded and ignored her, she accepts his trickery of her as though she deserved it. Sophia is supposed to be a spunky, warm American to blow some heat into James' heart, but she came across as a doormat who would do anything for a man who had betrayed her trust.

James' tortured past was very vaguely alluded to, leading me to be very skeptical of his behavior as well as his falling for Sophia at the end of the book. His one-dimensional character, combined with the fact that most of the book was in Sophia's point of view kept me at an emotional distance from him.

James' family was cardboard as well and the "mystery" surrounding them with the French courtesan was sloppily done and read as though it was put into the story to make Sophia look like a hero and open James' eyes to how wonderful she was.

All in all, this was a passable read. Sophia's doormat perfectness and James' vague aloofness, combined with hither and there plotting made what started off a somewhat sparkling and stand-out historical romance into a read I forgot as soon as the pages were closed
