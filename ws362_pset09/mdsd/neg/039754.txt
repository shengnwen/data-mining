I enjoyed Odd Thomas, the first novel in what is becoming a franchise for the author. I consider it one of Koontz's better efforts, but Forever Odd is no Odd Thomas.  It's a tedious, sometimes painful read.  

The biggest let down in Forever Odd is the cartoon-like villain.  She's annoying, not the least bit interesting, and more pathetic than she is menacing.  

The plot itself is thin.  Koontz stretches things out, giving us more detail than we need about the tunnel system beneath Pico Mondo and loading his sentences with as many adverbs and adjectives as he can.  Odd himself was endearing in the first novel but in Forever Odd his musings get too preachy for my taste.  The life affirming ending was meant to be poignant but I found it sappy. 

And was Koontz serious when he killed his villain by random cougar attack?  A cougar?  Really Dean?  That's the best you could come up with? 

Sometimes Koontz hits, sometimes he misses. Forever Odd is a miss.
