This book was strikingly similar to The Thin Red Line.  The characters, the use of literary techniques, the settings and subsettings all similar.  However, Mailer and Jones did not get it right.  These books don't tell the true story of war.  They certainly dipict physical side of war, the torn land and the carnage, but it is the personal side of war that they miss.  In this book Mailer fails to capture the true essence of human nature.  Because the fact is people at war depend on each other.  Mailer and Jones display the rivalries among the men.  Ofcourse, rivalries are common in the young men the write about.  Men at war do not often get along together, you always have the jerks and the sadsack, but they bond far more than they compete.  No fiction I have read regarding WWII has managed to capture this.  The Naked and the Dead is just another example of the dry, monotonous, and even lousy world war fiction that has been written.  I truthfully cannot explain all the great reviews on this book, it is very very average.  You want to know what it was like, read Stephen Ambrose, Gerald Astor, or Eugene Sledge
