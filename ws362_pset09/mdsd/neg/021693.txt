I have read a number of whaling/mutiny/lost at sea books in the last decade or so and was surprised as I trudged through this volume and found that the bits of fact and history were highly peppered with the author's own opinions and interjections. There is a lot of moralizing here, almost sermon like at times, and it completely gets in the way of the story. Heffernan may have been better served writing a novelization of this terrible and bloody event rather than a "history" as his histrionics many time take center stage. The book isn't terrible. It gets the facts across. But the best part of the book is actually the appendix that presents the actual journal of George Comstock (the mutineer's younger brother) as well as a few other historical tidbits. The story would have been much better served by a telling of the facts without all of the personal insight. I have purchased a copy of "Demon of the Waters" and am looking forward to a more direct approach to this wild story
