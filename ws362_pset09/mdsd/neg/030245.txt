This book has glaring errors in the chapter regarding Dr. Gary Kildall and CP/M.  The author trashes DOS as a "slapdash clone" and a "rip-off" of CP/M, which is simply untrue.  Tim Paterson, the author of DOS, is in fact suing the publisher and the author over numerous misrepresentations in the book.  Save your money and get a book that is better researched
