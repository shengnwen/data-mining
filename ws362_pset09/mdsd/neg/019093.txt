This book is not worth one star. I haven't even finished it, but I don't think I will. The characters are sooooo boring. I can't find the romance that I like about Jo Beverley's books. I am an avid reader and find myself diisapointed lately with the "Historical Romances" This book is not worth reading. Maybe if I had read the first book it might be different,but I don't think so
