If you want to learn anything new about JFK jr. do NOT read this book.  The book is basically one long whine-fest about why the magazine "George" failed (hint to Blow: because it was stupid!).  Richard Blow apparently saw in the death of Kennedy his one shot at fame--nothing else had worked.  Don't waste your money on this one
