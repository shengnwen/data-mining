Although I did not get a chance to read the book yet, but I heard the author present her works at the C-Span2 Book Review channel over the weekend. From her talks, the book sounded a lot like the recollection of the times of the great minds put together at Los Alamos, and her recollection about Feynmann's adventures sounded to come out of "Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynmann"..where he recounted his safe-cracking days, among other jests he used to pull to entertain himself in the middle of nowhere.

But what really hit the wrong nerve, was her recollection of history, where she discounted the severity of the Normandy Beach VS the clashes in the Pacific Ocean with the Japanese, and then she went ahead and justified the use of A-bombs on Japan.  Although the clashes in the Pacific must have been rough..but at the sametime, US had the upper hand and the priveliege of breaking the encrypted traffic of the Japanese, and they easily countered them at their next move in the Naval fights.

Perhaps in describing the above, the author has easily forgotten all the efforts US diplomats over the last 50 years have put forward in writing and verbose to condemn and apologize the pains brought to the Japanese, by the usage of the A-bombs.  

I really question the intent of the author by putting forth such irresponsible views, amidst the hostility the world is living in today.
