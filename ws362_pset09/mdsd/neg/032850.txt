This book was recommended to me by an actual SPY!

I found it boring. The characterization of Russians, Israelis, and Arabs were very heavy handed and charicaturish. more precisely, the character of the Hezzbolah Sheik was totally unbelieivable, he seemed to say things that would be impossible to imagine someone in his position saying.. really bad boring stupid book which i threw away a quarter of the way in!

This is absolutley not like early lecarre with his subtle characters and nuanced plots.

Thumbs down
