Most of Catherine Coulter's stories are good. Not The Target. This one starts off with the main character, a judge, deciding to secretly keep and care for a kidnapped child he found in the woods. He can't stand the idea of anyone else trying to care for her - including her parents. His reasoning is frightening, to the point that I wished he would have been arrested for his illegal acts, including kidnapping and washing down a rape victim. Sorry, Catherine. This one was really off Target.
