I found this book useless in respect to history. I was looking for a historical documentary but found a political afterwar pamphlet full of anti-nazi propaganda. I read a few historical reviews, in my opinion this boock is full of lies. Specially taking in concern that this author discredited himself already a few times during his lifetime.
He is an unreliable source, the Russians were the first to Berlin, he wasn't fluent in German (had to rely on translators), and his interviewed sources proved to be liars. That book who so many have relied on since it's publishing is best used as a door stop.
