20 odd years ago, when all I was reading was SCI-FI and fantasy, my mom insisted I read Ludlum's Bourne Identity. I remember really enjoying it and read several others of his through the years. Looked forward to and enjoyed the movies, but alas the Janson Directive, while fasted paced, offered me nothing new. Maybe it was the two recent movies with the agency's secret program always chasing someone, maybe those intervening 20 odd years of thrillers, suspense and techno thrillers made me an informed consumer.... Close but no cigar. Too many expected and predictable almost caught `yas / barely get-a-ways / one-ups-manships between the master vs. the disciple. I think today's readers have seen more than their fair share of someone being tracked by their best pupil or for that mater dusting off some ancient Obi-won to dispatch their star gone rogue to enjoy this book.
