Dave Barry's novel is a quick read, but there's nothing fresh about the story or the characters.  The story centers on many different characters that become involved in a potential airport disaster--a columnist, his son, a rich, sleazy lawyer, a wannabe criminal, etc.  Like Elmore Leonard's books, the characters begin to collide in unpredictable ways.  But the pay-off is just not that great.  You may find yourself thinking "What's the point?" after finishing the novel.

This book was made into a pretty forgettable movie that featured a great cast (Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Stanley Tucci, Tom Sizemore, etc.)
