I first read about Jack Parsons in the L.A. Times and it got me intrigued.  When I bought the book I thought it was going to be filled with nothing but his eccentricities and that's wanted I wanted to read.  But it got real technical.  Pages of his U.S patents which I did not find interesting.  The author did his homework as far as the smallest details of Parson's life.  Going so far as to tell you where Parsons lived (and dates of residency) and he moved quite a bit.  I did enjoy reading about the relationship he had with Alister Crowley and L. Ron Hubbard which portrays him (Hubbard) as a con man he is.  Basically, it's a technical book that I feel didn't quite hit the mark.
