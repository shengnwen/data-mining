My son enjoys the Olivia series immensely. "Missing Toy" and "Saves The Circus" are on their second copies at my house due to the wear and tear of the originals. We looked forward to "Forms A Band" and were delighted to finally get it at our local bookstore. Disappointed at the results puts it mildly. It is a disjointed mess, with a terrible ending (and if the end is political message, that is just awful and inappropriate)Olivia has lost her edge which is why we love her and the imagination scenes showed none, which is unusual for this series. Ours lasted two reads before it was pushed aside for one of the vibrant other Olivia books. I would buy this book only to complete a collection and nothing more. It is terrible. I would give it 0 stars if I could
