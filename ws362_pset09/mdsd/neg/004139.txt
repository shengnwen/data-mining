I've looked at IJ books on the shelves for years, but never read any of her work.  This was my first IJ book and sadly I would not recommend it.  Countdown is very clearly a part 2 or part 3 of something she wrote previously.  

The first part of the book is full of people showing up with no character development at all.  At first I thought it was just really poor writing, but then it dawned on me, this is a part 2 of some story started previously.  As I continued reading, the vast majority of the story flashes back to previous events, characters, conflicts and plots from part 1, whatever that was. 

I think IJ owed it to her readers to mention this as a continuation.  It would be a huge help for new IJ readers (like me) so we could read part 1 first. 

Then again, maybe the lack of character and plot development is typical for IJ.  Countdown was supposed to be about a bomb plot, yet 2/3's of the way through the book the bomb has received only a sentence or two of coverage and across the entire 500+ pages, it warrants less than a full page or two of mention.

Countdown is more of a romance/love story than the thriller it is marketed as.  If you go into it expecting a romance, you'll probably enjoy it.  If you're looking for a thriller, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for an ending, look elsewhere.
