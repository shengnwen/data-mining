This book takes a fascinating subject---the lives of Gypsies in the USA---and reduces it to anthropological formulae and scholarly babble. It might be impressive to other anthropologists, but it's largely unreadable  to mere mortals. It's a shame, because obviously the author has done some  interesting research on a people that are hidden within our midst
