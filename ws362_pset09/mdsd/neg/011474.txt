This book may be helpful as an VERY BASIC introduction to making your own altars.  
*If you like the concept of altar-making, but feel intimidated or lost about them, then this book would probably help make you feel at ease about creating your own.  

THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR AN ARTIST. 

Anyone who already feels comfortable making an altar will need to be *VERY PATIENT* to find the new ideas scattered throughout.  So far, I have lost that battle of patience. 

I was expecting a contemplative, image-rich publication.  
Instead I got a book with images that are uninspired & a lot of text that is not insightful. 
The photos chosen look ameteurish & many are rather bland nature shots, or of home decorations/ potential altar fodder.  

My main disappointment was that all the altars look like they were made by the same person and none of them are very aesthetically exciting.  
One of the altars near the end of the book appears to feature a sheet of tinfoil underneath. 
The book includes ideas about ritual use of an altar that may be new-- even  to someone who has made altars, performed sacred rituals or explored symbolism. For me, the tinfoil effect is making it hard for me patiently sift through to the new ideas.
