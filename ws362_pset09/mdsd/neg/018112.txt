Delores Cannon certainly gives us an interesting view into the lives of the Essenes.  Built on the assumption of reincarnation and the possibility of past life regression, she attempts to show much detail of the times and peoples that were the Essene community, and ultimately, the life of Christ.  While it certainly is interesting reading, it is completely devoid of corroborating evidence.  She tends to agree or disagree with Archaeologists (never saying who her sources are), depending on whether they agree with her research.  Also, she supports the validity of her story as being more authentic than the Biblical account, as she claims to have an older source, a teacher named Suddi from the Essene community.  Some problems include the fact that while she claims the Biblical record has been changed, she seems to forget that the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran actually show the accuracy of the Biblical record, by moving the Old Testament back 1100 years, and yet with no significant changes.  It seems that her purpose is to promote her own view of reality, than to deal with any real historical evidence.  While it's an interesting story, I have to deeply question that there's anything resembling true research or evidence in this book
