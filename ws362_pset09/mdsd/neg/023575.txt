From the land of pseudo-science, written in a didactic approach (like a good professsor should), comes this years winner for economic creativity.  Full of theorum, statistics, abstraction, complexities, cute little pictures and sometimes difficult to grasp, this book has some interesting and refreshing perspectives including how certain natural behaviors parallel the same behaviors found in investing. 

That said, I feel some of this stuff is just intellectual ramblings with not much real basis for pragmatist investors. 
I can see the pseudo-intellectuals quoting this stuff at the company Xmas party. The author quotes Warren Buffett's "people make simple things difficult" philosophy yet writes a book that goes out of it's way to make "simple things difficult". 

Although the book provides a different angle to view investing from, I did not walk away from this book feeling that I gained any newly found insight about investing. 

To save the reader time and money, (and not to oversimplify) the basic investing premise I obtained from this book is "investing is like gambling---you win some, you lose some" and to minimize risk, one should "just BUY and HOLD solid investments" and, ultimately, let TIME be your best friend
