The Kirkus review says it all. I wonder if Michener did more than preside over this book rather than write it himself.  It seems driven by research his staff has unearthed about retirement homes, death and diseases.  He then weaves a weak story, with corny dialogue around this information and calls it a novel.  It would get little attention if his name wasn't on it
