This was the worst darn book I ever read.  I read it last year and never want to read it again.  It was about a person who turned into an owl and called chinese food "food of the gods."  Don't make the mistake of buying or reading this book.  It was terrible.  I hated it.  If you like dumb books, definetly buy this!!!!!!!
