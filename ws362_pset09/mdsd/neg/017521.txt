Dharma states in her book that the thymus has limited function, only secreting immune factors. Thousands of medical articles and numerous excellent books on the thymus have been produced in the last hundred years. Not only does the thymus control your brains health, secrete neuropeptides that strengthen and mature cells ability to recept neuropeptides and fight infections in the brain, the thymus prevents autoimmune diseases by producing new MHC restricted CD3+, CD4+ t-cells that recognize self from non self, prevent death from AIDS & chemotherapy by producing new mature tcells, and to top it off, articles have been produced on the thymus preventing aging, one staying women age slower than men because their thymus shrinks/involutes slower and many interesting papers on hayflicks limit and telomerase (the enzyme that makes cells live forever) which is produce by the thymus to prevent aging. Normal cells replicate apprx. 80 times and die, telomerase allows them to live over 600 replications with no damage! Please see medical references below.
