I just got this book and I'm very disappointed; even thought, I haven't prepared a thing. There is some picture but it doesn't reference the name of the food that's in the picture. How do I suppose to know the recipes of the food that's in the picture? For most of the pages, it doesn't have a picture of the food....it only recipes. I don't know how the food will be taste like or looks like? If there's a picture, you would say that's looks good but there's no picture. There are millions of recipes, do we suppose to know what's good or not; without providing a picture or sampling it? When a food looks good, people will try to prepare it. If you not a Thai, then you will be very disappointed because you'll not know what your food looks like when you try to prepare it
