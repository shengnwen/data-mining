My husband, John Berg, was the art director of many of the covers in this book. I looked in the index to find where they were and I was amazed that a book on the subject of the album COVERS would not have a listing for the people who created the album covers. Listing the albums by recording artist and listing by album name is fine but the subject of the book is the ART on the covers, and yet the art directors, while buried in the text under the pictures of the individual album covers within the body of the book, are not singled out in an index. A person researching the work of John Berg, or Bob Defrin or Paula Scher would have to KNOW the album title or the band in order to see the work.  That's ok for a book about the bands, or the music or even the decade, but if it's about the cover art lets have it BE about the cover art- there should have been an index for the ART PEOPLE: the illustrators, the photographers and the art directors...so for someone interested in who did the covers rather than just what they look like this is not the best book, no matter how well it's printed
