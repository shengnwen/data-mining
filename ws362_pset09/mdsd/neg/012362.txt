This is the ONLY Heinlein work I don't like and have read only once, and I've read everything he wrote that I could get my hands on for more than thirty years (since I was a teenager). I've literally worn out multiple softcover copies of several of his novels, and starting to do the same in hardcover, especially "I Will Fear No Evil" and "Time Enough for Love." I'm sorry to say, however, Heinlein completely lost me with "Job"- it's not a 'comedy,' it's a travesty
