Collins' book is a shortsighted and often rude introduction to the Old Testament and its corresponding history of interpretations.  Collins treats his modern vantage point with such arrogance that it is simply  embarassing to read him dismiss the OT as 'legendary and folkloristic' without providing evidence for such claims.  Certainly there is better scholarship out there, if at least more humble.  Teachers and students can do much better.
