First of all let me start off by saying that Vine Deloria is amazing as a writer, as a philosopher, and I will say as many good things about him as I can. He's brilliant! I've read many of his books and yet he never fails to impress me.

My problem with him? As much as I like him I have to say he constantly seems to discredit himself with his hatred of Christianity. Now, quite frankly, I do not blame him, look at what many did to his people. 

Now, he has done nothing wrong with expressing his viewpoints but it almost goes to the extream of a blind hatred if you will. The Native Americans especially the Lakota express constantly that they teach peace and respect for all cultures. 

Even though I myself have issues with the church, at some points just reading I had to step away because it truely felt like there was such an intense hatred and anger. 

I would recommend this book but be prepared and mostly take what he says about Christianity (if you are a firm believer etc) with a grain of salt-it is at this moment you will have to just realize he's just nothing more than a bitter old man who remembers, is not yet trusting of the white man or his faith, and refuses to release his anger.
