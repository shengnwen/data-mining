I bought this book excited by the premise and found it to be a sad disappointment. Populated with gross stereotypes, misrepresentative of the Faith, and full of poorly-constructed two-dimensional characters made colorful by circumstance rather than spirit, Rinaldi takes a beautiful piece of Church Lore and turns it into a relativistic anti-Catholic romp. Propaganda at its worst.  Irredeemably convoluted if not downright hateful
