To begin with this review does not deal with the whole of Sokal and Bricmont's work, only with the chapter on Deleuze.

In essence all the authors do in this section are quote long passages from Deleuze work (and his collaborations with Guattari)that deal with the philosophical issues surrounding scientific concepts (or functions in Deleuze terminology) and then make a pejorative comment without any substantiation. 

For example "the end is totally devoid of meaning", "...the end of the passage is meaningless" , "it is devoid of both logic and sense."  Those parts of the quoted passages that the authors, as any careful reader, do not find "meaningless" are dismissed as "banal observations" or "sometimes banal" or dealing with issues in the philosophy of science that the authors believe were settled for ever 150 years ago and so we may imply should never be discussed again.

It is possible, I guess, that a rigorous scientific analysis of Deleuze philosophical writings may be able to point out some scientific error, but the authors offer nothing but unproven ejaculations that would seem to say that anything correct in their opinion is so obvious it is not worth saying and anything they have not been able to understand has no meaning at all. 

Sokal made his name by perpetrating a hoax and that seems to be the pony's only trick, too bad
