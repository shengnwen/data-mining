I rented the CD book from the library. I do not write long reviews but instead like to point out the major flaws or good points.

The storyline is OK. However the sheer banality of the diaglogue is almost staggering. The average emotional and mental IQ of the characters is extremely low. These people are not interesting!!!!!!!
