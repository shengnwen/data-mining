John Cooney had it out for Cardinal Spellman right from page one. I don't think there was any other reason for writing this book except to bash Cardinal Spellman. I don't think there was ONE good thing he had to say about the Cardinal.  He went out to find the worst in him and whatever else Cardinal Spellman may have done that WAS good, Cooney made sure he made it look bad.  He made Cardinal Spellman out to be the worst, most despicable Catholic cleric  ever upon the earth.  And I think it must be mostly untrue and very unfair.  Sure, lots of politics, lots of religion. They don't always mix well, but Cooney just didn't like Spellman's brand of politics mixed with religion.   Religion won't get you anywhere. Just remember, 'it's not what you know, but Who you know'
