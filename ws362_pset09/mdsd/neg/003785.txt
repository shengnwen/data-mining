Hersh obviously doesn't like the present administration. He obviously has a beef with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. "Chain of Command" is a political rant with a lot of claims, but not much support. He rarely supports his claims with facts, and his arguments are clearly not-logical. He begins his book by claiming that the Interogations at Guantanamo have had no results, that the intelligence wasn't satisfying the needs of the Pentagon. This obviously isn't taking the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed into account. He pushes forth the idea that the "Failing to Gain Intelligence" from Guantanamo, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld decided to solve the problem by spreading the practice of abuse to Iraq. That is illogical. 
By simply doing your own resarch you will find that this, and many other claims made by Hersh in this novel are exaggerated, falsified, misquoted, misinterpreted, etc. This book is libel against the soldiers who have fought or are fighting in the War on Terror. Anyone who ever took a prisoner is touched by this calumny.

I'd also like to say one more thing about the scale of the abuses: There were 66 allegations out of 300 that were substantiated. These substantiated allegations have been or are in the process of being investigated and prosecuted. Those numbers represent such a small fraction of the people who have fought  and are fighting this war, it is tempting to say it is negligible. But it's not. It's a redundant proof that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen are not war criminals. With very few exceptions these young people are true to American values even in the worst and most dangerous circumstances.

Hersh is part of the Blame America first crowd. This book is proof of that. It is nothing but an unsubstantiated, unsupported conspiracy theory intended to smear the present administration.
