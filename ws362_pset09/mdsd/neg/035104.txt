After reading the bad reviews for this book I checked it out from the library, and I must say it is indeed trash. After I saw the author trying to assign certain loa to the kabballah I hardly even wanted to skim through it. But I forced myself to -- and was not impressed by anything.

Don't waste your money or time on this book
