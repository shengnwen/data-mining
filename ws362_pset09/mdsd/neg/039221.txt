Several women recommended this book to me quite highly - meaning you may enjoy it. I certainly didn't. The story was predictable and repetitive. Elephants suffering the atrocities of man wander around the plains aimlessly searching for each other, their holy grail (a white bone) and/or the promised land. The elephants kept getting killed or dying from exposure to the barren elements. It was written in a "matriarchal feminist style" that would very much have appealed to me in my early twenties but which I'm rather tired of now. It is unlikely this story will appeal to many men. I read through to the end expecting to find some meaningful take away. I didn't. It was just another story of the suffering and despair brought by human cruelty. If you already know this, don't torture yourself with a 327 page reminder of the fact
