I feel for the HSPs in the world.  In many respects, I am one.  However, this book had a pervasive pointlessness to it.  Despite the promising title, the book offers little of substance.  What's worse, it thoroughly confounds two separate traits: emotional sensitivity and sensitivity to one's environment.  The two are vastly different and jamming them into one trait, "sensitive," misses much ground for exploration.  I was excited to start the book the first time I started it...and I never got very far.  I started it again a year or so later wondering, "why was it again that I never got very far in this book?"  I figured that out rather quickly.  I doubt I'll pick up this book a third time
