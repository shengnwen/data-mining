At a risk of offending Joseph Campbell cultists and fantatics, please know that I am both an admirer of Joseph Campbell and James Joyce. It was through Campbell's praise of Joyce's work, that help muster the discipline it takes to read Joyce. I'll give credit where credits due--thanks Joe!

Now here's my beef. I suspect that it's takes a man with a healthy ego and a sense of academic competitiveness to want to incorporate Joyce's work into a grand blanket scheme, such as Joseph Campbell did with many of Joyce's work. I believe Ulysses is appropriate enough to enter into a conversation of mythology, but Finnegans Wake? No, I am not buying it.

So what is this Skeleton's Key anyway? Basically it's a fleshed out version of the Outline of Chapter Contents already provided in the Penguin edition of FW, which in truth, is helpful as a "key". Seamus Deane offers an introduction that is as helpful (and unhelpful) as Campbell's. So over the 70-odd years since Finnegans Wake first appeared and not much is known about it--perhaps Joyce intended just that--an enigmatic mystery. Why try to dismantle a good thing
