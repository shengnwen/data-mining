until Meltzer blithered out the most vitriolic, senseless, self effacing, guilt plagued indictment of white people Ive ever had the displeasure to get vertigo from. I threw the book straight into the trash after that. A bitter man, and a wasted talent who has done nothing of any worth whatsoever. Meltzer may have the rock game nailed dead, but I cant stomach an ex-rockwriter slandering 500 years of civilization wholesale just because he cant find a better place to live than LA, even if I am half his age. A dimbulb Dadaist flinging offal like a chimp at anything and anyone that gets more attention than he does. What a disappointment
