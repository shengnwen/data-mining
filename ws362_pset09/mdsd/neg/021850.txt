Sometimes when I can't get into a book at first, I hang in there thinking that I'll get hooked in soon.  Usually that happens, but unfortunately, it did not in this case.  The book centers on an Irish family in the early -  mid 1900's, three generations, their motivations, the love they did/didn't  receive from their parents, their sagas.  Yet, I could not connect with any  of the characters, and could barely recall who was who and what had  happened from one reading to the next.  I loved Mary Gordon's book,  Spending.  When I read a book and enjoy it, I will read and study other  books by the same author.  I was very disappointed in this book
