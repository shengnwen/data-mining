I, like so many other's, was stupid enough to buy this guide not realising the mystery's within. I still havnt got %100 thanks to this guide and can say now that i will never buy a Bradly guide again. 

Everything is all mixed up in there,(Locations of all inportant things such as Horseshoes, tags ect) there must of been no proof reading what so ever... SO I SUGGEST TO EVERYONE, DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF... ...GUIDE
