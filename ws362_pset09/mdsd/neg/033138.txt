I think this book was too confusing to read, but it had a lot of good information about Benedict Arnold. The book was too confusing because the events in the book changed a lot and it was hard for me to remember the names and the time. Since I haven't learned much about the history of America I find this book boring. I'm not an American, so I only learned part of its history. The author's writing is like she is telling a story about Benedict Arnold, so she didn't really say that Benedict Arnold was a bad guy or anything like that. One good part about this book is that it tells the events in order like from when Benedict was a child to when he died. So that wasn't too confusing. I know some books that had all the events mixed up.  If you like books about history and heroes in the past then I suggest you read this book.  I suggest you read this book because Jean Fritz is a pretty good writer, and she wrote many good books
