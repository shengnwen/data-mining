With the hype this book has gotten, I looked forward to a terrific read.  Based on a true unsolved crime that has been a fascinating story for decades, I figured I was in for an engrossing read.

Unfortunately, the reader has to plow through 177 pages of character "background" before even getting to the crime.  I managed to plow through that but I was so peeved it took that long to get to the real story, I put the book down.  I'll pick it up again when I am desperate for something to read
