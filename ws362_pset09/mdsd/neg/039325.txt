Ok I havent even read this book yet and I am sort of afraid to spend my money and be left dissappointed. Mainly because I've read Death before Dishoner by 50 and Nikki Turner and that one was awful plus the reviews on this book is so bad as well. 50 need to find something else to do because if he keeps this up he is going ruin alot of talented authors careers!
