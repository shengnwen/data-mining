I was anxious to read the books written by this author since they take place near Charleston, a place we visit often.  I was very disappointed!  This book should have ended about 3 chapters earlier.  The book lacked depth and character development.  The dialogue was contrite and superficial.  I will definitely NOT be reading anymore books from this author
