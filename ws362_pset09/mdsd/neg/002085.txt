I haven't read the book but the 6 hour audiobook was fairly slow for what could have been much more interesting considering the subject matter.  It seemed like the author really has an axe to grind against the CIA.  The stories seemed overly focused on any mistakes the CIA made.  The author lost credibility with me when he said he was the one who revealed the presence of the secret nuclear bunker that was to be used by the US Congress in the instance of a nuclear strike.
