The book seems to be more for scoring political points rather than genuine scholarship. The first line in the description says it all - "A book the government of India demands be ritually burned". The BJP led govt. is "demanding" and book to be burned, but "hasn't". While individual members in the BJP govt. are entitled to their own opinion, the govt as a whole hasn't made a policy of banning it. The Allahbad high court (which is totally different than the BJP led govt) has on grounds of hurting public sentiment. Which means this book is banned via the valid legal process.

This book is a publicity stunt and rehash of the work done by other renowned authors/historians previously
