Having lived for more than six years in Japan, and being fluent in Japanese, I have a quite clear idea of the society there. This book is not only too old, but it shows that Reischauer (like the other members of the Chrysantemum Club) has a one-sided point of view, and is still ganging with the American &quot;reformists&quot; that put Japan back on the rails (so to say...) during the occupation. Of course Reishauer knows quite a lot about Japan, but he tells only what he thinks is important to him and to his old-fashion Orientalist group. Read any Murakami or Yoshimoto to understand on your own how this book is very superficial. There are much better and objective introductions to the complex Japanese reality
