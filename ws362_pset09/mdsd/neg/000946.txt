I had to read this book for english class. Before we read the book we read some notes about it and it sounded like a good book.  After I read it though, I have to say it sucked.  It was a long boring snooze fest.  I'd have to say some praise is due but it was just too long, boring, descriptive to keep anybody's attention.  I found that even if I read it slowly I couldn't retain any of it.  Take my advice and don't read this book unless you absolutely have to
