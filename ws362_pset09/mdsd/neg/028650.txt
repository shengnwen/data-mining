There were many times when I had to mentally and physically shake my head as Nye supports his thesis that America's dominance in this globalized system actually necessitates its interdependence with the rest of the world (read; France and Germany).  


The underlying idealism of Nye points to a world where if only the United States of America would submit, just a little, to other states and respect (read; follow) their opinions then BY GOLLY our Air will be cleaner and North Korea and Iran will give up their nuke programs.  Also, Europe will magically create a more robust military transport capability and actively participate in counterterrorism and ethno-religious conflicts abroad which, will be on the decline.  

My biggest gripe was Nye believing that self constraint will somehow lead to greater leadership opportunities above when these tools of self constraint are tools used by weaker countries to limit US power.  That's why, 'they' want to make US weaker.  Nye, in one sentence by my count, concedes this point but still argues that in the long term it'll be for the good.  However, Nye does not recognize the ulterior motives by countries such as Germany and a nostalgic France (Europe is given way too much credit and attention in his book as well).  Given the self interests of other states and the entrenched problems associated with failing states, failed states, and the Middle East it is a stretch to believe that countries will unite with the United States (who will still be the 100 ton gorilla in the room) and make the world a better place.  

I don't buy it.  So...don't buy it.
