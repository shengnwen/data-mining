This is the story of Becky who was such a pathological liar with a relatively small mind. She lied about everything small and big, important and unimportant, good or bad so to speak, attempting to make everyone happy in her small and selfish ways, or for her own selfish reasons. Coming from a loving good family with great education, why she was so absurdly and senselessly stupid and dump is really beyond anyone with a minim dose of common sense can understand, except for those who think in the same way. Wonder what a sheltered life can do to one's life. May be someone should write a book title as "How to Tell the Truth in Daily life." Or call it "How to Tell the Truth 101."  The interesting characters who worth my sympathy is the wedding planer and Becky's mother. I had hard time to finish the book because I was out of patience with Becky less half way through the book. It is entertaining sometime, but most of the time Becky just irritate my nerve.
