The "twist" is apparent from so far off that I actually hung on till the end, assuming that something more interesting would happen -- that surely there was more to it than I suspected. Alas, no. Much, much too simplistic and predictable, like a weak joke that goes on for hours -- which is a pity, because the author has real skill. 

This is one of the books I literally threw at the wall after I finished, so great was my disappointment at having wasted my time. Mr. Phillips! Please write another book: one that respects the reader's intellect
