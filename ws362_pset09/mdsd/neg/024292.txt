I couldn't get into this book.  I didn't think the characters were very interesting and I really couldn't get too excited about the plot.  Perhaps I found the characters too pathetic.  Also, this was my first Rebus book and I must say, I don't like him much as a character.  Some of the description about Edinburgh was interesting but I guess I just found the book too sordid, too boring
