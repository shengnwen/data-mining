The book should have been titled " I have my cake and eat it too! A CD's guide to enablement and manipulation"

As a married CD in a committed relationship of 17 years. I was astonished on how self-absorbed and manipulative Dr. Novic came through in his "memoir." As a life-long admirer of the feminine, I do not perceive that he (and I mean "he") has an understanding of the feminine power that is within us all. He seems purely absorbed in obtaining sexual gratification. Which is fine, I just do not hold him as a positive representative of our closet community.

I also have dealt with mixing cross-dressing and the family. I am blessed with a supportive, open-minded wife who challenges me to be a better person and understands we possess both masculine and feminine in our psyche. To meet this challenge and keep my cross-dressing as a positive in our family, I have learned to cook, sew, do my equal share of housework, listen, nurture, care for our children and elderly relatives -- in essence, experience first-hand what a woman's role is. I am richer because of it. I still enjoy the sensuality of silks, wonderful garments and make-up, but we strive for balance and finding the "right place and the right time."

If you are a married CD, be careful about showing this book to your wife. My wife read it first and gave me the icy stare, "is this what you really want." I hadn't read it yet, so I had some bridge mending to do as I was guilty by association. 

In summary, I did not increase my knowledge on the subject of cross-dressing nor did I see much of myself to relate this story. To me, Dr. Novic's memoir reads as an entitled, self-absorbed CD who has found a way to get it all and blame anyone (1st wife, parents, counselors) who got in his way.
