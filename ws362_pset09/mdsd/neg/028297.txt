It seems to me like Levinson barely put any effort into this book at all. There really is nothing new or groundbreaking in this book. To me, this was just a quick way for him to capitalize on his &quot;Guerrilla Brand Name&quot; to make an extra buck with recycled information.  The concepts in this book were so basic, they were almost insulting. Maybe if you are 14 years old and have no prior entrepreneurial experience this is the book for you. I felt ripped off. I actually ended up throwing it away... Catchy title, but it does not deliver at all
