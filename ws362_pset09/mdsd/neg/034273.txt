It's a good thing I watched the movie before reading  the book or else I wouldn't have known what the heck was going. I was stranded at a bus station in Philly and "Beloved" was the only book I had to read to pass away the time. Dull, dull, dull. Torture, torture, toture. I had to re-read each page more than once just to understand what was happening. This book is too long, too boring, and extremely overhyped. It leaves you braindead. I enjoyed "The Bluest Eye" more than this. Skip this book at all costs and watch the movie instead. The movie's just as boring and confusing, but it's visual and last only 2 hours and 52 mintues, which is less time than a week of reading
