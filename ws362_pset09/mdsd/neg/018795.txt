I am a Welsh fan as tried and true.  The idea behind the play was great.  I love reading plays above anything else.  I hate to say it but I was dissapointed in this effort (or lack of effort).  The only reason this work gets 1 stars instead of zero is because of the idea of using normal sized people with oversized furniture and props to draw the viewer in to make them sympathize with the characters.  The problem is that none of the characters are worth caring about, much less likable.  The action goes nowhere.  I read the whole play in one sitting (normally I am a slow reader).  I read it that way because I kept waiting for something to happen.  Pleading and begging the authors to give me one great line.  One amazing piece of writing just in a statement that would at least given me my hard earned coin back out of this.  I got to the last page and closed the book, set it on the shelf with my beloved Irvine Welsh collection, and tried to forget all about it.  This could be the most boring play ever, and a complete waste of a phenomenal idea
