I returned this book.  I was hoping for a work of scholarship in which the author would carefully argue for his views by presenting documented research.  This is not the case.  Instead, the author simply throws out conjectures about the Egyptian origins of the Hebrew scriptures.  There is absolutely no attempt to connect any of this with academic Egyptology or the mountains of Biblical scholarship.  Read Richard Friedman or Mark Smith or Finkelstein if you're interested in genuine scholarship from a liberal/skeptical point of view
