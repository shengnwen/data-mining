After reading Maureen Dowd's article, "What's a Modern Girl to Do?" in the October 2005 New York Times, I immediately ordered this book. Maureen Dowd's writing is certainly entertaining, and she is obviously a sharp intuitive writer. Are Men Necessary, however, is one of the most jumbled books I have ever read. Throughout the book, she lacks a clear unifying point and she often reuses information. I felt like I jumped into a crazy stream of consciousness and was never oriented.

Maureen Dowd obviously was well researched when she wrote this. Her witty sarcastic writing often masks her lack of a clear path. The book was entertaining, and at times, thought provoking, until the last chapter.

The final chapter was ultimately a tribute to Hilary Clinton. Dowd does not clearly conclude her book; instead, she aimlessly hopes that in a dreadfully long tribute the reader can come to some sense of finality.

Nevertheless, if you are interested in this topic, please check out her article, "What's a Modern Girl to Do." It is wonderful and well worth the 15 minute read.
