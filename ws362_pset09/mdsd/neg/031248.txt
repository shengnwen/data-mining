I was truely craving Korean food and want to learn to make it. Well, i have to say, the book has too exquisite of food in it. Not traditional food you will find at most restaurants or even in the open market. And what's up with it being written in a language other than Korean???  I speak English but also know some Korean and am very disappointed with the fact that it isn't even written in Korean........
