To all who have read this malarkey, and for those who intend to, I have a suggestion. First, read all the articles by Tim Callahan of Skeptic magazine. He is an authentic scholar who specializes in debunking revisionism and bigotry. Since he like Mr. Cahill is Irish the 3-5 star reviewers will not be able to condemn him for being anti-Irish. He makes certain, unlike Cahill that he has a mountain of proof-evidence to verify his thesis. I was so impressed with his methods that it truly surprised me that some people actually fell for this book. In fact he used every point that the 1-2 star reviewers mentioned, and more. I agree with him that the entire "Hinges Of History Series" largely lacks any in depth research. The first 3 chapters of this book is devoted to rehashing what most of us learned in grade school. The next 2 chapters are clearly the authors reinterpretations of the period. The rest of the book felt padded. What does Plato have to do with the title, or premise? Where are the footnotes and sources? That makes everything dubious at best. Also, Cahill did make Archie Bunker type remarks about other groups that have no place in our society, except in a very tasteless jokebook. Read Callahan first, or in place of this rusty fiction.
