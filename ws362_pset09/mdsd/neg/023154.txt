For someone with 50 books to his credit--as per the dust jacket--Collins is highly sloppy in the research of this book.  As has been previously noted, he just presented a common story about the origins of "Silent Night" without necessarily having done any deep research. And the comments about "The Twelve Days of Christmas" come straight from a silly internet piece, with no basis in fact.

This is common throughout this book. It seems more often than not, Collins has just done some cursory internet research and then slapped it all together and called it good.  

Some other screw-ups:  Irving Berlin was worried that "White Christmas" wasn't really a good song.  Actually Berlin, upon introducing it to his office staff and musical secretary, refered to it as "not only the greatest song I've ever written, but the greatest song ever written."  Berlin at one point had plans to make White Christmas the main production number in a major Broadway revue.  In performing it for Crosby and studio execs, Berlin got nervous with himself and choked in performing it.  You can read about this in Jody Rosen's excellent book on White Christmas, called "White Christmas."  

As for his assertions about the meaning and origin of the term Merry in merry Christmas, he gets it wrong again.  Ten minutes in the Oxford English Dictionary, available at any decent public library, would have given him the answers.  

Better Books on this subject are Rosen's afforementioned book and "The Penguin Book of Christmas Carols" ed. Ian Bradbury
