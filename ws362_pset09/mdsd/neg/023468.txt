I received this as an XMas gift and can't get through it.  The book feels forced and manufactured.  There are points that are relatable but are painfully obvious, if you are a fantasy football player you are better off reading your league message board.  Everyone can relate to the overzealous owner in their league, most overzealous owners don't try to write a book
