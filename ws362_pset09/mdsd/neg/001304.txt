An arrogant, rich guy brags at length about snagging a trophy girlfriend (his client's daughter), then chuckles to himself as he motors his shiny BMW bike through crowds of "brown faces" (I think those were his actual words).  As a travelogue, this book fails because all of the locations and cultures blur together.  As a means of imparting financial strategy, this book also fails--for the reasons noted in other reviews.  Anything worthwhile the author has to say is completely nullified by his enormous ego, which comes across on every page.  For those of you seeking adventure writing or stock tips, look elsewher.
