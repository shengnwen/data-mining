This is the worst textbook I have ever read. The editing is terrible (typos, spelling mistakes, extremely unprofessional writing, unexplained jargon), the diagrams are hit-and-miss (some are useful and accurate, others are shoddily crafted, most are downright unnecessary), and the whole book has a vibe of amateur, slapdash work. 

I would estimate that roughly 1/4 of the included figures are pictures of recording equipment taken straight from manufacturers' advertising literature. It's as if Huber did a Google Image search for "preamps" and included the first six results. Also, do I really need to see screenshot of Windows Media Player's visualization options? 

The book does a good job at covering the basic concepts of recording, but goes too far in trying to encompass every little bit of information about the recording industry ("Tax Tips for Musicians"? A half-page table of Internet connection speeds?). Do yourself a favor and find a better, more professional book.

I've returned to this review months later because I finally figured out what was REALLY bothering me about this book. The Windows Media Player screenshots, the tables of useless information, the gee-wiz references to the "Information Superhighway", the useless, gear-lusty sprinklings of product promotion photos, the dumbed-down writing style, all suggest one thing: an underlying immaturity in dealing with the recording industry. Don't get me wrong - there's lots of helpful information here. But reading between the lines, I can't help but get the feeling that if someone wiser and more experienced had written (or at least edited) this book, all of Huber's ephemera would be boiled away and readers would be able to concentrate on the real meat of the recording profession
