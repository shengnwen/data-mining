National Geographic itself recently referred to Saddam as one of the four worst mass murderers in 20th century history (others are Hitler, Mao Zedong and Saddam's proven idol Stalin)so deadly was Saddam's butchering of the Kurds of Iraq. After reading Bamford's book I don't feel he was in touch enough with how inhuman Saddam is. And for those who pounce on the idea that Bush just protected Israel by his Iraqi invasion remember how Saddam invaded Kuwait some years before. He (Saddam) could've just been waiting in the wings for a weak US leader (like (former president? hah!) Jimmy Carter) so he coulld have a field day attacking mideast countries again. Good Bush acted when he did in 2003
