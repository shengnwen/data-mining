Some good information but the book tries to cover too much and hence, doesn't do anything exceptionally well. Too few communities covered. Too much tourist and moving info covered. I can get restaurant info from better sources and I don't need tips on Pros and Cons of having a roommate. I was hoping to learn more about demographics of surrounding communities but only a few were covered and not in much depth
