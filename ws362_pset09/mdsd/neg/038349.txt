This was my second attempt to find a successful Laymon novel.  After all, with his list of A-list writer's recommendations at the front of the book, you'd think we'd have something decent once in a while.  You would think wrong.

My first complaint is the excessive use of the word "rump."  Laymon uses it over 15 times throughout this novel as if he's scared to use a common synonym.  This wouldnt be a problem, but the novel is filled with every other bad word imaginable and "rump" just sticks out.  Not to mention that there are scenes of intense rape, murder, and gore, and he still uses "rump."  It sticks out.

I think Laymon had a checklist for weapons in this book.  Every character shows up with something different:  a gasoline pump, a bike pump, whatever.  Wouldnt most people use a knife or a gun?  He shows us the crazies have intelligence and their normal psyche, but still some opt for a spear other than a knife.  Who has a spear hanging around?

Bad dialogue.  Lame ending.  The list goes on and on.  No matter how awesome the premise on the back of a Laymon novel sounds (and they do SOUND awesome), I wont toss away seven or eight bucks again on him.  Read the King instead
