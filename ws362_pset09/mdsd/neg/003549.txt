So my favorites are Thom Jones, Denis Johnson, George Saunders, Rick Bass, and the like.  Someone said &quot;Oh you should check out Moody&quot;.  In a word, this book was slow.  I found it hard to care about and the only thing that moved me was trying to see if more would be written about the guitarist's leather pants.  It seemed like it was trying to do what Jesus' Son nailed to the wall- contempory non-beautiful people down to Earth honest to God in your face fictional realism.  It didn't make it.  I hesitate to read Ice Storm
