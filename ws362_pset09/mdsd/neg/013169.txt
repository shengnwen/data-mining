Having read much of Ann Coulter's book "Godless," I was impressed with her energy, but dismayed by her hyperbole.  Her basic themes about the Godlessness of American liberals are right on target, but she unfortunately goes way over the top in some of her examples and analogies.

Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to check out one or more of the response books engendered by her bombshell.  Being in a bookstore I picked up "Brainless" to see if the liberals had any good response to Coulter's assertions.

Sadly, the author of this book named it after himself, as he is clueless about how to go about writing an effective rebuttal.  The entire book is one long series of ranting ad-hominem attacks that resemble the gruntings of a pig.  

Maguire starts out by indicating that if "you are part of less that 20% of the American population who is white, male, conservative, and therefore bigoted, you probably wont want to read his book."  It goes downhill from there.

Maguire's unwitting accomplishment is that he has proved Coulter right - in his case, liberals are completely clueless
