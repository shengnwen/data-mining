J.A. Jance's novel, Outlaw Mountain, is one of the worst books i have read in years.  Her characters and their dialogue, both inward and spoken, are completely unbelievable.  The storyline is convoluted and riddled with useless drama which is completely unnecessary for the plot.  The fact that I was able to finish this book was an act of pure discipline.  I am a worse person just for having consumed this book.  I would advise anyone who is considering purchasing or reading this book to save their time and money
