I recently read a book, In the Middle, by Nancie Atwell. In her book, Mrs. Atwell highly suggested having The Beans of Egypt, Maine as part of one's classroom library. Being a junior high English teacher as well, I looked forward to the possibility of having another book to present to my students. I have never been so mortified. I could never present such a book to my students with a clear conscience. The language is appalling and the adult situations are not suitable for their impressionable minds. Thinking of my students as I read, I was disgusted and in disbelief that this was considered excellent literature for 12-14-year-olds
