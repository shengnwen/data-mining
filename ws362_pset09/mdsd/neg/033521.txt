I read this book after reading the one published by Golf Digest, since another reader said it was the original work. However, I didn't see that this book was that much different. I do like the notion of a pendulum swing and its simplicity in instruction. However, it is my opinion that golfers today need to have other thoughts as well, such as a firm rear leg against which to turn. When you incorporate the pendulum with other contemporary advice, I think it helps you to extend your arms more for a fuller swing arc. But don't rely on this book alone if you want to advance beyond beginning golf. Look at Humphries' book "Two Steps to a Perfect Swing" if you still want to keep it simple but want to improve.
