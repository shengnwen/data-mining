I have to admit, I have forced myself to listen to Michael Weiner's abortion of a talkshow more than once.In a way it's almost humorous, until you stop to think that so many people in this country not only take this man seriously, they view him as a deep political thinker. He is not.He is an ignorant, homophobic, sexist, racist little subhuman troll. An insult to true, honest-to-God old-fashioned American conservatism. William F. Buckley Jr he ain't. What this is the rantings of a deeply psychologically disturbed individual. One would find more insightful comments at your state's mental hospital, or by a survey of several of your town's homeless population. I can't wait for the day when Savage, Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly AND their counterparts on the left Moore, Franken, Janeane Garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve. Or even better, we could get NASA to get cracking on building the first solar lander, and have them put these windbags on it. The average IQ of the nation would increase, and perhaps we would then be able to listen to REAL political discourse, instead of a bunch of ignorant, partisan loudmouths with an agenda screaming at one another.
