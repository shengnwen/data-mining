The other review of this book is obviously biased, since he studied under the author. This book is dry, poorly formatted, and has terrible illustrations/tables/figures. 

For example, the author's discussion of Strategic Alignment Maturity starts off with a figure describing different levels of maturity (okay), followed by text that repeats what the figure shows (uh, okay), followed by MORE figures that expand on the first figure. ??? This is really poor presentation of information. 

I bought it for $60 (not cover price of $130) and am disappointed. Frankly, Dilbert does a better job of explaining IT management
