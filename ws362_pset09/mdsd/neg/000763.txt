Billy Collins' work is shiftless, mundane and irresistably dull. His wit lacks humor and the reader, (assuming he/she is an avid poetry reader) should be unimpressed by the second poem of this book. The voice that the reader should hear while reading this monstrosity is the voice of a 6th-grader with a college-level vocabulary. There is no spark in Collins' writing. There is no life in this work. And if that is what it takes to become America's Poet Laureate, I will never read nor review another again!
If, in fact, you are craving poetry with Outlaw flair and a touch of Hunter Thompson, I suggest you read "European Confession" by Timothy Edward Jones (ISBN: 1-4137-2867-7)
