After Pamela and her son are abandoned by her boyfriend, she decides to use the knowledge of criminal activities she gained from him for her own benefit.  Changing her name to Carmen to reflect her new, tough-minded business persona, she opens an escort service and then gets involved in the drug trade.  She keeps intending to leave her new lifestyle when she has enough money, but when she does try to change, she finds that it is harder to back out of than she thought.

The beginning of the book is written in a dry "how I succeeded in business" style - since this novel is supposedly similar to the author's life, that is probably why.  There is also no editing, which makes it harder to read.  There is some attempt to develop the character of Pamela/Carmen, but she usually talks and thinks in clichés.  The secondary characters are not developed and are rather interchangeable.  Her son is never given a name.  At one point she shows up at the funeral of someone who used to work for her escort service, and is introduced as "someone who tried to help her".  Help her how, by supporting the lifestyle that eventually killed her?  The ending of the book is no surprise, and elicits little sympathy for the narrator, since she thinks so little of the consequences her actions will have for herself and others
