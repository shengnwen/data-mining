Inxs shouldn't have participated in this book after so many people ignored what was really wrong with Michael. 
Does anyone remember in Michaels last hours all the call to and from Bob Geldof? What happened that night is left to posterity.
But imagine if you will Michael is trying to run off with Bob's wife with her full acceptance, however enter the children here is the overiding factor and why Michael's new love couldn't , wouldn't come to OZ. The kids, Bob had a serious say in the disposition of the kids. Michael found out the hard way that the kids were not leaving the UK with mom when Bob(their dad) had so much infulence after doing things like championing "Live Aid". That was the relationship killer for Michael right there and he should have had the sense to see it coming. What mother wants to lose the children she loves most? None that I know of and not for a burnout like Michael became. Go to OZ and live with Michael and lose the children forever. Bob played a Royal flush that night and Michael in dispair took the long road home.
This book doesn't paint this lilly white it just doesn't tell you how it really is. Although if you read factual information from other sources this contributed to another suicide and made losers of inoccent children as well. Way to go Bob I hope you can sleep at night after this.
Moral of the story if you love something set it free, if it doesn't come back tell Bob and he'll talk it into killing itself.
I agree with the other reviewer that mentioned Motley crew from personal experince I knew they were all 5150 material.
But we live in a crazy world the rock bands and other looneys are the icing on the cak
