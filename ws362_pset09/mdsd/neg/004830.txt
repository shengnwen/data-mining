Despite many reviews recommendation this book for beginners, it has nothing for the beginners. It is clearly for people who have prior knowledge. Does not explain any basics. 

Do not install CD. Despite my mentioning a particular folder in which to install the software, the CD went ahead and created a new folder called PROGRAM. And this conflicted with the WIndows startup at next boot - which gave me a message that this folder has to be renamed to anything but PROGRAM. 

In any case, the software did not run.

But a big disappointment, when I went by the reviews
