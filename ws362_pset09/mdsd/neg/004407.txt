I picked up this book since it was in the 25 best american novels ever written according to the New-York Times.  Initially, I was interested since the story unfolds in Africa and I knew little about that continent, however, Norman Rush's prose feels really heavy, and, in the end, it wears you out.

I don't recommend this book, instead, pick up A fine balance by Rohinton Mistry. Much better story unfolding in another country
