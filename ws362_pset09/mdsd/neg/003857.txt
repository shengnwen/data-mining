The approach towards multi-orgasms is similar to the one of Barbara Keesling. You have to come very close to the end and contract your PC muscle to stop yourself from crossing the point of no return. Hopefully, at that time your prostate will contract and you have got an orgasm. Next, you have to calm down and gradually come back again very close to the edge for a second orgasm. This is in theory but the problem is that most of the time I ended up with unpleasant semi-ejacul. or very stiff and painful PC muscle without reaching even one orgasm. I practiced this method for 3 weeks and was unpleasantly surprised because of sharp decrease in my ability to last long.

I searched for an explanation and found it in "scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex". According to its author scientist Ritz regular and strong contractions of the PC muscle cause hyper activation of the "sympathetic nerves" in the genitals. They execute each ejaculat. That's why he recommends avoiding using the PC muscle. Instead you should use the "VIP Muscle", which is completely different, yet a nearby muscle. It is connected with the "parasympathetic nerves" and cannot influence the ejaculat. control. I easily achieved multi-orgasms with it and after several days my PE (prem. ejacul.) was gone. (update: it was not only gone but my endurance now is the record 40+ minutes) 

You may find the taoistic information in "The Multi-Orgasmic Man" refreshing but if you want results (multi-orgasms or greater endurance) then the result could be the opposite namely PE as happened with me. I would suggest reading this book only for its exotic side but if you regularly and strenuously use your PC muscle, it will most probably turn counter productive
