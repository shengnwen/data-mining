I'm a long-time buyer of Amazon's products, but lately I am seeing that they may have a quality control problem! The book "Essential Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson", published by Kessinger (ISBN: 1425341438) does not deserve more than one star, although there are other Emerson compilations (including the Modern Library Classics version with the same title) that are undoubtedly fine.

Amazon seems to have a strange methodology/algorithm for placing some of its books first in "relevance", and I am a little suspicious as to what criteria they are using. Furthermore, you may have noticed that the specific reviews of books now are often reviews of a different printing/edition than the one listed along with said reviews.

At any rate, the Kessinger "booklet" is a thin,cheaply made, 60 page paperback that includes short excerpts of a few of Emerson's writings, and is hardly more than a xerox-type copy, sandwiched within a glossy cover....

Not only that, but the Modern Library Classics' version costs less than the inferior Kessinger printing..
