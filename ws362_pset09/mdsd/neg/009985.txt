Stop me if you've heard this one: 

So these girls go into Afghanistan, then one of the most repressive theocracies in the world.   They are -- get this -- missionaries, and they wander around trying to convert the "heathens" to Christianity, which is a little like opening a synagogue in 1930s Germany.   It would make a good sitcom, in the tasteless manner of "Hogan's Heroes," but it makes a lousy book.  Religious zealotry is the worst thing on the planet and these two crullers merely wanted to exchange one type of fanaticism for another.
