The John Carter of Mars series of books, by my favorite author of all time,   Edgar Rice Burroughs,  is his best series.
I was so excited to receive the audio version of this book, but when I listened to it, I was hoorified !   
John Carter sounded like a wimp.  A girly Southerner, not at all the swashbuckling hero I envisioned.
  Now, maybe I'm spoiled by the narrators of other books, but even the weakest, most boring readings have not turned me off in the way that John Bolen has.
  Please Tantor audio,  get some one else to read this, and make sure it is a Manly-Man !
