The fourth volume in Martin's epic fantasy is a frustrating and disappointing novel because most of the characters readers have come to love are off-stage.  Only at the end of 1100 pages does Martin confide that he deliberately focuses on characters such as Jamie and Cersei in this volume.  Where is Dany?  Where is Tyrion?  Why does Catelyn Stark appear only briefly as a disfigured, silent harridan without even a page from her point of view?  Instead, this volume focuses on the escalating disintegration of the Seven Kingdoms as Queen Cersei, regent for the king, her timid 9-year -old son, solidifies her power base by placing weak and easily controlled men in key positions.  When her brother, Jamie spurns her offer to share the power, Cersei uses her wiles to manipulate and destroy all rivals.  The Starks are noticeably absent from this volume except for a few token chapters about Arya, who has adopted a new identity as a street urchin selling fish.  This entire volume feels superfluous; introducing characters and storylines that seem pointless --- and --- even worse --- uninteresting.  Martin seems to have succumbed to the disease that fells many fantasy writers: an unwillingness to bring a story to its logical conclusion and let go.  The unending tale grows wearisome.
