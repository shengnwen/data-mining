I started reading this book with an open mind but tossed it aside pretty quickly.  In the first dozen pages, Milton shows that he either doesn't understand that mutations are the source of variability and that it is variability that natural selection works on, or he is deliberately trying to mislead his readers. 

He says on page 10/11 that Neo-Darwinists believe that species evolve into other species "not because of the trivial variation that occurs between all individuals but because of chance mutations in their genetic makeup..."  Surely most people who have an iron in this fire know that it is variation that natural selection works on, and that mutations (according to the theory) provide the variation.  I find the word "trivial" variation to be misleading, as well.  It's a word ploy.  I don't personally think of the differences between a Saint Bernard and a Beagle to be trivial.
