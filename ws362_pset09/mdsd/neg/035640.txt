I enjoyed the other books in this series, though strangely, it seemed to me that each successive book was a step down the rung from the one preceeding it. Kiss & Tell remains the strongest and most enjoyable. By the time I got to Out of Sight, the decline in reading pleasure had sunk so low that I was unable to finish the story. I was completely turned off by the self-centeredness of the heroine. Her inability to see the larger picture in life and death situations endangered not only herself but others, and ultimately led to the death of another character. She seemed less troubled by this than she was with proving herself, which I found contemptible. My two stars are for the hero, who deserved a much better woman. I'll be waiting for Ms. Adair's newest entry, On Thin Ice, to be released in paperback before purchasing. I sincerely hope this series, which began with so much potential, will get back on track. The author has a lot of talent, and I'm looking forward to better things from her
