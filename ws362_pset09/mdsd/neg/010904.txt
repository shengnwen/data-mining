Most of Ballard's books are large, well illustrated, and to the point. This one however spends most of the page count on his thoughts about the veterans aboard Ballard's research vessel, the battle itself, and WW2. I wouldn't mind reading about his thoughts in another book as he is usually very insightful but it wasn't what I bought this particular book for.

After Ballard's commentaries and the history sections we see only very little relating to the Yorktown and underwater archeology which is rather disappointing
