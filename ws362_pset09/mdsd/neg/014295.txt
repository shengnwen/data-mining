This book contains an interesting selection of photos of German and American prisoners, then and now; also a map of the United States showing hundreds of places prisoners were held.  Some interesting facts emerge such  as German prisoners held in Mississippi camps working in swamps and cotton  fields, suffering malnutrition,and in the words of one ex prisoner, being  &quot;treated no better than the blacks we were working with.&quot
