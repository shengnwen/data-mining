I like this story.The writer wrote people's mien very carefully. I make me feel seemingly I was in the story. It described a poor young woman and a man,they loved each other,they both bought a present to each other,and they  used different ways. The same thing was they both sold their things to by  the present. So, though they didn't have much money,their mental world was  rich
