This book supposedly has the origin of Savage Dragon which interests me. The rest of the properties don't really do anything for me, but I think mr. Q Public needs to do more research before he speaks about something. There are only 4 founding artists on this book: Larsen, McFarlane, Silvestri,and Valentino. There were only 7 original founders in total. Regardless of which of these you were going for, it's a 10th Anniversary book by founding artists. It is not 10 founding artists on an anniversary book. I would hope that one would work on their own literacy before speaking of literary respectability...
