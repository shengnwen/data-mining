This is a strangely disappointing book.  I guess I expected some clear connection with Adolf Hitler, some bit of evidence or conjecture that would make the man more of a creature like us.  Instead, Mailer has seized on the old rumors about his family, his father, incest, and has drawn a picture that suggests the damage Hitler may (must) have suffered as a child.  It is in short Mailer's imagination we are dealing with here, and his alone.  There is nothing here for the historian, and perhaps that was my mistake.  I was thinking historical fiction when I began reading it.  There is virtually nothing of history present in the work.  And worse, we learn nothing new about Hitler.  A disappointment
