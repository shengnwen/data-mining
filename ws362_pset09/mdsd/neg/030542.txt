I recently read this book for a ELAN class @ UGA. I thought it was terrible and pointless. The characters lack depth and the theme of the book is not developmentally appropriate for 7th or 8th graders. The book was around 100 pages and leaves the reader wishing he had done something better with his time. My professor scolded me for not wanting to read this book to my future classes. She claimed I was scared to read books to my kids. (I guess she is refering to the religious implications in the book) She is absolutely right. I am terrified to read bad books to my students.
