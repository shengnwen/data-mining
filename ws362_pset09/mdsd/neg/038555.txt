This book is not very well written.  It jumps from one detailed description to another, without giving enough overview or bridging material.  It seems like this book evolved from presentation slides, and the author failed to include enough of the bridging, higher-level exposition that keeps people oriented from slide to slide.  This is a little disappointing, and it makes it more difficult to get value from this book
