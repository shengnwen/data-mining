Well, I was hoping for something with some relevant information on Rune use in the pre-Christian era. 
What this is, however, is yet another mash-up of Norse Magic (Conway), Northern Magic (Thorsson), Northern Mysteries and Magick (Aswynn) and Rites of Odin (Fitch).
Which are total fabrications of the worst kind in describing the religious and spiritual practices of pre-Christian Scandinavians. 
If you're into revisionist religion practice, this may appeal to you, as it has no basis in the actual spiritual or worship in the pre-Christian era there, and therefore you need never to explain it as "connected" or "factual". 
This book asserts to give historical facts, myths and misconceptions and provide you with a basic factual foundation of rune knowledge. 
It does not one of these things, relying on the worst sort of pseudo history, outright fiction and reversionary romantic theory's of the past two decades of pop Viking culture popular on the disenchanted fringe of the pagan mainstream.
 It bears no relationship at all to proven historic facts, artifacts, or written references of the time in question.  Sorry I bought it, the only high point is taking that book out of circulation - much like a Southern Baptist tract.
