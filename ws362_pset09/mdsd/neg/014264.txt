I have read some wonder novels by Coetzee, and so without hesitation I purchased 'Elizabeth Costello'.  What a mistake!  'Elizabeth Costello' is really not so much of a novel but rather a forum for the other to pontificate on a whole slew of life and death philosophical matters.  Such verbage might be of interest to the top 0.1% of the populace with multiple doctorates and too much time on their hands.  For everyone it's simply the sort of book that screams out "don't read me!".


Bottom line: maybe better served as fodder for a doctoral thesis
