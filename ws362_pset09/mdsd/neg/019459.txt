I truly believe in the power of the mind. In so much as we can control our own thoughts we have tremendous control over our own moods and lives and can consequently impact the lives of those around us, but on a psychological level only.  The authors' attempt to link the power of thought beyond our own bodies through actual physical phenomenon, like vibration, is unscholarly at best.

The authors backup their claims with citations of the work of other "scientists", but a little investigation shows that they are simply backing up junk science with more junk science. The reference to work of Dr. Masaru Emoto's with ice crystals, for example, not only has no bearing on their subject matter, but has been discredited for its lack of scientific rigor.

Had the authors stayed in the psychological realm and not ventured into the physical sciences they might have maintained their creditability and produced a truly interesting piece of work. Unfortunately they did not.
