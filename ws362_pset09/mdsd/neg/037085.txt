No one will appreciate this review because I am sixteen and had to read this book for my english class over the summer. The diary entries are kind of interesting, but the analysis just KILLS my desire to read this book. I mean, as far as educational purposes go, couldn't they just put the diary in a book and let the students analyse it themselves? If you're into this kinda book, then disregard this review, but if you're sixteen and assigned this, beware. I probably wont even finish it before school starts
