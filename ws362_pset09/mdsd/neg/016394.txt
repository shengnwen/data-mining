How dissapointing to read this book.  Unfortunately, it starts off weak and dies after a couple of pages. I'm sorry, but I'm serious!  When I got it, I was stunned!  Not only are the lines insipid and meaningless, the author puts the 200 of them one-per-page! For example, from "Rebel Without A Cause": "Mom, dad .. this is Judy.  She's my friend."  What the heck is that supposed to mean?  I couldn't even find a bio of the "author" in the book. ( Frankly, I really felt like I was ripped off! )  EXCEPT FOR ONE THING!   I only bought the book because I was researching to see if there was already one out there like the one I wanted to write?  This book sounded the closest at the time, so I shelled out the bucks.  But, while I was dissapointed, I was also elated!  It meant that the idea for my book;  REEL LIFE 101; 1,101 Classic Movie Lines That Teach Us About Life, Death, Love, Marriage, Anger and Humor, was timely.  Mine aren't meaningless quotes,  They're the movie lines that we don't remember ... but never forgot!  The ones that changed our lives!   So, if you're a "reel" movie lover like me,  I sincerely encourage you to check out my new ( first and only ) book now available here on Amazon.com.  Respectfully yours,    Jon Anthony Dos
