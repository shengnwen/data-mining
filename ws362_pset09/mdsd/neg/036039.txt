Like another reviewer said, there are a ton of made up names in this book.  The lists in the front are bizzare, and quite often end somewhere around M in alphabetical order - like there was some arbitrary list and she ran out of room for more variety. Reading through all the names with my husband last night, we just kept looking at each other with quizzical expressions on our faces. It felt like even the author got bored creating her own lists. If you really need to look at this book, get it from the library - don't waste your money
