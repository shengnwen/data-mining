I've said it before, feminists are too often their own worst enemies. Not only do they apparently presume to speak for all women, as perhaps subconsciously does Ms. Nead, but they frequently take a platform that is both dour and too stringent. Her contentions here in The Female Nude are extreme. She is all-but critical of sexuality itself, all but denies that there is any non-sexual beauty in the human body, chides lust as an institution (no, I could not type that with a straight face) and contrary to her goals of championing women she in fact attacks women much more ardently than most any man ever would. Really this is not an overview of western female nudity in art and photography at all. There's little to be learned here, and the overall tone to this message leaves you feeling like you've just sat thru a sermon, or at best one of those college lectures where the professor was a bit too dogmatic in her approach to conveying the subject matter. Heck, even the photographs in here were bad choices. Nead won't be able to market this to either voyeurs or the intellectually curious. This book seems intent upon punishing its reader and is yet another "get the message in first" example of attacking rather than studying; of overtly delivering a message instead of neutrally expounding upon what could have been an engaging topic.
