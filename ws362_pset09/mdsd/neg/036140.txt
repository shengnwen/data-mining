This is the most demented book I have ever read. The author tries to suggest that Native Americans were just as "human" or destructive of the land as western people. Um....has he seen the land lately, it's a little changed since the English first arrived. It's mostly gone, covered with asphalt, and the animals? They are gone too. Of course they used the land they we human beings but to suggest that they were of the same mind as those that followed is a reach
