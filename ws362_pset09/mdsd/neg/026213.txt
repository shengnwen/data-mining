This is the second (and definitely last) book  I  bought from Dan Margulis ( "the experts' expert " ?) The man has certainly some talents. For example the talent to write a complete book around just one (good) idea. As one or two other reviewers mentioned this book can be summarized in say 10 pages. The rest is just making simple things complicated to fill a book. I get the impression that some authors of photoshop books praise each other's work just  to mutually boost sales
