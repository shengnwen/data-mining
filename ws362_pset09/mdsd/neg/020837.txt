I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.

I feel like the characters have lost their voices.  The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books.  Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books.  I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone.  I tried to start the next book, and it was worse.  Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series.
