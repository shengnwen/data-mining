I got this book based on my Buddhist teacher's advice to do so.  I found it hard to follow and unintelligible in spots.  However, it could be my own understanding of it also.  This kind of book is similar to other esoteric teachings like the Rosicrucian handbook.

It really is for advanced readers and thinkers.  I suppose that leaves me out.  So, if you are into esoteric teachings with a twist, then by all means get this book.  However, I warn you that it might seem like gibberish to the uneducated and unenlightened (like myself).

Peace...
