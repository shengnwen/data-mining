Having read some of the other reviews, I have gathered that this was not the best book to introduce the reader to Saul Bellow. Unfortunately, this is my first attempt at reading Bellow. At the very beginning, I was very impressed with his vivid description of people and their situations. However, some 20-30 pages into the book I began to wonder when the descriptions would end and some kind of story would begin. Perhaps I am just not used to Bellow's style of narrative, but I found this one very hard to get through, despite its very short length. Somewhere down the line I may attempt to read more by Bellow, but at this point it's not real high on my list of priorities
