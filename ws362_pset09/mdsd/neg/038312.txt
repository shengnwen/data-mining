I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.

The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.

First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.

This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one.
