Author couldn't seem to find much to talk about, only 30 pages prior to his discussion of biblical times. He manages to sidestep a lot of charged topics though, simply by leaving them out.
The style of writting is both readable and enjoyable and the book itself is engaging. Unfortunatly it leaves out 90% of us humans who are not from that particular tradition in the "west."
If you want a book that will reinforce the western centracism by all means read it
