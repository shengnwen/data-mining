This "bio" which was obviously hastily churned out right after the 1994 assault on Nancy Kerrigan, doesn't tell the reader anything that hasn't already been printed in news stories. It's doubtful that the writers even interviewed anyone in the Harding camp; for instance, they repeatedly refer to her mother as LaVona Golden, when the woman doesn't even use that name. A shameless attempt to cash in on the scandal
