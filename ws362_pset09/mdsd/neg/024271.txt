Randy Jackson is the most annoying person on TV. While Simon is entertaining and Paula is cute, Randy is a complete buffoon. This book was written with one thing on his mind... money. This book has no inside info on the entertainment industry and has no insight for those seeking fame and fortune as entertainers. Instead what we have is an egotistical jerk who brags about his success while never admitting he doesn't do anything. If you admire a man who helped bring us the likes of Mariah Carey and NSYNC, go ahead and waste your money because you're an idiot too
