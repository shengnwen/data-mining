Well, my mistake. I now promise myself to research authors and books just a tiny bit before I impulsively add them to my shopping cart based on a couple minutes of TV exposure and a clever title and cover; at least I can start paying attention to the reputation of the publishing house. At page 250, Saxen ponders whether he has enough "material" actually to constitute a book. Let me answer that for you: NO. I recognize the book is labeled a memoir, but still, it lacks any evidence of insight or mature thought whatsoever. And I'm dumbfounded that anyone paged through this shallow and self-indulgent memoir and sent it to press.  My advice: avoid this vacuous, paralyzingly dull waste of trees, and read instead "Binge No More."
