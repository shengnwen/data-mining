  Some people write for the "art crowd." Dense outpourings of words that some of lesser human (like me) find nonsensical; but the really artsy types find fascinating. Perhaps because, like the crowd surrounding the naked emperor, they are afraid of simply telling the truth.

  Europe Central is a collection of stories about "the warring authoritarian cultures of Germany and the USSR," wherein according to jacket blurb, the author "compares and contrasts the moral decisions made by various figures from this period - some famous, some infamous, some unknown."

  It simply doesn't work, at least not for this reader.

  It's overblown, pretentious and far too wordy (just like good proletarian novels about real life are supposed to be).

  And it's dreadfully slow reading and, for the most part, boring. Once in a while, something interesting appears, like a rock formation popping out of an otherwise flat plain.

  In the hands of someone like Alan Furst, the theme might have worked, though the book would far shorter than this doorstop's 752 ponderous pages. On the whole, you can pass this by and move on with your life.
