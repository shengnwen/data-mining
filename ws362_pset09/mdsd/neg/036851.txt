I read this book while doing research for my own book, CUSS CONTROL, the Complete Book on How to Curb your Cursing.  I give the editor credit for the compilation, but for what purpose?  Some of the expressions are clever,  some are funny, but most are not.  People who read this book looking for  new ways to express themselves should determine if they will come across as  amusing or just crass.  While I believe the basic word has some value,  promoting its use is a social disservice. The fact that the book has  received so many favorable reviews reflects the decline of civility and the  dumbing down of both our language and our concept of what is funny. My book  has an entire chapter on this word that is not only more amusing, but also  thought provoking
