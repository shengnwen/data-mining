The accompanying CD begins naturally enough with the author introducing himself by showing off his slide chops.   His intonation is off and his playing is sloppy.   Unfortunately the book and package are just as inept.    For starters, the CD tracks don't match the numbers that are given in the book.   A completely different system of numbering is used for the CD tracks making it hard to pick out the tracks you want to hear.   Also, the notation of the examples is constantly in error.   It is as if the author was not familiar with music notation.   There are errors in rhythmic notation throughout in addition to improper notational conventions.   Also, with all of the excercises in G tuning, B flat is written as A sharp which will drive any educated musician crazy.   For instance; the C7 chord is spelled C-E-G-A#.   How did that get past the editors?   The first part of the book is a survey of slide guitar players from the past to the present which is informative.  But on page 40 he talks about Jimmy Page, and the photo that goes with Jimmy Page?   None other than Syd Barrett! (Pink Floyd).  This makes me question the veracity and accuracy of the information within.    I plan on seeking out other materials
