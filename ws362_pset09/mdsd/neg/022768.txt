It seems that these recipes were written by either mothers of college kids or 70 year old sophomores. Two recipes for LIVER? Come onnnn. Most of the recipes have 6 - 9, even 14 ingredients. A coed is never going to buy so many ingredients called for in this book, let alone a guy. I bought this for my niece and I decided to give it to her as a gag gift, writing my own takes on some recipes. They may taste delicious (except the liver) but even I don't want to take the time
