I was excited about reading this book because the cover and table of contents looked so interesting. However, upon reading it, I'm not sure exactly what it was about. It was boring, disorganized, and the author's overwhelming sense of snobbery was quite a turnoff! (Not to mention the blurbs on nearly every page singing her praises. Weird.) If you can check it our from the library, it's a quick read, but don't waste your money
