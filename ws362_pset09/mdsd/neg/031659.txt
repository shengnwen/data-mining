Rarely does one find a book concerning the Cuban Revolution in which the author at least makes an effort to keep there political views out of the analysis.  Marifeli Perez-Stable is no exception, as her book will either be praised by the left, or critizied by the right.  In writing such a biased account her credibility is jepordized; not only because anyone with half a brain will realize this, but anyone with limited study in regards to the revolution see's many flaws.  Amongst the most prevelant is the complete neglect of Cuba's &quot;Counterculture&quot; and the booming tobacco industry in Cuba throughout the 50's (she harbors on sugar as if every Cuban was either a plantation owner or slave).  Hopefully Cuban books in the future will steer clear of political biases and present the facts, and only the facts
