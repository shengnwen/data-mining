I am an avid reader of Chick Lit, and have read and enjoyed others by Elizabeth Young, so I felt kind of guilty about not being able to get into this book.  I found myself, about halfway through, just skimming the pages.  My interest started to falter with the &quot;Murder Mystery Weekend&quot; with which I found it difficult to keep up.  After that, I just couldn't get into the characters.  Maybe I'll enjoy her next one more..
