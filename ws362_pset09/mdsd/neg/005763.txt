If this had been the first Crais book I'd read I wouldn't have read any others which would have been a pity as all his previous books (except the Forgotten Man) were excellent.
The Two-Minute rule (note the use of the grammatically correct hyphen) has two main characters, Holman and Pollard, who are made of cardboard and are not in the least bit interesting. The plot was okay but the end was silly. I was bored throughout most of the book and couldn't wait for it to finish.
If you want good Crais then read Demolition Angel, Hostage or LA Requiem and don't read this one.
