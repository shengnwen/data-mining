what i enjoy tremendously about the sister fidelma series is the exploration of the people and culture of ireland.  this entry in the series falls woefully short.  yes, i know it is set in wales, but all the cultural/societal interactions are missing.  this was a mystery set in a 2 dimensional world.  i expect better from sister fidelma
