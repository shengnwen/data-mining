Like a lot of the reviews on here, I was excited to read this book--my first Bear novel--and thought the premise of the plot was a great idea.  But by midway through the book it became tedious and convuluted.  Way too many characters to follow that don't go anywhere and aren't necessary for the good of the book.  The science seems solid enough (don't listen to all those self proclaimed scientists [by the way, I'm a microbiologist] who slam it for being innaccurate or not up to their ego driven standards) but didn't really mesh with the character development or--as hard as this seems like it would be--the plot.

Overall, a good idea kind of wasted.  I didn't hate the book.  But I wouldn't recommend.  Nonetheless, I wouldn't discourage someone from reading it if they had their heart set on it
