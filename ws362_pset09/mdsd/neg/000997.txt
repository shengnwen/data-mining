I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.

I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.  

Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.

Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited.
