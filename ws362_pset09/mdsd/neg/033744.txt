I was very troubled reading this book.  The women are very weak characters.  Their husband cheats on them and verbally abuses one of the wives.  The women are submissive and pathetic.  I was so angry, that I couldn't even finish this book.  As for the historical fiction aspect of the book, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  If you are looking for a bible story where women are treated like animals, this is the book for you.  If you are looking for a historical perspective on the time period, this is not the right book
