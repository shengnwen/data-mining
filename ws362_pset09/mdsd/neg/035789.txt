Two years after print, I found the LP Ecuador guide to be very outdated.  The book was written when the Sucre was the currency of Ecuador, now that they have change to the dollar, all of the prices have increased 20%-40% over what the book says.  Also, I found that it lacked information on good, reliable tour operators.  I found more reliable tour operators and better prices by doing online searches and by going to the towns and asking around.  I believe that a lot has changed in Ecuador since the publication of this 6th addition so I suggest finding a more recently published guide
