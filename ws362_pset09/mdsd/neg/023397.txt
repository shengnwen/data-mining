This has to be one of the most frustrating and dull spirituality and live food books I have ever read. There are pages and pages of 'the author' (he refers to himself in the third person) procrastinating on religion, history etc. Yup he's right, a live food diet will raise your kundalini. So does walking in the counrty, having a great love life, being positive and doing work you love. Which is basically what he is saying here.There, I've managed to say it in two sentances. If you're into personal growth, and spiritual development, try David Wolfe's books. Even though he plagurised Nature's First Law, the original is out of print, but it's a raw food philosophy masterpiece all the same. It's also the third of the length of Cousen's book. Or read Leonard Orr's Breaking The Death Habit, or the Indian classic 'Autobiography of a Yogi.' These three books will open your mind and soul to new and real possibilitesin an authentic heartfelt way, without the ego of the author getting in the way.
