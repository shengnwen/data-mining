It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film
