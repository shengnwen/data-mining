I've been in the software industry for quite awhile, and I've watched as the personal computer industry evolved from one where there were dozens of machines being sold to consumers down to the two primary platforms of windows and macintosh.  While there is no doubt that the macintosh is the minority platform, there is also no doubt that its continued survival has engendered an unexplained amount of hate from those who are not fans of the machine. 

This book, in summary, is the longwinded rant of one such user. As someone who knows first hand a number of the situations covered in the book, and who has a generally solid understanding for situations not covered in the book, I believe the author of this book sat down and wrote it out by himself without any fact checking, without any real interviews (or he ignored or misunderstood the people he interviewed).

There are so many factual errrors in this book, its not funny- -from little things like the years events happened or the locations of companies or the person who held a particular role at a particular time, to grossly innacurate assumptions about things the author could not possibly know-- such as the minutes of boardroom discussions. 

This is a smear job, thru and thru, and like most smear jobs its repetitive, self-contradictory, and downright dishonest.

I think the only reason the author has not been sued is that doing so would give this book far more attention than it deserves.

Windows fans like to kick apple and the mac, even when they are down.  Windows seems to engender some sociopathic sadism in people.   IF you want to learn more about apple, find another book... this book is just a windows fan bashing steve jobs for having taste
