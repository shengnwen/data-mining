Rana and Ross's beliefs blind them to the reality of the scientific knowledge gained over the past 200 years.  Their attempt to bring together results from biology, chemistry and geology to show how puzzling the origin of life is, utterly fails.  They totally omit major portions of research currently underway with in biochemistry, chemistry, and biology, that show a variety of potential pathways to the emergence of proto-life.  In the end, the authors fail to prove their point.  Just more supernaturalistic excuses for why there has to be a God
