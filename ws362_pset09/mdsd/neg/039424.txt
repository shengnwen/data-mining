I've been a fan of Elizabeth Taylor's for almost longer than I can remember, and there isn't a book about her that I don't have, but this is one that even I could have done without. 

There is nothing new here, and some things - the dynamics between Taylor and her parents, for example - are analyzed for what feels like several thousand pages. The book is a difficult read as well, due to the oddly florid and sophomoric writing by author Taraborelli.

For anyone who's curious, the best book about the actress is still Brenda Maddox's "Who's Afraid of Elizabeth Taylor?", published back in 1978. Admmittedly out of date now, it's still remarkably insightful and well written, and worth searching for
