This book is out of print and should stay that way.  I made the mistake of taking a public library copy of the book to Israel on a recent trip there without reading it first, and too late discovered that it was a political tract, not a guidebook.  The author is a typical British ivory tower apologist who is able to convince himself that siding with the "oppressed" puts him in the intellectual vanguard. In a book so full of misinformation and half-truths that it would take another book just to tease them all out of the text, here is just one choice example:  page 211, where he actually says that a tourist worried about safety should be "equally vigilant" to avoid areas where Israelis could attack Palestinians, including tear gas attacks, since "Israeli police don't discriminate" between Arabs and tourists.  Of course, in describing the supposedly "rare" attacks on Jews, there is no mention of who the perpetrators are of these "rare" events, and the author actually suggests that such attacks could be avoided if only those arrogant Jews would stop provoking people with their "outward displays of Jewishness" and their "'amusing' IDF t-shirts."  The thousands who have been shot, stabbed, blown up, or otherwise murdered or injured by Arabs give the lie to this disgusting piece of work.
