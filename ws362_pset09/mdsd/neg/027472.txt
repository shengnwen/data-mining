My bookclub picked this out based on the exciting description.  It was very diappointing.  The main characters, Colin and Mary, are one dimensional and seem to have very little chemistry between the two of them.  There were a few times in the book that I wondered if Mary had multiple personalities.  It is unclear what their history is or what is the full story about her kids, why they are vacationing there, etc.

Robert and Carolyn reek of creepy, creepy from the first moment that the reader meets them.  However, they are more interesting then the main characters of Mary and Colin.  At least Robert had a bit more dimension to him than the other characters.

The ending was the most exciting part of the book.  The rest just goes on and on about nothing.  Even with an exciting ending it leaves so many holes and unanswered questions that just leave you wondering "What the ? ? ?
