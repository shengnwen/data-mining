I bought this book from a different web retailer because of the online description; I did not see it in the store first.  If I had, I wouldn't have bought it, because it is a philosophy book about gardening.  I tend to buy gardening books that have lots of photos or diagrams of examples.  This book has no photos and only a few drawings.  It is all text.  If you are a &quot;show me&quot; kind of person like I am, then don't buy this book
