I had a very hard time actually reading this book through after the first chapter in which a character who becomes a hero at the end of the book and in fact stars in his own in a future book rapes one of the characters.  I think that the attempt to make him seem less hated was that he was &quot;nice&quot; about it.  Right there, that is a huge strike against the book.  I don't care if this was the times, that is why it is fiction.  Rape is not a part of romance and a rapist should not be the hero of a romance...at least not by an author who I ever plan to read again.  The other problem I had was with the main characters and the changes that she goes through.  She becomes the nice docile wife she is meant to become and he becomes a little more tolerant after &quot;taming&quot; her with sex.  That is supposed to be romantic?  My &quot;favorite&quot; line to hate was when she told him she was pregnant, shut him up and then it went on to say that it was probably the last time she ever got the best of him.  Sounds like a match made in sexism 101
