Mr. Patterson: Please demonstrate more discretion in selecting ghost writers for your pulp fiction publishing machine.

Ms. Paetro: Don't quit your day job.

If you are looking for character development, descriptive scenes, engaging voice and style, believable conflict, romantic or who-done-it suspense, balanced point of view, entertaining pace, and (or) suspension of disbelief, this is not a book deserving of your time or money.  If your idea of pacing is 146 chapters spread across 400 pages, or if the lame pet dog character foil trick works for you, be sure to buy this book at Amazon's used book prices
