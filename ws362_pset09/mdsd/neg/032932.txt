The first two-thirds of this story is very good, with wild but endearing characters and an interesting plot. But then, it seems as though the author dumps all the tragedy and suffering he can possibly think of on the characters, like he is setting up bowling pins just to knock them down.  The very end of the book is plain awful, with plot resolutions that are, in turn, nauseating, cutesy, and just plain preposterous, despite the fact that this is a semi-magical realism type of tale.  Skip this and read In the City of Shy Hunters.  This one is a real mess
