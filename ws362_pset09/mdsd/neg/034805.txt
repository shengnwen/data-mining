One of the authors of this book is Mr. Philip Watts, chairman of Shell until 2003. He left the company after it was revealed that under his mandate, Shell has inflated its oil reserves by 20%, with his knowledge and influence. Although the book seems consistent and based on real facts, his presence as an author make it a bit unreliable. I did not realize he is one of the authors. If I  knew it, I would never buy it. Check "Chapter 2 - The Right Framework",  particulalrly the item "Transparency and Accountability" and then check the reports on Mr Watts' activities and behaviour at Shell.      How can one trust on what reads??
