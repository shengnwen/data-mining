I've never read any of her other work, so it's actually possible that the author of this book is as awesome as all the reviews posted here say. However, I have read this book. And it's not awesome. In fact, it's achingly far from being so--stupid characters, snail-like plot, and a complete lack of insight into anything. I think reading it may have killed brain cells I can't afford to loose.

If you're interested in groupie/musician relationships, I suggest getting yourself a copy of Bye Bye Baby: My Tragic Love Affair with the Bay City Rollers
