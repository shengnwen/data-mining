I had already read several great McNaught romances when I bought this one, the 1985 version, so I had high hopes.  While the book is well-written, and some of the secondary characters are interesting, the entire novel is ruined by the total jerk of a hero - a tyrannical, domineering, bullying, violent moron.  Yeah, of course he's handsome and charming, etc., etc.  But he also exerts his total will over everyone around him.  After reading the scene where he whips Whitney six lashes with a riding crop, just because she had ACCIDENTALLY hit her horse with it ONCE, I knew this book was not going to turn out well.  Who in hell WHIPS someone they profess to love and is hoping will learn to love him?  WHIPPING her was going to make her love him??????  And then the rape scene; he believes one woman's gossip that Whitney is not "pure," so he throws her down and rapes her.  Oh yeah, he's remorseful the next day - NOT because he raped her, but because he realized she really had been a virgin.  Apparently, if she truly had been "impure", then the rape would have been justified in his eyes.  This book is GARBAGE.  I would love to read a rebuttal from Judith McNaught concerning all the negative issues brought up by some of the reviewers here; did SHE like this hero?  would SHE have liked being treated as Whitney was treated
