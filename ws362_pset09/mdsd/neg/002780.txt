Please don't get sucked in like I did.  All she does is endlessly talk about herself and then give you one tiny suggestion at the end like, start a diary.  It's ridiculous!  I tried her tape set and found it   horrible! It's an absolute abomination of her endlessly saying how she will eventually help you.  And she will tell you to listen to her saying that same thing for two weeks straight, while your time gets sucked up.  It's criminal!
