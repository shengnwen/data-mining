I have read books on both sides of the issue and Mary did not handle herself well though she fought hard.

. It was noted by other greek philosophers that Egypt was a land of blacks. So, Why did she forget to mention that part of history. Gerald massey among others were white scholars who mentions the same things as Bernal, Vansertima, Dr. Ben. So, why did she not take on the other white scholar. Seems to me she was only speaking out of frustration and anger.

On another note there are some crazy people out there that says the black man created every thing which is not true. Contribution was made by all including the Africans.
