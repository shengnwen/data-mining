I sincerely expected much more from the author of "Guns, Germs and Steel" than this booklet that thrives on the trivia of evolutonary psychology. It's  obious why is sex fun- to encourage reproduction - and I expected the author went beyond this self-evident fact. Bit it didn't. And, excuse me, Dr. Diamond, how you account for gay sex in your reasoning? Homosexuality is totally  overlooked, yet it's one of the mayor puzzles of  human sexuality- and of sexuality in general.
Dr. Diamond, I'm very disappointed
