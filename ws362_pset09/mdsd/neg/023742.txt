For basic fence building, this book is okay.  It repeats much information, right down to the images, found in other fence books.  Hmmm.  But what's most frustrating about this book is the copious inclusions of photographs of fences and gates for which there are no designs.  I'm not talking about exact designs, but rather guidelines for building the particular kind of fence; for instance, how to have the vertical pickets enclosed within lower and upper horizontal rails.  No ideas provided.  I actually called the publisher and asked, and got a run-around but no real answers except that because those photos are from private properties, they can't help.  So why include them?
