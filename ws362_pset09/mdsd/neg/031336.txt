I was looking to this book as an expansion on Levinson's first "Charlotte Mason Education."  While it does provide more "meat" than the first, I can't get past some of the glaring grammatical errors.  Her misuse of the comma has plagued the first half of the book, to the point where I have to re-read sentences to figure out what the idea was supposed to be.  At another point, she means to refer to a "vicious" cycle, yet she spells it "viscous."  It is so hard to respect the information coming from one of the "Charlotte Mason experts" when she can't even proofread her work or find a good editor to do it for her.  I'm not trying to be nasty, but I think it gives homeschoolers a bad name when books claiming that we "know how to teach our kids" are published and then contain so many glaring errors.  I hope that future editions will correct the problems so that others don't lose respect for Levinson like I have.  On the positive side, her book lists are excellent, and are an amazing resource for those looking for living books in each subject area. It is worth the purchase for that reason alone
