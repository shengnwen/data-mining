There are two problems with this book. First, it uses figures from the specification. The PCI Express specification is very poor when it comes to figures, tables and charts. I had hoped that this book was going to have some decent figures, tables and charts, and provide more design help than the specification. Instead it simply rewords the specification. The second problem is that it is out of date. There has been numerous engineering change orders generated by the PCI special interest group [sig] against rev. 1.0a. The PCI sig has just come out with revision 1.1. This book covers neither. I have ordered a different book that someone told me about. I have been told this other book has addressed the above two problems, I hope so
