I eagerly awaited my copy of this guide book only to be very disappointed  with the actual book. The author does not go into any great depth about any  of the rides, attractions, or shows. The maps, what few of them there were,  are small and cramped.  The restaurant and food places did not contain  menus as I expected, but, rather, short blurbs on the general kinds of food  served. A better choice for the reader would be Kelly Monaghan's  &quot;Universal Studios Escape. The Ultimate Guide to the Ultimate Theme  Park Adventure,&quot; or the sections on Universal Studios in Rita Aero's  &quot;Disny World. The Essential Guide to Amazing Vacations.&quot
