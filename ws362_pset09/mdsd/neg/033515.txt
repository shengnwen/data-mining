This book was conceived from an incorrect perception of "America". United States is not only America. What about the other countries such Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Argentina, etc. Maybe, the correct title for this book is "Some surnames in United States of America". Since the United States of America were forged with immigrants, the author did not respect the particularities of other surnames established in the United States as jews, russians, germans, frenchs, irish, among others
