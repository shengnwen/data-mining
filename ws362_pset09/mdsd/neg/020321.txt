I love Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone books and have been reading them for years. But "Cape Perdido" was so bad I couldn't get through it. The characters are all stereotypes-- the aggressive, unfeminine local tree-hugger lady; the arrogant, chauvanistic, big-city lawyer; the sweet, idealistic community liaison intern; etc., etc. The only mystery was some oft-referenced, vague, long-ago "incident" that was never explained (at least not in the first 110 pages, which is where I got off the bus.) I don't know who wrote this book but I hope it wasn't REALLY Marcia Muller. I don't want to believe she would knowlingly publish such poor writing
