Perhaps this book would have seemed less trifling and annoying if I had never read any of the Scriptures, and had no previous knowledge, however slight,  of Middle Eastern history or mythology. But since that was not the case, I thought this book was a very poor introduction to this fascinating subject. It begins with a DeMille-like soft porn depiction of an ancient pagan ritual which had me laughing out loud. To be fair, the author doesn't claim to have any historical documentation for the temple scenes he describes. It probably seemed like just the sort of thing that polytheistic goddess-worshipping simpletons were likely to get up to under the influence of hallucinogens and muddled thinking. Perhaps this is a good introduction after all, as muddled thinking plays a major role throughout this book. As long as the reader understands this, there is probably no harm in reading the rest for its entertainment value.

Maybe if you are interested in learning about the ancient world and its religious thought, and don't know where to begin, this is better than nothing. However, please don't don't let this lightweight feel-good fluff be the only thing you read. If you want to find out what people in the ancient Near East really wrote and thought, you might start by reading primary sources, such as the Bible, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the many other ancient documents which have been translated by scholars who actually care about historical accuracy. Museum websites and publications are another great source of easily accessible information. If you persevere, you will soon know enough to understand why this book seems so silly.
