David F. Wells provides a horrible representation of Christian Spirituality in a postmodern world.  If you want to know about Christ and His Kingdom stay as far away from this book as you can.  Wells is most clearly a Chatholic that is pissed off by the effects of the Reformation and sticks solidly to the traditionalism that has plagued the catholic church for years.  This is not an attack on catholics, however, I believe that they are Christians at the core can be just as spiritual connected with God as any one else on the planet.  I am stating simply that Wells is a bafoon who needs to do more research in not only the Bible but in the definintion of Spirituality.  If you read the life of Christ presented in Gospels and the journey of Paul presented in the Letters you will see that spirituality is much more Christ centered than Wells suggests.  The Postmodern Spirituality, I believe, is more intuned with the Holy Spirit than and classical rendition defined in his book.

I REPEAT...STAY FAR FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK
