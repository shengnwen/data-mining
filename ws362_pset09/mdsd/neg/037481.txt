Sorry in short I was very very disappointed with this book. It was not the  bomb! and doesn't hold up to her previous books!  I was disappointed with Pay Back is a Muth and now this one too. I skipped alot of uninteresting pages of material,to just get through this book. This was a forced read because I paid my money. 2 terrible books back to back is enough to make me wait the next time around which honestly I don't think I will. Could have been much much better1
