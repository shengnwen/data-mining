This book sounded wonderful from the 4 reviews I read, but I checked the Nefeli website, & discovered before & after pix from this book.  I was dismayed to see the dramatic difference in those pix are results of lighting conditions.  

Most of the "before" shots show obvious shadows behind & slightly below each person's head, or under their chin--compared to the "after" shot where the light is totally different. You can easily see the difference in light placement by noticing the reflection in the eyes.  Manipulating lighting creates dramatic differences in shadows cast on the face, resulting in aging affects.  Ever notice the poor lighting in retail stores? It's the same effect when you're in their dressing rooms, or look in retail store mirrors. 

The most flattering lighting is horizontally level with your mid-face, whereas overhead lighting casts unflattering shadows, accentuating lines & sagging.  

It's a shame they had to resort to lighting "tricks" to sell this book. I can't help thinking of Dr. Perricone's books, I thought his program was wonderful--his skin looked terrific!  Then I read about his having had a FACE LIFT!  Buyer beware.
