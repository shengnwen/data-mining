This book is a departure from others I've read by the same authors.  There is little flow or organisation to the material.  Detailed technical info is presented, only to be often times refuted by the authors in a side-note as  not of true value.  Therefore I feel the only value in this book is in the  authors' side notes, which are in themsevles often arcane
