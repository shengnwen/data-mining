I was very disappointed with Feed Your Kids Well. This is an Atkins/Low Carbohydrate type diet that excludes most fruits and vegetables. The book is filled with list of &quot;off limit&quot; foods and only 6-7 time consuming recepies. All meals must be made from scratch and everyday  children should be eating eggs for breakfas! What if your child does not  like eggs?  The author is unclear on what children should be eating. His  suggestions seem unrealistic (especiall for working parents) and his  exclusion of most fruits and vegetables seems more of a &quot;fad  diet&quot; than a healty solution to a difficult problem many parents with  little time face
