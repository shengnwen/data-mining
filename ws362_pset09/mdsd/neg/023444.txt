I was disappointed when I received this book from amazon.com.  Judging by the mostly glowing reviews, I had high expectations.  However, I found the format to be a big distraction.  Basically, the entire book is a composition of 1-paragraph tips from other women (not the author) on a particular subject.  It's like reading a whole book of Hints from Heloise, one after the other with no connective matter.

Furthermore, many of the tips were just downright silly or unrealistic.  For example, under "Meal Planning" tip #17 reads: "Buy large quantities of a side dish you like and make that the main dish.  Instead of one box of mac and cheese, buy four.  Add a salad or cut veggies and you're set."  Tip #18: "Have an appetizer dinner: buy cocktail hotdogs in a crust (in the freezer department), Tater Tots, and if you're really feeling adventurous, slice some fruit and thread it onto skewers."  I mean, really, does the author expect us to feed our families this way?  My husband would divorce me (and rightfully so).  Tip #19: "Cook large meals and freeze leftovers in one-servng containers."  Gee, never heard that one before!

Last but not least, the photo of the book cover led me to believe that I was getting a spiral-bound softcover book with color-coded divider tabs.  Not so.  Turns out that it's just a regular paperback book with a cover art design that looks like spirals and tabs.  The real thing is nothing of the sort, but it would be a big improvement to the overall organization of the book.

I will be returning this one.  It's too scattered and choppy to be useful for me.  A better reference I found is "Organizing from the Right Side of the Brain" by Lee Silber.
