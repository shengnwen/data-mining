What I found annoying about this book, it that it is so obvious that the Violet character is some kind of self-portrait and that Bill Wechsler is a portrait Paul Auster. For anyone who knows even the basic facts about the Hustvedt-Auster couple it is impossible to overlook. Bill is said to be very handsome in a "Byronic" kind of way, he is an artist, he has a sibling who is mentally ill, his father was emotionally detached, he excelled in sports at school and has a strong moral codex, he has a son by his first wife, and then met his "true" love Siri/Violet etc. All of which is also true of Paul Auster. Violet is from Minnesota, of Norwegian descent, as is Siri Hustvedt, and I am sure the similarities go on. I find it slightly sickening when the writer invents a male character, Leo, who goes on to detail his sexual fantasies about Violet in the book. Siri Hustvedt is clearly a very gifted writer, but I wish she would write a novel where the clues from her own personal life are not strewn about all over the place. What worries me also is that the character Mark in "What I loved" so closely resembles the delinquent in Austers "Oracle night".
