Being one of Ms. Brockman's most avid fans, I could hardly wait for the ink to dry before buying this book.  I was so disappointed.  It started out very good, very well written but got more and more outlandish by the minute.  I kept waiting for the other characters to come in and help save the day as usual but there was no sign of them.  The complete reversal in Max's character was a little contrived and I think the worst character portrayal was that of Jules.  He went from an applaudable FBI agent who just happened to be gay to a stereotypical gay man fumbling around trying to be a FBI agent; I always liked Jules and this portrayal was most disappointing.  I recommend buying it used because I know Suzanne Brockmann fans will not be able to resist it.
