Blah, blah, and more blah.  That is the summary of George H. Smith's "Atheism".  There are some fine paragraphs and some interesting ideas, but much of the book is stuff like "the epistomology of reason gives metaphysical analysis pause to consider theological corrolaries".  I'm sure a philosopher really enjoys seeing "epistomology" and "metaphysics" in every paragraph of the book, but I think it just obscures a straightforward discussion.

If Smith were direct, he would say that believing in a god is like believing in "unies"--no reliable person can describe that word in terms we can understand; no one has seen a unie; and those who believe in unies are no better off than those who don't.  Therefore, god is a concept that doesn't make any sense and doesn't warrant our attention.  He gets carried away at the end (and therefore the reading is more interesting) bashing Jesus' teachings as unoriginal and likely to cause believers "emotional suicide".  This is not an enjoyable or interesting book, for the most part, and I wouldn't recommend it to others
