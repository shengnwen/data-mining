    Who was it that said there's a sucker born every minute? Never underestimate the sophistication of your audience? I am giving it two stars just because it is SO creatively contrived, and there is such an essence of authenticity- Down to the fake website with pen and ink drawings of the characters- yeah, like dozens of people just disapeared because an entity which is in fact a building itself called RoseRed, gets jealous. er... right. The fact that some academic phd found a diary at a flea market ...!! oh this is very clever.needless to say I read the book cover to cover .It's worth the 75 cents I paid for it. Good gimmick I say.
