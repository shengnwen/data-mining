This is one of those books where all the best parts can be found on the book jacket!  I was intrigued by the book jacket description of the Swap Shop Show:  &quot;If you've got something you're itching to sell, something  you mighta never woulda bought no way, then give us a call,&quot; but this  idea isn't expanded upon in the text.  Instead, this seems to be another in  a series of recent books where the authors seem to believe a series of  quirky characters alone a great novel make.  Not so.  Readers want  characters they can get to know, characters who grow and change throughout  the book, not a series of semi-related vignettes about cardboard cutouts of  people.  I particularly found McCorkle unable to handle the parallel story  lines well.  Perhaps the plot ties together in the end (I just couldn't get  that far, I really tried!), but the impression I got was of jerking back  and forth between stories that may have stood better on their own.  For  examples of successful books employing the parallel-lives technique, see  Tom Wolfe's *A Man in Full* or Michelle Huneven's *Round Rock.*  I've  gathered in reading reviews that McCorkle is being hailed as a great new  Southern author; I found no Southern flavor at all in this book.  These  silly characters could have lived anywhere.  I guess I'll stick to Rita Mae  Brown when I want a taste of the South
