There was some hype about this book - it made it to a few 'Great New Books' Lists, so I was eager to read it.  I haven't been able to finish it and have abandoned it for more interesting (captivating) works.  The short stories are adequately written and could actually have been something if there was ever a purpose to the writing.  They leave you scratching your head and saying, "so, where's the end - what's the point?"  It did not hold my attention, I was not engaged by it, which is why it was shelved before finishing in favor of something else
