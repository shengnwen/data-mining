The author has a decent touch with action sequences (few though they are in this book). And he seems to have a real affinity for martial arts which comes across in his writing and enriches his story. But he is very akward at moving the plot forward and constantly depends on groups of characters sitting around dicussion what happened. "Why did this clue appear earlier? What is the significance of this event? What trends should we see based on events so far." Very clumsy style which veers into Hardy Boys book territory. But when he finishes explaining everything that's happended so far he writes competently. If you got the book free and like the genre it's worth reading on a plane
