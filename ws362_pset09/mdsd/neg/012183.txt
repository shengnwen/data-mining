To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations.
Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not?
I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative!
Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists.
