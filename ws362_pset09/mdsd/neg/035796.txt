I was very disappointed with this book.The title and theme really grabbed me. What you will read are the ramblings of several peoples current life stories that are boring and unhelpful. It is like Po searched out a bunch of aimless people doing strange things.The bookis no help for a typical middle class person or a blue collar worker trying to get a foot in a new door. I am tired of publishers publishing books that never arrive at any point or recommended solution. Like the readers are just blessed to be reading stlye, good English, and punctuation. Where are the solutions?Or at least be thought provoking.This book was neither
