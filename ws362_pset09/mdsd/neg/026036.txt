I didn't make it to the end of this slow-paced, excruciatingly detailed novel. The characters, Jew and Arab alike, were more stereotypes than real human beings. The scenes written from the killer's point of view were embarrassingly overwritten; I don't like this technique as a rule, but these were among the worst I've seen. I'm a fan of richly detailed settings and slow-moving plots when a book is written well enough and has characters whose side stories are interesting enough, but this one didn't make the grade. 

On a side note to those who have criticized this book's racist portrayal of overtones: I felt that the tone of the book was meant to reflect the prejudices of the main character. Maybe I'm attributing too much subtlety to Kellerman in assuming this was all intentional, but it would have been pointlessly naive for him to put pro-Arab sentiments in the mind of a conservative Israeli Jew
