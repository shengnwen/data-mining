"Mr. Mani" is the story of a Sephardic family over a couple centuries, told via one side of conversations, and going backwards in time.  Both devices are hoary. I didn't believe for a second that the characters were of their own time. They were not even three-dimensional moderns. The prose alternates between plodding and precious. It's beyond me why this novel is well-respected
