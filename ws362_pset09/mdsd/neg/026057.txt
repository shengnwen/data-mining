I thought the beginning of this book was GREAT! So funny and smart. And then it's not. One specific complaint is she has one of the characters go on a page-long tirade against Michael Milken and Reagan and other evil people from the 80s. It seems like she wanted to say these things and instead of cleverly weaving her opinions into her story through her character, she just has them say it, even when it hurts the flow of the story. It seemed lazy. And that was a problem throughout the book for me; good idea but poorly executed
