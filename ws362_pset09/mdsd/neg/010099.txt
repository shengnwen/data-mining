How about writing some parenting tips on dealing with the strong-willed child?  

The basic premise of the book:  Mild spanking by a loving parent is essential for a child to respect authority later in life.  Depriving them of this necessity will lead them to be a failure in work and other adult situations. 

The book focuses on:  justifications for spanking, rationalization that spanking is not harmful to children and prevents child abuse, and how all studies regarding spanking (except the ones that support spanking) are horribly flawed and overrated.  Excessive examples of how other parenting experts are wrong and how their advice is ineffective are discussed.  Inflammatory and biased language is used to persuade the reader.

The books presents that mild spanking should be used as one of many different strategies, however it fails to discuss any other effective techniques.  Only read this book if you are looking for reinforcement of your belief in spanking.  It offers nothing else.
