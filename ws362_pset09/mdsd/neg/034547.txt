Here's this book in a nutshell:

Be chased by bad guys. Feel safe. Oh no! Realize that bad guys are on your trail again. Lather, rinse, repeat. 

Throw in a few interesting ideas, and then add a dash of the most improbable romance you can conceive.

Why did I give this book 2 stars? There is a sinister magic to this series. Despite my critiques, I continue to read. Why can't I stop
