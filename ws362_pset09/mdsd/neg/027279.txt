SharePoint as a technology is a tremendous product.  This book, however, does not come close to doing it justice.  I found the verbiage to be incoherent in various places, and occasionally terms were simply never defined.  Further, at one point the author says "At the time we had to go to press with this chapter, the information on how to use Microsoft SharePoint Server 2003 extranets was in the beta stages of being written"...  When I purchased this book about SharePoint products and technologies, I assumed the author would be able to write about SharePoint portal server 2003 without requiring other authors to pave the way.  In short, this book seems to be a repurposing of information from other sources in a pell-mell fashion.  Consequently I cannot recommend it
