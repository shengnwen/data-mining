As a university professor of human resource development and an Anglican brother, The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent is pure drivel and has no redeeming value whatsoever. If you enjoy new-age fantasy, get a copy from your local library otherwise do not waste your money. If you are serious about spiritual growth you might read works such as The Rule of Benedict: Insights for the Ages, or the best selling book on spiritual development of all time.. it's called the Bible
