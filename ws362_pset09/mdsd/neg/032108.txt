David Blight's book has shed much light on the impact the War Between the States (Civil War) has had upon the American mind. However, Northern apologists continue to refuse the Southerner to have his/her view point on this topic, as if to deny that there were not two distinct competing cultures in this conflict; one agrarian and the other industrial. More strikingly is the way the author lays claim to the supposed moral high ground of the Union army in fighting for emancipation and the underlying claim that the South fought to maintain slavery (Gen's Lee, Polk, Cleburne, Johnston, Col Mosby and many others did not advocate slavery nor own them). Sadly, the author fails to mentioned that we are the only Western nation to have allegedly fight a war to end slavery. The North had black codes which refused blacks the right to vote, own property, and attend schools, yet this is not mentioned. Hardly freedom. Blight's book is interesting in tracing the impact the conflict has had upon our memories and nation. The conflict truly established an enduring legacy of American fortitude and will.  However, I was somewhat disappointed that he hardly gave attention to the rise of pragmatism in the US shortly after 1865, thus contributing to Jim Crow laws and segregation(not the correct means to deal with cultural problems). Blight also failed to show a grasp of antebellum race relations and that Southernors, despite slavery, were more yoked together then during the Northern Reconstruction time period. Although I gave it only 2 stars (generliazed view of the social/cultural issues surrounding the War and typical victors' history), it is worth buying
