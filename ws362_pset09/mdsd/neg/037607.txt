 Very poorly organized.  Focuses on case studies (like pages and pages about vole hormones and a whole chapter on bird song) rather than concepts.  The writing style is decent, but it's not very comprehensive or clear, and the author makes some mistakes (he misinterprets a critical graph when discussing hyena hormones and ends up with a bad conclusion.  My teacher knows he  screwed it up because she wrote the paper he cites incorrectly).

The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is that my teacher says that, while it is quite bad, there are no better alternatives
