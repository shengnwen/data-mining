I have all of her previous books and I have to admit that I am getting a little tired of her cookbooks. I have used her first two books numerous times and the recipes are no fail. However, with the more recent ones and especially this last one, I am beginning to fill that her repertoire needs some refreshing. There is nothing new and exciting here and I have encountered and excecuted extremely close version of these recipes from a number of other chefs/cookbook writers. Let us hope for something better in the future
