This is a poor work for all of the reasons stated. The facts are especially weak with regard to the African kingdoms and empires. The Ghana kingdom, for example, was never ruled by berbers and neither was it dependent upon them for trade. It was founded and ruled by the Soninke, a part of the Mande group which for over 1000 years dominated the trade routes North, East, and South of their capitals. The book  also continues to pay too much lip-service to Greeks and Romans and their influence on Western society and not enough to the cultures most influential outside of Europe. There is a much larger world beyond the West, and any book about "HISTORY" should explore - honestly - every aspect of that world. It is therefore a poor homeschool reference, because it will result in you needing to spend time explaining eurocentric biases to your children, and ultimately, needing to purchase an additional reference book
