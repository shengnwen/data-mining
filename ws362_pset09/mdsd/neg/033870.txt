I was disappointed with the whole thing:  mostly commentary and not much content;  I'd have expected and would have liked more of each show and less of the commentary.  It felt to me like the authors missed their mark and focused on their documentary rather than on the subject(s).  I wouldn't recommend at all, even at the reduced price from the original retail..
