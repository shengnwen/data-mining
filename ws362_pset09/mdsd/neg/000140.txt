I was expecting something more like Miyamoto Musashi's "Book of Five Rings." 
 I believe the era in which Tsunetomo wrote (early 1700s) was rather less interesting than the transitional period between Momoyama and Edo eras when Musashi lived. It is essentially a manual of manners and morals for employees who would die for their boss. Lots of yammer about the righteousness of cutting your intestines out for no clear reason, and keeping neat, squeaky clean and ready for death. As I understand things, during this period you were a lot more likely to cut out your own intestines than die in combat. I suppose I would take inspiration from such a thing if I were a "sararyman," a bodyguard, low ranking soldier in peacetime,  or some such self-loathing type, but meanwhile it really isn't for me. Perhaps it is the book for someone else; Tsunetomo's era has more in common with our own than Musashi's does; he was a bureaucrat -chances are, you're more of a bureaucrat than you are a Samurai.

 On the other hand, the book did develop an appreciation for the concept of badger skin underpants
