I bought this book based on the blurbs, and the fact that I enjoy an occasional Steven Covey - type read.

This sure wasn't one of them.

I started the book once and put it down after reaching the third point, thinking that maybe this wasn't simplistic pap written in an incredibly juvenile fashion, but that maybe for whatever reason my head wasn't into it.

I took it on a recent vacation, thinking that with my mind unfettered, etc., perhaps I might be more open to what the book had to say.

Wrong.

This is a terribly written book, with a hokey, herky-jerky style by an author in need of some creative writing classes, spouting the most basic of tenants as if they are something new.

For Pete's sake, basically this fellow took Zig Ziglar and put in a clever twist of the 'Time Bandits' style confrontations with famous characters. I noted with amusement that all of the characters basically had the same sort of dialogue. When Anne Frank has the same speech patterns as Solomon and Harry Truman, I know I'm reading a really bad book.

Comparing this to Og Mandino is an insult to Og. 

This book is to motivational literature what 'Bridges of Madison County' was to fiction
