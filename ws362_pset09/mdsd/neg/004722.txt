Master Ni does not trust the reader to be able to understand the Tao without his using many words to explain it to us.  As a result, his translations are long and cumbersome compared to the original text, and completely devoid of its beauty.  If you want everything spelled out to you step-by-step, then this is the translation for you.  But remember that the 'Tao Te Ching' starts off by warning the reader 'The Tao that can be spoken is not the true Tao.'  It is up to each person to find an understanding of the Tao in his/her heart.  By trying so hard to 'speak' the Tao with his words, Master Ni ignores the spirit of the true Tao
