You know, yesterday, 20/20 aired yet ANOTHER report featuring a major climatologist whose reports regarding global warming are regularly edited and grossly redacted by the president's folks to make it sound as if global warming is just a gnat in the wind.

I read this book. I cannot imagine how anyone can accuse the world's climatologists of "false science" with a straight face. 

Both the author and his supporters -- like ardent right-wing "journalist" John Stossel (a lightweight reporter with a third-rate intellect)are idealogues who are TRYING to prove wrong opinions that, if correct, will mean the death of earth. 

What kind of people are these? Why would ANYWONE try to convince others that this is not happening when the consequences, if they are wrong and able to convince enough people, will be horrific? 

Anti-science is the work of idiots and fools, people who correctly observe that you can't be rational, which science is, and believe that some god will not visit horror on the earth.

This book is earnest and stupid
