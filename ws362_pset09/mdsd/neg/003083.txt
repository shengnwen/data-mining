How about:  three centuries of gossip in the world of theoritical physics and mathematics...it's a lot closer to the content of the book.  

Why do most physicists and mathematicians have to write about the human side of those who contributed to their fields instead of discussing the topics germane to their to main ideas.

I really would like to know about the constants, what their importance is and how they were discovered and developed, not about a debate at a conference in some place I've never been in 1879.

I had hoped, and had believed, that this book would discuss each of the constants in detail.  But, after weeks of teadous reading, I came to the end with my wish unfulfilled.
