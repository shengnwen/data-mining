As a begining ESL teacher without training in this area, I was looking for a book that included practical advice,such as needs assessments, lesson/unit plans, etc. Many reviews lead you to believe that this is a great overall book that includes these things, but it is not! This book is a text book for a "Teaching ESL" class.  All theory with almost NO practical purpose.  If you are interested in language acquisition theory etc., then this may be the book for you, but if your looking for a book to help you teach an ESL class - don't waste your money. I'm very sorry I did.
