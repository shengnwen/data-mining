This book is perpetuating false facts about Reiki and its history. Hayashi did not charge $10,000 for master level training as this book claims. And certainly Usui did not charge anywhere near $10,000 as the book is  suggesting. This book also states that Usui was a Christian monk, when in  fact he was Buddhist. Another false fact presented in this book is that  Hayashi was Usui's successor, when we know through research it was Ushida.  The society that Usui founded in 1922 still exists today in Japan and is  called Usui Shiki Reiki Ryoho. Ushida was the second president of this  organization after Usui made his transition. I recommend the book Reiki  Fire for those interested in the true and verifiable history of Reiki or  contact the Usui Shiki Reiki Ryoho society in Japan. These are only a FEW  examples of the incorrect information this book is presenting about Reiki  and its history
