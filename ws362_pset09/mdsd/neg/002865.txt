We were looking for scientific, comprehensive information about fertility and conception.  We found this book to be vague and general, which is OK if you need some background on general infertility or fertility issues.  If you want a much more specific "how-to" on identifying fertile days, knowledge of fertility signs, and how to make detailed charts that will be useful for you and your doctor, then we very strongly recommend Toni Weschler's "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" instead.
