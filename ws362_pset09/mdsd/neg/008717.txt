I don't actually believe in sociology and I think Mr. Thio's reasoning is mushy at many points.  If you're thinking of paying full-price at your campus bookstore for the current edition, think again.  The author mainly updates the pictures each year and tosses in a few new references - if you buy a coffee for the guy next to you he'll probably let you skim his new addition before the exam
