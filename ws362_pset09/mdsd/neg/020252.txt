As an update to "James Bond: The Secret World of 007" this book is sorely lacking. The meager additions covering CASINO ROYALE are perfunctory at best. The DIE ANOTHER DAY additions are adequate but seem to lack the detail given to earlier James Bond films. The lackluster cover seems to parallel the significance of this edition.
