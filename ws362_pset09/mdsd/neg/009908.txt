I was very excited when our bookclub selected Susanna Moore's One Last Look for the January selection - I bought the hard back and settled in for a good read....boy, was I disappointed. The language makes this book no fun to read and thus a really frustrating way to pass a winter evening.  Many other writers have given us diaries based on letters which offer the reader real insight into a specific time and events. Sadly, this book left me with nothing more than the feeling I should buy a better dictionary
