Let me start by saying I am an avid Sci-Fi reader, the longer the book the better. I believe a good story takes a long time to tell ala Harry Turtledove. So when I read the plot and saw the book size, I thought I was in for a good read. I could not have been more incorrect. Here are my bullet points:

1) Excellent plot idea, but I think Baxter forgot what is was after the first 12 pages. I have never been a part of such a plot trainwreck as this. Its like he compiled a dozen different stories into one without any of them going anywhere.
2) Character developement was horrendous. He needs to take a lesson from Harry Turtledove or Kevin Anderson. Those guys can present twenty or more characters, make you remember and love each one, this guy can't do it with two.
3) Science. About the only thing this guy can get across, but its not involving, its like reading a NASA technical paper, done with lots of coffee.
4) Writing. He needs to take a lesson from Jack McDevitt. You need to make the book an incredible journey independent of the ending. I begged for the ending just to finish the book. If Nemoto was one thousand years old, I felt like it half way through the book. Baxter's writing style is cold and easily forgotten. 

The plot to this review, skip this book. It goes everywhere and nowhere all at once. I implore Baxter to work on his writing style and present more concise plot lines, eliminate all the extra about prehistoric men crapping on themselves on Jupiter's moon and stick to the plot. The editors need to quite screwing around and edit these books. Like previous readers, the book could have been cut in half..
