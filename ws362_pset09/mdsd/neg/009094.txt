White Tantra seeks to conquer the demons we have inside, as opposed to enslaving ourselves to them. White Tantra ALWAYS teaches to RENOUNCE animal desire. This is how one becomes a purified soul, a Mahatma, an angel, an illuminated Master: these types of people have no lust, no desire, and are not controlled by animal instinct. How could an angel have lust? How could an angel have pride? To become an Illuminated Soul, we must remove all that is impure from the soul. Books and schools that teach how to awaken through lust, through the orgasm, through desire, are teaching BLACK TANTRA: they are teaching humanity how to awaken as Black Magicians. The purified soul has removed all animal instinct and pride, lust, fear, jealousy, attachment, etc.  By stumilating and feeding lust we only deepen our slavery to sensation and animal desire, thus increasing our karma and our suffering.  White Sexual Magic is the pure sexual activity of the Djinns, of the Angels, the Buddhas - for God creates through sex.  BE CLEAR: we create through our use of sex, but we can create either an Angel or a Demon.
