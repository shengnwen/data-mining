I have been trying to help a friend critique her mystery novel and get it ready to publish and thought that a published author would be able to help. Unfortunately, this is not the right book for it. I passed up other lesser known 'How-To' authors in favor of this one, and I regret it. You know you are in trouble when the first page is a FOREWARD (instead of a FOREWORD) and the guy who writes it spends all but the last sentence of it talking about himself instead of about Hayden's book. 

The first 80 or so pages are not bad. They are very general, but there is some good advice there. Then from there on, the author spends the next 40 pages giving trite and yawn-worthy grammar and usage advice. The final 30 pages before all the author interviews are general commentary about contracts, mystery groups, and writing a series, but again, it is all so general as not to be very helpful at all.

From page 152 on through the interviews, we are treated to some interesting stuff from various midlist to famous authors, but none of it helps reach the goal of the title, Writing the Mystery: A Start to Finish Guide for Both Novice and Professional. 

Lastly the FAQ and Index are both rather weak. This book is not detailed enough to help a novice, and it is so general that a professional would only sit there saying, "yes, I knew that, yes, I knew that, duh, nothing new there, etc." The writer is cogent, and her delivery sound, but this sure doesn't help anyone much if it is not always really on-topic in a way to help write a novel. A good editor could have cut half the blather and inserted another 100 pages of helpful details and advice. The book just does not go anywhere, and I am sorry I bought it instead of one of the other mystery crafting novels. Back to the drawing board
