Janet Evanovich is my absolute all time favorite author, which is why I'm heartbroken over this book. I have never read an Evanovich book I didn't like until now. I literally finished the book only because Janet wrote it. 

The book pretty much goes like this: steal a hauler, Beans is kidnapped, follow people around, get Beans back, follow more people around, Gobbles is kidnapped, follow some more people around, Hooker is kidnapped(my favorite part, who likes a cheater!), follow even more people around, etc, etc... Wish I had a nickel for every car they tailed in this book. I also agree with the other reviewers, Beans the dog got on my nerves pretty quick. 

I'm still a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum series. I can't wait for the next Plum book in January. I just wish Janet would have spent her time working on the next Plum novel instead of wasting everyones time with Motor Mouth.
