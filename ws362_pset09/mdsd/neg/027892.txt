This book is a collection of previously published thumbnail sized drawings. The book catagorizes the drawings, but not clearly. The drawings are really quite inconsistent, and the explanations are minimal. There is only one drawing per mechanism... so really it should be called Five Hundred And Seven Odd Drawings Which You May Enjoy; However, You Will Never Reference One Of Them.

When I say the drawings are inconsistent, I'm alluding to the fact that they were pulled from different sources, and it REALLY shows.

This book is TINY. Wait... I shouldn't have made "tiny" so large. It might confuse you.

I'm sure that the author put time into this book. And in all fairness, it is inexpensive. The value just isn't there though.

This book is the antithesis of Macaulay's The Way Things Work. It is "Things: They Might Work, But Who Knows How?"

There are other editions of this book, and maybe they are better.... but really we all know they're not
