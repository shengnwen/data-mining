The world of Star Wars is a very interesting one, but there is no reason to show how one theory or another agrees with everything George Lucas created.  Lucas did not look to science for his ships, weapons, aliens, or  The Force, and science is not &quot;trying to catch up with Star  Wars,&quot; as the author posits.  The science of the book is very  interesting and well-written, but the subject matter is not one that  requires a scientific explanation
