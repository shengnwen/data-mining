The heroine, if you can call her that, has the hissy fit to end all hissy fits right at the beginning of the book.  We forgive her for it because she's been placed in such an awful situation.  The next day though, the problems start.
The author either doesn't understand pacing or has no clue of how long it takes to just do things in every day life.  Her timing was all over the place and it pulled me out of the story.  
 
The lead female chacter manages to get over the hurt and devastation of finding her fiance cheating on her the night before the wedding in somewhere between one and two weeks.  Are you kidding me?  She looks up one morning and says, "I'm healed."  Either she didn't love the guy in the first place or she's the coldest thing around. 

Then there's the issue of at least 3 of her characters drinking and driving.  Where the heck has this author been living that she thinks it's normal or cool to have people pulling into the mini-mart, pick up a beer, drink it and then take off again??
 
The piece de resistance that had me wanting to dent the wall with this book was that charming scene where our heroine serves someone water from the toilet bowl - NOT tank (as if that's acceptable), but bowl.  How on earth am I supposed to like or sympathize with a character like that?
 
I'm shocked at the existing positive reviews.  This book stinks
