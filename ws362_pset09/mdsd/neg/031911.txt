This is a story line attacking the merits of the resurrection of Jesus as is popular in modern culture.  This work of fiction capitalizes on the swell of popular culture to attack the resurrection of Christ.  One of the books tactics regards Bible inerrancy and addresses the supposed contradictions in the resurrection narratives (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the Bible).  This is a favorite study of mine and I assure you the accusations are false.  

Other than that, the book is an okay read, kinda entertaining in places.  Not too convincing
