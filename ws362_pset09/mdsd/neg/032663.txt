I thought this book would offer more in the way to make changes in your home, instead it is a nice narrative of people who have been helped by the author.  I prefer a direct "how to" approach, and this was not it - very disappointing.  Gregory Bodenhammer has two books on this topic that are more direct, concise and to the point.  I found that "Back in Control" and "Parent in Control" had a lot of useable information
