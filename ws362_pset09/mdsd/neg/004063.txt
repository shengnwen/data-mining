While I admire Mehta's brave plunge into the underworld his research seems to have no final conclusion. Maximum City is nothing but a string of obervations strung together with none of the brilliant analysis of, say, Naipaul or Dalrymple. My patience finally wore out with the section on "Monalisa" - a totally uninteresting, narcissistic bar girl of limited intelligence. Unable to explain why he wanted to know "why she cut herself" Mehta falls back on a bunch of "hooker with a heart of gold" cliches that would have done justice to the corniest Bollywood production. Face it Suketu: you just thoguht she was hot
