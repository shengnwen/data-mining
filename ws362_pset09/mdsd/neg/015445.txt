I am also a Catholic priest. Here is a man who was rector of a seminary. Yet he takes no responsibility for the current problems. Instead he dares to offer advice. Penance would be more appropriate. I would ask him &quot;why didn't you fix the problems when you had the chance as rector?&quot; and &quot;why if there is a problem with homosexuals in the priesthood did you not take action and expell them?&quot;. The answer to our problems is more fidelty not less. Fr. Cozzens is part of the problem not the answer. For the real answers we need only look to Pope John Paul II. If we had simply done what he has asked us to do for years we would not be in this situation
