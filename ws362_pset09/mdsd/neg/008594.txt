It's too bad - it could've been an interesting book.

Major flaws:

(1) His assumptions that women lack ambition and competitiveness and are unwilling compared to men to do what it takes.  Clearly this man's views have been shaped by the women he personally knows.  Do you know a highly aggressive, well-respected, well-liked, sharp woman who knows how to negotiate and who works as hard as any man but STILL doesn't even come close to what a man would make?  Well, if you do, and in particular if you know a lot of them, you'll find this book startlingly naive.

(2) The author fails to notice and address the very simple concept that males have made a corporate structure where males succeed.
