Unless you are an avid bird watcher with an interest in birds and their habitats, you will find this book difficult to understand.  It is even harder to piece together the ideas the author is trying to convey.  The ideas are disjointed and read worse than the diary of a thirteen year old in how everything is organized.  This book was a mandatory read for a class I took and I would not have read it otherwise.  The reading is monotonous and a chore to continue.  Although factual in its reporting it is difficult to understand what the author wants you to know.  If the ending was placed at the begining it might provide enough incentive to continue readig the book
