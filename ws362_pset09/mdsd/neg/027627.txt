A picture book of live nude models caught in mid leap or whirl, with various lighting.  Divided into the single female figure (Playboy this ain't), the single male figure (no g-string), and groups (4 whole shots).  Good if you need a reality check to make Hogarth clear, or just want a starting point to get your mind loose sketching.  You know perfectly well that the exact pose you need is not likely to show up in a collection of less than 10,000 shots
