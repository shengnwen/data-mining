Somehow I felt that if the subject matter was going to be so horrible, then we must expect to be uplifted and guided as we read this child's story from heaven.  Not so.  She never seems happy in heaven, nor do the other souls around her.  She doesn't even seem content.  Chapter after chapter one keeps expecting something....anything to give this childs life worth.  To give the book some worth.  Never happens.  Very disappointed
