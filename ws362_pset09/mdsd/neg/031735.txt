Which of the following statements are true: 
a)	René Descartes invented the Cartesian coordinate system to track the movements of a fly on the wall. 
b)	René Descartes was messy. 
c)	René Descartes absentmindedly fell into the Seine. 
d)	None of the above.
The correct answer is "d)." Unfortunately, the author of this pseudo-biography, tells an engaging story, which incorporates all three statements. The fact behind the fiction is stated in the Author's Note section on the final page (48), where we learn the only two undisputable facts in the entire book: "...René Descartes made the Cartesian Coordinate System very popular. And he was a darn good philosopher, too." The remaining pages are filled with speculation. Although the illustrations are very good, and the book's explanation of the Cartesian coordinate system is comprehensible, it seems pointless to provide a fabricated story to a seven to nine-year-old child, to whom you must at some point say, "It isn't true."
