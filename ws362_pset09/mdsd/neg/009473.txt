I would possibly recommend this book for children but not for the serious reader or someone who needs information pertaining to African-American scientists and inventors. The book has a very elementary style of writing and few citations of where the information was obtained. I was expecting a book with deep information of African-American history but was disappointed in the juvenile nature of the book
