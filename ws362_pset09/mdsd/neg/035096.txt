The book gives a brief account of the experience of Chinese prostitutes in nineteenth-century San Francisco. During that period many Chinese women migrated to the United States and and sold their bodies for economic improvement. They daily encounter racism, discrimination, exploitation, and violence. The biggest weakness of the book is that all the facts are contradictary to the thesis. Although the author attempts to challenge the stereotype  of the Chinese prostitutes as hapless victims of economic, racial, and sexual exploitation, the stories in the book have failed to support its argument. Presenting only the misery and sufferings of the prostitutes at the hand of men, the excessive details of those immigrants' unpleasant experience in the American West contradict the thesis. There is no evidence of &quot;unsubmissive women&quot; in the book at all. It just reinforce the stereotype. Many portions of the book seem to be simply a collection of various unsorted episodes with no analysis. The research is incomplete. The author's incapability to read any document in Chinese has greatly hampered his research and also limited his knowledge about Chinese immigration history. In general, this is a poorly researched, weakly argued, carelessly written book. Agreeing with many other professional reviewers, I don't recommend this work to the general audience
