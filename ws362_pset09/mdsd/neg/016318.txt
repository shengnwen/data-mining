Every person that wants to teach science on any level should be required to read this book.  If they can't find an average of one error in basic science per page they shouldn't be allowed in a classroom.  Picking out the errors was fun for the first couple of chapters then it just got painful.  Kids that watch the Discovery channel will laugh at some of the errors, like putting penquins in the Artic and having the sun set in the east.  This is no Jurrasic Park clone.  In JP all the science was legitimate while the fiction held the speculation.  Getting beyond the physical impossibilities of the creature he has his people doing physically impossible things. For example there is no archer in the world that can shoot skeet with a bow, much less shoot three at once.  Nor can an archer shoot a bow with a shoulder gone.
