I expected that Gary Sick's &quot;All Fall Down&quot; was going to be an exciting account of the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis.  Instead, it was a boring account of the Carter administration's reaction to  the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis.  Sick worked for Carter when  the revolution helped turn the president's foreign policy program on its  head.  The hostage crisis more than any other event, contributed to  Carter's defeat in 1980.  Unfortunately, none of this makes for terribly  interesting reading.  The Iranian revolution is one of the most important  events in World History of the last quarter century.  But you would never  know that from reading this book
