I've listened to people rave about this book for years, and being a horror junkie, I couldn't help but pick up a copy as soon as Leisure re-released it.  I tore the cover open, expecting to be blown away.  Did I read the same book that's getting all of the 5 star reviews and adoring cover-blurbs?  I feel horribly cheated.

For starters, the story was propelled by the shallowest plot I've read in horror fiction.  Who are these cannibals, why are they there, what is their purpose, and what has brought them to such a point of unintelligent animalism?  I hope you aren't looking for answers to these questions within the book.  Nevermind the fact that there were no psychological elements behind the killings whatsoever.  This short, bland novel is the literary equivalent of a slasher b-movie.

The characters here were 2-dimensional. Basically fodder to be sequentially killed off.  But that wasn't the worst narrative element.  The writing itself was amatuer, sloppy, and just plain laughable.  Instead of attempting to depict characters in a unique light, the author chooses to isntead bombard us with so many pronouns that we lost track of which "he", "she", or "child" he's even referring to at most times.

Then we come to the gore.  People keep referring to this book as the most extreme horror on the market.  Call me psychotic if you will, but I didn't cringe once.  If you want graphic depictions of extreme violence, complete with fully developed characters, psychological intruigue, suspense, and plot development, let me suggest Michael Slade's "Headhunter" or J.F. Gonzalez's "Survivor".  However, if you still insist on reading this book, save yourself some coin and try finding my copy at my local used book store
