This memoir/humor type book was written by a former employee of Amazon.com.

While the author proclaims himself to be a slacker (read: cool) I thought this story would be quite entertaining.

WRONG!

I did manage to get through the book (it was no easy feat) and throughout the whole thing, the author manages to write and write but actually says absolutely nothing.

It is obvious that the author used this book as nothing more than a vehicle to wax poetic.  I did not gleam one piece of interesting information out of this memoir.  The book is purported to be funny when, in fact, it is a one great big yawn. 

An incredibly boring read.  Now I know why I found this book on the "sale" table at my local bookstore
