This book pulls together a lot of information, but in my opinion it is written and organized very very poorly. I have over 10 yrs of experience in in the healthcare industry and came across this book during a grad level course in CEA.

Long, boring, convoluted sentences fill the pages of this book. It took about 3 times more time and effort to get through a page in this book compared to a page in respected journals like JAMA, NEJM, BMJ etc.

If you have lots of time and are doing research in this field - go for it. Alternatively if you want to quickly determine what CEA is about, I would recommend reading Peter Muennig and Kamran Khan "Designing and Conducting Cost-Effectiveness Analyses in Medicine and Health Care"
