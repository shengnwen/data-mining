I had to buy this book for a college course and, quite frankly, I think it's ridiculous.  While there are fantastic examples and projects in this text, I did not come across a single piece of information that could qualify as anything other than common sense.  This may be useful as an early high school textbook, but no high school grad should need to learn any of this stuff.  The result was a class of 30 kids rolling their eyes through lectures and laughing at the absurdity of the material included.  I was very irritated to pay such a high price for a book that afforded me no new knowledge.  The two stars were for the book's potential use in high schools or as a teacher's resource for relevant projects in technical writing
