My family (who is entirely CUBAN) sat around reading the recipes of this book and began to laugh.  I mean, what REAL Cuban cooks a steak in Olive Oil???  We also DO NOT eat gazpacho...that is a Latin American dish...not Cuban...why is it in a Cuban Cook Book?  I was not impressed with the book and am returning it in hopes that I find something more authentic and true
