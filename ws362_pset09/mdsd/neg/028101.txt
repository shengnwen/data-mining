Let's not even discuss the countless laws our heroine violated in her attempt to escape her abusive husband.  Laws, that were completely overlooked by the authorities in the resolution of this piece of work.  Lets go to the stereotyped characters, the completely predictable plot,  the outrageous 'chemistry' of the two main lovers and the mindless banter that was being passed off as witty conversation.  The bad guy was completely bad, the heroine was perfectly good, the hero was a pillar of strength, the son was every parents' dream, the cops were all cliches of one type or another...The characters were perfect examples of cardboard cut-outs.   Max and Caroline had romantic sparks flying the minute they saw each other and it was hilarious...There is no way a real person in real life could think and act like those two...These two would make a great Saturday NIght Live satire of afternoon soap operas.  Detective Jolley was a hoot...If you didn't see what was coming for him you were not payng attention which could have easily been the case.  The plot I thought had possibilities but it was wasted.  Yes, I know Rob Winters was one of them (a cop), but come on...Nobody could see the obvious here?  Finally, of all the things I did not like about this book, there was the scene in the kitchen with Max, Tom, Caroline and Dana.  Why Caroline (or Max)didn't just smack Dana for her witty comments (more like witless) is beyond me.  Somecody should have just told her to shut the H... up.   This was not good natured banter among friends.  This was drivel.   I bought another Karen Rose book at the same time I purchased this one.  I'm not sure if I will give it a try or not.  This book could have been written by a middle school student who would have been satisfied with a grade of 'C'.   I gave it two stars only because I was able to finish it and I wanted to see how the author wrapped it up.
