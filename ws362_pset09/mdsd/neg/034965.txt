I READ MOST OF WHAT THE OTHER REVIEWERS WROTE AND I AGREED WITH THEM. THERE REALLY WAS NO DEPTH, BARELY ANY EMOTIONS, THE HERO IS SO VERY DULL. WHAT I DIDN'T GET WAS THE FACT THAT HE WENT AND KISSED THE HEROINE'S SISTER AND RESPONDED, WHAT'S WORSE WAS THAT, THAT PART WAS ONLY 67 PAGES TO THE END. HE DIDN'T REALLY ADMIT HE LOVE HIS WIFE UNTIL SHE ASKED HIM! AND HE REPLIED, 

"AYE. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. I AM YOUR HUSBAND. HOW CAN YOU DOUBT IT?"

THERE WASN'T EVEN ANY EMOTION AS HE TALKED! BORING! I STILL CAN'T IMAGINE HE WENT AND KISSED SOMEONE ELSE AND FELT NO REMORSE OR GUILT. NO FEELINGS, PRATICALLY FOR WHAT HE DID!

ANOTHER PROBLEM, IS THAT HE SEEMED TO TAKE A LIKING TO THE HEROINE'S LITTLE BROTHER WAY TOO MUCH! IT'S ALMOST DISTURBING!

THE FACT THAT IN THE SEQUEL, CLEVE MENTIONED OF THE HERO'S LOVE FOR THE BOY MORE THAN THE WORLD AND PERHAPS HIS WIFE TOO. PREHAPS? I MEAN THAT IS EXTREMELY MESSED UP! '&'

I'M NOT GIVING THIS BOOK A TOTAL ZERO BECAUSE IT IS COULTER AFTER ALL. I STILL HAVE HOPE, HER OTHER BOOKS ARE BETTER.
