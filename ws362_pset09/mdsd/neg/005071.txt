As a British reader without much knowledge of the Alamo or of Texas, I can't comment on the book's historical accuracy. But like me I'm sure many people will know something of the story - if nothing else from that old John Wayne film and will be encouraged, as I was, to read it. And it is, indeed, a "page turner".  But am I the only one to come out of it angry at the gratuitous heaping of violence upon graphic violence - and it's not just the violence of war - that splatters its pages from start to finish? No, to be fair, "gratuitous" isn't the right word. We know Harrigan isn't describing a garden party. A better word is "relentless". We are only too well aware how ghastly war is. We don't need its minute details incessantly drummed into us as though we ought to enjoy lapping them up with a voyeuristic relish. The killing frenzy exhibited at various times in the book by soldiers on both sides, seems almost to be replicated by proxy in the written word. No human being, no animal, can be allowed to be injured or die without having their sufferings exposed to the world in details which are either disturbing or disgusting or more often both. If I had a thousand dollars for every inch of bowel displayed in these pages I'd never need to work again!  Why do we need it? What on earth has happened to our society that this sort of thing has become mainstream literature, a "best-seller" that can be picked up from any airport bookstall by any child? How many fine novels have been written about war where the descriptions are oblique and sparing and the message far more powerful?  The delicacy of previous generations had a point.
