This is some phoned in art work. 

I found the art so bad that I could hardly read the text. After this many years you think Silvestri would improve his art style but you'd be wrong, he has regressed. It seems as if he couldn't complete the required number of pages for the script, squished it down and just sped through the ones he did turn in so they wouldn't be returnable.

I think they teach you to drop cross hatching as a shading technique when you are in High School art classes but here it reigns supreme.

Poor work from someone that should be better but rather representative of his current shoddy style.
