The title and front cover kind of decieves the reader into thinking it's a different kind of book then what it actually is. I don't really see how the title tied in with the plot of the book. I wouldn't really call this a complete chick-lit book, although chick-lit has expanded into different areas other than a Bridget Jones type of story lately. "The Dominant Blonde" is more of a thriller/mystery type of novel. It kind of reminded me of some of Nora Roberts thriller type of books that I've read. The story is okay but I had a really hard time getting into the book. It took me about three weeks to finish which is really unusual because I usually read a book in less than a week. I even considered putting it away and starting a new book but I decided to push through and finish it. There just wasn't anything special about the story, I'm already kind of forgetting the storyline and it hasn't been that long since I read the book. The storyline is predictable, I knew what was going to happen before it happened. The characters aren't that memorable either and I didn't find myself rooting for any of them at all. It was just a disappointing book
