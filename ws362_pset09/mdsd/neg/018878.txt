I purchased this book as a requirement for a course I was taking. Although the title did appeal to me, since it is a topic that I have a high interest in, I was pretty much disappointed after having read through it. It was hard to read and understand, I had to reread through many of the chapters. I think the topic was great, I just don't feel the authors did justice to the topic
