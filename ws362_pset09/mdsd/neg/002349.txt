 This book could more aptly be named `What We Think We Know About Eczema & Some Things That Might Help You'.  There is some interesting information however this is just another doctor who thinks an Eczema rash is CAUSED by scratching.  Those of you that have Eczema know that while scratching makes it worse, the bumps or rash itself comes first.  

While I did find a number of his suggestions worth trying [such as washing with oatmeal rather than soap & eliminating B-complex] I found some completely insane like taking a bath in diluted Clorox!  

The book is worth reading if you don't know much about Eczema but I caution parents to do further research by talking to someone that HAS Eczema.  Some of these ideas can make your child's rash much worse.  And the ever present push from western medicine doctors to give you cortisone, then when it doesn't work - stronger cortisone, just hasn't helped me at all - not to mention the side effects & potential birth defects it can cause.  

I also don't agree that Eczema has nothing to do with what you eat. There is a lot of information out there about the benefits of  Essential Fatty Acids [Omega 3.6.9] to those with eczema.  This has been a far more helpful to me & my infant son.   You might also want to consider allergy tests.  [There are also foods that are irritants that you may need to hold off on during a flare up.]  When your system is stressed common sense tells you that it all has something to do with why your Eczema is flaring.  Remember Eczema is a symtom not the problem.

The best book I have read on eczema is:
Superimmunity for Kids : What to Feed Your Children to Keep Them Healthy Now, and Prevent Disease in Their Future (Paperback) 
by Leo Galland, Dian Dincin Buchman 
Superimmunity for Kids is a much better book for adults or children with eczema.  After reading the Superimmunity book I wanted to lower the number of stars I gave for this review but it wouldn't let me
