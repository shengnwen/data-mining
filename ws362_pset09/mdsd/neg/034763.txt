I purchased the book with great enthusiasm for I am fanatically interested in the design and construction of the Musashi.Unfortunately the book didn`t satisfy any of my interests..Rather than detail the making of the Musashi  it wandered off into the problems associated in keeping the construction  hidden.. I am no more enlightened than I was before I read the book. If you  are interested enough in the making of the Musashi that this book would  appeal to you, then you probably already know more than the book offers.
