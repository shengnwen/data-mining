Maybe my expectations were too high based on the reviews.  I found most of the information in this book to be news items. Also, anyone that follows technology in the news will not find much insight into this book.  The book is an overview of how the younger generation uses technology in their social lives, play and work.  If you are not very familiar with the internet and don't watch the news this book would be worthwhile.  However, anyone who uses the internet and keeps up on the news won't get much out of it
