This book is terrible!  It gives different definitions for the same term several times in the first few chapters.  Why doesn't it just give one coherent, comprehensive definition for each word?!! The concepts are broken up and presented helter-skelter, so reading this book is like working a tedious jigsaw puzzle. Then it includes lots of problems at the end of each chapter, but there is no answer key, and the Solutions Manual is only available to teachers.  Do they think that my professor is too lazy or too stupid to make up his own tests? (Hint to oblivious writers/editors: a textbook is useless if students cannot practice working problems and check the answers on their own.  This is not third grade, and my professor is not a babysitter!)  I bought the workbook (which contains practice tests) separately, but I still don't have the answers to the problems at the end of the chapters. I will speak to the department heads at my college and beg them to switch publishers next semester
