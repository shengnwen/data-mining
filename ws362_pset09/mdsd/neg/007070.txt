The diagrams are a little too schematic, showing some muscle bellies well displaced from their actual positions.  What's worse is that the software doesn't have any pictures available for many of the muscles listed.  There was also at least one difference from Gray's Anatomy that I think Gray got right and this book didn't.  If I'd been able to try this before buying, I wouldn't have bought it
