I can't, for the life of me, figure out why this book is getting such rave reviews. I found it to be a major disappointment, mostly because the reviews led me to expect much more. This book is for the TOTALLY clueless, ie., those who don't know that rosemary goes with lamb and chicken, apples with pork, beans with bacon, etc. I can see how it could help jumpstart a kitchen novice, but if a professional chef needs this book he/she is in the wrong profession. There's absolutely nothing new here. To make matters worse, it's in boring black and white with not one image (color or otherwise) to inspire or break the monotony. I've tried again and again to find a reason to keep this book but can't come up with one. It's up for sale. Sorry folks, I just can't agree on this one.
