Let me start by saying that this is the only Dirk Pitt/Clive Cussler novel I've read so far. I have no opinion on any other DP books. This, however, was dreadful.

This book's only redeeming point is the seemingly interesting theory about the Trojan Oddyssey having taken place in the Atlantic  Ocean instead of the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, this theory has preciously little to do with the rest of the book, and seems to be there mainly as a selling point for a mostly unrelated (and very poor) story.

The actual story is best compared to a bad James Bond movie (one from the seventies would do nicely), complete with super-villains, world-threatening schemes and secret bases. The problem here is that all of this is completely silly from start to finish (what on earth was up with the hologram pirates?). Everything is far-fetched, implausible, or most likely both. It also has none of the style and very little of the humor which often redeems James Bond. 

To make matters even worse, this movie must contain the worst characters in living history. From Dirk Pitt to the super-villain, they're all extremely dull and flat. Yet, no opportunity is wasted by the author to rub in how wonderful, beautiful and talented all these characters (supposedly) are. Together with lots of unnecessarily lengthy descriptions of just about everything, this book is truly full of filler. 

The characters are also completely super-human, apparently, since there doesn't seem to be anything that Pitt cum suis can't handle, including flying a helicopter into the hurricane of the century (just after the hurricane nearly took out a much more sturdy plane) and much more. This takes away any form of suspension there could have been. 

If this book didn't take itself so seriously, it might have worked. As it is, though, "Trojan Odyssey" is a totally daft, horribly written excuse for a book that does almost nothing with a potentially very entertaining theory
