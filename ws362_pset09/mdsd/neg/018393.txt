Aimed squarely at the computer-guy type it's totally a bore for this car-guy.  The actual projects were kind of interesting but too many of them had the same formula:
Buy a kit, read instructions and install according to instructions.  If you can buy a kit, read instructions and install something, you don't need this book.  If you feel that buying a kit, reading instructions, and installing something is hard for you, here is the advice from the book....  Buy a kit, read instructions and install according to instructions.
The paper even felt cheap.

Also, instead of finding illustrations or pictures of the projects actually built and installed in a car, there were a few totally blank pages.  Publishing error?  I hope so.
