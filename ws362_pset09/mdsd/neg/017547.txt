I bought this book soon after the death of my 11 year old daughter. I found the approach very uncomfortable and it left me feeling as though i was failing because i was not following the prescribed way of grieving. The examples given in the book led me to belive that if i did not follow the advice of the author i would be doomed to a life of sadness and despair. The most damaging aspect of the text was the insistance in "letting go", and idea i still find very difficult to accept. The freightening examples of people who had become overly interseted in the cause of a loved one's death only to fall victim to the sane illness would have been better placed in horror fiction. Stear clear, this book will help know one except the author
