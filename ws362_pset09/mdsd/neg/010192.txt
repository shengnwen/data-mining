This is a Grilling Cookbook. Not a book about grilling for dummies. I had never grilled before and this book goes off about sauces and marinades, when I just wanted to start by putting a slab of meat or a hot dog on the grill.
Needless to say, I was lost and confused before I got the gas connected (which it doesn't help you with, either BTW).

It was totally useless for me
