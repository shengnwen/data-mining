For those customers who are buying other books, such as The Deep Dark, that deal specifically with the Sunshine Mine fire or with other mine disasters, Amazon inappropriately "suggests" The Sunshine Mine Disaster for purchase. I, for one, was looking for serious history, not a collection of poetry. Let this serve as a warning to prospective buyers. Shame on Amazon for conflating these poems with nonfiction works based on  painstaking research into a great and terrible tragedy
