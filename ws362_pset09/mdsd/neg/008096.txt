The book was repetitive and boring.  One theme, that could have been stated in a paragraph, was repeated over and over again to create a book. I found it to be primarily about what wonderful things the author has done for people, with letters praising her over and over. Yuk.  I read this as a selection for our church's book club, and skimmed the last quarter of it because it simply had nothing to say that it had not been said before.  I appreciate the sentiment, just felt that the author spent more time praising herself than anything else.
