I started reading this book with the expectation that I would learn about women in a culture totally different than mine. Instead, I read the story of a lusty, rich, worldly woman with no sense of morality. Then it gets  incredibly dry as the author launches into a historical story from the  middle ages. Very boring, and I heartily do NOT recommend this book
