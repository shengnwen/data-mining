I am aware that this novel falls into the Christian literature classification, however the spiritual conflict as well as the romantic aspect of the story falls short and the family dynamic is improbable.  As for the "she saw the killer and now she's at risk, so let's send in Mr. Wonderful to protect her", the story has been done to death.
 
This could, however, be a perfect vehicle for the WE (women's entertainment) cable network to purchase and produce. (All of their shows seem to be of this caliber). The story is sugary, Marcus O'Malley comes across as a combination of Clint Eastwood and Robert Young, and the women in the story are generally portrayed as helpless, in need of a man's love and protection in order to survive. All in all, there isn't a really believable character in the book. (1 1/2 stars)
