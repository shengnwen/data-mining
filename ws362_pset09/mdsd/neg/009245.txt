A few of the diary entries were interesting to read (I especially liked the story of the china doll), but the quilt blocks were a major disappointment. Each block was named after an entry in the corresponding diary entry rather than by its commonly used name. No patterns given for the blocks, only a line diagram and a small picture of an actual fabric block. Civil War Women by Barbara Brackman is a much better choice for historical background, diary entries and actual patterns
