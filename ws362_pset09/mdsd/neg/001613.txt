I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this book.  At least I got it used.  This book is almost devoid of actual tutorials and hands-on learning.  The first few chapters have some instruction, but the majority of the book reads like a compilation of resumes with stunning imagery.  There are lots of pictures and in-depth biographies of industry professionals with very little tips on how to create the images included.  If you are a new user looking to expand your skills this is not the book for you.  If you are an industry professional looking to hire a skilled artist, this may be what you're looking for.  I regret buying this book
