This is a pricey book as I write this. It offers a CD and some templates, which you are supposed to get from a Web site it tells you about inside the book. Well, guess what? No Web site. No CD. No templates. Rip off? You be the judge.

As to the contents of the book. You'll find lots of useful heads to help you in your copywriting. If you're stuck for a head, you'll find something that will do the trick in this book.

It's a handy reference and it will help you. But I feel that the author has done the reader a major disservice by not being truthful in the CD and template offer. Shame on him
