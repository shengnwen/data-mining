While this book provides a lot of technical information it was written over seven years ago.  The information provided is practically ancient in the high tech and ever changing world of IVF.  The author is very dry, clinical and frankly quite negative about the chances of success.  Again, this is due to the age of the book.  IVF success rates have increased dramatically since this book was published.  A much better, positive, timely and accurate book is The Couples Guide to IVF.  It was written in this century and it much more helpful, upbeat and informative.
