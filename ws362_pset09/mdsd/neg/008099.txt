I was expecting a book with good turkey recipes with marinades and rubs, but instead it is recipes that you need to buy the authors own marinades and rubs.  Evidently this guy started the Cajun Injector marinades and seasoning and the recipes say things like, use one jar of our marinade and one can of our seasoning and use our injector.  There are a grand total of 9 turkey recipes in a book that has 192 pages.  All the other recipes are for different side dishes and some desserts.  Don't waste your money on this book.  It was a big dissappointment
