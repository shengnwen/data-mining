I wanted to like this book, really, but after 70 pages or so, I realized life is too short to waste on crap like this. Where to start? The lead character speaks like someone in a Stephen King novel. For instance, who have you ever met someone in real life who introduces themself with their full name, including middle name? Now, that wouldn't be so bad if, like King, it had a good plot. But I didn't believe this one for a microsecond. The whole family watched from a window as the teen couple kissed? The girl in the lingerie store cheerfully tried on clothes for the lead character? Come on. When the protagonist showed up in the yard of his family's old house and started weeping, I made a vow to myself: If he wound up bedding the woman who came outside to chase him away, I was outta there. I'm glad I followed that vow
