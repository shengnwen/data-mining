This book uses a very selective, pick-and-choose approach to Buddhism as a means of pointing up the failings of traditional psychotherapy, by the use of anecdotes from the psychiatrist-author's personal life and from the case histories of his (almost entirely female) patients. It succeeds to some degree on the descriptive level, but it is not a how-to: if you need therapy, this book is not a substitute for it, and if you want to develop a meditation practice, this book will probably encourage you but it will not show you or tell you how. If you want to learn about Buddhist meditation practice this book is particularly misleading because it suggests that meditation can be a sort of care-free lifestyle accoutrement that will correct all the flaws of your (and your therapist's) Western mindset. There is an over-emphasis on esoteric Tibetan practices and beliefs that have no demonstrable connection with the teachings of the Buddha. These lurid by-ways are showcased at the expense of the traditional core of Buddhist teaching, such as the laws of moral cause and effect (i.e., karma), the four Noble Truths, and the eightfold Noble Path. Most surprisingly, the author gets through his 180 pages without once noting that, according to the Buddhist perspective, progress in meditative insight and the spiritual path is based squarely upon self-discipline and moral living. By the end of the book you will know quite a bit about the lifestyle of a successful Manhattan psychotherapist and the sorts of problems that plague his patients, but if you want to be bristling with insights about yourself, as the author is, you would be better advised to undergo one of the intensive meditation retreats that he is always going on, and going on about
