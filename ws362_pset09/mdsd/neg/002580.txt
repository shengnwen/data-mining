My 3 1/2 year old son enjoys this book, and I'll admit that the illustrations are great, but I find the text of this book lacking.  For example on page 40, the text reads: &quot;I'm supposed to be played with,&quot; he decided&quot;--is this even correct grammar?  The choppiness of the text, lack of flow, and overuse of exclamation points makes the story a disappointment to read
