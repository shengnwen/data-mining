First of all, I just wanted to comment that I am a huge fan of the Polseen universe and Mr. Ringo's body of work. Well, except for this book. 

The characterizations were not engaging, the action sequences lacked "snap", the overall plot was rather tiresome and the ending was very disappointing. Actually the ending is horrid. What I did enjoy was learning a bit more about the "Elves" as well as brushing against some other aspects of the Polseen universe and its history. 

Mr. Ringo is a skilled storyteller who has brought me countless hours of happy reading. I look forward to what comes out next in the Polseen universe but I have to recommend that people skip this book
