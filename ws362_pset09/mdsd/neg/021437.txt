What the hell kind of novel is this?  Everyone LOVES her.  She never makes any mistakes, and when she does, they are obviously NOT her fault.  Thats completly not real.  Everyone makes a mistake.  How about someone outsmarting her in a tactical situation and she loses a whole battalion?

Guess what?  These things happen...but obviously not to Honor Harrington.  What the hell is Weber thinking?  In the next novel, I think he is going to declare her the Godess of the Universe
