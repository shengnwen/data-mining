I was disappointed to find that most of these tactics were either impractical or outdated or both.Some examples described in the book:A man who puts on a gasmask, knocks on a door in the middle of the night with a large toolbox in his hand while wearing a gas company uniform and yelling out warnings that the whole block is getting ready to explode. After the home's occupants dissipate he goes through the house placing cement mix in their toilets and scattering rotten meat throughout the house. Huh? In a day and age where you could spend a few years in the slammer if you mailed somebody an envelope full of baby powder?One example suggests that you should buy a chemical made by &quot;Aquatect&quot; which leaves a bright red cloud around anyone who pees in your pool. One small problem- no such chemical has ever existed in the history of the Earth. This has been outed as an urban legend over and over again, even on TV. (A chemical that in concentrations of less than 1:5000 would cause a bright red cloud when it comes into contact with small amounts of urea, despite the fact that it is in a gigantic vat of bleach water? Ummhmm.)On the good side however, you will find that the book is a very quick read and may offer some laughs, as well as possibly a handful of ideas on elaborate pranks. The guy actually has a decent writing style, he reminds me a little bit of Hunter S. Thompson. But the long and short of it is that there is no &quot;Oh, now I've got 'em!&quot; within the pages of this book. (Unless perhaps you are irked at a UPS driver who runs over dead dogs, and you wish to wire explosives in the carcass of a dead dog to blow out his tire as in one example.
