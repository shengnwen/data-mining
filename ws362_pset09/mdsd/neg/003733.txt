Examines unusual characters, circumstances, and relationships that distinguish the Maciver family across five decades. Hamilton's choice to tell the saga in limited third person perspective, through the character of "Mac," is unfortunate. Consequently, the novel lacks the thematic depth that could have been achieved with an omniscient point of view and the insight that could have been gained by assigning the title character narrative duties. Ultimately, the novel is about as tedious, meandering, and "distinctive" as any story about any American family in the second half of the twentieth century.
