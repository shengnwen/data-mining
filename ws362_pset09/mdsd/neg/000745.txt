Boy, did I want to like this novel.  A young inventor in pre-Revolution France, when automatons were all the rage, and scientific enquiry was in  its Natural  History/specimen-collecting/leather-books-on-esoteric-subjects/freaks-and-oddities  stage.  Unfortunately, the novel infuriated me.  The characters are all  thin, even the main character, Claude, the young inventor, whom Kurzweil  treats like a lay figure, placing him in various positions and  predicaments.  Kurzweil's writing is too often glib and general.  &quot;The  beery fellow began a conversation that led to friendship.&quot; (pg 124)   Too often he tells and doesn't show.  Dialog lacks pop.  There are a number  of debates on arcane subjects which read like passages from a dry lecture.   (No crafty, natural-flow, Socratic stuff here.)  A crucial event mid-way in  the book, which propels Claude to Paris, is obviously not the shocker  Claude thinks, and it doesn't make sense that he would think it is.  There  are many nice details, details of the kind of milieu I was hoping for.  But  I need more than details...
