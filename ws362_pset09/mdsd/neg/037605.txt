I'm a big fan of Peter Bart's books and column in Variety, and Peter Guber certainly has a load of top-tier credentials. I'd really hoped for an insightful commentary on the current state of the movie business - but this isn't it. &quot;Shoot Out&quot; reads like a dozen other entry-level memoirs by bigtime moguls. There's nary an original comment, and (as other reviewers here have noted) too many war stories. &quot;Final Cut&quot; by Steven Bach gives you the story on &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; far better than Guber and Bart (and they acknowledge as much); Sidney Lumet's book on making movies gives you a far better insight into the director's world and - above all - Frank Rose's magisterial &quot;The Agency: William Morris and the Hidden History of Hollywood&quot; tells the story of the rise of the agencies in far greater detail, with much more insight than do Guber and Bart. 
 
 I really had high hopes for this one, but it was a waste of time. Rose's book - and, of course, &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot; by William Goldman (again, acknowledged repeatedly by Guber and Bart) are essential reading. This sure isn't
