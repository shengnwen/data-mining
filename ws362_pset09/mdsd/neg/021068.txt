When I first read this book, it confirmed a feeling I had then: that archaeologists should be forbidden by law to make any attempt at culture history.  It is nonsense, pure and simple; a wild attempt at inventing a "matriarchalist" past for Europe that ignores even its own evidence.  To give one instance of its lunacy, it argues that war only entered Gimbutas' imagined "Old European" culture with the evil patriarchalist Indo-Europeans and their steppe-bred war axes... and then goes on to tell us that wooden palisades (that is, FORTIFICATIONS) were a regular feature of "Old European" settlements!  What were they meaning to keep out, wolves?  Gimbutas' archaeological work is not without value, but when it comes to interpreting it, a moron or a politician could do better.  She simply is trapped in the foolish ideology of the "great goddess", a pathetic though unortunately popular reflex of contemporary political obsession.  Luckily, I have since found out that some archaeologists (for instance, Filippo Coarelli) DO read and understand anthropology, culture history, comparative sociology, etc. - but as for this sort of stuff, leave it to Wiccans and other ignorami
