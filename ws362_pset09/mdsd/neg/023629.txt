The first 2 books in Lackey's Dragonjouster series were excellent.  The author created a new world, new scenarios, new theme and did them well.  Imagine my surprise when I read 'Sanctuary' the third installment in this series.

It seems that the author, after throwing herself fully into the first 2 books, has lost interest in them and was mainly just trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible and finish the series.  'Sanctuary' could have been a satisfying end to Vetch/Kiron's story...as it was, I was left wanting...
