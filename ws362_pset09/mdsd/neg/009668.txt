A monster book of 641 pages. Proof that Eco's editor was already dead, or the book killed him. It is filled with lots of esoteric knowledge and history.
Be advised that the translator, William Weaver, does not translate the chapter headings, nor the majority of foreign dialogue. Is he assuming that we read French, or would want to?
The inclusion of 8 drawings does not advance the story and you wonder why they were included. They are there possibly solely to annoy the reader.
Eco makes the reader feel uneducated by using words and terms no one ever heard before, let alone want to use.
And the story suddenly becomes the Italian version of John Knowles' "A Separate Peace." And with this transformation: The hunt for "The Plan" or the Templars' Secret," is just a red herring, the story is not about these long dead French knights. As Eco uses 1960-70's LSD induced stream of consciousness writing style for the last 60 pages, he leads his main character to the Zen-Tao-I Ching conclusion that watching his friend be murdered is all for the best.
Perhaps Eco should take his own character's advice and "Ma gavte la nata," and take the cork out
