This book features an incredibly lame plot and even lamer dialog that is so corny it almost seems like parody. Then there is the obnoxious phrase that two of the main characters say to one another ad nauseum: "But...(dramatic pause, I assume) I saw you die!" I wish they had seen ME die so I wouldn't have had to finish reading this idiotic book. Take out this phrase and the 500 page book would probably be reduced to 450 pages. This was the first - and last - David Morrell book I will read
