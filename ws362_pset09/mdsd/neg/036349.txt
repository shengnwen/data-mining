Being that our primary purpose in life is to be successful leaders of service to others.  By clearly understanding the role we are in, knowing what actions to be successful to DO, and implementing a system in the home to cover all 4 primary needs of our children, then we will automatically cover any areas of possible "temperement hinderings" in others.  To achieve the above, I reccommend the Bible.  The book by Hal Urban, available here at Amazon.com titled Lifes greatest lessons.  20 Things That Matter (to know the 8 things that sucessful people do).  And refining revising and rennovating our habits to revolutionize the impact we have on society through this lost art called "A Family".
Confucius stated; "The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home"  I say...Duh!!
