This is an open letter to the author, Barry Glassner

You appear to believe that the only reasons
people limit their intake of pleasurable foods--with fats, salt, MSG, etc.--are for weight
maintenance, longer life, better health and other self-serving objectives.  I have given
up red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products while recognizing the loss to the pleasures
of my own taste buds, but with the greater satisfaction of being able to look myself in the
mirror: I am not contributing to  an industry that day-in, day-out causes
enormous suffering to literally billions of animals annually in our own country alone.

Though you mention animal rights here and there in The Gospel of Food, you at no
time make a connection between the joys of eating foie gras , beef, squab, and the like,
and the suffering that this consumption is causing to creatures as sentient as you. 

By dissing folks who shun the foods you enjoy, assuming that they have all bought into
nostrums provided by quacks like Atkins, you are shortchanging many.  Millions of us
refuse to partake of the pleasures of the palate that demand suffering and blood from
innocent, sentient beings
