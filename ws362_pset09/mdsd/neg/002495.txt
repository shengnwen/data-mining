Unless you are a devout christian you will get very little from this book. Throughout the book are countless references to God and quotes from the Bible. For example on page 7 God is mentioned 9 times. The author's style is far from being concise and he spends a lot of time discussing theological issues that are of no immediate use to the investor. On page 16 he says: " I told my dad, "Make me Pope. I will change the world by changing just two things. One the Pope is getting married. I'm no good leading church with all this testosterone flowing throw [sic] my veins.
Number two, I am taking over one of these buildings as my home."
Besides offending Catholics I don't see how this statement could help me build a fortune. The book is full of similar statements. Whatever investment advice the book has could fit in a booklet of about 20 pages. 
In conclusion I was disappointed by this book, I found it useless
