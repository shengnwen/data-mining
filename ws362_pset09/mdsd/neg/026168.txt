I have read all of Marcia Muller's books and this one was certainly a let down.  During the past 2 weeks I got Listen to the Silence, Both Ends of the Night and this one out of the library.  The other 2 were great - I devoured them, but I couldn't get past page 50 of this one.  Will return it to the library unfinished today.  Thank goodness I am aware of Muller's REAL potential and don't have to judge her by this book
