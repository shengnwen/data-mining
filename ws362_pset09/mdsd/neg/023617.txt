This book is extremely limited in discussing how these genetic disorders manifest themselves clinically.  I would not recommend this book for students who plan to apply their knowledge in the clinical setting.   Explanations of certain genetic terms are not always clearly defined nor  are certain biologic processes such as meiosis.  Overall, a poorly written  book for anyone but a graduate student of genetics
