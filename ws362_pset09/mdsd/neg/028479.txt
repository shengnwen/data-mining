Canadian-born John Kenneth Galbraith is probably one of the most influential economists in the West over the last 60 years.  As a flag-bearer of progressive politics and liberals, he has a steady history of writing economics treatise that argue his beliefs.  His latest offering is a short polemic against corporate bureaucracy.  Titled "The Economics of Innocent Fraud", this book shows how the modern capitalistic economy found in the US is really an economy driven by a small class of corporate managers.  They, not consumers and not share-holders, are in the driver's seat.  They determine what gets made, who gets paid, and what people can buy in the marketplace of goods, services, and most importantly, ideas.  As such, this class is beholden to noone but themselves.  The books ideas are not new, though for such a major economic figure to take it up and argue it with such obvious partisanship is quite new.  The problem with this book is its writing style.  It seems to follow a stream-of-consciousness style, which makes it difficult to understand what the author is trying to say.  The book contains many sentences that are not grammatically correct in any sense of the word.  Overall, the book's editors needed to have done a better job
