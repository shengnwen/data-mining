I had to read this book in ninth grade honors English.  I thought the book was one more the more profound wastes of time I had ever expended when I was done.  Now that I'm in college however, I do not despise the book as much.  I still feel that it is of very little value.  Had the author been white and not helped along by Ophra, this work would be largely unnoticed.  It's just another story about how someone had a rough life... with nothing to differentiate it from all of the other books like it.  The reason I have rated it so low is because it seemed to be an agenda setting work.  Maya Angelou is black and has used this book to help push her liberal agenda.  Again - if Maya Angelou was white and was not well liked by Ophra, the book would have flopped.  I would not recommend this at all... especially if you are a conservative.
