I have two beautiful children and a hard working husband. I live in Paradise. Where every day is a vacation.So what if my kids are a little differnt from everybody else????? ADD ODD ADHD,FAS FAE,it is all a crock.I drank and smoked the whole time I was pregnant with both my kids, and used the whole time I was pergnant with my first kid.   How a child acts has nothing to do with what I did or didn't do!!!! Kids will be kids, and a good parent knows their own childs limitations. This book is a total waste of time and I don't know why my family wanted me to read it. I didn't get past page two. This book is only for complete losers!!!!! So what if the facts line up and my kids really do have FAS like my husband says, they'll never prove it.
