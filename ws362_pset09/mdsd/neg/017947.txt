This book is beautifully illustrated variant of Martin Niemöller's classic poem.  It does a fine job of that.  Middle school, high school and adult readers should have no problems reading the story, getting the message and understanding it.  The problem arises in that the book seems to be geared towards younger children, simplifying a horrible situation into a context that they might find easier to understand while giving the message that they should stand up for people.  This is done in a some what simplistic fashion, using a metaphor that does not necessarily ring true or relatable to young children in terms of connecting it to the suffering of the holocaust.  There are books like Keeping the Promise: A Torah's Journey which convey the horrors but in a much more effective, less traumatic way
