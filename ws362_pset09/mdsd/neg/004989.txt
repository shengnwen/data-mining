So, Butch gets his own book.  The question is why?  This secondary character introduced in Dark Lover has appeared throughout this series  as a weak, pathetic drunk.  The meaning of V's vision and his destiny with the brotherhood is revealed here, but surely this could have been incorporated into one of the other brother's book.  I feel the author goes too far to justify or validate his story with the predictable storyline regarding Wrath's lineage.  Not to mention the uncomfortable relationship between V and Butch with Marissa caught somewhere in the middle.  I was unprepared by how bad this book really is.  Butch's story ends my interest in this series, but I must say I really wish this author success with her future books, because the first three books of this series were awesome
