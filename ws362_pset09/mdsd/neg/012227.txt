If I were in Hoboken, having a Chicken Emergency, I wouldn't panic. It is hard to feel empathy for Arthur, the main character in this engaging but factually inaccurate Thanksgiving tale by Daniel Pinkwater, as he bumbles his way from one disaster to another. The premise that not a single shopkeeper in the whole of Hoboken has a turkey in their freezer is, at best, far-fetched. At worst, it is factually inaccurate and a damning incitement on Pinkwater's research whilst writing this book. This reviewer knows for a fact that Sandra D's Mini Mart, 453 5th St, had a freezer full of plump gobblers last Thanksgiving, and had Arthur visited King's Super market, 1212 Hudson St, he'd have found cranberry sauce as well. I'm all for warming, cheery tales of triumph over tragedy, but when they're this sloppy with the detail, they're hard to swallow. My nephew's first comment when he read this book was "I done a guff", and, quite frankly, I think that says it all. Disappointing
