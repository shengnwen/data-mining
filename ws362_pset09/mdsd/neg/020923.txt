I listen to this CD several times a year.  I gave the book away long ago, but I think I should buy one once a month and give it to someone who needs it.  Lots of people understand this book because they understand the most effective tool left unused is worthless.  Insights, many simple, put into practice will change your life.  This is the gift of these thoughts. DO ONE or TWO and see if you are not changed.  Four circles is my favorite; its easy and always puts a focus on the lifetime that exists within my day.
