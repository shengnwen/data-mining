I really disliked this book. If it wasn't for Sam & Alyssa's story, the one "true saving grace" of this tired-awful book, I would have given it 1 star.
 
 The plot: Meg's ten year old daughter and grandmother are kidnapped by terrorists. They threaten to kill Meg's daughter and grandmother if she doesn't comply with their wishes. They want her to kill or bring them one of their extremist opposers. She kidnaps this guy and decides to turn him in to the terrorists or kill him herself.
 
 Completely unbelievable. This small, slight woman is able to drug and drag around a grown man? NOT!!  Plus, Meg doesn't care who she kills or hurts to get her daughter back. It was terrible. It gave her some rather unlikable character traits. I found myself not caring what happened to Meg, her grandmother or her daughter. She is completely unpatriotic. I could not figure out what John found so attractive about her. He's a Navy Seal. This is a man who puts his life on the line for his country. Would he really want to be with a woman who is completely nuts? I don't think so.
 
 Plus the World War II story was a drag. Why bother? It was a waste of time and paper. Both Ms. Brockmann's and myself.
 
 I find myself wondering what the hype is about Suzanne Brockmann. I have read four of the Seal Team 16 books, or rather tortured myself to read them. I later realize it is because I am trying to find out more about Sam & Alyssa's history. I first learned about them in "Wildcart Karmody's" story and have been reading the books in reverse sequential order to discover more about them. I have ordered Sam & Alyssa's story and truly believe that this will be my last Suzanne Brockmann book. Her love scenes are drab, her plots disjointed and with three to four storylines running consecutively, usually just plain confusing.
 
 Suzanne, I'm truly disappointed
