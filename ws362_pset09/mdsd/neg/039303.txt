Uh, did we all read the same book? Cause I got an entirely different impression. First of all, Ellen, the 14-year-old sounds like a 34 year old trapped in a 14-year-old's body. She and her whole family are unbearably pretentious. The mother is very comfortable with her son being gay, which is not realistic. One of the boys knows he's gay but then turns straight just like that. The author sets up the relationship with the two boys, then sets up one with the girl and a boy and then lets the whole thing drop at the end. The sex scene seemed like it was tagged on as an afterthought. I just felt very led on by this book, then very disapointed and I never emotionally connected to any of the characters.
