The title of this book and the cover are incredibly inviting. We checked it out at the library because my 3-year-old loves the piano. We both found the content and the illustrations, well, boring. That Mozart's dad was a tyrant about the piano is not something I even want to share with my daughter at this point. I want to draw her into music, not give examples of abusive parenting related to music. It's a strange angle for a kid's book. Much of Mozart's music is very child-like and approachable. Too bad the qualities of the music didn't get more 'play' than the production of it
