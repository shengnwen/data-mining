The book delves very little into art, aside from introducing "Roy G Biv" (the color spectrum, red-orange-yellow...violet).

Worse, I was offended by its outright snobbery toward poor/homeless people and its condescencion toward handicapped people.  Its elitism on several other fronts was also questionable morality to put in front of young, impressionable minds.

The use of silly names would have been appropriate in a short humorous story or 7~8yo kids' book; in this longer young-adults' book it wore on one's nerves
