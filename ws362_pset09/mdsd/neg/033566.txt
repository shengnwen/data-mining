Downing is an excellent writer making postmodern philosophy very accessible.  Another plus is she has interacted with the primary sources.  Too many evangelicals just read critiques by other evangelicals.  Downing has spent some time with postmodern writers.  Much of the book was helpful.  She shows that postmodernisms exposing of the flaws of modernism has served our faith.  This is very true in many ways, but Downing goes too far the other way.  She leans toward inclusivism, which is a very tempting thing to do in today's postmodern culture in order to not offend, and remain respectable.  The problem is the biblical worldview will not allow it.  Christians must build their worldview from Scripture, as unpopluar as this may be.  You just can't mix worldviews and remain faithful to both.  I would reccomend Veith's 'Postmodern Times' then this one
