I am very disappointed with the recipes in this book.  I love to cook, love to try new recipes, and bought this book on the strength of others' reviews.  I've tried 6 recipes straight out of the book with no adaptation.  2 of them were OK, but had little flavor.  The other 4 were barely edible, with strange flavors.  Another reviewer said this book is a good spring-board for crockery cooking.  I would definately say that you need to be experienced enough with the crock pot, and spice usage in general, to adapt these recipes to taste, in order to enjoy recipes from this book
