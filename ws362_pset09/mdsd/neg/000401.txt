Spring says, "I don't make blanket judgments about whether affairs are, in themselves, good or bad."

In many ways, our culture condones and even glorifies affairs. The author's statement implies that like the weather or flavors of ice cream, affairs can be viewed differently. If your author's husband had an affair and she contracted a STD such as HIV/AIDS, would she still be unwilling to say that affairs are bad or wrong? Affairs are wrong and bad just as spousal battery is. Imagine someone saying in a book on spousal abuse/battering saying "I don't make blanket judgments about whether beating your spouse is good or bad." Beating your spouse or having an affair are bad and wrong. People who have such desires and feel the need to act upon them should instead put their energies into immediately contacting a competent marriage counselor or divorce lawyer.

Spring says "I don't separate the two of you into victim and victimizer, betrayed and betrayer. Each of you must accept an appropriate share of responsibility for what went wrong. Rather than assign blame, I encourage each of you to confront those parts of yourself that led to the affair..."

While I have not wanted to play the role of victim at various times in my life, the fact of the matter is that I have been the victim of an affair. The second part of the above statement is even more troubling. Can you imagine saying to the victim of spousal battering, "Each of you must accept an appropriate share of responsibility for what went wrong. Rather than assign blame, I encourage each of you to confront those parts of yourself that led to the battering/abuse..." Sorry Dr. Spring, but you're no expert on affairs. Victims of affairs, just as victims of spousal battering, are not responsible for the wrong choices and decisions their partners made.

Spring seems to be more concerned with offering coddling statements and reassurances to adulterers.
