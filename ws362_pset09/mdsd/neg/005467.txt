If these stories were by some unknown writer, they would have been boring and dull.  But from Jennifer Weiner, they are a real disappointment.  I can't imagine this book would have been published but for the fact that it was an automatic "sell" to Weiner fans.  

I have to agree with an earlier reviewer - note to Jennifer:  Enough with the overweight underdog from a divorced family - try some new material!  You are a fantastic writer - get creative
