Check out my review of "What is Lightbody"- because this book is almost a mirror image of that book- just lacking the descriptions of the different levels.

Again, between these two books, the premise is that the entire planet is moving to light... which conflicts with most current Lightworker beliefs.  Both also say to consider their books "just another opinion"... I would think channeled information from an angel would be more 'concrete' in what it says.

I also disagreed with what this author said about "love"- how cheating on your partner isn't a bad thing- and that instead of being upset, you should simply ask "was it good?"  This way of thinking is NOT a healthy expression of love or behavior.  If you are in a committed relationship- then you should honor that committment- or else don't even get into something committed.  

But that's the problem I had with this book and the "Lightbody" book.  Both say that 'everyone is going to ascend' so therefore, who cares about other people, just enjoy your life and work on yourself.  I tend to believe that, according to prophecy, those who are spiritual and ascend will go the way of the new earth, and those who fail to acknowledge the signs and stick to their old ways, will stay in the 'old earth' dimension.

Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense why some people are going through the ascension process, like I am in a very intense way... and others are not, and are unaware of what is happening.

I have read much better information by doing online searches, then anything provided between these two books.  

Just be advised that this book offers much different views of ascension, than most other Lightworkers.
