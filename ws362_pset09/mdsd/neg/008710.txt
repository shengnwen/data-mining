As a longtime visitor to Something Awful I have grown to enjoy Parson's   writing immensely. When purchasing this book I expected to read a light, humorous account of WWII inventions gone wrong. In reality, the book is a ponderous recitation of those inventions replete with plenty of mind-numbing technical details and absent of anything remotely resembling humor. Hopefully SA/Parson's next literary venture will help us forget this stinker.
