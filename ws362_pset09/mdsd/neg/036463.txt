Dawkins defiles science, dragging it down to the level of fundamentalist religion.  The situation is quite simple: evolution says precisely nothing about whether god exists.  There can be evolution and no god, or there can be evolution and a god.  Clearly, Dawkins has some emotional need for there to be no god.  Any truely rational person sees that evolution does indeed exist, but they also understand that it does not fully explain the origins of life, and it especially does not say a thing about reality on the level of "god", the level that encompasses the weird intangible stuff like the very nature of existence.  Argue for evolution based on science and reason, go ahead.  But conflating evolution with atheism just drags science down to the level of politics, punditry, talk-radio BS, it turns science into bad religion
