It is a story about a Mafia family named the Clericuzio, in transition from illegitimate to legitimate riches. In the transition, of course, the members of the family have their share of missteps and miscalculations. Some of these miscalculations are human - the love of a woman, blood lust, greed - while other miscalculations are the inevitable product of sin and deception.

Overall, it sucks. The first 25% of the novel is practically text porn, which can be skipped without losing any of the plot. The middle 50% is set-up, but it gives a bad name to "rising action" because of the pointless maneuvers and character development that takes place. The last 25% is pretty good, where the plot advances, twists, turns, etc. I give it 2/5. Don't waste your time if you have anything to read other than Fabio-pulp novels. Because of the low rating, it's not worth reviewing any further. Save this one for those cold winter nights when you run out of kindling
