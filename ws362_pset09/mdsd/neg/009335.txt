I don't know if Wigmore's book has merit because I will probably never buy it.  Of the eleven glowing reviews, two were written by awi 12, and four (4) by a Dr.(self styled?)Craig.  This makes suspect all eleven.  Amazon has fallen down on the job by not monitoring the reviews, and leaves me in the position of a doubting Thomas with all future reviews.  Ironically, the one person hurt by Craig and others is the author
