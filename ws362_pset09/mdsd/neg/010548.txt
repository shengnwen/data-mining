I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.
