The book is easy to read and moderately informative but useless as a textbook for a course in critical thinking. About a third of it is just incomprehensible because of the "folksy" writing style. Ex: Ch 4 opens, "Reasoning is often taken to be the hallmark of the human species. Colloquially, reasoning tells us 'what follows what.'" That's the best definition of reasoning you're going to get in that chapter! Errors of reasoning are rampant throughout the book. The first chapter opens with a barrage of statistics to show that CT is not adequately taught.Ex: You will live into your '70's so what do you need to know to be prosperous (as if all knowledge for the entire future needs to be acquired today.) The book is riddled with wrong definitions and erroneous information. The chapter on hypothesis testing is especially egregious in that regard. There are few references later than 1991 (in the 3d edition). Finally, the chapters do not speak to each other: There are completely unrelated chapters on memory, logic, and probability theory, for example. The book might be useful in a course on rhetoric or communications, but critical thinking it is not. The chapter on analysis of arguments is the one good one, but it doesn't redeem this... paperback
