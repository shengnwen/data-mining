If you want to really find out what Rick Warren believes, read the Statement of Faith made by Saddleback Church. No hidden agendas, and you'll find it is based on sound doctrine. Also if you want to get the other side of the controversy this book participates in creating, read "Rick Warren And The Purpose That Drives Him" ISBN: 0736917381. It is interesting to me how harsh Sundquist is (as well as other anti-Warren authors) in contrast to Abanes more conciliatory approach to Warren's critics.

It appears to me that Sundquist is using fear and intimidation as his method of spreading the Gospel. My initial reaction was to get angry over the false accusations about a spiritual leader that God is obviously blessing. However, I can see now that it isn't necessary to get into debates or fights over man made rules. God will be the final judge.

Is this an example of the fundamentalist approach to evangelism? I don't know, but I'd double check the facts claimed in this book. I found the fundamental assumptions of Sundquist's position were based on false information, and then extrapolated into something that doesn't resemble anything close to the truth.
