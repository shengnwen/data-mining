I made it about two-thirds of the way through before putting the book down. Not that the writing is vomitous; it isn't. But this book should have been marketed for young people, not adult readers. It's very basic and generic--at every turn I was thinking: "Jeez, each of these sentences would require you to read an entire book to get the background!" Now that's not a bad thing in a young person's book, as it could inspire the reader to check into the history further. But for an adult who already likes history and has read a fair amount of it, this is like a comic book version.

Another thing that bugged me was Cantor's relentlessly positive view of Gaunt and his times. OK, maybe Gaunt was a great guy, and maybe the Middle Ages weren't the pool of muck I've always thought they were, but knock off the Norman Vincent Peale act and give us a little more balance! (Which would equate to more interest, incidentally.)

Adults interested in knowing more about the 14th century would do much better with Barbara Tuchman's *A Distant Mirror* or Johan Huizinga's *The Waning of the Middle Ages* (which Cantor pooh-poohs, but is a much better read than Cantor's book!)
