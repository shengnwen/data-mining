I believed that I buyed a book of history, but it isn't. From almost the first page the book is full of personal opinions and few history.
 The opinions of Anna Reid are simple, the ucranians are very good and the russians very bad,three undred and fifty years together is nothing for her, and in many parts of Ucrania the russian are new occupants - from mid XIX century (sic )- !¡. I thing that California, Texas, etc,  belongs to Mexico in the opinion of Mrs Anna Reid too, they were conquered in 1848. I know a lot of history of Russia and Ucrania, but for someone don't, the book is dangerous and worst it's not true.
 When I read her, that seems to me very similar to the arguments of terrorist vasques in Spain and other minorities in Europe. I hope that Mrs Anna Reid fight for the independence of Scotland with the same strenght she do for Ucrania independence.
 I'm sure that Ucrania and Russia will be togheter again in the future, but books like Borderland, cause more pain that it seem at first sight.
  If you look for diferences you will find everywhere, but one country is a country because there are more thing that keep united to the people that diferences.
  Definitively a bad book of history.
  Yours faithfully.
