I was bored stiff reading this novel.  I think J. Oke needs to slow down and take some time to think between writing each book. I thought it was very unrealistic how quickly the two young ladies became friends considering they didn't speak the same language.  This action was sooooooooooooooooo slow.  I prefer Oke's more exciting books like the Canadian West series, A Woman Named Damaris, and A Gown of Spanish Lace. They aren't overly sappy and their characters do more than just hug and cry.
