I found this a rather disappointing tome, given its weight.  In many cases it merely lists the obvious at great length.  The index is poor, and the organisation is confusing.  I found the lack of tips and absence of special insights frustrating as these have been good a feature of previous reference works like Windows 95 Secrets by Livingston &amp; Straub .  I wonder at whom this bland work is really targeted.  Best to look elsewhere for a main XP reference.  I regretted my purchase
