I bought and read this book for a class and found it very difficult to take much away from. The accounts are potentially very enlightening, but the author's writing style obfuscates their values. Her interjection of her own personal stories into the work was sloppy and often left me unsure of who I was reading about. While I don't know of any other book which tells these stories, there are many other books that contain similar accounts which are far more effective
