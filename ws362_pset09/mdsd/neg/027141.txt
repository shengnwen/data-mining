I really wanted to read a good book about Tina Modotti, but Albers writing style is so dull, and so flat, I barely made it through chapters. She goes into tedious detail, and I have not gotten any feel at all for Tina. Fortunately, I took the book out of the library, and will return it tomorrow. Perhaps I will try another author, but this is really a great disappointment
