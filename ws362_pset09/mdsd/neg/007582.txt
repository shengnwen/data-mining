I bought the book based on many of the reviews.  I wish now that I hadn't.  Although I did find a few ideas in the book about taking risks interesting, hence two stars instead of one, overall it was pretty bad.  At one point I almost stopped reading, but felt compelled to finsih in the hopes that it got better.

A lot of the ideas presented are laughable.  For example, ignore the advice of experts (which the author presumably qualifies as) or do the opposite.  So basically, you should do nothing the author himself suggests.  

I did find the authors advice on keeping fit and healthy interesting, but at the same time takes it too far into the land of junk science.  I wholly expected him to begin touting about homeopathic medicine and aromatherapy.

A waste of money.
