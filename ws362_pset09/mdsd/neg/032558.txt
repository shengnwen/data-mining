I find it interesting that in the pages I scanned through that I couldn't find a single fact. All I found was the fallacy of "Argumentum ad Hominum" (Argument against the Man i.e. "He's a schmuck therefore anything he says or does isn't valid") Now, granted, I didn't (couldn't) read the whole book so I don't know if she got into any actual facts that could be looked up and verified but just the fact that what I did read was so obviously skewed by emotion doesn't lend any credence with me of the facts. I am NOT a Republican but I do like my information to be clear, concise and to have the ability to be verified. I do not appreciate "scare" tactics or emotional string pulling. Let me decide what my emotions should be by giving me the FACTS
