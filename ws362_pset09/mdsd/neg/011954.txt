This ain't the best of the complete class books. I found most of the kits not very useful, and the description of the specialists was nothing more but repeating the Player's handbook - let's not mention the &quot;special abilities&quot; for specialist mages (I'm talking about a +1 save vs alteration magic at level 17 here!). If you want some more spells, especially some necormancy, then get this book, it has some really cool spells in it. But that's about all
