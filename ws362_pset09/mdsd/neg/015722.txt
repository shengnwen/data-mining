Junie B. Jones: Kindergartener. She's worrying about having a boyfriend and living &quot;happily ever after&quot; in her strange Junie-like world. First of all, her grammar is horrible and is fighting over this poor little 5-year-old boy named Warren, who just wants to be left alone. Even Lucille and Grace liked him, and Junie B liked him because he was on a T.V. commercial. I'm 9 now, and I think Junie B has lost her mind of wanting a boyfriend. Then, she begs her mom to go to the mall so she can buy princess clothes to make Warren notice him. She made comments like: &quot;And he was beauty to our eyes...&quot; &quot;What a chunk.&quot; and &quot;...I think I'd like him as my new boyfriend.&quot; She said she needed to &quot;move on in her life&quot;, which I thought was silly. OK, so she learned you shouldn't make friends by buying fancy stuff to make him or her like you, but Junie B needs to quit thinking about boys and more about her English
