I don't know how many books I have seen that claim
to "teach" the Chinese or Japanese writing system
by presenting a list of characters with their
meanings and nice diagrams showing
pictures and strokes. Then there are some books that
advertise that they will also explain the
"etymology" of the character.  That is equally
worthless.  Such books sell well but mislead
the learner who then must buy another book
and then another until they find the right
book.   Well, let me shorten the process for
you - the RIGHT book is "Rerembering the Kanji, volume l"
by James P. Heisig.   In this book, your are not
only given a list of traditional Chinese
characters, you also get a method of learning
how to recognize them and draw them
and how to rerember the thousands
of the little thingies that there are.
This was the last book I ever needed
(apart from dictionaries and readers,
obviously) to "learn" the writing
system in my Asian language studies.
Heisig's book requires some learning
and memorizing but he shows you how
to do it via a mnemonic
method - it can take as little
as 2 or 3 months or as long as
a year depending on how much time
you wish to invest each day.
You will end up learning
approximately 1,960
Asian Chinese characters,
used by both the Chinese
and the Japanese and then later,
once you have learned these
characters, you can specialize
your study to traditional Chinese
(still used in Hong Kong,
Taiwan, and other places),
modern Chinese (the simplified
characters) or Japanese(which
uses the traditional Chinese
characters).  You do not learn
speaking from this method,
that comes later.  You learn
only how to recall the characters
and their most common meaning
and how to draw them.  Later
on, once you can draw
and recognize the character
for "big", you can then
learn that it is pronounced
"da'" if you are learning
Chinese, or "dai" or "tai"
if you are learning Japanese
