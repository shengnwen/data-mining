I used this book to shop for furniture in the High Point area.  It was useful in locating stores and in knowing what product lines each store offered.  There are two main problems I have; (1) I think the savings are overstated - it is probably more in the area of 20 percent off, and (2) I think the author was uninformed or else very soft on rating the customer service side of things.  The salespeople treat you like family (as stated in this book) when they are trying to make the sale, but for me, that was where the good customer service ended.  I bought almost all of my furniture at Rose Furniture.  They were very helpful and responsive until after some items arrived damaged.  That is where all the competence and responsiveness ended.  If you read Ms. Shapiro's review of Rose Furniture, she only talks about how wonderful the sales people are - she offers no information about treatment after the sale.  I think this is a huge oversight.  What you want in a furniture retailer is good service - this is all they do.  They don't build furniture, they service the customer.  I waited 5 months for my order to be delivered - Rose estimates an 8 to 10 week delivery timeframe.  Rose Furniture would consistently tell me something that just wasn't true.  After waiting 5 months for my items, one of the items would not even function properly and was covered with some dark, gummy substance - all over the finish.  I refused delivery and I'm seeking a refund.  Rose Furniture has a condescending way of dealing with people that is very aggravating.  They have a pleasant exterior appearance while all the time they could care less
