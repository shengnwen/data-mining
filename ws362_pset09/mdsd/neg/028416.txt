The premise of this book is good, but it fails miserably in its execution. There is little to no really useful information here. You could probably compile something close to this book simply by culling facts, quotes and descriptions from college web sites. An actual college student's perspective would have been more useful than Asher's. If you purchase this, you will absolutely be taken aback by the sheer volume of useless filler. Everything useful in this book could probably be reduced to 15 or 20 pages. Just take a look at the book's overspaced layout and you'll get the idea that even the author knows its failings. I urge you not to buy this
