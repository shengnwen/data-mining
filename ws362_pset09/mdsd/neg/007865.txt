This was an extremely frustrating book to read.  There were many gaps in the word lists.  The two letter word list only contained 85 of the 96 acceptable two letter words.  It was missing ag, ex, hm, mm, mo, mu, ne,  uh, um, wo, and xu.  All of those words are contained in The Official  Scrabble Players Dictionary (1995) but not contained in this 1998 book  based on that dictionary.  The Three Letter Words from Two Letter Words  also had many gaps.  The very first two letter word (AA - cindery lava)only  listed BAA, and totally missed AAH, AAL, and AAS.  This is just one of  many, many, omissions through out the book.  The only benefit I found in  having the book was in finding some words which contain a particular letter  in the middle of the end of the word.  But even these lists were  incomplete.  This book is not worth the investment
