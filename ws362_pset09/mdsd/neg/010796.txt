I love to read about Hollywood, and I know I would enjoy this book if the "Eff-word" wasn't used so much. It proves to me that to get anywhere in Hollywood you have be very low-class and profane. Any really  educated person would have a stronger command of the language. The eff-word is a stupid substitution for any word at all, and I just can't get interested in the book because of it. If you don't mind eff this and eff that you might enjoy the book. Too bad. It could have been a good read
