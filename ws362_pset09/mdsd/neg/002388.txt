I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.

I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.

There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board
