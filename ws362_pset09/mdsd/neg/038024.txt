Many years ago I enjoyed reading Ivins' columns but unforunately her brand of independent liberalism has turned into just another mainstream media voice parroting the Democrats. Her personal hatred of George Bush has become distracting and embarrasing. Strangely enough she reminds me of Rush Limbaugh. When he began doing political commentary on the radio Limbaugh was an independent with a conservative streak and was comfortable attacking Republicans. Similarly Ivins was originally an independent with a liberal streak who was comfortable attacking Democrats. Now Limbaugh is as firmly ensconced in the Republican camp as Ivins is in the Democratic camp.

What a shame
