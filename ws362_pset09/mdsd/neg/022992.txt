As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one.  However, I  had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed  as to how much I didn't love it.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it;  maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.  If you have yet to read Anne  Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book.  I suggest reading Celestial  Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's  mastery
