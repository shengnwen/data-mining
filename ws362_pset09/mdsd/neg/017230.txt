I find it to be an irony that the author high handedly cautions children not to lie like former President Bill Clinton did then goes on to lie to them that he was impeached. President Clinton was NOT impeached. To try and manipulate young minds based on her own political leanings no matter what they are is unconscionable and pathetic. She should teach history but leave the parents to do the rest as she is obviously very unqualified. I can only hope that the author doesn't have offspring of her own. I am personally making sure this offensive book is brought to the attention of every teacher at my child's school and my local public library to request that it by removed from the shelves. I suggest reprinting with the truth this time - something we should all espouse - perhaps Ms. St. George could look to the page on Lincoln to get a clue
