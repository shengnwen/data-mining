I've read several of Rita Mae Brown's Mrs. Murphy series, and enjoyed them, though I've always found her writing style a little annoying. 

"I'll sniff around." (says Harry)
"You've got a good nose." Bo's light eyes complemented his handsome features. 

What in the heck do his eyes have to do with what he's saying? The book is full of such writing. 

Anyway, this particular style has always been a little off-putting, but I've endured it because I like the characters in this series, especially the animals. 

This entry, Sour Puss, however, was almost unreadable. I very rarely stop reading a book once I've started it, but I came very close with this one. I felt as if I were attending a bio-terrorism/grape-growing lecture. Boring! I didn't feel any interest at all in what happened until about the last fourth of the book. I get the distinct feeling that Brown is bored with her series and her characters. Maybe it's time to give them a rest. 

I may or may not try another Mrs. Murphy book...I'm just glad I checked this one out of the library rather than purchasing it.
