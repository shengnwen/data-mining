As an open-minded aid worker, I was interested to read about our faults (and there are many, nobody's perfect).
But G.Hancock fails miserably to deliver. I have the same reaction with Michael Moore: I agree with his ideas, want to enajoyhis books, and then am extremley disappointed. A long litany of facts mostly correct, sometimnes distorted to fit the picture, and nothing else. No analysis of reasons why, no consideration of what the other side may have to say, no shades of gray, everything is black. Morevoer there does not seem to be any alternatives. Even conservatives can do better than that.

One example of superficial analysis (page 171):
1- a highway was (poorly) built in Somalia and started failing almost immediately. OK this happens too often
2- Somalia will still be repaying the loan ($100M) after 40 years. 
NO: first of all with a soft loan they would pay at most a third of it, second even if the road is failing, the road built may be still worth more than that...
And second of all Somalia's debt was cancelled in the meantime...SO they will not pay anything...

I am not saying building a poor highway is OK, I am saying the the author criticizes in a simplistic manner. His ranting is really useless. I guess it is for non-aid workers, who will conclude that aid is to be stopped completely.

WHAT DOES THE AUTHOR PRPOSE TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF AID ?
Nothing said about that.

NB. One failing among others: why there is no mention of international journalists (such as the author). They also live (fatly) from poverty...
