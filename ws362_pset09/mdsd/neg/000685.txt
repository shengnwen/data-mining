Winter in the Blood was a book I thought would be easier to understand than it was.  Most of the chapters jump from one part of the main character's life to another.  This makes the book semi-difficult to follow.   In addition, throughout the entire book, the main character, who is the  only narrator, is never given a name.  The book starts out being slow and  the point of the story is not understood until the end.  However, the end  was done very nicely and portrays that the story is about a young man that  finds himself and overcomes his guilt and sorrow that he has felt for years  due to losing the two people he cares about most- his brother and father.   Winter in the Blood also demonstrates the difficulties of life that a  Native American must face and how a person of this background can learn not  only to accept, but also to be proud of this heritage
