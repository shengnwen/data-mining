I too am horrified that this author is capitalizing on her first-hand expereince as a murderer.  Would you want to support Charles Manson or other murderers by buying their books? Buying a book written by a murderer is condoning their activities and agreeing they should profit from their crime.  I can't support that.  This woman manipulated her friend into helping her murder her friend's murder and then used her own wealthy family's lawyers to get a light sentence while her friend wasted away in prison
