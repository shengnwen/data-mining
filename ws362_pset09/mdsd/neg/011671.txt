See what happens when the author's friends write the reviews? After all the glowing raves given "Postwar," I spent fancy money on it, and in the end, I came to agree with the only negative review of it I saw, in The Economist. You are misled by the acuity of the first chapter, in which Judt explains how much the current peace of Europe derives from the severe ethnic cleansing that took place there during and just after World War II--a fascinating point quite new to me. But after that, over 830 pages, Judt tries to explain everything and gets to the bottom of nothing. What did Margaret Thatcher really accomplish for England? I still don't know, though I learned a lot on my way to not knowing. This was the failing cited by The Economist reviewer, too. If you want a history of the war's aftermath in Europe (though only up to the mid-fifties) try "1945" by Gregor Dallas: distilled, acute, clear, concrete, fresh, and compelling. Maybe Dallas needs to hustle academic insiders as well as Judt does, for unlike Judt, Dallas actually delivers the goods and deserves the credit wasted on Judt.
