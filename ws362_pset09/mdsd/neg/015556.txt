I thouht I'd like this book, what with all the good reviews and my love of English mysteries. But I found it stilted and boring. The concept was good: an investigation sixty-some years after her great-aunt died into whether or not she actually killed her husband, a charge for which she was acquitted. There were letters, interviews, even a diary/journal for clues. But the answer was so obvious and the writing so stilted, I found myself skipping through the pages just to confirm that that my first instincts as to who-dunnit were accurate. (They were.) There's no doubt the author, the wife of the British Ambassador to the United States, is a talented, intelligent woman. But the story was too drawn out, and the writing was pretentious, at least for me.
