This is the worst book ever written. im serious. It does not make sense, it is really boring. Nothing happens, there is so much unneccesary writting. The author could have written the same information on just 100 pages. Do not buy this book. you will regret it . I repeat, you will regret it. Do not waste your money this book. Please look at other books instead. The author has written the book in a really stupid way. like right at the beggining, the protagonist recieves a grave letter from johhannesburg. Then his wike asks him what they should do about it. Then the protagonist responds DO ABOUT WHAT? then his wife says the letter of course.
When I read this, I thought, Damn this book sucks!
DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!
