This book is the sole textbook for the two-term intro ee course EE20 at Caltech.  Having gone through every page of this thing quite thoroughly, I can say that it is ok at what it attempts to do.  It has decent instructions on how to build and test a NorCal 40A radio.  Having a well-stocked lab and lots of test equipment helps you get what you should out of the book, and I'd say it's almost essential to actually build the radio to get everything you can out of this book.  Beyond the build, this book, and its course, are a sort of intro to circuit analysis, although in this aspect I find it lacking, with brief descriptions of techniques and circuits that either are not clear or leave too much out of the discussion.  For more basic/general E&M a book such as Physics for Scientists and Engineers by Serway and Jewett would be far more useful, and for more advanced circuit analysis techniques, something along the lines of Microelectronic Circuits by Sedra and Smith is a good choice.  This book would be good for those interested in the inner workings of a radio and some bits and pieces of RF stuff, however I must emphasize that the building of the radio (which would be fairly expensive) and testing of it are where the real value of this book lie.  I must also emphasize that the resulting radio is pretty fiddly and not a practical piece of kit.  However, if you buy this book and don't build the radio or do the exercises, then you probably bought the wrong book
