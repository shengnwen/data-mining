I must agree with the review that appeared this week in the TLS (Times Literary Supplement, London, 27.01.00), which managed to describe the book without talking about the social character of knowledge - except to say  that Goldman has a 'dirigiste' view of how knowledge should be controlled  and communicated in society. His own euphemism is 'epistemic paternalism',  and readers might want to judge for themselves what it all means, once the  dogmatic philosophising and gratuitous formalising is removed. This reader  found the implications rather scarey, though luckily this philosophical  stuff rarely gets beyond the seminar room. A definite step from back (and  away) from Fuller's work on social epistemology - and even more  conservative types like Kitcher and Longino
