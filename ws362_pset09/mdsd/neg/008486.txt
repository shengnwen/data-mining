Sleeping editors... Selected, manipulated datas... Do not believe? Select a topic from the book and explore it in pubmed. Could you find the most realistic studies, or studies with the largest "n"?... No... Why? Because senior judges (editors) prefer(!) to underestimates most of them, and prefer to presentate many marginal studies of many peoples(!). If you prefer to scan the literature objectively (without racist filtration) you can't do it with CMDT. Don't believe... Go on... Editors need you...
