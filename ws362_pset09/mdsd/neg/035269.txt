I gave the book 2-stars as I like very much the information contained, however, find that it difficult to put into practice. It seems that Ms. Kingston only recommends space clearing tool (bells, harmony balls, etc.) that comes from Bali because they are produced by the purest of priests and therefore produce the purest of sound. The bells, in particular, that Ms. Kingston recommends are not available to the general public and therefore she makes them available through her own website which is very convenient. Convenient, that it, until you learn that the most inexpensive bell listed on the site is $160, and even then comes with a note from Ms. Kingston that it will not produce the same results as the $250 dollar model.

I do find it odd that Ms. Kingston provides that much of space clearing is about the intention of the practitioner, but then contradicts herself with the viewpoint that only the best results can come from her one-of-a-kind tools

So, although I hate to be a spiritual skeptic, I find this book a bit of a spiritual tease. "Here is a great way to bring peace and love and wonder to your life ... and that will be $250 please". Because of the contradiction noted above, the book only warrants a 2 in my view.
