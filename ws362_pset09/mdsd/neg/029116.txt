This book focuses way too much on disputing irrational self-defeating thoughts such as putting yourself down for not being able to stop drinking. The books answers your self-defeating thinking with such retorts as "prove it" over and over again. This book is also very ambiguous with confusing statements like this one all throughout the book.

QUOTE FROM BOOK...
" If you only believe you don't want to be deprived of alcohol, would you then believe that life without it is awful? Usually not. If you believe, however, that you must not be deprived, you can easily think that abstinence is awful. If you only don't want discomfort, would you then believe that you can't stand it? Probably not. You may, however, think that you can't stand it when you believe that you must not have discomfort."

huh......?????? what?????

That's how this whole book is written. Also, there's too much emphasis put on how great a feeling alcohol is. That's dangerous thinking for someone looking to get away from it. For someone who has been drinking for many years, the feeling is not that great anymore. This book put ideas in my head that really weren't there before. It focuses way too much on assuming you put yourself down constantly for not being able to quit drinking. I never really thought like that. There are better books out there. This one just didn't work for me
