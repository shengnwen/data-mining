He could very well be Jack and not Mark because he repeats the phrase "Jump In" ad nauseam. I was reminded of the Rolling Stones song "Jumping Jack Flash" which is a classic but I digress.

It is a story of rags-to-riches told in somewhat candid manner. However, the author doesn't give a glimpse of his past and his psychology other than urging the reader to Jump In (there you go again). His life as a commando as well as his past in England are not told so the story lacks the foundation and thus robs the reader the opportunity to truly discover how Mark's brilliant mind functions.

The book is peppered with motivational phrases and if you want to get 'pumped up' (this could be the title of Mark's sequel) then just read the sidebars of the book. It is a forgettable book, overall.
