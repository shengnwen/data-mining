For me this book was useful only in that it pointed out to me that there is such a thing as trailer sailing. All well and good.  However I rapidly(less than a week) out grew the book's very narrow scope, and now  have no use for it.  Would even hesitate to give to a friend because all  the boats he recommends are pretty heavy, hence require a reasonably  powerful vehicle to tow.  No where does he even acknowledge that there is a  relationship between displacement and tow vehicle size.  Most of us can't  go buy a dedicated towing machine
