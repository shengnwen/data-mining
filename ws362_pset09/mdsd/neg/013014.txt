I really enjoyed the first book in this series, but feel like this second book goes far, far astray. The first book sets up a wonderful world in which dragons fight in the air during the naval battles of the Napolionic (sp?) war. This book throws it all away to get onto a literal slow boat to China. I bought the third book at the same time, I hope the series picks back up
