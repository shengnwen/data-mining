The people who have reviewed this book with 5 stars are simply  ignorant or they are pro-Nazi sympathizers. By their logic, the US of A was on the wrong side during WW II. We should've helped the freedom-loving Hitler beat the freedom-hating Stalin.

This book contains nothing but distortions, misinformation, and circumstatial evidence which doesn't "demonstrate" or "prove" anything, except that the author hates communists.
 
In one of the most ironic things I've ever seen posted on the internet, one reviewer - Darren Boggs who's serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom - mentioned that Hoffman's book debunks the "myth of German aggression". He sees the book as a rationale for "pre-emptive war". 
Thus an American soldier, who's actually taking part in a "pre-emptive war" reads a pro-nazi history book and comes to the conclusion that Hitler and George W Bush were both right.

Is this book on US Army reading lists or something? Did the Pentagon send copies out to the troops so they could feel a bit better about their pre emptive war?
Good. God.
By the way, I strongly reccomend you read something more accurate by David Glantz or Volkogonov, the recent crop of books on 1941
