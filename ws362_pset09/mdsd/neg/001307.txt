All of these books on so-called Bible codes that all just happen to "predict" events after they happen, or just "happen" to find words that support the fallacies of the bumper crop of megaselling would-be Bible interpreters, are laughable.

There is a code in the prophecies of the Bible, and the prophecies do have an ultimate aim and an ulitimate conclusion, but the code has nothing to do with nuclear bombs or international conspiracies.

The real code in the prophets is about the One truth, the Two decisions, the Three in balance, the Four traits, the Five disciplines, and the Seven plus One Spirits, and ever part of the code relates back to the teachings of Jesus Christ.

To read a book about the real Bible Code, try my book, "The Character Map: An Introduction to the Introductions in Revelation." This is the one about living and preserving your life.
