This is a basic book of general common sense regarding business cards that any college kid would even know.

Any ideas presented here can be obtained just by picking up business cards, looking at them, and thinking "Yes, a black background on a business card is not a good idea". Duh!

I STRONGLY suspect that all these 5 star reviews came from the PR department and publisher's / writer's contacts. Save yourself the money and the time and look for something else
