I purchased this book specifically to make the quilt, 'La Chocolata'. Having just begun to assemble this quilt, I have found the cutting directions both incomplete and inaccurate.  As an experienced quilter, I'll be able to correct the errors and figure out the size for the corner triangles, but I shouldn't have to do that.
