My 3-year-old loves this book, so I bought him a new copy to replace his tattered old one. I highly recommend this book, which is delightful, especially for train-loving little ones. This edition, however, was poorly edited, in my opinion. The illustrations don't match up with the words. The sentences break up in the middle of the page. Anyone who reads to children knows that they enjoy pointing at pictures and anticipating the next event. However, it's very confusing for them when the words and pictures aren't in synch. I bought him another version that had other little blue engine stories, and it was a big hit.
