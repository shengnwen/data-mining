I listened to this tape, hoping to get something new out of it. What I really got was annoyed. The frequent proselytizing about Act! was at once a major turn off and a distraction. If you have never read anything about time management then you may find something useful in the most basic sense. I, however, did not find anything new. Better choices would be "Getting Things Done" by David Allen and "Eat that Frog" by Brian Tracy
