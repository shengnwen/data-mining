Okay, this book LOOKED good from the description.  That's about all I've got.  Once I started reading it, I realized that it was a collection of icky horror stories that were really more disturbing and likely to cause a nightmare than I'm comfortable with.  If that's the kind of thing that you're into, then...would you like my copy??  ;-
