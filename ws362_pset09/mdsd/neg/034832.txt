I ordered this book as a gift and found it completely unsuitable because of the photo on the backcover. The gift was intended for a father of 2 small children; he certainly would not want a book with a cover photo of a  man with a vulgar word written on his forehead and making a vulgar gesture.  Neither one of us is a prude, but this is something you don't want around  children. I only wish that Amazon could let customers know what the back  cover looks like in cases like this. I wasted money and time! I'm sure the  inside content would have been interesting, but a coffee table book's  cover--back AND front--need to be suitable for public consumption
