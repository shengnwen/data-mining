A fun book yes. But accurate? No. There are many many flaws. For a couple of examples, it says John plays lead guitar on "Dig a Pony" when you can see George playing lead in the film "Let it be" from were the recording was made. It also states that George only played Tamboura on "Within you, Without you" when it's be clear for many years even by George himself that he play the simple "Sitar" parts on it. Did John really play lead guitar on the Let it Be version of "One after 909" and "I've Got a Feeling"? A lot of real info can be found in Mark Lewisohn's book "The Beatles Recording Sessions". This is someone who went thru the original tapes. Anyway, I'm sure there is correct info here but I just don't know what is correct and what isn't, (unless it's obvious of course.) Maybe someone can write a book and correct all these flaws.
