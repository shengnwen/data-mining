I believe Ayn Rand's writings are very destructive. And this isn't because                      of her highly un-original philosophy. No, the reason for this is the                      powerful grip the books has on her  followers. In her books they find                      justification for  behaving in a anti-social manner that is slowly destroying                       the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is                       supposedly derived from &quot;reason&quot;. In the real world  however there is no                      reason for people not to find  fulfillment and meaning from helping others                      and caring  for their family and friends. The accusation that &quot;altruism&quot;,  i.e.                      decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is nothing  but products of a very                      paranoid mind. The craziest  thing about this though is the fact that Ayn                      Rand has  been raised to a saint-like status by her followers. No                       disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if you disagree you                       are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true  individualist you must                      agree with everything she has  ever written. Isn't this collectivism in a true                      sense?  No, says her followers, those views are derived by reason and                       must therefore be share by all intelligent human beings. Pretty  scary!!                      Note that Objectivism, like Marxism,  Freudianism and Jungianism, is a                      closed system of  thought in the sense that any critisism of the system is                       automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what makes                       Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific  method. And                      this is also the reason for the fanatical  behavior of her disciples. At best                      her books are  useful self help guides, but this is also true of for example                       the Bible or the writings of Jung
