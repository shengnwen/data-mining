I was very excited to get this book, but it has so much description of what amounts to torture of dogs in it, that I just can't read more of it and am actually ashamed to have it.  

It was written by someone who doesn't seem to have any regard for the wellbeing of housepets and did horrible experiments on dogs for questionable gains.  I'm not a member of PETA and am generally thick-skinned, but this one gave me nightmares.  

What they did to get the information isn't worth the outdated information the book contains
