I can honestly say that I have almost always finished reading a book that I start.  This is the exception.

It's my fault, really.  I was looking for a book that would discuss the origins and development of Halloween.  I had in mind the sort that would discuss Charlie Brown and The Great Pumpkin and other Americana.  You know, a nostalgic trip down Memory Lane in rural/suburban America.

Oops.

This is actually an academic treatise where the author wants to discuss social inversion, gender identity, and queer politics.  No offense to the author, but most people don't regularly use the term "social inversion", let alone bring it up constantly in conversation.  If you are a cultural transgressor looking to be affirmed in your okayness, this is perhaps a good book for you.  I was looking to be affirmed in my nostalgia, so I am out of luck.

(Normally I don't review books down because I disagree with the author; however, I feel that this is marketed deceptively.  Normal people don't talk like this guy writes, so I can only imagine that he is one of those people that must rework every concept to fit his sociological theories.  Or maybe I'm just a jerk - you decide)
