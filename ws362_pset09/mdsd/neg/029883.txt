I seriously wondered if I could take this book back the the bookstore it was so lame.  I have read many books that aren't so great, but this one was embarrassingly bad.  I couldn't get the image of Hannah wearing a party dress with an appliqued Christmas sweater AND mooseskin boots out of my head.  Stacy and Clinton from "What Not to Wear" would have been better at this party than the whodunit. And whoever heard of telling half the town about the murder before letting the woman's husband even know?  My old Trixie Belden mysteries I read 25 years ago were much more believable than this.  Also, I thought there would be a few recipes in the book, not over half the pages. Big letdown.
