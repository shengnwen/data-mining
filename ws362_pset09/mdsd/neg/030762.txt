I will make it easy for you:  
At one point the author quotes "The Rover", in particular the line "I used to rock it  sometimes I'd roll it..." and does his best to determine the evil significance of the words "rock it" and yes, "roll it".   

Not even amusing in a sarcastic light but a complete waste of time and money. 

In recent years Jimmy Page has become a patron of ABC Trust (Action for Brazil's Children Trust) donating his time, energy and money to help Brazilian street children so i encourage you to spend your cash wisely. 
  
Or you can buy "Fallen Angel" and allow a self-admitted drug casualty to explain his true meaning of "rock it" and "roll it."   
It's up to you of course.
