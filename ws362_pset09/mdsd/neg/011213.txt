I can not comprehend Mr. Watson's intentions in writing this book.  Although I disagree with the parents of the Columbine victims who believe that more gun laws will prevent further school violence, I respect their opinion and would not dare insult them in a way that this author insults those parents with Christian beliefs.  

Not once does this author offer solid evidence that the Rachel and Cassie accounts never happened.  He even goes so far as to quote law that a jury must follow in defining "proof" because it is so lacking in this book that the author can only be too aware of it.  He insults the victims and their families by calling into question their stories, essentially calling them liars, based only on his own speculation.  With the mass of confusion in the library that day, the Cassie story will always be debated, yet again, Mr. Watson offers no new evidence.  As for Rachel Scott's story: the following text is an excerpt from page 151 of  No Easy Answers, The Truth Behind Death At Columbine  by Brooks Brown and Rob Merritt.  "After he got the breathing tube out, he (Castaldo) was crying and upset, telling me through sobs how they taunted her (Rachel Scott) and teased her about God," Castaldo's mother Connie Michalek, told the Denver Rocky Mountain News on April 21, 2000.  Mr. Watson  actually explores the idea that she was being less than truthful with what Richard said in the hospital that day!
  
 It is the opinion of this reader that if an author wishes to make the accusations that he does, he should bring new and compelling evidence to the table.   This book offers no new insight into the Columbine tragedy. The information he cites as evidence has been around for years, and is available to anyone with internet access or a library card.
