Book one was great, and I felt it followed the biblical story of Rachel and Leah quite well, but this book, book three in the series, it was just so off base with the biblical story.  First of all, Rachel had two children by Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin.  In this book, she cannot have children, but does become pregnant.  Her children dont live!  Why?  Did Liz Curtis Higgs forget about the fact that Joseph and Benjamin did exist?  Honestly, I hope that Grace in Thine Eyes is better than this one was.  I was so disappointed with this book simply because I felt that it didn't do either character, Rose or Leana, justice at all.
