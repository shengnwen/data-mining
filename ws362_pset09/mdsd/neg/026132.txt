This book is nothing new. It's your typical storyline with an obvious problem, a goal, and a very predictable ending. The only difference is that the story is told from the perspective of two girls, which if you're already familiar with southern California gang stories is a complete spin-off from the movie Mi Vida Loca. In fact, if you were to combine the movie Blood In Blood Out with Mi Vida Loca, you would get this book. The good part about Locas was that even though I was one step ahead of the story the entire time, I did keep an interest in it. So by no means is this a slow paced book. Besides the lack of inspiration behind this novel, my only grievance with it is this: the book is narrated in the first person by two girls (Cecilia and Lucia). Since neither of the two really had much of an education, especially Lucia, Murray seems to have purposely squeezed in a few grammar errors to illustrate her lack of education. That's great because the reader can create a better image of who exactly the person is who is telling the story. However, if Lucia is supposed to be poorly educated and Murray wanted to show that in her writing, then she has to be consistent with it. I seriously doubt that a high school drop out from Echo Park is capable of constructing a quote like, &quot;When I'm listening to them jumping sounds I start seeing that same picture again, there's Star Girl on the grass, smiling up at me with the fog in her breath twining up in the night air with mine.&quot; Other than that it wasn't too horrible. I'd recomend this book if you have a lot of time to kill. Otherwise just rent Mi Vida Loca and see the same thing
