I was disappointed in this book. After seeing her on television, I thought it would be a great book to have and be full of helpful information. I found that most of her solutions to problems were addressed with purchasing her products. It was my understanding that there were inexpensive ways, items from your home & items easily purchased from your local drug store  - which could accomplish the same results as the more expensive remedies & name brands. I did not find the suggestions to be any cheaper than what I was purchasing myself beforehand.  There were some solutions she suggested that worked okay, but I found I was trying too many products, spending more money and not getting the good results stated in the book.

Examples: She says to "cleanse" before doing certain things like exfoliate - she does not address cleansing.

She suggests that "exfoliating" will help with the removal of blackheads - but doesn't tell how to remove the blackheads from the face safely without bruising or scarring the skin.

After reading the book I came away with only one or two remedies that worked.  

I would not have purchased this book if I had known the above.
