I have no doubt that this book is great for the first time mother, but for someone who has had a child previously, there was not a lot of new information. There is a lot of good basic pregnancy information here, but much of the multiple pregnancy info could be concluded from singleton pregnancy books and good common sense. I wanted specific information on what I could do to prevent pre-term labor, how much to eat and what, and my limitations. This book did not enlighten me very much at all
