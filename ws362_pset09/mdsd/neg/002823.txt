My main problem with this hiking book is how it is crafted and its purpose.  I grew up in a town along the coast and have spent my whole life hiking in southern California.  The southern hikes listed in Foghorn Outdoors California Hiking are full of holes and what's really puzzling - - - missing maps.  Forget about taking it along on the hike, it's as heavy as a bottle of water,  and who wants to tear out pages.
