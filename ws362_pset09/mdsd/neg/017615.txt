I've read it. I wish I hadn't
The illos are nice, but the backstory makes no sense at all. And the writing goes downhill the further you get into the book. By the time you reach Kong's origins, you no longer care.

Go see the movie. Either the original, or the new one. Heck, see  the 76 version, even THAT'S better than THIS.
