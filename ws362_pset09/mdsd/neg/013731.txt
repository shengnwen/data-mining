I regret to say, Robert Pirsig is a terrible narrator...others find his books gripping, for me, dead boring. Compare with other books to see: "Nature, man & woman" for example, by Alan Watts. It's a hundred times more interesting and the ideas are infinitely more profound. Take Plato's "Phaedrus" or "Symposium" for another. Hey, the setting in Plato is always about the same, Socrates with a bunch of fellows discussing, yet what a wonderful reading it makes...no comparison. Are you interested in Hindu-philosophy and religion? You'll be a hundred times better off if you could just read the Gita or the actual Upanishads - much higher literary standards than in Lila. Say you want something more of a novel? Take "Blue Highways" by William Least Heat Moon. Not a profound philosophical work, but an honest one. You'll get to know many things about old America, some things about Native indians too, a bit of philosophy, you may get tired at points, but there is a sense of humour too, something that is missing completely from Mr. Pirsig, to the best of my understanding. Both his books, Zen&AMM and Lila, are based on very loose (and boring) stories together with sudden "enlightments", where a long dry lecture starts about quality or morals or how people are thinking...bad thing that the reader most of the time is totally unprepared for these, like 'driving my bike and thinking about Phaedrus and some lofty ideas along the way' (in Zen&AMM)- irrelevant, no matter if he somehow tries to motivate or to connect to the story.
