I was led to try this book through Kim Harrison's recommendation. That's the last time I'll do that. A risible mishmash of comic-book superheroes, heiresses, and evil fathers, it features a heroine who's a) traffic-stoppingly beautiful b) the Savior The Whole World Has Been Waiting For, with superpowers likely to be Greater Than Ever Seen Before and c) a survivor of abuse and violence. All together now: "Oh, the poor little chick!" Oh yeah, and her (devastatingly handsome) childhood sweetheart stays in love with her even after he thinks she's dead. 

The Zodiac concept would have been entertaining, and Ms Pettersson's writing is extremely good on the prose level. But her unsympathetic heroine and eye-rollingly far-fetched setup place this book beyond redemption.

Memo to the author: Having characters repeatedly make the sarcastic comment "That's so Star Wars" will not distract readers' attention from the fact that your plot is, in fact, a rip-off of Star Wars
