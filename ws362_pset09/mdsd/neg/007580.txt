Based on the title, I expected this to be an account of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.  There is certainly some of that.  But it's really a book about the author/war correspondent.  The book reiterates countless times how the author was the first American into Nagasaki after the bomb.  That's impressive (although later in the book we read about someone who got to Hiroshima earlier)-- but the book doesn't contain much substance about Nagasaki.  The rest of the book is a mish-mash of other aspects of the war, and it gets repetitive about how merciless the Japanese were to our prisoners.  Toward the end the book tries to become political and focus on censorship, which wasn't very interesting
