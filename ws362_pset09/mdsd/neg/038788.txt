After quickly exhausting the cultural significance of Jello-O boxes in her previous book, SYMPTOMS OF CULTURE, Marjorie Garber has now produced little  more than a book for realtors.  The result is banal and rather  stupid--anything but revelatory.  But perhaps the reader below doesn't take  the criticism far enough: this book has really nothing to say about the  scandalous cost of real estate in most major U.S. cities, the large number  of people who are homeless, and the millions of folks who are gouged every  month by unscrupulous landlords (how sexual is that, Professor Garber?).   Until recently, cultural critics expressed nominal interest in improving  our society.  Nowadays, concerned only about their fat publishing advances,  all they seem able to do is exhibit nauseating complicity with society's  ugliest elements
