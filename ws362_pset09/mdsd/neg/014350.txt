This book started out okay then went downhill very quickly after the first couple of chapters.  I think the authors lost me somewhere after getting the notebook and writing a bunch of dreams and desires down.  It was too run-of-the-mill for me.

Then it gets worse.  It talks about affirmations (like every other self-help book out there) and the same rehashed every other self-help guru talks about.

I wonder if the authors of this book are rich beyond their wildest dreams.  I can almost guarantee that they aren't.  They remind me of hippies running around the country preaching love, prosperity, and happiness while living in a tin-can trailer with dirt between their toes.

I recommend The Trick to Money is Having Some and The Little Money Bible, both by Stuart Wilde.

Pass on this book for sure
