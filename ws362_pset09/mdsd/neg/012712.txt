Very bad book! This book, like all the books in the Trotter-Mathematica series is a excellent example of how not to write a good technical book. Presentation of material and ideas do not flow and he makes simple things more complex than they really are by virtue of his inability to communicate ideas in the most direct way. Many good authors have written books on Mathematica such as Bahder or Ruskeepaa. It would have been better if they had written this book as well
