This is honestly the worst audio book I have ever bought.  Kenneth Davis has written some fantastic books, unfortunately this is not one of them.  I can't even sell this as used.  I could not bring myself to do something that bad to another human.  Kenneths other books are funny, interesting, and informative.  This book would have been better at all three if it had been a random collection of words.
