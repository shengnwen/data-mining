Slapping the name Celtic on a book title does not make it so.  This is just another of many psuedo-magic fluff and nonsense wiccan wannabe books mass produced to fill the troughs of those who would rather preen and put on a veneer. This book is merely a rehash of rehash cloaked in bright blessings and make believe fairy dust. A great book for posuers and those who would rather make up things than actually build on foundations of true believers. Chalk up another one for those out to inflate their egos or make a quick buck
