I recently purchased this book and was somewhat disappointed when I sat down to read it. The subtitle is &quot;Games &amp; Puzzles to Stimulate Your Creativity &amp; Imagination&quot;. Actually, there are only some  thirty such puzzles and many of them are 'old chestnuts'. However, my  biggest complaint is the lack of accuracy. The very first puzzle (p. 20)  has a mistake in it. Then in 'Mental Counting' (p. 161), the author claims  that the letters O and U are not symmetrical about the vertical axis. As  for 'Three-dimesional Dots' (p. 199) the text states &quot;Below is a  collection of random dots.&quot; Unfortunately, the random dots have been  omitted. So much for &quot;something remarkable&quot; happening as the  author claims. And how's this for one of the three (yup, only three)  lateral thinking puzzles? What common word begins with IS, ends with ND,  and has LA in the middle? I bet that really stretched your brain, didn't  it? Sorry, but Mr. Wujec's editor should be fired. These glaring mistakes  and omissions have scuttled any enjoyment I may have expected from this  book. I suspect the author was motivated by the commercial success of his  previous book. He should have waited until he had something of value before  publishing this schlock
