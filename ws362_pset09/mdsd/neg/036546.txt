This book was horrid.  I was bombing the class all year with this text, until I bought REA's electromagnetics problem solver.  Going into the final, I had maybe a B.  By studying the REA book and working my [...] off before the final, I got that up to a final mark of A-.  The physics students at my school used Griffith's electrmagnetics book, and they seemed to enjoy that book a lot more.

This book was slightly better when I took a waveguides course... imagine my disgust when I found out we were using this book, again!  Even the waveguides sections were still quite weak, though, but they do keep me from rating this book a 1.
