This book is easy reading, chock full of anecdotal evidence from the arena of ultra-competitive triathletes.  And while it acknowledges that the reader is probably more of a casual athlete, the book offers little concrete advice.  Rather, Kearns prefers to let you go your own way, using overarching (vague) advice streams.

The main ideas in the book can be summed up rather neatly: 
1) Train only for the enjoyment of reaching "peak performance."  The author calls this "pure motivation".
2) Aerobic training is the indispensible base for triathletes - anaerobic training must come second and be built upon the long-distance training you accumulate and maintain over time.
3) Rest adequately between "key workouts," the workouts that push your limits, are planned fluidly around your life, etc.
4) Gradually intensify workouts as you become more fit.  Do the workout that benefits you most.  One suggestion: the 100/10 "brick" (ie 50 miles biking followed by a 5 mile run).

There, I saved you $10.  This book is a GREAT mental guide for pursuing an enjoyable triathlon career but should be regarded as a companion to other books that can offer you more concrete information about training, especially if you're new to the sport
