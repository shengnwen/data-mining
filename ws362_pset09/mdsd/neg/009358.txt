This is more a text book with a general approach. The focus is not on Lean. 
The formulas in the book are given with very little explanation; I would hate to be in a class where this book is used as the basis for instruction.
I hoped to find a lot of detailed information about Lean production systems but the book has too much other topics to be valuable as an aid to design and/or implement Lean production systems.
The title is misleading and the practioner looking for either theoretical or practical information about Lean production systems will be dissapointed in what he finds in the book
