Ok.  Kyle was the GL in the DC Comic book world for a long time.  He took over for Hal Jordan who decided to take a long needed vacation (ok, he went crazy and killed a whole bunch of people but hey, my version sounds more real then what this novel did).

This novel in one word sucked.  It bastardized the entire origin of Kyle Rayner and how he became a Green Lantern.  It destroyed what happened to Coast City and how it tied into Superman.  It made the Atom seem like a pain in the tucas and the only character that was written correcly was Batman.

Hal is in this but not in a good way.  Kyle is in this and it too is not in a good way.  When did Kyle ever call Ganthet "Gandy"?  And why in the heck did the other Oan's want to remake the universe...wasn't that Hal's job when he became Parallax???

In a nut shell if you like Green Lanter, any version of the character, read the comics and put this book down.  There are much better novels out there to read
