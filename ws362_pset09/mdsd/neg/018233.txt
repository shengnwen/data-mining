This book has a promising start.  Rick Summers, the protagonist of this effort from Frank, has just finished visiting the cemetery to mourn his mom and sister.  He gets into a cab, and immediately finds that his driver has been replaced by a corpse.  A good start, but it's soon downhill from there.

I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I will talk about what hurts this book.  Most noticably, the dialogue throughout is stilted and mind-numbing.  The characters don't seem capable of any discussion that doesn't focus on flirting, and their deepest statements sound like something a 7th-grader might come up with.  Even their thoughts are boring, especially those of Rick, who seems to spend most of his time thinking about how much he'd like to get every female character in this novel into the sack.  When he's not concentrating on bedding each woman, or thinking about lesbian action, he turns his mind to other important pursuits like drinking.  At points, the book seems like some young man's fantasy life - getting drunk and having sex with hot women.

As for the story, there are a couple of problems.  The first is that much of it is nonsensible.  There are some great ideas, but the author doesn't manage to tie them well together.  Added to that is the pacing, which is erratic.  Too much time is spent on certain parts, which makes it plodding, while interesting scenes are really glossed over.  Again, there are the makings of an interesting story, but they're lost in the clutter.  

This one may have been saved had the hero been someone with whom we could sympathize, but he's not.  Really, I couldn't have cared less by book's end about his fate.  This isn't the worst book I've read, but it's not something I would recommend.
