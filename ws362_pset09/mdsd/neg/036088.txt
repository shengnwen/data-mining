This book is 80% verbage and 20% needed information. The ratio is similar to that you might get from listening to bloated bureacrat explain federal regulations for the purchase of government pencils. 

The worst part about this book is that upon first reading, it actually seems to contain information. You don't realize how much verbage there is until it comes time to take a nursing test. 

Don't listen to these other reviewers. Avoid this book at all costs. I've spent hours poring over a single chapter only to find a shorter more compact book that got the info across in ten minutes.
