I thought this Biography very interesting but I have to say I will NEVER read it again, The horrible beatings he had to endure as a nine year old boy left me sickened and depressed,I made myself finish it, so I could write this review. The cruelty displayed by the Matron and Headmaster was terrible, especially since these boys were away from home with no one to talk to.
If you enjoy reading about such things than this is the book for you. 
What is truly amazing is Dahl's humor in writing these memories, I guess he had to go through this so he could write his books,,,,,sa
