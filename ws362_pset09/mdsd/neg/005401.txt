Having been involved in a production of a play, I was very surprised to read this edition, surprised because it seemed to lose so much of the play's poetry and excitement. By altering the text to create a rather traditional form of theater, Mr. Rudall undermines the power of the text fragments and fails to adequately provide future performers and readers with the materials to create a production. I would advise anyone interested in the play, which is at turns tragic, hysterical, and terrifying, to seek another translation
