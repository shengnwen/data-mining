This book has strengths and weaknesses, and overall it's just an  average book.  First 4 chapters present a good overview of device physics and modeling, pratical layout issues, different gain  stages and noise analysis and modelling.  These four chapters are well written.   From chapter 5 on, everything is just a confusing collection of facts, not organized and not well explained.  The authors are extremely fond of the phrase &quot;It should be mentioned/ stated that ....&quot;, this is a clear indication that the explanations are not well thought out, not at all logically connected to the context.  Examples of this is abundant throught. For a textbook, I would recommand Razavi's book, as it gives detailed explanations, and insight into design issues, and this book just pales miserably in comparison.  Though this book gives more coverage, but again, the coverage is mere collection of facts.  As for a reference book, this book does deserve some merit.  Afterall, both authors have had quite extensive experience in circuit design.  However, there are much better reference books on specific topics.   Overall, the authors did not put an effor into explaining things, but merely put in the phrase &quot;It should be mentioned that...&quot;.  So again, it should be mentioned that you won't gain insight from this book
