I really need to learn to put books down when I realize they are bad and stop wasting my time, but there is that side of me that really must find out what happens in the end. 

I started off being annoyed by the writing style, then got intrigued again once the Horse Whisperer entered the picture.  

When Annie and Tom began their affair, it went downhill all over again. The sex scene was WAY over the top - not romantic or sweet - more like a cheap romance novel.

An example of the bad writing? "And he felt no shame nor saw any in her, for why should they feel shame at what was not of their making but of some deeper force that stirred not just their bodies but their souls and knew naught of shame nor of any such construct?".

Let's put aside how we might feel about adultery not being of "their own making", and maybe even put aside the fact that that sentence seems to be missing a comma or two.  "...knew NAUGHT of shame nor of any such CONSTRUCT?"?????  Give me a break.  That about says it all.

That and the ending was infuriating and completely out of character.  Would a supposedly kind and gentle man allow a child who had been through such trauma, or any child at all, to witness such an awful scene? The author certainly makes it seem as though it were a deliberate act, not an accident.  If he were going to be such a coward, couldn't he have at least had the dignity to do it somewhere alone? That the author would leave you with the notion that it was anything other than an accident is maddening.

Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.
