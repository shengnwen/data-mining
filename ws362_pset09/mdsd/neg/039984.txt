the premise of this book suggested that there might be some interesting ideas in there. what a disappointment-there are none. the book is basically a brochure for the authors movement(?)of manifestlove (as he calls it). it all reads a bit new-age, and very american...with little idea or appreciation of a whole other gay world out there beyond the u.s.a.  what makes the book ultimately pointless is that nimmons has no new ideas - he spends the best part of the book outlining what is wrong (or underappreciated) with gay men and their lives (all seen through rose-tinted glasses...especially the chapter on gay men-straight women friends...yuck!!!!!!), and then trots out some of his manifestlove ideas at the end. and consumers...since you are now hooked, you are supposed to sign up for one of his courses/camps or whatever. it is a very cynical approach to write a book to promote your own industry...and as such should be avoided! spend your money elsewhere! or better...just go for a walk on a beach at sunset and enjoy the view and the sounds of the waves...it will do you a lot more good...and make you feel way better than this book!!
