  No. Hillary & her handlers will not know about nor care about this poorly done hachet job. I guess she is such a bad senator that she was defeated in a lanndslide by ?. You know. That famous Republican with the courage to run against her backed up by this tripe. Read it, listen to it, waste your time & tell me I'm wrong. Millions of people LOVE Hillary. Millions of people HATE her. About 5% of voters have no opinion. Those are the people she needs to convince to become president.
