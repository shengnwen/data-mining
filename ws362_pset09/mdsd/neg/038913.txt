   Just as in his book on Orson Welles, Thomson harbors an untoward lust to "get into the act" himself.  He is forever flapping his arms in front of the projector to throw his own shadow up upon the screen. 

   He apparently fancies himself a philosopher, so we are never far from some pompous pronunciamento:

 "In America we treasure shared things, as if we had a constant fear of being helplessly divided and scattered."

"Here, by the way, is a profound contradiction in much of Americana..."etc

   He is, unsurprisingly, cavalier enough about facts to expect to be allowed to breeze by with "To be quick about this part of it, the campaign of the House Committee on Un-American Activities was unconstitutional, and in its punishment, the blacklist, it was illegal."    HUAC's "campaign" itself sadly passed muster via  Congress' power to investigate just about anything it wishes to waste time on, or grandstand about.  It was the methods that offended. HUAC "punishment" was indictment for contempt of congress. The judiciary did the rest on that score, dutifully seeing several into the slam. The blacklist was exclusively the illegitimate get of The (frightened) Studios. 

  Worst of all about this book is that, whenever he runs out of cheap, scurrilous, time-hallowed, dirt to re-publish, Thomson concocts bitchy dish "nouveau" of his own to serve up
