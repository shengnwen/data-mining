If your intention is to podcast to a public site, this is a good book, with clear instruction. If you want to set up podcasts from your own website,there is nothing in this book to help you, and you would be wasting your money, as I did. The book does not live up to its title. 

The author assumes that you are a public blogger wanting to post podcasts on a public site. There is nothing anywhere in the release about the book that this book is no help, if you want to post on your own website. Next time, I guess I go to a bookstore and look at the book. Anyone want a very slightly worn, but unused, copy of this book?
