I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone and her walking tapes and have several for variety and love them all.  I recently bought this book based on the reviews of others but found it really was geared to those who are new to walking.  There is one small chapter for advanced walkers but it doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know if you currently do Leslie's tapes. 

If you are just starting out walking, you may find this book contains some good information and inspirational stories.  But if you are already a "Walker", your money is better spent on a new Leslie Sansone DVD to make sure you have variety in your workouts and a subscription to Weight Watchers magazine, which will provide you with more insight into healthier eating habits.  

I returned my book.  Sorry Leslie
