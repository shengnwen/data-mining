Nylander's semi-biographical book on New England women's history is problematic for many reasons.  Firstly, she carries the brunt of her argument on insufficient evidence...only four diaries.   In a region that's rich with historical documentation, she should easily have been able to find more evidence.  Secondly, Nylander systematically ignores issues of class or race, instead depicting a very rosy image of white upper class women as representative of all women in this time period.    At the very least, Nylander should have been more forward about her intended focus
