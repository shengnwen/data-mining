Fundamentals claims that it is easy to read - in layman's language- but that couldn't be further from the truth. I am a law student with several years of business experience and I've taken courses on Corporations and Securities Regulation. I bought this book because of my interest in learning about Venture Capital from a lawyer's perspective. Even for me this book was way too complex.  The book's chapters and subheadings give the appearance of structure, but the substance is distorted.  The author assumes you have a great deal of understanding about these issues already. Unless you already thoroughly understand such concepts as Securities Registration, Corporate Taxation, and Corporate Organization; and unless you have a fundamental knowledge of such terms as IRS code Section 83, SEC Reg D, Form S-8, Rule 10b5, first refusal option, Reg S-X, leveraged buyout, and best efforts underwriting, you will be left with more questions than answers. You won't learn what those things mean from this book, you'll have to find them somewhere else, yet they are essential to understand what he is talking about. The author gives a comprehensive overview of the whole process but will leave the &quot;layman&quot; lost in the effort
