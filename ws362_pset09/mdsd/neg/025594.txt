I thought it was time I expanded my literary experience to include a higher-education type author. Big mistake. I always try to see a book through to the end no matter what but this one really tested that conviction. I was ready to pitch it into the fire after the first chapter as Mr. Kafka himself suggested we do with all of his 'work'. And why didn't I like it? Because it's nothing more than disturbed stream-of-consciousness phychobabble...dark, depressing, manic, mundane, absurd, surreal. Very Lewis Carrolesque but without the imagination and color. You feel as if you're trapped in this guys never-ending disjointed dream with the vague awareness that you will eventually wake up. You do, after you turn the last page and realize that you've just wasted far too much valuable time dedicated to finishing a work that hasn't enriched your knowledge, sparked your imagination or widened your scope of understanding. I don't care how cheap you can buy it...don't
