This more I think about this book, the more thought provoking it becomes.  First, I find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that's widely known (practically a cliche), add nothing of substance to it, and actually write a book about it.  Second, I find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the Golden Rule applicable to business.  Third, and perhaps the most amazing of all, is the fact that I actually spent my own hard earned money on this book.  What amazing insights did I think would be uncovered?

I'll save you $9.72 (+s/h) and the 45 minutes it'll take you to read this.  Here goes... Unless you were raised by wolves, it's pretty likely you've heard of the Golden Rule.  Ok, now think about how this rule can be applied to all of your business dealings.  That's it - you got it!  

Whew!  Now that you have an extra $9.72 in your pocket and 45 minutes of free time, go practice that Golden Rule by treating your kids/grandkids/neighbors to some ice cream
