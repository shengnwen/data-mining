Don't think I'll be finishing this one! I always try to give an author respect for their efforts by finishing a book even if I find it boring, but I simply cannot stand the fantasies at the beginning of each chapter. It throws the reader of course, and is rather irrevelant. Frankly I'd rather not waste the time as I think I figured it out in the first 1/4 of the book. Maybe I'll finish it and see if I'm wrong..
