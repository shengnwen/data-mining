The information and exercises in this book are good...BUT...certainly most of us with osteoporosis are past 60, as I am, and this book is fairly small at 5 1/2 x 8 inches. We need to have the print and illustrations larger, darker, and easier for us seniors to see.  My husband agrees with me, and he also found the smaller and lighter print difficult to see and read. That fact didn't seem to be taken into consideration with the creation and publication of this book.
