I read this book while in Antarctica last year and had to force myself to finish it.  It became a contest of wills to see if I could red the entire book.  McMurdo is a weird place, no doubt about it.  But somehow, while the author perhaps had the best intentions, it veered off into something that becomes rather incomprehensible.  I spent over seven seasons on the ice and there are so many other stories to tell; the people, scientists, raytheon, projects, science, bureaucracy, idiocy, etc., that would make a great story.  This book is unfortunately not a great story.  Buy another book, any other book..
