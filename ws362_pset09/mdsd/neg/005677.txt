Robin Hobb knows how to write well and proved it with Assassin's Apprentice. Unfortunately, she seems to be in love with her descriptive prose and forgets mundane items such as plot, action, and likable (or at least interesting) characters. Ship of Magic suffers from an excess of flowery prose adorning a dull, meandering story containing uninteresting and mostly unlikable characters. I read a quarter of the book and stopped. Some of the (mostly glowing) reviews claim that the book gets better, but my patience dwindled to naught.

Specific things I disliked:

1. Another Hobb book in which magic but inanimate objects (the wood of the liveship) come to life only after multiple people (three generations of ship owners, in this book) die while touching the object. Can't her magic creatures have lives and personalities of their own?

2. Teens and young adults rarely learn from mistakes and repeatedly act stupid. (Maybe they are all budding politicians.)

3. The interwoven story of sea serpents from some other plane of existence is distracting because of lack of context. It probably will make sense later, but it adds nothing but confusion in the early chapters. Hobb should have started the book at the middle or near-end of the story (so we would know the importance of the serpents and the liveships) and then gone back in time.

4. The members of the main family are mostly unlikable. The only likable one has unrealistic lines: the 13-year-old acolyte talks like a 50-year-old philosopher
