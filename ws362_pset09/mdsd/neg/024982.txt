I don't believe it.  I'm sorry.  Any perceived reduction in pain can be caused by the placebo affect.  I highly doubt that someone who had bowed legs, all of a sudden had straight legs in five minutes.  The author is vague and the chapters lack documentation (Once, there was this lady who came to me...).  The author claims to be able to change the molecular structure of water by "running energy" into it.  Sorry, I might be closed minded, but there is no way.  The whole "quantum physics" thing is just a scientific explanation that, conveniently, no one can disprove, and the author uses this to his advantage to sell books, dvds, training sessions, etc..
