I really wanted to like this book - it had such potential to be fun and motivating. The illustrations were terrific  and the subject could have been quite witty in the right hands. But the text quickly descended into a trivial guide to shopping and all things selfish and superficial. 

Catagnoli's explanation of a princess in theory and in practice seems entirely based on a trite model of a pampered, self obsessed woman. All based on your ability to consume of course. I shop therefore I am... a princess!

I was looking for inspiration in the form of an elegant narrative with lessons in loveliness, grace and everyday nobility. Instead princessdom here is all about 'me, me, me', Manalo Blahnik and how big your diamonds are. Burberry trench coats, Barneys as a place of worship,  Tiffany-blue, Vera Wang wedding dresses... haven't we seen all these characters somewhere - far more interesting - before (like Vogue)? 

The quizes are beyond ridiculous. I thought the author must have been joking but she seems to have some unguarded moments (such as an unladylike obsession with lip waxing) which suggest otherwise. I fear she took it all Rather Seriously which is why this book is not funny at all. 

And there's a whole - boring - chapter dedicated to The Princess Pooch (a pedigree dog of course). Give us a break...

Sadly the main message of this book is how you can justify any kind of narcissistic, self serving, consumeristic behaviour with delusions of royal grandeur. 

Books like this give princesses a bad name
