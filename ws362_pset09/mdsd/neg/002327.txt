While this book would be useful as a reference, it is difficult to read straight through.  This however is not the real problem.  The real issue is that the book applies to the retired exam (9E0-569), not the current exam (9E0-402).  Unfortunately, this little parcel of information is not written on the cover, but instead on one of the introductory pages, making it impossible to know this when you are ordering the book online.  The worst thing is that this book was actually published after the exam it covers was retired.  Why Cisco would release a book on 01/15/2002 when the exam it pertains to was retired more than 2 months earlier is beyond me.  As you might guess, I am not particularly pleased to have discovered all of this after I had already purchased the book
