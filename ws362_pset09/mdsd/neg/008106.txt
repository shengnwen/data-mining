Generally, didactic novels are rather tired and trite, offering platitudes that only please a particular group, while alienating all others.

This book avoids much of that by telling a mildly entertaining (if meandering and redundant) tale set in a (somewhat overly) detailed future.  However, it fails because this book suffers from the "a moral in search of a plot" syndrome.

The original Canticle was a masterpiece because it offered no easy answers and deftly explored the tensions that came with a life of faith.  This new work knows the truth from the beginning, and its entire purpose is to destroy the basis of the previous novel:  The Catholic church is evil, and organized religion is the bane of civilization.  

Whereas Miller's first novel dealt with the church as a more or less (but not always) positive force, this book clearly knows the Catholic church is an evil, evil thing.  This, of course, represents the loss of faith Miller suffered later in life, but he let this disillusionment take over the narrative so that the plot becomes submerged by numerous diatribes and examples meant to reveal the utter corruptness of the church hierarchy.

This is fine if you agree with that stance.  But if you don't (and I am not a Catholic) or even think that novels should stimulate thinking rather than preach to you, then the tale becomes rather annoying.
