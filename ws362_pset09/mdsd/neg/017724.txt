I bought this book thinking it would be a good read before my husband and I started trying for a baby. The cover captions looked like there would be some great information inside. However, when I got the book and read the table of contents I immediately realized it was a book about infertility. I only give it 1 star not based on the content but on the misleading cover of the book. I'll have to pay better attention next time
