There are a number of errors in this textbook, not just in the end-of-chapter review problems, but also in the chapter Examples  that are meant to explain them. This does little to allow students to quickly and easily grasp the material. 
The writing style makes an interesting novel but a lousy textbook. Material is presented by giving an example, history and finally the scientific concept meant to be grasped. Makes for a great mystery, but this is science and a subject that scares students anyway. A concept given first is seldom followed by a thorough explanation. The effect is one of an author, who know his material really well, has no idea how to convey the basics to his readers and is trying hard to entertain. Combine this with the smattering of factual errors and this textbook is just annoying
