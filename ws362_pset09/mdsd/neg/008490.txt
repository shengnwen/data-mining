I believe Jane Green is one of the most gifted and fresh chick-lit writers out there....but this book does not showcase her talents at all!

In every other book by Ms. Green, the protagonist is a woman who has tragic flaws but who you - as a reader - can relate to, feel sorry for, can root for and can empathize with.  Her characters are human - sad, funny, average, smart humans.  

Tasha, the protagonist in this book is the opposite.  She's SO conceited and completely blind to her own flaws.  She is the antithesis of what Jane Green's usual heroine is - she can't even truly see herself for what she is and this fact alone is what keeps this book from taking off.  It is difficult to warm to Tasha, I only found myself exasperated by her ridiculous antics and her egotistical rantings.

The style of the main character speaking directly to the reader is an interesting device, but tends to work well only if the protagonist is someone the reader can bond with.  I never found myself taking Tasha's side so this style of writing was frustrating.

This is Ms. Green first work, and her books since then have been first-rate...you can see some of her sparkling wit and cutting sense of humor in places in this work, but don't waste time reading this if you haven't picked up Jemima J or Mr. Maybe yet
