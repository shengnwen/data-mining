For someone who spent her last years alone,a prisoner,jailed by a vanity so huge,it engulfed her,i didnt expect her to reveal much in this,and  she  dosent,she tells lie after lie,and contradicts herself time and again,all she gives us is what is left of the astute mind,that lay behind the actress,and you know what,we actually dont want to know, why, becauce everyone knows that fame is as phoney as a seven dollar bill,but now and again there comes along someone who transends this,hypnotising everyone into a trance.It was written that she wrote this only for the money becauce she was broke,unforgivible in another,but not marlene,for a soldiers daughter has to survive somehow,whose to argue maybe she will need all her energy to fight another war,such is the legend of marlene
