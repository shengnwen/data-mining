It speaks volumes that David Sudnow found it necessary to completely rewrite his treatise on his experience learning jazz improvisation at the piano. According to Sudnow's introduction, upon reading it again not even he, the author, could penetrate the murky, turgid prose that cluttered his first edition to get any meaning out of it. However, Mr. Sudnow has blown away the first edition's clouds only to replace them with a thick fog in a tome just as impenetrable as the original. Occasional moments of clarity notwithstanding, Sudnow's book reads like a manual of how to convolute language beyond its capacity to render meaning. That this occurs in a book about music-arguably the most emotionally expressive of the arts-makes Sudnow's literary idiosyncrasies unforgivable. Other reviewers on this site have pulled out but a few confusing gems from Sudnow's book, but I won't bother to provide more. I will simply state that such examples are sadly the rule, and not the exception, in Sudnow's book. It is a sad example of a fascinating idea, buried in meaningless language
