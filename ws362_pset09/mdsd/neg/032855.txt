You know it's a bad sign when the copy you've checked out of the library was actually signed by Tania Abei.  Someone went through the trouble of having her sign it (preteniously blathering on about fair winds in her inscription, mind you) and then donated the book to the public library because it was such a lousy read.

Tania has taken something exciting as sailing around the world and put it into words in the most boring manner possible.  Her writing lacks emotion.  Her description of her love interests made me wonder if she was really describing her relationship with her brother. Her description of her cat falling overboard couldn't have been written with any less passion.  She may as well lost a pencil overboard with the way she described her cat falling. 

I admit, I couldn't finish it.  I got 2/3 of the way through and thought 'What is the point, Tania?'
