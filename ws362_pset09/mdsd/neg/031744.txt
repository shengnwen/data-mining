This re-tooling of a classic might amuse children, and since they're the target audience... maybe it's not as bad as I think.  I think it's pretty bad, though.

An ugly frog helps a beautiful princess get back her golden ball when it falls into a well.  In return, she promises to let him live with her and be her playmate - even though she has no intention of keeping her promise.  When he follows her home and she tells her father the story, her father insists she honor her promise.  A rather shocking (for a little kids' book) act of violence turns the frog into a prince, they wed and live happily ever after.

Having grown up with the Brothers Grimm, I realize that a great many old tales have things in them that, today, bother us (boiling children in Hansel and Gretel, for example).  But this is a more modern (1974) re-write and that makes the princess throwing the frog at the wall a bit more offensive.  That's not the worst of it, in my opinion - the fact that, despite having been lied to and thrown at the wall by the princess, the frog marries her anyway... THAT'S the worst part!

The illustrations are poor, with the only potential for redemption being that the "beautiful" princess appears NOT to be a stick-thin female.  The lesson ideas in the beginning are about the best part of the book but they're just not enough to make buying this book worthwhile
