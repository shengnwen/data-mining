This book was the bane of my existence throughout 9th Grade Geometry. Having had a year of a  real  math book this year I am finally able to realize just how stupid the book was. It treats the student like he or she is about two years old, does not provide the information necessary for exam review, and is far too colloquial in general. In addition, it has no answers in the back, just "Hints" in the back of the book that either do nothing at all to help or solve the problem completely without explanation. It also says "SHAME ON YOU" if one looks at the hints without first trying the problem. Personally, I don't enjoy being chastized by a math book, especially one with such a bad approach to Geometry
