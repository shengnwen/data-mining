This book doesn't appear to have been edited well ... there are grammatical errors and label errors, as though there was a rush to the printers.  The photos are rather dark.  However, on the plus side, the fitness models show good form on almost every page.  The workouts actualy appear to be minimal workouts ... the author  claims you can do the workout in 30 minutes ... it seems it would be much less at least for the beginner and intermediate stages, given you only do 1-2 sets for only a few exercises per day. I don't believe most would progress very far using these plans, or rather, you'd progress to the advanced stage very quickly or become discouraged from the lack of improvement in your physique.  In addition, the book fell apart in less than a week ... the pages fell out ... I'll use them to post on my workout wall.  Poor quality production IMO.
