Don't waste your time on this book, there are more valuable ones out there. First of all, what has she DONE to the fabulous story of Shahrazad? Practically torn it apart and sewed it back together with very rough stitches. I read this book trying to get away from the stereotype some writers have of typical "weak" women (I am partial to strong heroines with wit) and therefore thought another retelling of Shahrazad would be just the thing. 
Well, it turned out I was wrong and this book just had the stereotype I was looking to get away from.
If you want a strong heroine, if you've been disappointed by this book and how it portrays Shahrazad, go read Cameron Dokey's version (called "The Storyteller's Daughter). In all, that is a much more satisfying read
