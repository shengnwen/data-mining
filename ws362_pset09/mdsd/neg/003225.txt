Gene Florence has let true glass collectors down with this book. With so many etch patterns to identify, he chooses instead to cover more obscure things like Cathay Crystal. I did not solve one glass mystery with this book and wish I had saved my money. Also, again, he chose to completely ignore Maryland Glass. Although a fan, I cannot let this one slide. Save your money and don't bother with this one
