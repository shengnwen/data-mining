I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.

Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction
