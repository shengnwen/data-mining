This is a nice book but if you are looking for information on starting a Circle, then it is a disappointing choice. I ordered it because of an interview I read in New Dimensions Journal where Justine Toms had a  conversation with Dr. Bolen about Women's Circles. I found more helpful  information in that interview than in the book, as well as information that  was not in the book. What I have found that has proven helpful is the book  Wisdon Circles. It has the information one needs to get a circle started
