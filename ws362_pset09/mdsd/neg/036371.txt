I was excited about this book because I had hoped it would give me insight to gaining understanding about my emotional IQ.  I found the content to be too basic to be of much help to me.  The storytelling style conveyed very little depth.
   I took the online test which revealed little.  My scores were in the mid 70s (1-100 scale) and for my age group placed me about 50% above my peer group.  The questions were very pedestrian, (i.e. "Do you understand other people's emotions",  "Can you feel the mood of a room"  "Do you get frustrated?"  At the end of the 28 question test, there was a pitch to buy more of their services and material.
   Bottom line is that I got very little from this book and test.  
   I have gotten better results buying books on the "Hearthmath Program" (Google them and visit their website.  They are a non-profit org and have books also listed on Amazon) and would encourage someone seeking emotional performance and well-being  to persue this avenue instead.  I am not associated with this program, just a happy customer.  
  I usually don't write reveiw but I felt compelled this time.
