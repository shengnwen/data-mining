This fluffy take on the human element of DoCoMo's success will not teach you anything about the wireless industry in Japan or the U.S. and hardly poses as a model or case study for anything related to strategy or how to &quot;become a global force&quot;. Check out the market cap for DoCoMo in the last year and a half and look at the value and return in their overseas' investments and you will see why DoCoMo is a typical example of floundering, conservative Japanese management styles that aren't taking the world like a tsunami, but trickling in with little or no impact. Global competitors look at DoCoMo's business model as something to emulate, but their weak strategy and feet dragging business style make them a bloated telecom giant wasting away shareholder value. This books talks nothing of that and merely goes on and on about the success of i-mode, which would be relatively interesting if you hadn't read about it ten times in Business Week or Forbes Magazine in the last two years. NOTE: We used DoCoMo as a case study in my Japanese business school and despite all sorts of flowery talk about the creation and success of i-Mode, nearly every member of the class was critical of this company's overall global strategy
