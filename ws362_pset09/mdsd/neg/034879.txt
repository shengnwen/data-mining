I bought the book and was let down about how dated the stories were during the days of the Iron Curtain.  The book dedicates only one real chapter to the issues that have faced couples meeting since the fall of the Soviet Union and impact of the internet.

Secondly the book almost exclusively deals with the marriages of childless couples.  To ignore the impact of children from the Former Soviet Union, coming with their Mom in a package deal, is to underestimate the challenges of the marriage and the stress it will place on the relationship.

Lastly while the book is collection of stories, it offers little advice and mostly annidotes.  The "Culture Shock" books on Amazon and internet articles were far more helpful to prepare me for the challenges of this type of marriage
