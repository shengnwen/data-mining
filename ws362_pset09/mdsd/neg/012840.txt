Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of fiction, but regardless, good fiction is engrossing with dynamic characters and a well-told story.  With that said, Maguire has a strong command of language and is a great writer when you examine his technique.  However, I DESPISED this story...I am familiar with the original Wizard of Oz story, and the potential of turning a classic on its head was alluring to me in addition to all of the attention that the musical is getting.  In spite of my better judgment after the first 100 pages, I kept reading.  I hated this book.  It is one of the worst stories I have read in years.  I am so mad that I paid for this.  Even worse, I wish that I had not given it a chance and saved myself 400 pages of a warped, pretentious story that attempts to question the nature of good and evil.  It fails miserably
