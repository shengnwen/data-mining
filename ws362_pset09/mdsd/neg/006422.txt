I grew up reading Johnathon Livingston Seagull over and over, and became a fan of Richard Bach after reading a few of his other books later in life, but with One it seems he's become too comfortable in his role as an always-inspiring and thought-provoking author, and didn't strain himself to be either.  The book rambles on quite a bit and has an extremely different tone than something like Illusions.  Still made you think a few times, but I definitely didn't feel at all enlightened when reading it.  Very mushy and soft throughout, and occasionally even preachy and self-righteous.  I'd recommend one of his earlier books over this
