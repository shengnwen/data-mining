Well, I was deeply disappointed and the only reason I finished this book was because I kept thinking it was going to explode in the end - well it did - right up in my face!  I don't like how suddenly we are reading about Kay in the 3rd person, I like being in her head - not just 'watching' her.  I actually went back and re-read an earlier novel, just to fall in love wtih the author's writings again.
