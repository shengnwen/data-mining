whenever you post a review about a SW item, I think it's interesting to know wether the reviewer is a fan or not, or just an inbetween. I have been a fan for 30 years and I must admit I find the prequels to have more depths than the original movies. This said, this book was to be the ultimate reference for me, knowing that I already own the classic SW Chronicles. 
Sadly enough, I was really desappointed by the product. First, if you are a fan, you probably already have the SW Ep 1,2,3 Artbooks along with the 3 making-of books. And they contain much more interesting pictures and pre-visualisation art, along with great articles, than those new chronicles do. Second, the desillusion might also have to do with the way the prequels were made. You don't have this sense of handcraftmanship you had while reading through the first Chronicles. Here, everything is Computer graphics and the props and costumes do not have this amazing feel of recycled junk, which made you believe movie-magic exists.
Also, compared to the 1st chronicles, I find that, though there are maybe more pictures, they are all smaller, so again, they don't have the same impact.

If you don't have the art-books or the making-of books for ep1,2 and 3 and if Amazon maintains the low-price of $90 or so, you can give it a go. But be aware you won't learn much about the production or the behind-the-scenes of the movies. 

My personal advice? Purchase the Ep3 making-of book (excellent "live from the set"-style)+ the "dressing a galaxy" book which has nice full-page photographs+ any of the art-books, + "365 days of SW". You can get 4 books for the  same price and you will really come accross never-before-seen pictures and insights, unlike those Chronicles
