I read this book when I was actually in Borneo where I spent over a year, visiting many of the places described in the book.
I found it plainly ridiculous!
The real Borneo is nothing like the mystical "deepest-darkest" fantasy-world described in this story, nor was it even when those travels were supposedly taking place...
It is amazing that this book got such good marks from other readers and probably the best example of how many high tales a writer can get away with about far-away places where most readers haven't been. :-) 
A more realistic description of the same places on a similar trip could be read in "A Stroll Through Borneo" by James Barclay
