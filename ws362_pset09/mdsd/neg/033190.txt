A bad clone of a great model.  In some cases, imitation is not just a form of flattery -- it's a diservice.  If you want to learn Situational Leadership go to the source: The Management of Organizational Behavior or The Situational Leader by Paul Hersey.  Better yet, avail yourself of one of his world famous workshops. He has a new book as well: Leadership - A Behavioral Science Approach.  The Leadership Window omits the most critical elements of this behavioral model.  This "window" is broken and distorted.  Save your money and go for the real deal.
