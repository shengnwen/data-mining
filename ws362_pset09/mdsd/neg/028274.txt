This book provides ideas that could help you sell more effectively, particularly if you are just beginning in sales. If you've read a lot of sales or management books, though, you will already be familiar with many of the ideas it presents.

In my opinion, the book title is misleading. This book reads like it was originally named Fourteen Laws for Better Sales before the publisher decided to boost sales by renaming it. The author seems to feel that if he sprinkles the words "high trust" throughout the text, then that's what the book is about. It's really not.

In High Trust Selling, Todd Duncan offers standard advice on selling dressed up in "high trust" clothes. But he does not really place the sales cycle in the context of the principles we advocate in the TrustBuild Program. If you need an introduction to selling or a review of basic principles, you might want to buy this book. Otherwise, there are better choices.
