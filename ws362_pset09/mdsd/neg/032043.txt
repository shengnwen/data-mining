I expect a lot out of anything with a Disney association, and in many ways this does not disappoint. However, I believe it has a fatal flaw that makes it less child-friendly. I love to read with my children, but I view these read-alongs as a good alternative so our young children (3 & 5) can "read" a book on their own. However, none of these stories include cues to let a child know when to turn the page! This leaves them guessing and was a severe disappointment for all of us
