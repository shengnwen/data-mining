I have to say that I didn't like SEE HOW THEY RUN and that's surprising since I've loved all of the other books by James Patterson that I've read. I'm not sure if it was the disappointment of Alex Cross not being in this tale, or the bouncing around, both physical and emotionally.

The story revolves around Dr. David Strauss and opens with his wife being murdered at a party, in which he barely escapes. At almost the same time, his brother is killed at the Academy Awards and he then finds out that his old girlfriend is on the run for her life. So begins Strauss' search into why this is happening to his family and close friends. A search that drags the reader along as he streaks across Europe, to the Nazi concentration camps and finally ends up in Moscow in time for the Olympics.

The tale leaps from place to place, and emotion to emotion with no clear cut methodology and leaves the reader with jet lag. Throughout SEE HOW THEY RUN, I found myself wondering why Patterson had included everything that he did and where his logic for that inclusion had come from. It was never clearly explained and many loose ends were left dangling. Instead of fooling the reader by covering up the guilty parties and their reasons for the assassinations with excellent dialog and mysterious situations, he keeps pulling new things in to confuse you. 

To me it seemed as if he didn't have a clear outline in the beginning of the book and kept adding things that "sounded good" to get the number of pages needed to publish it. Don't read this book and judge it to be a typical James Patterson novel - which would make you not want to read any of his other books, which are definitely worth reading. I'd like to chalk this up to a decent try, but definitely not a contender for a great book!
