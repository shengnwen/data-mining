I have played all of the Splinter Cell video games and I enjoy the series very much.  I bought the third book, Checkmate, in an airport with fairly low expectations.  It was well written enough, particularly because I like the genre and the Sam Fisher character.  I read the reviews for the first two books and I ignored the bad ones.  I cannot believe that these books made it to print.  The writing appears to have been done by a high school student or a non-native english speaker. There obviously was no editor assigned to the project.  I lost count of the number of times words were used incorrectly or gratuitously.(My favorite, is when a "hidden surveillance team" was inserted -- as opposed to what, a "visible" surveillance team?) Worst of all, in these books Sam Fisher is a total moron.  I won't put spoilers in here, but there are instances where someone is very obviously bad or try to kill Sam and after it would be paintfully obvious to anyone, he would say "I'm beginning to get the feeling that they are aiming for me" or "I'm starting to think this guy might be not be on our side".  At the end of one of the books, he does something so stupid and amateurish that you won't believe it.  And, if only a handful of people know about Third Echelon, why do I lose count of the number of people who know?  Perhaps it is my ignorance, but do covert operatives take Army flights out of Dulles?  Wouldn't he know he needed the access code in the many hours before he got to the facility he was infilitrating?  If the facility was abandoned, why would they send him and not the FBI?  These books have more holes than swiss cheese.  My wife couldn't believe that insisted on finishing the books, but I was invested and wanted to know the resolution.  Perhaps the practice of writing made the third one better or maybe they found an editor.  But owners of the first two books should be issued a refund
