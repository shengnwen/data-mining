The lack of imagination in this book is incredible (it is, in fact, the only incredible thing about it). Ms. Bushnell merely takes clichï¿½d ideas of powerful, wealthy men's lives and applies them to four women. The result reads like a collection of phony Playboy short stories -- only with female names.

There is really very little character development. I had no feelings one way or the other for any of the characters. 

Also, there is no development of the relationships between the women. There's just no glue there -- it is as if it were written about three unrelated strangers.

Additionally, it's one of those books where you keep waiting for something to happen -- and nothing ever does.

Sorry, but I really found nothing entertaining in this book
