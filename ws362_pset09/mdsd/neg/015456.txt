If you like to read a story where the author is so in love with big, fancy-pants words and spinning his tires without getting anywhere then this is the book for you.  This guy has a great command of vocabulary and language and often writes beautiful sentences THAT GO NOWHERE!. To say that these stories are slow in developing would be an insult to slow.  The first story is great, I will say that, but the others meander and meander and describe and describe and finally you get a hint of true plot and action without endless description and the story is over.  The stories are overlong, overblown and self-congratulatory.
Yes he is like China Melville but I actually like China and feel bad saying that. They both have a similar feel to the universe they create and they both have astounding vocabularies but China also incorporates some meat with all the potatoes.
This guy had a good idea and then got lost in a thesauras
