Dr. Moats' theories have been excitedly received by politicians (particularly those with very strong conservative views) and slavishly followed by publishers.  These interests claim her work to be informed by scientific research and met by strong results.

Sadly, not only is Dr. Moats' classroom experience and research questionable, she also fails to take any notice of linguistic theory.  Most damagingly, she is an adherent to the widely discredited theory of language deficit hypothesis.  This theory, which was stunninngly debunked by Labov in the 1950s, states simply that children who speak dialects other than Standard American English lack a true language and require both remedial education and lots of phonics.

Dr. Moats seems entirely unaware of this hypothesis' thorough debunking, since she never bothers to make any kind of argument as to why she believes it to be true.  This arrogance is problematic
