Legend, Lies & Cherished Myths of American history is a misleading title.  Do not assume this book to among likes of James Lowen's publications.  Some aspects of the book seem factual.  However, many arguements he makes such as the American revolution was not revolutionary at all, are completly rediculous.

This is yet another book in this kind of genre based upon assumptions and poor research. Avoid it at all costs.
