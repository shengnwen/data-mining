Though Time on the Cross takes on a new approach to the subject of  slavery, the authors' research is horrid.  It is as though they made up  their minds what they were going to find and then made sure their research  (or lack there of) fit their thesis. Much of there data is inaccurate or  irrelevant, such as tables that compare the occupation distribution of  antebellum slaves to that of all males in 1870 to show that slaves held  fewer laboring jobs (as opposed to artisan or managerial positions).  1870  is after the industrial revolution begins to take place so there are  obviously more laborers than skilled workers.  The book is filled with  these inaccurate interpretations of data and some claims that are  completely unfounded.  &quot;Reckoning with Slavery&quot; by David, Gutman,  Sutch, Temin, Wright and Stampp is a good book to read along with Time on  The Cross, to see the many errors which the authors find in Fogel and  Engerman's &quot;masterpiece&quot;.  This book is good in that it teaches  readers to be objective and understand that statistics can be bent to  support what an author wants to prove
