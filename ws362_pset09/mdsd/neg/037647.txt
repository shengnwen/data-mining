I bought 20 stocks with Greenblatt's list.  Two quarters later i have lost 25 percent of my capital.  Of the 20 stocks i picked from his list, only 8 are now on his list 5 months later!!!  Wow!! What changed with his numbers SO quickly?  Watch out for the Hussler!!  You would think that Greenblatt already has enough money and wouldn't need to milk the consumer anymore with yet another book
