Wow, this book is a near giant piece of worthless trash. It's amazing how seemingly wise men put out garbage like this. An example of the utter stupidity of the garbage logic in this book is for example one of the author's claims that Samuel didn't really do all the things that were claimed of him because he was described as doing different things. What, the, hell? For example Samuel couldn't have been both a prophet and "king-maker". Uh... CUZ? Instead they claim he was probably a cult leader. LOL. This is preschooler dribble hoping for lobster and wine elbow rubbing with other God haters. Jesus is worth more then the $ you dive for Mr. Miller and Hayes
