This is the worst romance I have read in ages and ages. The heroine is perfect- like Jo in Little Women. She can do all and be all. Independent, head-strong, beautiful ofcourse. And the guy she picks- tall, handsome, loyal, perfectly patient with all of Elizabeth's ("don't call me Bessie!") prickliness. "don't call me Bessie" is what she constantly says to all the family members- quite repetitive.
And that is another reason this book is really poor. So much repetition. In the first few chapters the author says the same things over and over and over again- How the Uncle took the first two daughters to court to find their husbands. How Elizabeth doesn't really want to go. They say it to each other, they say it again. 
Spare yourself. And if you must read it, get it from the library. This is not a book you'll want to pay for or keep or lend to a friend. Want a good historical romance? Try The Queen's Fool by Phillipa Gregory. Now that is a complicated plot with lots of surprises. And the heroine isn't quite perfect..
