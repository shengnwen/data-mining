Scott Eblin takes the reader on a wonderful ride of executive leadership and management by drawing on his years of experience in human resources and human resource management.  For Eblin the essence of getting from point A to point B is more than a linear approach of plotting a course, but a dynamic process of self-discovery and self differentiating behavior.  Additionally, in moving to the Next Level, Eblin coaches the reader into an understanding of the component parts that make that moving process work.  It's not for the timid or meek. Dr. Ja
