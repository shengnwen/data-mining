As a diehard Red Sox fan, how could I go wrong with a book documenting the 2004 season?  The answer:  Stephen O'Nan.  He spends more time espousing outrageous conspiracy theories (that MLB is routinely fixing games to get postseason matchups) making up silly nicknames for players that no one else on the planet uses, and generally spouting personal anecdotes that do not provide any insight or even useful description of the famed season.  Stephen King, on the other hand, does a terrific job.  Unfortunately it is O'Nan who provides the bulk of the content.  As a committed baseball fan I routinely found O'Nan's lack of understanding of the subtleties of the game to be infuriating.  Basically this guys is not qualified to be writing any sort of non-fiction book about the sport.

That said, there is one redeeming aspect (in addition to Stephen King's portions) to the book.  It brought back that wonderful season - as I plowed through, I remembered where I was and what I was doing at each critical juncture.  I remebered the anguish and the joy - conjured back by the images in the book.  Worth reading?  I think so - though I reccomend the strategy of keeping the book out and picking a chapter randomly every now and again.  This allows you to re-live the moments with small doses of O'Nan's idiocy
