The idea for the book was great, but the book was way too long, although the ending wasn't quite long enough. You shouldn't read this book until your 16 or 17, at least. It was way too confusing for me. Some parts of the book were more intersting than the others, and it was interesting to see into her life, but definately not a book to put on a young adults list
