When I was introduced to Goldberg at a conference a few years ago, the first words out of his mouth to me were (almost a direct quote), "See, I don't have horns and a tail." Other than my name and that I am a journalism/mass communication professor, he knew NOTHING about me, not even my politics or whether I had read his book. The man doth protest too much, me thinks. I have read his book, and there is nothing like a completely one-sided book complaining about the mass media being one-sided in the other direction. If all of the mass media companies (which includes book publishers) were one-sided in favor of liberals (other than Fox, National Review, Weekly Standard, etc.), Goldberg wouldn't have been able to get this book published, let alone advertised, reviewed, etc
