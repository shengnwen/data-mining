This is so far one of the most boring Nora Roberts books, ever.  It was OK but it seriously was a PUSH to get through it, and usually I simply just fly through her novels.  The characters are very flat and uninvolved.  I was able to guess whodunit way before the act was even done, as well as guess some of the plot twists.  The book was fun for the trip to Hollywood-land but besides that it was a LONG book (528 pages) that really would have been better off slimmed down.  Lots ado about nothing which leads to boring repeat events and pointless happenings that in the end you discover served no purpose at all to the story.

If you are a NR fan, you may like it but I suggest perhaps finding another novel to read first and borrow this one from a friend.
