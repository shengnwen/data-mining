The first two Betsy Taylor books were short but packed with humor and action.  I've re-read them both several times, and still love them.  This one? It seems like she whipped it off in less than a month, and didn't put the care and craftsmanship into it that she did the others.  The plot is thin, the characters far less developed, and the book is overall a disappointment, especially in light of how excellent her first two Vampire Queen books were.  Sadly, the fourth book in the series, Undead and Unreturnable, is even worse.  I advise anyone wanting to read either Unappreciated or Unreturnable to get them from the library--they are not worth buying.  Try Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking instead, or Katie McAlister's You Slay Me if you want something lighter, and hope that MJD gets her act together and starts writing well again
