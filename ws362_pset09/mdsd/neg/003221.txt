Danielewski is a little like "musician" Puff Daddy: he really does very little work on his own but is an expert at appropriating ideas from the avant-garde and then rearranging them in a comfortable, easily consumable form. "House of Leaves" has more in common with Stephen King than it does with Ballard, Burroughs, Poe, or even more radical artists who use the methods MD steals, like Samuel R. Delaney.

If having to turn a book while you read seems "cutting edge" or "daring" to you, then jump in. Otherwise, you should go buy some Jeff Vandermeer of China Mieville -- two artists less concerned with empty stylistic tricks and more focused on producing quality literature
