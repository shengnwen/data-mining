Packwood attempts to create a magical paradigm using memetics as his field of study but unfortunately he abuses the subject matter.  Attempts to mystify and colour the system are lost in juvenile descriptions such as "Root Social Matrix" which he attempts to pass off as "substantial".  Even more scary are his references to meme-atoms and meme-molecules.  Memetics is a science; Packwood attempts to create a magical model using pseudo-science as his framework. He has possibly done more to damage magic's worth in the world of science than anyone else by writing such a poor book.  Pseudoscientific claptrap made worse by the courier new font in large lettering for kids - except I wouldn't let my children read this rubbish! If you want to get into Magical Memetics, read the literature and make it up as you go along, you can only do better than Packwood
