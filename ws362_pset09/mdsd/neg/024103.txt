This book left much to be desired. The storyline wasn't great, and the main character was unsympathetic and unlikeable. The only reason I finished it in spite of this was that Berg has a beautiful way with words. I liked the way she put words together to create a particular feel or image, and look forward to seeing if she has anything better out there than this.
