This book tries to do too much: it wants to be a heart rate training book AND a book about training for sporting events.  The book is only 200 pages...get the picture?   The book provides cursory information on training for various sports: walking, running, cycling, in-line skating, and  triathlon.  Obviously, if you really wanted to learn how to train  competitively for these sports, this ISN'T the book for you.  If you're  looking for a book that tells you how to create a workout you can do at a  health club on a stair-climbing machine or elliptical trainer, etc....this is  NOT the book for you.  Sure, there's a chapter on "group" exercise (i.e.  aerobic class), but it FAR from practical.  The introductory chapters  merely delineate the heart zones rather than offering suggestions for  combining them meaningfully or providing progressive programs.  The book  simply tries to cover too much in order to increase its market
