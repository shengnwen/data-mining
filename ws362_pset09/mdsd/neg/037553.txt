Marjorie Kelly stands heads above her comrades in shouting the old adage "From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs" from the father of wealth discrimination, Karl Marx.  She pounds her pulpit to not just reform our economic society but to invert it.  Her scheme for change requires more government intervention and less free capitalism.  She is clearly in left field. The fedgov through their meddling in forbidding areas has created the mess we are seeing today.  Corporations are abiding to compliant ethics (established by meddling government bureaucrats) and no more.  Free capitalism abides to the divine ethics and does unto others as they would want done unto them.  Ms. Kelly and those who like this book should reread Animal Farm, visit the Von Mises website or check economic books by Carson, Hazlitt or Sennholz
