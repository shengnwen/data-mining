I thought this book would be similar to the author's previous colaborations where they wrote about business. BIG MISTAKE. Although the style is similar, the content is very different. This book tells a religious story. Even if this is what you're looking for and are familiar with their previous work you'll find that this text is not as deep or witty as in their business books. The book is also very short without the deeper level analysis that could be found at the end of their other books. I didn't give this 1 star simply because I continue to like the conceptual way in which they try to convery concepts and I'm a sucker for the illustrations of Gombert
