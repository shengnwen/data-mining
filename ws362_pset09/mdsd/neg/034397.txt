The Mozart Season is about a girl named Allegra Shapiro, who has played the violin since she was young.  Now Allegra has been accepted into a violin Bloch Competition.  She hesitantly enters, being the youngest player.  At the beginning of the book, Allegra is not sure about the competition, but as you continue to read, her determination grows.  As she confronts other characters, such as the dancing man, she learns different things.  For instance, she learns that her talents and family aren't always taken for granted.  She finds motivation from some of these characters.  To her, violin is life.  An example of that is during the summer she practices six to seven hours a day to prepare for the competition.  As she enters the stage, thoughts whiz through her mind and her practice pays off.
 While Virginia Euwer Wolff had a good plot, The Mozart Season wasn't a good book in my eyes.  Still, if you enjoy reading coming of the age books, then you should read this one.  I think that the author could have done better moving the book along and she could have used more pronouns.  In my opinion, she also finished the book without really finishing it.  She dropped character during it and never finished their story.  Overall I would say that this book wasn't really a book that I fully enjoyed reading, but the end, I would have to say, was good.
