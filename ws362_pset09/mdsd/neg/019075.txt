This book is pure fantasy.  I've talked to people from Sevillian fencing schools who say it just doesn't exist.  The book has many geographic inaccuracies.  The author has invented an imaginary world that he could be the sole expert on.  There's a few photos of techniques but it's just fancy recycled ninjitsu moves
