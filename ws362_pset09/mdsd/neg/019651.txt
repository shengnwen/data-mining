As the past reviewer I did not arrive to the page with THE END printed on it, and I really hate to be unable to finish a book. Anecdote aside, I am aware that my review lacks proper grounds, but since there is so much to  read and too little time, I strongly suggest you to look for other works of  this author. During the first chapter I seems to be going great, the drama  was cleaver and catchy. But suddenly in the second chapter it just stops  and all the events seem to be going nowhere. Besides the construction of  the language is boring and confusing. It feels like the author worked in  this novel for a while, then left it during some years locked in a closet  and one fine day decided to complete it, but without being at ease doing  so
