I have been searching all over to find the book that was my favorite as a child, and am greatly saddened that it has been replaced by this version which is text heavy and watered down to be somehow politically correct (according to some other reviews).  The original was a long horizontal, though not too large book.   I can remember the drawings vividly, of the little obstinate boy out in the distance, with the sea life spewn about on the ocean floor and the first brother's cheeks full with the ocean water, about to burst.  This scene alone taught me that going against your word brings your own demise.  I remember the picture of the brother with the long legs, drawn as a center fold that you could hold vertically to see how long his legs were.  This was a favorite book of my generation who were children of the violent 60s.   REM turned it into a song it was so popular.  The new version is watered down visually, most likely due to the contemporary belief that children should be protected from death, although I am sure the current version still gets the message through about justice.  In the times we live in, I believe children are more sophisticated about reality.  To me the reinvention of this story is like ripping down an historic building to replace it with boring row houses.  Where is the old book?  ..
