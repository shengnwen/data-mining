I hesitate to write a less than laudatory review, given all the praise this book has received over the years (not to mention awards).  And I must include that this was my first Norman Mailer and maybe third true crime read, so I am familiar with neither.  That being said, if you are also unfamiliar and/or not a fan of Mailer or true crime, pick another title.  Please.  Life is WAY too short for people like you and me to experiment w/ this huge, honker of a story, awards or no.

I definitely enjoyed many parts and was interested in some of the characters (e.g. Gary, Nicole, some of their family), but man, too many parts (those detailing the details of every detail lived by indirect parties like lawyers, journalists and producers involved in the trial) read like, "blah blah blah" after a few paragraphs.

I recognize the genius of the work.  I recognize the appeal to a specific crowd.  I also recognize that if it weren't for some stupid compulsion I have to finish any book I start, I would have jumped on the internet around page 350 to skip the journey and get to end.
