I'll keep this short, not so sweet and to the point.  I've read all of Dean's books up until this point and this is the very FIRST time where I couldn't finish one of her books in 2 days or less.  I don't mean to suggest that book #5 was intellectually challenging, it just did nothing in the stimulating department.  When I discovered that Django was absent throughout this entire book, I discovered something else...he's the only character that truly interests me.  It's odd because even the books he does appear in, that appearance is shortlived, which only leaves you (or at least me) wanting more.  

Therefore, allow me to make one request to the author if she should decide to care what her readers really think....PLEASE BRING BACK DJANGO.

*keeps fingers crossed* (It's alot safer than holding my breath)
