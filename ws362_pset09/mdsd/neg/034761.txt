Return to the Whorl is like a Christmas Fruit Cake--all too full of candies and fruit and nuts for my tastes. Mr. Wolfe desperately needs an editor who would cut these books by half or more. The Book of the New Sun was very interesting despite a tendency to introduce unexplained marvels for no apparent plot reason. The Book of the Long Sun was entirely too long. He has good, sometimes wonderful, characters who spend too much time doing pedestrian things. On Blue's Waters led me to hope that he had regained some of the magic of his earlier book. Then came In Green's jungles..a step back. Then this, which was so tedious I could barely finish it. Fantasy fiction, which abandons the normal theory of some metaphysical cause and effect, drifts into a meaningless subjective expression of whim in this book. A gross example is the Godling who appears in this book (and on the dust cover). What possible explanation for this being can there be? I could go on at great length, but it is now clear that this kind of fiction is not for me any longer
