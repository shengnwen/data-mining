Someone's trying to kill Soap star Mary Lisa Beverly, and how I wish they'd succeeded. This book doesn't do either the mystery or romanance genres justice, and thread throughout is a lame shooting report from the set of the soap whose title forms the title of the book. Does anybody care that Mary Lisa's character in the soap meets her long-believed dead father? What does this have to do with the death plot? And what's a small town cop from Oregon doing stepping into an investigation in California? The book explains Mary Lisa's father and a rejected lover both asked him to, but Jack Wolf's got his own murder to sleuth, so what's he doing in Oregon, other than making eyes at our heroine. Much of the book centers on flirting between the Oregon sheriff and Mary Lisa, stuff that has little to do with the plot and indeed detracts from it, and the book is in serious need of an editor. At one place, Mary Lisa refers to the "Sheik of Aran." Argh!

This is one to skip. Generally a good writer, Catherine Coulter must have pulled this one out of the rejected pile. It should be thrown back
