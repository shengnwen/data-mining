Do yourself a favor and pass buy this book.  I wasted my money on this and wish I had chose a different book.  However, if you have any teenage girls at home that raid your liquer cabinet when your out of town this book might come in handy.  Or, if you want to make non-alcohol drinks and smoothies this is book has alot of recipies.  Just don't buy it if you plan on having an adult party that requires mixed drinks
