While Sigma Six Software development is an interesting book, very little of the book has anything to do with software development. Most of the commentary and examples in the book are about Manufacturing, not about Software development.  While the book does have value, it is mostly a decent overview of Sigma Six in general.  If it is your goal to learn about Sigma Six in general, there are literally hundreds of generalist Sigma Six books in the marketplace. Hopefully, someone, someday will write a good book on Sigma Six that focuses on software.  Unfortunately, the cover and title of this book does not reflect its contents
