I was very disappointed to find that most of chapter 5 "Genetic Engineering" was incomplete. The chapter was cut off (on page 80) and was followed by a repetition of page 49-80. Chapter 6 "Why we should Worry" had been left out and the beginning of chapter 7 "Human Rights" (page 105-113) was missing as well. It was very important for me to work on precisely these (missing) chapters at exactly this moment in time, so I am of course quite dissatisfied with the quality of this particular product.
