"I was flushing the evil out....It was a good feeling knowing even though I might not be able to sleep, at least I'd feel clean." 

17 year old Brendan and his friends Will and Kevin are the dregs of school society, the outcast, the fringe. Now they're in for a night of memories. After throwning back some Acid, they've hit the streets of Philly to enjoy themselves when the Pure Sunshine kicks in. The best and worst part about Sunshine is it makes everything else boring. It takes Brendan past all the normal experiences to where he can't enjoy anything anymore because of his desire for the next hit. 

That's where Sunshine leaves him---at a place where the real and surreal mix together and separate in a way that leaves real life not worth as much as induced life. In the middle of a midnight trip, Brendan and the guys visit Sally, the downtown girl, so they can relax safely and enjoy their high. With so many girls that Brendan wishes he could take things deeper with, their night with Sally awakens a spark in him for something more. Not necessarily with Sally. Or any specific girl. But with something. For once, he feels his void. 

Brian James' PURE SUNSHINE delves into the euphoria and pain people experience when addicted to LSD. While the details of the high can be intriguing at times, a sense of arc and story are strangely missing all the way through. The story is more a realization that drugs may not be everything Brendan's made them out to be. Thatâ(tm)s the only thing that can bring him back to the point he can enjoy reality again, give him a chance with the girl he's always wanted, and get him to a place he can feel clean for the first time in a long time.
