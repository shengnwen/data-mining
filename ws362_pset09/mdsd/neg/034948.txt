In the theoretical sense, this book provides a very thorough overview of categorical data analysis.  However, this book should not be used as a reference for the scientist needing to do the occasional number crunching of categorical data.  The examples are vague and the tests are not well explained.  If you want to derive the tests, this book is for you.  If you're not a statistician at heart and just want the answer, I suggest looking at Conover's "Practical Nonparametric Statistics" for a good explanation of which tests to use and how to use them
