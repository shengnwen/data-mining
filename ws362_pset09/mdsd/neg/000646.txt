If you're interested in learning how to build wooden boats but have NO wooden boat building experience whatsoever this book is NOT the book for you. The Duck Trap Press how-to books might be a better place to start.  This book appears to contain a wealth of information from a very experienced author. There's a ton of good historical information contained within.  Unfortunately without knowing how to 'read' wooden boat plans and drawings and understand the terminology that the author uses this book did not meet my expecations at all
