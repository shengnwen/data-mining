This is a 'lets make fun of the French' book.  In reality, a similar book can be written by many expatriates in every country, including foreigners living in the US and New York.  Mr. Gupnik refuses to accept the differences between the different cultures and seemingly expects the French to behave as if they are funny speaking Americans.  

This is a useless book, fake and pompous.  Don't waste your time and money with it
