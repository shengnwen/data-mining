This book offered very little in the way of useful information.  To make matters worse, the cartoons that nearly filled every page of the book had almost nothing to do with recovery from the pain of addiction.  Perhaps, this book would be useful for someone with a very limited vocabulary, along with even less interest in overcoming an addiction.
