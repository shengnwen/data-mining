This book gets to the heart of what really constitutes a book review.  Does a book get X stars because it is grammatically correct?  Because the
reader happened to like the subject matter?  Because the author is adept at using descriptive adjectives?  I don't really have an answer to that general question, so let me just say I gave the book a low rating because of the effect it had on me. 

Frances Mayes obviously knows how to write well technically.  Nobody needs me to tell him that.  The problem for me was the way the author conveyed her choice of subject material.  She soon began to sound quite self-indulgent and self-absorbed with this "pert orange rind", that
"meandering back road", this "raised fork" and that "riotous bougainvillea".  It felt eventually like I was reading about someone  partaking of a huge buffet of the senses.  Interesting for a short time, but for over 400 pages?  The book became numbing and repetetive.  Perhaps this is the result of patching together the various vacations she took over the 5-year period and using the same formula to convey the impressions of each one consecutively.  I would have enjoyed the book if it had been about 250 pages shorter and had concentrated on just one geographical location.  And if there had been more of the "location" described, and less of Frances Mayes' perceptions of it.  It really seemed as if she was writing for an audience of one; herself.
