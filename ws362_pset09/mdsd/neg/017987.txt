How could a book about labour ignore the most important issues of social class, race, and gender?  The book is really a collection of rah-rah essays on unions in America lacking in any analysis and rigor about the lives of workers in the U.S.  An obsequious effort to gather all perspectives without taking a position.  Why is there no critical examination of issues of race in this work?  The work does not have any essay by rank-and-file workers and seems to see the unions moving ahead by continuing in their old ways.
