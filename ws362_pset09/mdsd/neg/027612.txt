It's hard for me to imagine a more silly, less absurd book than this one.  Why anyone would NEED this book is beyond me.  Maggie Gallagher is a very controversial and extreme conservative, whose comments are often insulting and outrageous.

Anyone seeking a nice book about marriage should look to a more rational, reasoned source than this book. There are plenty of them out there.  This is not one of them.
