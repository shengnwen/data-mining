 I used this book for the first and last time in Autumn term 2006 with 28 foreign students in my Global Finance MBA course.  When one wishes to make money by consistently reissuing new editions he has an obligation to update it at least minimally, (The Paul Samuelson Rule). In this case Greed is not good.

Hence, my exasperation when I open the 2006 edition of the book and on the first page learn that the currency of Belgium is the Belgian franc,  the currency of Ireland is the pound,(Ireland's curency was never the pound; it was the punt) or that Germany still has the DM. Many of students lost points on a midterm because they thought the currency of Finland is is the markka. Shapiro in 2006 says so. On the next page he fails to mention Monaco; there are a lot of capital flows internationally through Monoco. And on that page Spain still has a peseta.Portugal has escudos.

The book also suffers from wordiness. I did like the key phrases section in each chapter; I thought at least that all key phrases would be included in the glossary but I could find all there. There is a certain obtuseness which I did find perplexed my students sometimes, who did not quite enjoy this book as I had hoped. We would not use it again.

I tried to contact the author by email with several queries but did not experience the courtesy of a reply
