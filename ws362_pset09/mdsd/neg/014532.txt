Just one of the many lies i n this book overlooked (????) by Douglas Brinkley was Kerry supposedly in Cambodia in 1968 and  havinga telephone conversation with Pres. Nixon. HINT: Johnson was the president in 1968, not Nixon.

To read this book 'TOUR OF DUTY', you'd swaer that Kerry was a real life Rambo when in fact, Kerry was more concerned with carrying around 8mm cameras and old fashioned and heavy Smith-Corona typewritters layingt he foundation for his future presidential campaign.

In another regard, what happened to that BIG DRAFT KERRY said was goingt o happen in January 2005? And the reduced social security benefits? And the Herbert Hoover economy? These were just some of the lies that Kerry repeated over and over and over during his failed presidential campaign in 2004. 

But what really happened? There was no draft and 2005 is nearly over. Our seniors got a raise, not a cut in social security benefits and all economic factors show that the economy is doing just great thank you.

Are you all glad that Kerry got whipped last year? Say yes.
