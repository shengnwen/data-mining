Littel has written a book about undercover agents that assume identities and personalities, called "Legends". The premise behind the book, and this may be kind of vague because I read the book several months ago, is that one of these undercover agents (or former agents?) is seemingly struggling with a personality disorder that obscures his reality. Not only does the character seem to have issues with reality, but the reader is left guessing as to the certainty of many of the vingnettes that are loosly slapped together in this plodding, oftentimes aimless read. 

The story is not very gripping or believable. There are flash-in-the-pan moments where the author paints a comical scene in what reminds me of the incredulous, but believable style of Tom Robbins. On the other hand, the book tries desperately to take on this Tom Clancy seriousness that is totally unbelievable in view of its outrageous episodes. 

Perhaps I would have enjoyed  "Legends" had I read it more carefully. I read the book for pleasure and escape from a life of reading impossibly dull legal tomes. So mabye, had I approached the book with greater diligence and less expectations, it is possible that I would have enjoyed it.
