I've been an acne sufferer since I was 13 years old, and have been on every antibiotic, tried every topical medication in combination with those antibiotics, and have been on 3 courses of Accutane in the last 8 years.  My acne has never been extremely severe...but it has been quite resistant to most treatments.  I was really excited when I  bought this book and read the reviews, it sounded like it might really be the cure I'd been searching for all these years. The plan was a lot of work, especially at night with the ice packs, but I was willing to try anything. I followed the plan exactly as stated for 6 full weeks with little to no improvement.  That was my experience.
