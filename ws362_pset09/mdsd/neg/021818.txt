I was hoping to buy an Italian food cookbook.  What I got was a cookbook about Italian "inspired"  creations that he, the author, himself created. Mostly this book seems like a pat on his back for he mentions how everyone loves this or that dish every few pages....and he is proud because he made all the recipes himself!! Not authentic to me.  Hardly any recipe contains garlic and I feel forced to doctor the recipes in order to get any flavor.  My only hope for this book is that the deserts (I haven't tried one yet) makes up for the rest.

Review addition:

OK...so the Tiramasu was VERY good.  Bought Lady Fingers at Trader Joes just to save you the effort of looking in every grocer and not finding it like I did.
