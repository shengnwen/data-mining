I read through the 700 pages of this book, including the mathematics, hoping at some point that the Nobel Prize-winning Sen would have something to say about Rationality and Freedom. Alas! I was disappointed. About 500 pages are devoted to an almost entirely vacuous &quot;social choice theory&quot; and in particular Kenneth Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. I was thinking maybe that Sen was doing a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; and at the end, he would offer an alternative approach. Unfortunately not. The salaries of the thousands of academics who are paid to do this stuff should be collected and distributed to poor people in developing countries. A far better use of the money
