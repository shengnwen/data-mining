As someone who was absolutely blown away by 'Waiting' I anticipated loving this as well. I did read a pre-publication proof that I found used in a local bookstore, so maybe there were some big changes between the proof and the finished product, but I was very disappointed in this story. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are totally one-dimensional, and Jian, the narrator, is relatively uninteresting and one doesn't really care what becomes of him. Plus, while what happened to Professor Yang after the Revolution was horrible, i'm sure it happpened to many, many intellectuals, so it wasn't that out of the ordinary. Finally, and I don't know if this was in the final novel or not, there is a note from the author at the end thanking someone for 'seeing the potential for this when she first read it in 1988.' So, my fear is that this is one of those first novels that was rejected, and suddenly, when a writer has success (as with 'Waiting') their earlier work magically is worthy of publication. 

Overall, not a great novel, but an interesting view of pre-Tiannammen Square China, and Ha Jin is a good writer, and 'Waiting' was SO good that this wouldn't stop me from reading something else by him, but i'd pass on this one if I were you..
