Overly flowery and melodramatic language predominate in this novel about a dysfunctional family in South Carolina, yet the subject itself, physical and emotional abuse within the family, is poorly explored.  The characters are one-dimensional and inconsistent.  The plot is not very well developed with a number of gaping holes the reader is expected to believe will be understood later, a later that doesn't somehow come, while some preposterous situations are given many pages of romanticized nonsense to fill in the gaps.

I can't imagine where all the good reviews come from because I found this to be a boring and pointless read.  The dreadful ending just caps it all off.  A real waste of time
