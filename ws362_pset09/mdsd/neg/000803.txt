As a loyal and knowledgable fan of the band, I found that this book was  filled with untruths, and it seemed that it was not researched well. Much  of the information in the book is false, and there were also many  typographical errors. The author seemed to repeat herself many times, and I  didn't find that there was anything in the book that I didn't already know.  Maybe I just know too much about the band to appreciate such a shallow,  poorly researched book. I would recommend it to people who don't have a  clue about the band, with the warning not to believe everything that is  written in the book. For someone like me though, who has followed the band  for more than 6 years, I found the book to be of little value. I feel like  I could write a better book about the band than this author did
