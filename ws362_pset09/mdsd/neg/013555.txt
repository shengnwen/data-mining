yet another book written by fanciful feminists dreaming of some (wholly imaginary) matriarchal past.  The book is full of wild unsubstantiated statements.  They talk about goddesses of the paeleolithic era, a period of which there is nothing known about religious practices or beliefs, how could there be?  The carved images of women found may be goddesses, or they may not.  We don't know.  That doesn't stop these nutty women laying down the law on the subject though.  All the authors of these batty feminist sprituality books should be made to write out the following a hundred times &quot;WORSHIPPING GODDESSES DOES NOT MEAN A SOCIETY IS MATRIARCHAL&quot; .History is full of partiarcahl goddess-worhsippers, Egyptian, Greek and Roman society were full of goddesses, and they were totally male-domonated societies.  And if Christianity was such a terrible male-domonated religion compared to all those lovely goddess worhsipping religions, how come they got so many women converts?  Alos they are banging on about moon goddesses as per usual, sun goddesses not getting a mention, though there were plenty.  And these women are meant to be psychologists or something, aren't they?  They both seem to me to be in urgent need of psychoanalysis themselves
