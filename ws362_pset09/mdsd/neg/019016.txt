As brevity is the soul of wit, let me be brief.  First of all, I found reading this book to be an arduous task.  I feel the same way that Joseph Conrad did, namely, I saw no emotion in it. Let me take just one sentence out to illustrate: "...in order to distinguish in...Gilberte an indefinable quality analogous in the world of the emotions to what in the world of colours is called infra-red, my parents would have needed that supplementary sense with which love had temporarily endowed me."  I imagine that if I were to write this sentence, my writing instructor's red ink comments would be "Wordy, awkward, over intellectual".  Compare Proust's sentence with how John Steinbeck expressed the same sentiment: "Once, when I raptured in a violet glow given off by the Queen of the World, my father asked me why, and I thought he was crazy not to see. Of course I know now she was a mouse-haired, freckle-nosed, scabby-kneed little girl with a voice like a bat and the loving kindness of a gila monster, but then she lighted up the landscape and me". 

This pretty much sums up my reaction to this book.  I cannot recommend it to anyone, no matter how famous the book is and no matter if it won the Prix Goncourt, and no matter how intelligent Proust was, and no matter how many people say they wouldn't have wanted to go to their grave without having read it.  All I can say is, Read it, and see for yourself why you shouldn't read it (paraphrasing Samuel Goldwyn).
