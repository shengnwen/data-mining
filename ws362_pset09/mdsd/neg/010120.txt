As a later GAO investigation revealed, Senator Roth's 1997 hearings on the IRS were a farce.  The witnesses' stories of abuse were exaggerated at best, falsified with the connivance of the Senator and his commitee staff, at worst.

Its all bull - pandering to marginal and disaffected losers who wear aluminum foil inside their hats.  Thankfully, the good citizens of Delware voted the rascal out in 1999, sending him and his horrible toupee back to the obscurity to which he so deservedly belongs
