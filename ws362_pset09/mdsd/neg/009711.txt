Now, I love to read. It's extremely RARE for me to pick up a book and not finish it. I'm not a picky reader, either. I like just about anything that I get my hands on. But this book--this book was an exception.

It's not so much of the cute cover (I really liked it) or the initial plot of the book. It's the bland writing and how unrealistic everything is. I only got through about half of the book, but I had to put it down. The way the writers (it's two people using one pseudonym) wrote the story, it had me thinking about other things. I had to go back and reread passages because even though I had "read" them, my mind had wandered. 

I'm all one for romance, and I have read a lot of these types of books. But Cy and Morgan's romance... it just happened out of nowhere. There was no build up. Also, I felt the characters lacked any dimension whatsoever and the whole book had me feeling like, "So what?"

A book is only good if it makes its readers care, one way or another. And I honestly didn't care. Which is why I gave this book 1 star
