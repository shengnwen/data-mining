I heard the author on the radio recently, and he came off as a total ignoramus. He subscribes to the belief that seems to be popular amongst conservatives these days that any lame-brained crackpot with an axe to grind should be taken seriously when it comes to science. During his interview, he spent most of his time evading the questions directed at him and distancing himself from the inflammatory BS printed all over the dust jacket of his book (of the "this book is the antidote to the evil liberal conspiracy" variety), prompting one of the other guests on the program to ask him if he was at war with his publisher. He apparently supports every looney conservative-backed pseudoscience you can imagine, including AIDS denial, "intelligent design," global warming skepticism, and a misunderstanding of hormesis that seems to equate it with homeopathy. I was not surprised to find that this book was published by Regnery, well known as a factory for right wing garbage.

 We live in a time when proper understanding of scientific issues has never been more important, and yet our political leaders and the people who vote them into office are woefully uninformed and confused when it comes to science. A book like this only compounds the problem. Bethell and Regnery should be ashamed of putting out deliberate misinformation to turn a quick buck
