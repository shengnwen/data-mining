Ho hum--I will never get my 5th grader to read this tome--however moving the story line and imagery.  It is too thick to easily add to a history block of Ancient Civilizations around the world.  The language is too dated.  The narrations dwarfs the action.  Children today (and writers for children are directed to SHOW the meaning and NOT TELL IT.)  
Thankfully, author Geraldine McCaughrean wrote a wonderfully telling of GILGAMESH, so I turned around and ordered her retelling of ODYSSEUS.  

Does anyone want my copy of Padric's version.  The cover art is great.
