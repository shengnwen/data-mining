First let's talk about the positives:
It talks about male-bashing, which I don't agree with either
she encourages mmore affection on the woman's part....those who are inconsiderate of their husband's feelings
It has some "romantic" (on first glance) views of husbands...how sweet

Now let's get down to why you should buy this book:

Buy this book if you don't mind having sex with your husband even though you're "not in the mood" Look, maybe there are times when BOTH of you guys can work stuff out and make things more enticing for both of you when one is not "in the mood"...but HELLO....she's encouraging all WOMEN to deny their feelings no matter what to please 'her man'

buy this book if you think most men are heros, willing to do anything for their wives, and wives should understand this...and cater to their men because it's their "duty"

Buy this book if you think the feminist movement screwed women over...why? Because it encouraged them to be more independent, free to do whatever the you-know-what they really want to do (i.e. careers, etc.), make money, and to not give in to all gender stereotypes imposed on females by society. 

Buy this book if you think woman have a certain "status" to be lady-like: while it's acceptable for men, Dr. Laura thinks woman should not display rudeness (hmm, I suppose it's never ok for a female to be "rude"? I can think of a few situations where speaking up for something can be construed as "being rude"), smoke, act vulgar, or be promiscuous. Of course, it's the women that will encourage their men to be the same way. 

Buy this book if you agree that you can either have a family and be a "homemaker" or have a career...not both, no compromise.

Buy this book if you're gay and have decided to become straight and live a good, wholesome married life
