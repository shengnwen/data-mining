I read THE BEANS OF EGYPT, MAINE many years ago because it was gathering such brilliant praise.  It is an appalling book.  It is pornographic, disjointed, depressing and very, very weird.  It reads like the drivel that comes out of women's writing classes which is supposed to be so profound but is mearly the meanderings of a mind steeped in Harlequin trash.  It was written most probably on a filthy kitchen table while a pile of dishes fermented in the sink and a baby sitting in a high chair screamed his head off.  

This book is not fit for the compost heap
