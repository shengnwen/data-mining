This book is very vague. I found the main characteristic of Prof. Tanenbaum's book is that he likes to use abstract algebra to deliver his example. For example, in chapter 1 he talks about Languages, Levels and VM. He uses L0, L1, L2 to represent languages and M0, M1, M2 to represent virtual machine. For people already have prior knowledge of programming such as C, Java, when they read this they could easily reference to something they have already studied, but for me I still can not relate them very well. In contrast, in Randal E. Bryany & David O'Hallaron's book, the beginning of book gives out a concrete example: the C programming Language. I found the latter always work better even after took the architecture course two years later.

My point is for people who want to have clear idea of real world, you should pick another book. This book might be suitable for architecture theory(hopefully).
