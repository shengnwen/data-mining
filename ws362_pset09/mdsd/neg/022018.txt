I have been reading this book out loud to my BF, who now worships Dr. Gray as it should be titled, "Why women should give men sex all the time". 

Dr. Gray actually lists why we should give our man a quickie when we really don't want to, don't have time or are tired. He even says we should give a hand job when we have a bad headache!!! Men, if your woman has a headache, run her a warm bubble bath, light some candles, give her a massage and you'll increase your chances of getting some! 

He also states that at certain times of the month many women don't feel the need to have an orgasm. I know LOTS of women and none of them will tell you orgasms are not important! Yes, sometime I will give my man a quickie and not worry about my orgasm, but that is totally up to me, NOT DR. GRAY.

He also states it's ok to look at other women in front of us as long as our men tell us they love us. Gee, not enough beautiful women on TV, billboards and magazines to look at when we're not around? I don't drool over other men when my man is around because I RESPECT him. If more couples respected each other they would have less trouble.

He has some good tips like men need to spend more time on foreplay, complimenting your woman, but I am on page 88 out of 206 and it has been overwhelmingly biased toward giving men what they want all the time and apparently at all costs
