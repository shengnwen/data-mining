Clearly written for students, this book is pedantic and condescending in tone, starting from the author's note that the books is "an attempt to communicate to the educated reader" some basic knowledge of antiquity.  As an educated reader with degrees in zoology, anthropology and medicine, I found his whirlwind tour through 2.5 million years to be contamtinated with editorial comments, clear bias and several factual errors.  Unless you are a very young educated reader who is ready to be led down this very personal path of historical opinion, skip this tome
