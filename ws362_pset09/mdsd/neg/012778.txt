I was somewhat disappointed with this book.  It is perhaps because the book got such good ratings, I was expecting much more than it delivered.  I am no expert on the waste industry but I didn't learn much more about it than what I already learned while watching a 20 minute segment on one of those news magazine shows years earlier.  If you're interested in learning the nitty-gritty details behind the trash industry, you might want to read this book.  However, if you already have a basic knowledge of what happends to trash once it leaves your front step, you might want to forgo reading this book.
