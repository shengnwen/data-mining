First of all, who says George had "sad eyes"? I received this book as a gift from my Mom, who knows I love the Beatles, but knows next to nothing about the Beatles themselves. Still, she probably knows more than the author of this awful book, which was obviously written for no other reason than to exploit. Save your money. You can learn more about George Harrison by simply listening to his music and reading his lyrics
