This book is a big disappointment.  The cover brags that the book contains &quot;15,000 entries - more listings than any other guide!&quot;  What the cover doesn't tell you is that for hundreds of these listings, the counts  of sugar and fiber are listed as &quot;data not available.&quot;  I'm not  talking about exotic foods here; there are missing entries for basics like  apples and bananas.  I am surprised and disappointed that the authors and  the publisher would market such a sloppy and incomplete book.  With so much  missing information, even for many basic foods, I have found this book to  be nearly useless and quite frustrating.  I plan to return this book for a  refund.  Save your money on this one
