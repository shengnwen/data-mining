Having just read the John Hammond bio that I purchased at the same time, I was not as impressed with this book. Even though I am familiar with many of the artists, it just didn't hold my interest that well. The author did seem to know his material, though. I just saw Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young again this summer. I wonder how they feel about each other now with so much gone on in decades before! It's a wonder more of these people didn't die of drug overdoses or std's! If you want an uplifting experience, this isn't for you
