This is one of the worst strategy guides Prima has put out in recent memory.  The book offers no insight into the different races and does not even aknowledge the unique units produced by the Vinci.  There are no tables, no charts, and no tips.  No multiplayer tips.  You would be better off going onto the website.  Don't waste your money
