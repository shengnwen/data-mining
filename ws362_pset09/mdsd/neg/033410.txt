It was hard to like this book when the heroine was such a complete buffoon.

Clare decides the murder attempt was meant for her friend for no apparent reason. She decides the police are incompetent and unwilling to see her point of view before they even arrive on the scene. She then proceeds to investigate on her own, doing idiotic things like swimming out to an unlighted boat by herself at night to follow the person she thinks might be the murderer and breaking into someone's house because she's nosy. The whole thing was just so unbelievable and stupid that it made it hard to even care.

I hope the next installment is better.
