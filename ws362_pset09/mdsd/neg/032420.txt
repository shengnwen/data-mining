Overall, I would say this book was pretty boring.  I like books that have more dialogue and action than description and details.  The one thing this book had plenty of was description and details.  It seemed like Lahiri gave way too much background information and didn't tell enough about the actual story as it pertained to Gogol.  I was really looking forward to reading this book because the movie preview made the movie seem pretty good.  I have a feeling this would still be a good movie, but just not a very good book.  If you don't want to be very entertained and enthused, then read this book.  Otherwise, I would choose something with more action and entertainment
