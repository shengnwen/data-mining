I bought this book hoping for insight into "why most things fail."  What I got was a rambling argument grounded primarily on the similarity of the frequency distributions of business failure and biological failures (extinctions).  Frankly, the relationship hardly strikes me as logically necessary, and the relation could well be spurious (or coincidental).  But I'm no PhD and didn't give it a lot of thought, so I could well be wrong.  

What I am certain of is that the book offered little else, no corrolaries, certainly no explanation of the reasons "why most things fail," and no other practical insights or knowledge.

Bottom line, wait for the book's appearance in the discount bin before buying
