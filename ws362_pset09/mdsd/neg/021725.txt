Rosemary Wells' book entitled Felix Feels Better is one of our family's new favorites.  I went to the book store seeking out more of her books.  I thumbed through this one and thought it looked really cute so I bought it.  It wasn't until I got home that I read the phrase, "Nora!" said her sister, "Why are you so dumb?" repeated several times in the book.  Name calling of any kind is not practiced in our house and I was disappointed to find this in the book.  This is also not a book that my son's teacher would read in class for the same reason.  I will be returning it to the book store.  Very disappointing
