In this fine work of literature, Mr. Manovich illustrates that he can talk a lot about computers, even though he doesn't know anything about them.  He makes a plethora of fallacious statements, such as when he argues that all digital media must be discrete and contain only discrete objects, neglecting one can define a continuous geometry using discrete coefficients.  If his statment were true, there'd be no way to draw a circle in Adobe Illustrator, but I know I've done that before!  Read this book if you don't know what a computer is and won't mind misinformation presented to prove points that are stupid and worthless anyway
