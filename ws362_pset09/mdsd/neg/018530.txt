After reading "The Kite Runner" - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship, loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in Afghanistan during the Russian war and the Taliban rule, I set out expecting more of the same from the Swallows of Kabul.  The latter was quite disapointing.  

The Swallows of Kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence, cruelty and desolation of their surroundings.  The dismal context of this story is properly set up.  Enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the Taliban and the desperation of the Afghan people is clearly communicated. Unfortunately, the novel reads like a short story.  Proper character development is not established, so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits.  

The novel is successful in  painting a truly depressing picture of Afghanistan, making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place.  But if you're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances, then I wouldn't recommend this book for you.  I was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down
