The book came as described in excellent shape and arrived quickly.
 I hate the book though. The rhymes are not very good. Just a few variations of words but nothing to really jump rump for a long period of time to. I was hoping for some of the playground rhymes I can't remember from childhood. It seemed like somebody just wrote down some words that sorta rhymed but had no reason.
