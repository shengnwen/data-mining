I thought this book was very poorly written and leaves much to be desired.  There are few details that I found enlightening and enjoyable.  I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking a true glimpse of this region. For the true adventurers, do not buy this book, save your money.  For those wanting to learn more about the region, I am sure there are better books out there that will better prepare you for a visit
