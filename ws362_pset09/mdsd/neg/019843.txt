The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.
