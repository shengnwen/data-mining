Sorry to disagree with the enthusiastic publishers and some readers, but I found Fox Evil an utter bore, with little action, long-winded conversation that doesn't move the story forward, and characters for whom I felt little interest. Walters also knows little about police investigative techniques, judging by the interviews that various officers conduct. Sadly, I've been unable to complete Walters last two books, also boring and with unsympathetic characters. She has been a disappointment for me, for I really enjoyed her earlier works, The Ice House, The Scupltress, and the Scold's Bridle. I also find her injection of news items, letters, police reports, etc., as shortcuts to explalining certain plot action. Either describe it succinctly as possible or let the characters do it. I'm not holding my breath for Walters nexr opus
