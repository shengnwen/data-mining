I bought the audio book and I didn't like the way the woman read the material.  Her voice was sappy and affected which was a real turn off for me.  I felt the examples used in the book didn't quite capture a wide enough variety of woman.  I actually came away feeling worse about "midlife crisis" which was not my purpose in purchasing the book. It was typical of the material out there already.  Nothing fresh or new.  For example, "the gardener" was one of the categories of women in mid-life crisis. Cut me a break!  That is the old stereotype of a middle aged woman.  There weren't enough modern references
