I'm shocked at the possibility that anyone could consider this book to be objective!  Allow me to summarize Paul's entire text: all men who use pornography are destined to be single and unsuccessful; most men do use pornography in secret and are unable to control themselves; no women really use pornography, they just say they do to look cool.
I'm not saying pornography is a societal good, nor do I disagree with her subtitle.  In fact, the few moments she engages with with the as-yet-unknown effects of unlimited internet access on present teens are quite good.  
Sadly, she is unable to objectively handle this threat, and instead stands on her soapbox and decries the entire male sex via perceived pornography usage.  Even her statistical polls are useless when she interprets the data according to the falsehoods she suspects are being submitted in that format.
The issue overall is engaging, but I'm sure there are better books out there that can handle such controversial material without showing the author's hand and letting the reader know on which side of the argument they fall
