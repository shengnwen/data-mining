this book is too complicated for a beginner and is very messy. the pictures are terrible and have them posted a page after the explanation on the flash technique. i don't know how this person is a photog. she's far from one, you can see it from her pics. she shoots 60% of her images with a 20mm and 28mm lens using old flashes. the pictures come out terrible, distorted and badly lit pictures. they either are lit too much so you see the foreground blown out and the background dark or the picture looks nothing like what her technique explained. most aren't lit properly and all the portrait shots are overly flashed, and their face are super distrorted because the use of the wide angle lenses.who uses wide angle lenses for portraits??!! you can tell she cropped some of the pics that were used with a wide angle lens.i'd crop them to if they looked like hers did. she shows usage of 3 vivitar flashes and an umbrella for use in studio work. uh, excuse me..if i have money to buy 3 vivitar flashes i certainly have money for a studio strobe. they can even cost less that all of the 3 flashes considering the hardware needed to mount them all. all in all this book is very cluttered, and unprofessional. i'd think twice. i'd also like add there's no contact info in her book and on this website. i wouldn't leave contact info if i put out such a book
