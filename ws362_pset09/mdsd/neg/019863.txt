A glorified attempt that falls way short of the mark. Boring design. It looks like a kid slapped this together in a photo album bought at Thrifty. Some of the color photos are good but I didn't get the feel of the intensity that goes hand in hand with this art form. Also, too many photos of smiling graffiti kids posing for the camera. If you like cheap exploitation at its best then buy this book
