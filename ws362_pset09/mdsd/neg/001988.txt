A highly informative book about viruses, how and why they are spread, in some cases their epidemiology and much about their evolution. Thankfully, very little is given over to speculation here, at least as compared to other books I've read on the subject.  The information in this book is offered in a completely straightforward (and sometimes very boring) way.  You will learn some fascinating new facts, but not have to suffer through scare tactics, just a yawn or two. The book put me to sleep a few times, but was still worth the read. The book contains some interesting viral history and global implications to ponder as well. No entertainment here though, it's just the facts
