Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious.  Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book.  I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was "forced" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug.  This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't.   I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so.  Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any.
