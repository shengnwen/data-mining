I was so excited to read this book that I actually waitlisted myself at my university's bookstore.  What a let down. Perhaps after the Rushdies and the Roys and all the other highly literate Indian authors I've just discovered, my hopes were just too high.  Shiva Dancing, had a wonderful title, and that is the best thing I have to say about it.  The romance (and I normally adore romances) was tiresome, the main character was a little too fond of her red sari, and had little to no respect for, or even knowledge of, India or Indian culture.  Perhaps Ms. Kirchner should stick to the kitchen
