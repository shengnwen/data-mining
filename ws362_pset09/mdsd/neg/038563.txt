"The Jason Strain" has the same problem that "Hell Lake" (Another Friday the 13th book from Black Flame)had.  The back cover sounds great, but the book falls short.  At least "Hell Lake" did stay with the idea pitched on the back cover.  "The Jason Strain" does not!
 The idea sounds like a 'can't miss'-A new reality show puts convicts on a island.  The last one alive gets their death sentence turned to life in prison.  What the convicts don't know, is that Jason is also on the island, and of course Jason could care less about TV shows, rules, cameras....
 I was patient with the book well over 100 pages into it.  I was fine with meeting all the characters, even though at this point Jason had just made a few cameos in the book.  I was counting on the story picking up when the convicts get on the island and face Jason.  
 But the book chooses to take off with another plot that I could have done without.  It's too bad, bacause "Jason on Survivor" could have been cool.
 But like other posters have written, this book wants to throw every plot idea in but the kitchen sink.  And I agree, that this story didn't need Jason in it at all.  He is a wasted after thought.  Too bad.
 I do enjoy the "Jason X" Books, and the "Nightmare on Elm Street" set as well.  So far though, the "Friday" books have been a mixed bag.  "Church of the divine psychopath" was the best.  "Hell Lake" tried, but was hard to get through-but at leasr Jason IS in that book!!!!  I skipped "Hate Kill Repeat", to read this one first.  Bad idea on my part.
 The next book sounds good-Jason's mother is back!  Will this idea be wasted as well?  We'll find out.
