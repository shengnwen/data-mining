I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one
