Our church book study group mistakenly purchased this Bad Girls of the Bible instead of the one by the other author.

While I had great difficulty getting through the first chapter, I am now using this book to improve my understanding of the Bible, and to learn more about ancient times.  

This writer makes-up her own story lines, and conveniently leaves out portions of chapters and verses that do not fit her story line.  For example, in chapter two, she states that Egypt where Joseph is held as a slave by Potiphar, is a dry hot land.  Perhaps she should read just a little earlier in the Bible. In Genesis 13:10, we are told different.
10 Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar.

While the ordering of this book was a mistake on the part of the person who ordered the books for us, I believe it is a Godsend for us to read and discuss this book, though I doubt we will actually be using the questions at the end of each chapter.  Instead we will ask questions regarding her inaccurate portrayal of these women and the facts of history.
