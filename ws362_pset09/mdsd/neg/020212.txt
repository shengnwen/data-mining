Theologically, this book was out of date for me, focusing too much on just "Christian worship" without considering the growing awareness of cultural influences from other religious sources.  It was also too evangelical for me, preferring a much more unitarian approach.  It will work for some, but if people begin asking deeper questions about our historical resources, it will come up short.
