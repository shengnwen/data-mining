I didn't expect the novel of the year when I purchased this book, but I expected a decent, frivolous book with a couple of entertaining storylines.  Instead, I was privy to short stories which once they grabbed your attention, they abruptly ended and a new story began.  The first story was entertaining and the subsequent stories were terrible.  I couldn't even finish the book. Just don't bother with this book.  Save your money for something else
