Agent: 	You took the first advance and went to Egypt.
DE:      	Yeah, I felt the need to ride a horse.
Agent: 	And then you changed publishers and took their advance and went to Costa Rica.                                                 
DE:      	Yeah, I felt the need to surf.
Agent: 	Dave, it's not like "The Producers";  you can't sell "The Next Big-One" to   		two	different houses, at  least not more than once. 
DE:      	Well, they offered.   I'll do better next time.
Agent: 	Do you have anything, anything at all lined up? 
DE:      	There is a box of stuff that I wrote in high school, my Mom's got it in her garage, I think. 		
Agent:  	Enough  for 200 pages or so, with large font, big titles, and huge headers?                  
DE:	  	Easy, yeah, no sweat. It's just pretentious, sophomoric, overwrought, and 		conceited;  Did I  mention self- referential? Or trite? 
Agent: 	Perfect!  Send it over.
DE:	 	But we'll need a whole new layer of quote whores for the front and back 		covers.
Agent:  	And since when has that ever been a problem?  The academics are cheap, 		and the SF Chron will  print anything we send 'em for free. 
DE:	 	Do ya'  think that the readers will think any less of me for tossing up such 		trash?
Agent:	Nah, They won't figure it out till after they have paid.
DE: 		God, I love this business.
