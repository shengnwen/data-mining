So we have this book in our house because my fiance is a veterinarian, and so everyone gives us dog and cat books.  I picked this book up for the first time during a late-night power outage, and I've got to say, the pictures in this book had me laughing and smiling, but the text had me pulling my hair out.  Sure, all dog owners put words into their dogs mouths, but most of Mr. Blount's are painfully irritating.  First off, if dogs are going to be poets (which I don't really get), they ought to at least rhyme, not just ALMOST rhyme.  Furball and terrible?  Blount too often struggles to to be poignant (though the bulldog with the stick is right on) and ends up missing the mark.  Valerie Shaff has captured the essence of what makes dogs special in her pictures, but the messages conveyed by these wonderful images are cheapened by Blount's poor poetry.  I've got "I am puppy, hear me yap" on the shelf, and I'll bring it out during the next power outage.  Hopefully Blount spent more than 10 minutes on the text for this book..
