I remember liking this book as a child and I thought I could get this book for my daughter.  The board book has been so abridged that it lacks a lot of things that I thought were funny.  AND what about that "climatic ending" where the apples all topple - Not there! I wouldn't even recognize the wording in the board book as Dr. Suess's
