i purchased this book based on the good reviews it got and was completely disappointed! the heroine is annoying, her vampire is dull - i stopped reading half way because it kept putting me to sleep, literally!

if katie macalister was going for fun romp, she needs to take some lessons from mary janice davidson - 'undead and unwed' or 'undead and unemployed'. even linsay sands does a better job in 'single white vampire', 'love bites' and 'tall dark & hungry'.

or, for a more dark read, try emma holly in 'catching midnight' and 'hunting midnight. i enjoyed these most of all. hope this helps
