I had to see the movie for some odd reason. I agree with the last review on many points. The film makes it sound like the Jewish people were the sole inventors of film. It is horribly cliched, and makes etremely odd, partial points, like that "My Fair Lady" is an example of the jews trying to fit in. It plays out like a script written by the moguls themselves. Waste of time
