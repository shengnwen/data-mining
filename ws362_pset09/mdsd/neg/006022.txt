After I rescued 2 beta fish from very poor conditions, I needed some really good information on their care. I did not find it in this book. It has a couple paragraphs about diseases, absolutely no charts or diagrams for biology or anything, and while the pictures were really beautiful, they had nothing to do with the topic on the same pages. There is a lot about how to have beta fights, and speaks of it in a very condoning tone! This is quite cruel and inhumane. There is I grant you some decent very basic info that you could glean off the internet yourself in an hour or two
