The American Civil War should have been named Robert E. Lee's Civil War. 85% of the books attention is paid to Lee's character, Lee's battles, Lee's brilliance, Lee's nobility, Lee's wisdom.  At the end of the War Churchill  rightly criticizes Lee for his faulty generalship in sending thousands to  die in frontal assaults when the war was clearly lost, but his fixation on  Lee still borders on worship.  There were other things going on in the War,  like the War in the West, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Atlanta campaign, March  to the Sea, etc., but Churchill concludes these events did not require any  full discussion.  Either Winston had a deadline to meet and was out of time  or he displays a surprising lack of knowledge by leaving out at least half  of the Civil War.  But of course if you are a Lee fan, then you'll love  this one
