Andy Grove helped to build Intel into the behemoth it has become. On the other hand, he didn't sell IBM on the X86 which was the critical moment nor resolve all the manufacturing processes they had in different fabs (Craig B's watch did that).

This is a relatively short book and could be a lot shorter.  Inflection points... yeah, I get it. Now, please move on Andy.

If you are a high-tech sales or marketing executive and read books like this and are awed by them, you are the probably not the sharpest tool in the drawer
