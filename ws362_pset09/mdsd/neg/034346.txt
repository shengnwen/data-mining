Okay so to start off. This book has a really annoying way of tell the story. It starts off with this woman being stuck in a library (which doesn't really add anything to the book)and then delves into the story of this man she used to love and guess what they love each other again (big surprise). Basically the book is really boring for the first 200 pages then it gets marginally better towards the end but ruins the ending because the thing that the characters spend all this time looking for is insignificant and also they throw in this stupid "poem" by one of the characters which is about 20 pages long. You could have just skipped those pages and the story would have been exactly the same. Very disappointed
