A grotesque soap opera. Whatever Marquez's style of writing is, this book is beyond me. I found NOTHING special about the book. Florentino Ariza falls in love with Fermina Daza when he is in his teens but she marries somebody else. The book talks about his "passionate" love while he waits for her husband to die, which does happen in 50 years.

In the meantime, he has an infinite number of liasons which Marquez takes great pains to elaborate. The book is without any style or substance and is a disgrace to marriage and love specifically and humanity in general
