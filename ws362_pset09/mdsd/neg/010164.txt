I used to laugh at Bush's verbal gaffes too, but seldom is the question asked, is there something wrong with the man? Has he fallen off the wagon? Is his brain fried? Mine would be if I kept up the party-boy lifestyle I had as a college undergrad until I was 40. Think about it, wouldn't your brain be toast too after decades of alcohol and possibly cannibus and poppi abuse? Consider, in the August 2004 timeframe alone, Bush: &#62; stammered some hysterically incomprehensible gibberish about tribal sovereignty to a group of native american journalists. Though it doesn't make for a good Bushism &#34;sound byte&#34; his incomprehensible, rambling, ad hoc answer was funny (there's a Quicktime video of this on the web...) Until you realize how remarkabley unprepared he was. His reply to a straightforward soft ball question also was offensive to native americans, who can actually be heard gasping in the background when his answer implied that native americans were &#34;given&#34; their sovereignty by the US government. &#62; Actually, really, said, &#34;Our enemies will never stop seeking ways to harm our country and its people, AND NEITHER WILL WE!&#34; durning a press conference where he signed a $400 billion plus dollar military appropriation. Doh! &#62; Last but not least, made a mega-freudian-faux pax on the campaing trail in front of thousands when he said something to the effect that... &#34;we must not stop OB/GYN doctors from spreading their love of woman across the country.&#34; HA-HA-Huh?! Bear in mind, these &#62;all occured around a one month period&#60;! Also consider that these gaffes come from professionally prepared, written speeches in most cases! All's he has to do is read off a frigg'n sheet of paper! Now, even if Bush was articulate there's a thousand reasons why I wouldn't vote for him. In fact, this will be the first presidential election I absolutely plan to vote in, I embarrassingly admit, ever! This administration has been an unmitigated disaster for this country. However, making its way up the &#34;reasons against&#34; column in terms of relative importance is the concern about the man's mental stability, and past substance abuse issues, as evident in these all too frequent &#34;Bushisms&#34;. Is the guy mentally fit to be the leader of the free world? It's not like the list of Bushisms is half-a-dozen. There's enough material here, literally, for a book! These so-called &#34;Bushisms&#34; are symptomatic of far greater problems, at least to me, at this point. In fact, they explain a lot
