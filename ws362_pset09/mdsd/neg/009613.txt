This book is harder to digest than the Silmarillion. I received it in school along with some fellow students and we unanimously agreed that it was tripe. Perhaps a very experienced software engineer would be able to benefit from it but at the junior level we were at when we received it we found it magnificently boring. I think I tried reading it about three times and never got past page four. It's both boring beyond comprehension and confusing beyond comprehension. The only thing I comprehended about it was that it was the worst book I've ever attempted to read. Ever. If you are not particularly versed in modeling software systems and are looking for an introduction to it, such as UML, do not buy this book. Consider this a warning
