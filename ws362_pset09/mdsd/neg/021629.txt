While the essays in this book were supposed to lay a basis for Intelligent Design, they instead dance around several obvious flaws in their logic.  First, Dembski is a mathematician and mathematics is not a science (though very useful for scientists) because in math, things are true because their logic is sound.  But in science, things are true because the evidence backs them up.  This is the reason mathematicians can talk about n-dimensional spaces and physicists shrug off such talk.  Dembski's essay only includes examples of man-made objects... he never has a natural example.
Second, the essays never quite nail down the definition of complexity.  And you will never get your foot in the door of Science if you can't nail down a definition.
If you want to read what they have to say, you don't need to buy this book.  A quick google search can get you the essentials of these essays for free
