I read this book anticipating an honest and unbiased treatment of an important and tragic event in Utah and Mormon history.  However, I was greatly disappointed instead by the biased voice of the author reflected throughout the book, which in numerous instances were unsubstantiated by questionable and unsupported evidences. I frequently examined the end notes supporting the quotes as I read, and found the author's sources were taken from the conclusions drawn by other authors, not direct sources. Many times the author gave quotes without any documentation whatsoever.  It was difficult to find additional light and knowledge on this subject when the author's bias was so plainly manifested in his writings.  It appeared that Bagley's ulterior motive was to negate the veracity of Brigham Young and the leaders of the LDS Church down to the current church President, Gordon B. Hinckley.  In my opinion, this book has little merit for a scholarly study. In other words, let's put it this way: Juanita Brooks -- You're still Number #1!
