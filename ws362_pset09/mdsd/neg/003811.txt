After seeing Field of Dreams, I was excited to get the book and fill in the holes of the story and figure out what was left out of the movie. But you know what? It didn't happen? Why? Because the movie is only vaguely "based on" this book. For good reason, too. The book is terrible. As in poorly written, mostly boring, and largely kinda dumb.

I don't know who the Field of Dreams screenwriter is, but Kinsella should be on his knees kissing the guy's (or girl's) feet every morning. He turned this largely unreadable mess of a novel into a moving, funny, classic movie. 

One example? In the movie, the revelation that the main character is REALLY building the field for his father doesn't come until right at the end, setting up an improbably emotional moment--even for most men who've seen the film. In the book, it's on about page 10. Shoeless Joe appearing is practically an aside--even though it's the dang title of the book!

Don't waste your time reading this book...and definitely don't waste the money. If you've ever seen Field of Dreams, it will only taint the movie experience for you
