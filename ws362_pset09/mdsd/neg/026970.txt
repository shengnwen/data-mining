I began this book as a big fan of Erin Gruwell. I loved her spontaneity and creativity in the most difficult of classrooms, with the most challenging students. However, as I read, I discovered that she kept the same students for four years, and even encouraged them to seek her help beyond high school! What happened to teachers preparing students to survive and excel on their own? But even then, I was willing to give her a break. After all, these WERE the most challenging students and no one else really wanted to teach them, despite more senior teachers throwing their weight around strictly on principle.
But then I continued reading and learned that the author got out of teaching entirely within (I'm making an educated guess here) five or six years, four of which she spent with the same 150 students. Now she's a speaker. At that point, I quit reading. Yes, her sacrifices and successes were impressive, but if all teachers were to burn themselves out or move out of the classroom after such a short period, where would that leave our students? What about the upcoming classes of difficult students? They simply miss out, I guess. That's not what teaching's about. 
Sorry, Erin, but you have to stick with teaching for most teachers who read your book to truly admire you. Replicate your successes year after year, with different students, instead of with the same ones who get to know you and your methods. Then I'll be glad to give you the credit your undeniable teaching talents deserve
