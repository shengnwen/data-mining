It never ceases to amaze me how conservatives prefer a brief read to something written in depth.  Perhaps some things are much too challenging for narrow minds.  I couldn't help but read some of the reviews, and I can never understand how conservatives can say liberals always have to revert to name-calling and using the word "stupid", and yet they constantly pepper what they say with insults themselves.  Typical.  I used to respect anyone's opinion, and I still try to, but when people clearly ignore facts and cling to their biases, without considering what they can see or use common sense, I have to call a spade a spade.  This book is funny only to those who find drivel funny.  It's not even well-written.
