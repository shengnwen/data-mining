The information presented in this book is amazing.  The economics of baseball are hardly talked about.  There are some things that go on behind the scenes that most of us don't know about.  It was fascinating to find out about this, but it got to be too much for me to handle.  I ended up being bored with it in the end and that is why I gave it two stars.  I also disagree with some of Zimbalist's theories on how to reform baseball.  He is not open to any other ways, and I should know since I met him once for a seminar
