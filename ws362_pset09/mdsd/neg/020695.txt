The book starts fantasticly, but then as I went along I grow tired by the long jurney, no humor at all, and especialy by exageration with the fact that Thomas is a leper - in every other line you can find something like &quot;... he knew that feeling all to well for he was a LEPER...&quot;, and another thing - every little thing and action is to important and grand. I just lost interest and excitement from the first 200 pages. I don't know, maybe I wasn't in the right mood, or I had too great expectations, but I'll take Feist, Guy Gavriel Kay, Eddings, especialy Eddings over Donaldson any day
