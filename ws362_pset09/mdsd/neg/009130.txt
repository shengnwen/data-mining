At first this book touched me deeply and got me hoping, but it became quickly clear that the author, with his mediocre storytelling ability, narrow Catholic perspective, and lack of emotional penetration, couldn't handle the intensity of his main character.  Although I was pulled in by the wild Mr. Blue, whose positivity, courage, simplicity, and rejection of all things conventional are quite above the average, he failed to develop as a character and instead grew dissociated and saccharine - like Jesus with all of the peace and none of the sword.  

Our world doesn't need another self-sacrificing martyr who has no deep point of view beyond finding joyous pleasure in starving himself to death amid the world's most broken souls.  Anyone who thinks that's what Jesus is about is missing the depth of his spiritual message.  My personal opinion is that the real Jesus would label Mr. Blue mentally ill.

But that said, I still commend Myles Connelly for at least attempting to share his deeper point of view.  Few people nowadays are willing to step out of the herd enough to take that risk
