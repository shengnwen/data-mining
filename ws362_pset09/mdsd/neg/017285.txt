It's all well and good for people to be researching this subject.  As an 'abductee' (that word just doesn't do it justice), my first thought when I heard Mack had finished his book was &quot;It's about damn time a major  figure got into the field&quot;.  But then I got really ticked-off when I  heard about his past life regression and other new-age consciousness  theories.  I read the book and was appalled that someone of his collegiate  stature would be lured-in by this contactee bull dung.  Sure enough, months  go by and his contactees start admitting they made the stuff up.  OF COURSE  THEY DID!  Anyone who thinks the...'things' act with ethical benevolence is  either lying or delusional.  The truth is bitter and unpleasant.  Want to  know what kind of crud goes on?  Read David Jacobs' &quot;Secret  Life&quot;.  I'll personally vouch for it
