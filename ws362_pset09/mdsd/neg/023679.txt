Did you ever see the hype some movies generate and go expecting a blockbuster but end up leaving the theater disappointed and let down? That's pretty much how I felt after reading TVparty. I really wanted to like the book and tried my best to see the silver lining in the cloud, but the more I read and looked, the darker the cloud became. The book is a gigantic joke filled with tidbits of old stories unrelated to the topic at hand...television. If you are looking for a genuine book regarding television, try Joe Garner's "Stay Tuned". Not only is his book heads and shoulders above TVparty, it has an excellent DVD/CD combo with excerpts of landmark television episodes which is a far cry from the cheap and scant content of the TVparty CD, which is, in a word, a scam. It's very rare that I buy a book so terrible, but TVparty suckered me. My fault. I should have believed the other reviews. Oh, well. I can always use the book as a doorstop
