One of those few books that one can say the movie was much more livelier.  In the book we never know whether Fast Eddie pays Bert the money that he wins in the final game and of course Sarah does not go with Bert and Eddie to Lexington. On the whole it was a lifeless novel. It seems the reputation of Tevis is based more on the success and acting of Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason , Piper Lori as well as the direction of Robert Rossen than anything that he wrote. I was not impressed by his writing. I loved the movie
