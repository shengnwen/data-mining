I had to read this book for a college course, sorry to say.  Otherwise, trust me, I wouldn't have gotten through this entire mess.  The authors have about three common sense points to make and take about 100 pages to  make each of those points.  I'd like to know what qualifies them to write  this book anyways.  Bottom line is it's a complete waste of time
