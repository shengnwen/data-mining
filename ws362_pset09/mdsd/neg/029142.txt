Schaeffer's work, Escape From Reason, leaves much to be desired in the way of 'penetrating' thought. Quite honestly, he doesn't leave room for thought of any kind. 
This book reads like the Christian version of &#34;Final Exit,&#34; reeking of the nihilistic determinism of death, though in the first half of the book, he blames everybody and everything for the &#34;theological shift,&#34; he claims, that has occurred.
Countless times, (I gave up trying to count them all), he parlays that knowledge is by revelation ONLY, that reason is the cause for all of man's problems and difficulties; a conclusion which is patently false, because as the Bible states, sin is the cause of all of man's problems. 
He engages in a fallacial logical argument, where he negates at predicate twice to call it identity. For instance, instead of A is A as identity... He says that A is NOT Non-A. The statement A-&#62; ~(~A) is false when using quantitative reasoning, something to which Schaeffer objects. 
As a Christian, I was outright offended by the statement he makes, that unless you have the content of the meaning of the name of Christ that the people of the Reformation had, then Christ's name is meaningless, or so says Schaeffer.
I also found that many questions I had while reading this were not answered, and some altogether avoided: 

If knowledge (wisdom, intelligence) is only gained by revelation, and only the select few are entitled to that revelation, should the rest of us remain ignorant? Schaeffer would say yes. 

If reason is so bad for man, why is anti-reason not the answer either? 

He goes through the line, Nature is bad, the principle of mechanics is bad, humanism is bad, freedom is bad, which would lead to the conclusion that intelligence is bad. 

He asks the question, &#34;How can unity exist when differences in thinking exist,&#34; to which I initially and facetiously replied &#34;Marriage.&#34;

In his analysis of the Renaissance, he faults Thomas Aquinas for what he believes is the introduction of &#34;humanism&#34; into the doctrines of the church. Then he faults Leonardo da Vinci for Neo-platonist tendencies in Leo's works. &#34;Curse those inventions of Leo's mind,&#34; Schaeffer seems to say. The list could go on and on, but it occurs to me that the only theophilologer to which Schaeffer completely defends is Immanuel Kant, whose whole premise was that reason should be completely abandoned for man to survive, and then so what if he doesn't. 

So what Schaeffer really believes is that we should abdicate our minds, that things like this review have to be knowledge anomalies; that Christians are designed to be dumb and solfidious, (Justification by Faith Alone). Even when he clings to the existentialism of Karl Barth, Jean-Paul Sartre, (and Camus), he is forced to admit that his theory needs help from humanism, or else mankind has no redeeming value to himself or to God, (determinism, or in Christian circles, nihilistic pre-destination). It reminded me of the song, &#34;Gloom, Despair, and Agony on Me.&#34;

Perhaps he should have read James 2:18, &#34;I have faith and you have works; show me your faith, and I will show you my faith by my works.&#34;  Unfortunately for Schaeffer, works would require that man know how to do things, a concept called intelligence and learning. 

This is ultimately a terrible book, offering no new thoughts or solutions, (how could he? the solutions have to be THOUGHT out.) to the continuing predicament in Christianity
