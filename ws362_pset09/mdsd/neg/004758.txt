This is something I would find on a humor website. And it's not very good. Most of the jobs listed is only held by a few people and not what I call real jobs. There is a show on The Discovery Channel that is titled "Dirty Jobs". One job that Racz mentions was featured on it. Chicken sexer. And what the job is about is quickly finding out what sex the baby chicks are. But he mentions silly stuff mostly like Saddam Hussein Double and Exorcist. A few real ones like Data Entry and Shopping Cart Valet. 

I got this book from the library by placing it on hold. If I saw the inside of this book I wouldn't have bothered with it.
