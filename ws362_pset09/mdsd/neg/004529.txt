As a year-round resident of a New Jersey shore community, I thought "The Big House," the history of a summer home in a Cape Cod community, would make for an interesting summer read. WRONG!

I have never read a book with such interesting potential that was so full of so many endless, boring details. The author goes to great lengths to describe in excruciating detail every brick, every shingle, every splinter, and every nail that forms the construction of the house; in addition to every cobweb in the house's endless corridors; every page in every book that resides on every shelf in every room; and every blade of grass, every tree, each individual leaf on every tree, and every weed that surrounds The Big House, to the point where you just want to scream "WILL YOU PLEASE GET ON WITH IT! DOES THE FAMILY MANAGE TO KEEP THE HOUSE, OR DOESN'T IT?"

Unlike one other reviewer who gave up on all of this endless detail after reading 75% of the book, I forced myself to finish it because, despite all the detail, I still wanted to find out whether the family managed to hang onto the property. I won't spoil the ending by revealing it here, but future readers may want to save themselves many hours of boring toil and sweat by stopping by their local library, removing the book from the shelf, reading the last few pages to learn who keeps or does not keep the house, and then returning the book to the shelf.

The dust jacket of this book proudly displays a seal that proclaims the book to be a "National Book Award Finalist," and the major benefit I received from wading through all that detail was the realization that if this author could manage to get this book published AND have it become a National Book Award Finalist, then I could do the same, and I have finally begun to write my own memoir that I have been meaning to get around to for the past 30 years. If this author can do it, so can I!

Thank you, George Howe Colt!
