I guess I should have listened to the title of this book a little more before I wasted my money on it.  This book is written for 12-16 year olds that have little or no knowledge of sex.  It has the most elementary stuff in it that even a person living on an island by themselves their whole lives could figure out.  I thought when I bought this book the author would be talking about techniques that would actually help achieve "amazing sex" as it said in the title.  Um think again.  It's like the author had some sort of agenda while writing this book.  She states that is normal to have "rape fantasies" and discusses "how to be comfortable being gay".  It is not normal to have rape fantasies and as for being comfortable with your sexuality I agree it is necessary for good sex, but don't waste my time with a whole chapter on it.  Honestly it's just false advertising naming the book "The complete idiot's guide to Amazing Sex", it should be called "The complete idiot's guide to the Basics of Sex from a leftist agenda."  There is nothing in this book that will help the reader achieve "amazing sex", just the basics that any simpleton could figure out.  Don't waste your money unless you're still in junior high
