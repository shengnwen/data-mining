I wanted to like this book, but honestly, I didn't find the kind of serious treatment of the important subject of the greeters ministry of a church. I would not recommend it for training greeters. Some of the examples in the book were strange if not fanciful. Like the directions about "how to hug someone who doesn't want to be hugged" or the greeter who was given a diamond ring by a guest. Try "Serving as a Church Greeter" by Leslie Parrott, Paul E. Engl
