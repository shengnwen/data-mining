I was never more disappointed in any book I read.  The story went directly from the eve of invasion by the aliens to "Oh, my, they're here!"  with no explination no how they got here.  The book was also more concerned with the characters sex life.  They spendt 90% of their time having sex, with the aliens forcing their captives to have sex, because they didn't reproduce sexually and were doing 'research'.  Even earth people who weren't in captivity seemed to spend most of their time having sex.  I will never read any by Mr. Turtledove again
