The reviews say that Lisa A. Johnson's book offers good suggestions on how to be a good companion and not a gold digger: I am glad about it. Yet, she is advising on how to date not just anybody, but specifically THE RICH. Does she mean that the rest of us is not entitled to the same self-confidence and emotional support in a companion? Are we honest, sensitive, understanding, compassionate common men (teachers, small businness owners, musicians, employees, local journalists etc.) condemned to be our self-despising girfriends' cheapo-free therapists
