In this book, Mr. Katz set out to show how these two "geeks" had nothing going for them, yet through determination and computer-know-how they were able to find a niche in the world that was all their own. This is not that kind of a story. Let me just remind people that these "two lost boys" did not "ride the Internet out of Idaho." They rode Jon Katz's wallet out of Idaho, used it to get some plane tickets to Chicago, an apartment, and, in Jesse's case, into college. Jesse's constant griping about authority and his social misfortunes is sickening.  I knew him in high school and with all of his knowledge he never figured out that not fitting in isn't always a social edict, sometimes it's a personal choice of simply conforming to acceptable and feasible guidelines. Growing up in a small town, dealing with self-induced seclusion, playing Quake in a darkened apartment, listening to MP3s, and using ICQ to send messages, does not merit any kind of praise from the readers of this book. If it were not for Mr. Katz and his sympathy towards Eric and Jesse, Eric would have still made something of himself (seeing as though he actually has skills outside of the world of computers; you know, social skills), while Jesse would probably still be living in a single bedroom apartment in Caldwell, making fake drivers licenses for underage kids, and riding his bicycle to a dead-end job at a second-rate computer store because his own license was revoked.
Instead of showing us how the Internet can act as a catalyst to propel those with determination and desire into something bigger and better than what has been given, Mr. Katz shows us how pity, cash, and some journalistic influence can help people skip over the journey that makes a triumph worth struggling for.
