Kristy in Charge was maybe the stupidest BSC book I ever read. I like BSC a lot but this one really disappointed me. A short story was made long and  it was kind of boring. It was a little interesting, but not really. And Ann  M. Martin favors Kristy too much---shouldn't the other BSC members have  Great Ideas more often? Do not read this book if you are looking for  excitement because you won't find it here
