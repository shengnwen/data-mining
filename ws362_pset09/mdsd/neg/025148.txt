I hated "Green Mars"! This book is easily one of the worst pieces of tripe I've ever read. "Red Mars" was a decent book and I had high hopes that "Green Mars" would be equally good or better, but boy-oh-boy was I wrong. Where to start? First it was boring and tedious. "Red Mars" at least kept a half-way decent pace, with imporant or interesting events happening every couple of chapters or so. I can scarely think of one in the whole of "Green Mars". Instead of focusing on the sorts of interesting happenings taking place on a planet in the process of being terraformed, Robinson instead used this book as a soap-box for enviromentalism and anti-capitalist crap. It consisted of people that were either anti-terraforming (that seems to be totally insane to me), communists (or socialists, or eco-socialists or whatever), or people with any other number of weird political stances. I got half-way through and simply threw my hands up in disgust. Never touch this book
