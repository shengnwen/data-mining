The epic story of the first crossing of North America, if you consider a lost party going from Fla into Tex and Mexico an epic crossing of North America.

Entire story could have been told in one chapter.  

Very little is available on the events so the author takes other experiences of other explorers and plugs them in, saying they may have happened.

Consider this book a real rip off.  Paul must have had a writers block and needed a few bucks.
