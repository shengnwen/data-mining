This was an amazing book...I LOVED it. I actually bought it for my older sisters birthday but ended up reading it myself. It's for 12-13 year olds, probably really mature for their age. Younger readers will probably find it boring-and a little inappropriate. Ummm...how about this: if you've read Dan Brown novels and liked them, you can read this book. I would recommend asking an older sibling or parent to censor it though. Nothing fancy, just a couple of pages should be folded
