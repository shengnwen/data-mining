This game just rocks.  It is so much fun and so detailed that you would probably think that the guide is too.  You would be wrong.  This guide lacks almost any real useful information and is confusing.  While it is clever to do it in a comic book fashion, the important info is either hard to find or non existant.  Many times, info that I needed to know was not included and the clue bottle map is non demetional and hard to determine where the bottles are.  I have actually had to get that info else where.  In fact, if you need assisntance with the game, I STRONGLY suggest you travel over to gamefaqs.com and look it up there.  Much better advice and its free.  Don't waste ur money with this guide, I am sorry I wasted mine.
