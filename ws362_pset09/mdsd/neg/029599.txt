If you agree with the concept of codependent, this might be a good book for you.  I found myself completely disagreeing with the author in that she seems to think that her definition of codepedent is a state to be overcome.  Nothing could be farther from the truth. One could also define codepedent as passionate, loyal, selfless and honorable. A "real" friend.

While it is true, it is not a good idea to get so wrapped up in someone else's life that you do not have a life of your own, at this point our agreement stops.  This author seems to feel that people who care, should not.  The friend who interceeds to stop another friend from killing themself, is wrong.  They should "let them handle their own problems". What ever happens- happens.  If a drunk kills someone..it is their problem.  If a friend is going through anger and takes it out on you, walk away - it is not convient for you. I find this kind of thinking scary.  It is what is wrong with our world.  No one cares about anyone but themselves.  It is what causes the wars and sucide as others feel alone and abondoned by society. Everyone has weakness.  Everyone has faults.  Everyone needs others. Caring and reaching out is not one of them. 

Skip this book and go with your own instincts.  It's advice Of course do not let anyone run you, but to care with passion and honor is not wrong.
