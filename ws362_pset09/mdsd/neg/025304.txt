  i bought this book thinking that it would be a good refrence and guide for doing repairs and maintnence on my79 300d. in reading the reveiws on amazon i got that empresion. not exactly. it is collaberation of articles in a mecedes magazine. yes it may have some helpful info, and some tecnical gudance, but it is not necessarly going to have your spacific problem. if you are lookiing for a complete guide to repairs and maintnece this is not your book
