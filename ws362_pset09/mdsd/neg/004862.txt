The only reason I am glad that I skimmed this book is that now I will not read more by this author.

This story is told in three point of views.  First, we have Radha, a young woman who really dislikes her husband.  He's more of a driven entrepeneur, and she's got no direction at all and stays that way throughout the book.  Her husband, Shyam, who doesn't understand his wife and only wants to possess her.  Then we have Radha's uncle, and I skimmed most of his parts, but he's been a famous dancer and is being interviewed by an American man.

Radha and Shyam are so contentious, it reminded me of episodes of The Needlers on Saturday Night Live.  It's stomach turning how they don't get along, and frankly I kept waiting for her to leave  him already!

If you are a fan of this author's books, don't read on because I am about to summarize the book in order to save other readers the time.

1.  Couple doesn't get along.
2.  Enter strange and facinating American.  The wife has a torrid affair with him.
3.  Young American is in India to invterview wife's uncle.  
4.  I couldn't stay awake to read all of Uncle's passages, but he has this "feeling" he knows this young American.  ((This part felt so cliche to me))
5.  The wife gets pregnant from the torrid affair, but finds she doesn't love the not so facinating American anymore.
6.  The uncle and young American do have a connection.  ((Gee what a surprise))
7.  The wife leaves her husband and does not stay with her American lover either. ((Gee, what another surprise!!))

OK, so there you have it.
