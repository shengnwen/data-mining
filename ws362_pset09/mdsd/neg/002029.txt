I received this book for Christmas and was annoyed by the writing style within the first 50 pages.

The story itself isn't bad, but I found the writing styles simplistic and like I said before, annoying.  The four main characters have no chemistry.  They are supposed to be the best of friends but you never feel any emotion out of any of them.

The same phrases are also uttered over and over and over again.  Here these people are, on the brink of something magical and amzing that they have found that will turn the world on the edge and all you hear constantly uttered out of one of the character's mouth is, "I sure wish I knew."  

Hey look, I can't believe it, how did those people build gateways to other worlds?  Boy, I sure wish I knew.  Hey!  Look at that amazing and terrifying flying insect, how does it fly with such small wings?  I sure wish I knew.

Maybe I expected too much of this book since I don't read sci-fi only.   But as I said, I could hardly finish this book much less read anything else written in this style.  What a shame =
