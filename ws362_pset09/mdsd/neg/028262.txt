Sue Jones write helpful personal account of fibromyalgia.  She groups Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue together and simply refers to them as FMS.  This does a bit of diservice to CFS.  They do have over-lapping symptoms, but CFS doesn't have many characteristic symptoms that fibromyalgia has.  Generally, her account is readable although she does discusses (briefly) only one treatment (unusual) treatment that has helped her.  I would not recommend this book as source the sole source of understanding FMS/CFS or its treatments.  It is a readable account of one person's experience, but overall does not offer many insights.
