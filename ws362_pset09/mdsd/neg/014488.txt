I ordered this book based on the great reader reviews it had.

After receiving the book and had a chance to look at it, I am not sure why the great reviews.

A second book I ordered, "The Ultimate Windows Server 2003 System Administrator's Guide" by Robert Williams and Mark Walla is a much better book
