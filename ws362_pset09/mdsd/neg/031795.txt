The university I am attending actually recommended this book as a study guide for the CLEP exams. I thouroughly studied the natural science section. I learned a lot, but to my surprise when I took the test, a lot of the material on the exam was not covered in this book. Needless to say, I did not pass. Maybe the other sections are closer to what is covered on the exams.
