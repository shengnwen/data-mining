I just finished reading chapter one.  I know it is quite early to make judgements, but already I'm starting to feel uneasy. As someone who has always enjoyed physics and math(and done well) I feel a little more insight into what is trying to be explained would be great.  Im a student at the authors institution so I think thats why we have to use this book.  I agree with others that there is a lot of waisted commentary so far, but it may prove to be usefull later.  It just seems like a lot is thrown into one chapter and doesn't really mix well.  More time, or more explanation about what is trying to be explained would greatly benefit the first chapter
