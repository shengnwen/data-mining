I will admit, I flipped through a few of the pages in this book, read some funny bits and decided to buy it. I might as well have thrown $15 down the toilet. 
After suggestions that people with potential eating disorders should be "banned from the universe" and telling a pregnant women, with hormones raging, that if she isn't having sex with her husband that he'll probably have an affair, I gave up on this piece of trash. There are other comments too, that could make any woman not "Playboy" material (She is a Playmate, ladies) feel like garbage. If you want to make yourself feel horrible, go ahead and buy this book. If you'd like to celebrate your pregnancy and feel good about yourself, there are plenty of other books out there for you. STAY AWAY.
