This book was not informative at all.  I started to read the reviews after I bought the book just to make sure I was not the only one who was not impressed with the book.  I took the suggestion of other readers and bought Baby Bargain.  Now this is a wonderful book.  I can't put it down, originally when I bought I was planning to just skim though and read what I thought was important but the advice was so good that I had to start reading the book from the beginning to make sure I wasn't missing out on any good tips
