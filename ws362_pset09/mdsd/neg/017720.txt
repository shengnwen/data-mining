I think this book has amazing potential- the plot lines are intriguing, and the characters are interesting- but it falls far short of what I anticipated.  Phillips' prose simply does not draw the reader in.  Instead, it is dry and boring, and it becomes incredibly difficult to get through the long, uninteresting passages to find the good parts.  While I think that many readers will enjoy this book because of the powerful plot line, it seemed to me as though the book relied too much on plot and not enough on quality writing
