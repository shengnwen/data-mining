I purchased this text as it is required for my precalc class.  The review that follows this review talks about how this book is not a self teaching guide but is to supplement the classroom experience.  I can't say that I agree wit that.  The book is very difficult to read even after attending the classroom session on the topic.  The author does a poor job of introducing topics and drawing out points.  Symbols are used in a confusing manner without explanation.  The author will introduce a topic, explain it in just a few sentences and follow with "therefore" followed by a conclusion that is not explained.  The authors seem more interested in proving how smart they are and less interested in teaching.  Not really a good book but the graphs are good and odd answers are in the back
