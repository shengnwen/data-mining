What a disapointment!
the book is not at all sufficient to operate small repair on leicas. it assumes too much knowledge and lacks step by step explanations and diagrams. I have found much more usefull dismantle description and repair instructions for free on the web. moreover, the subject treated are not systematic at all. restoration is treated on one camera, speed tuning on another. most of the pictures are useless as they descibe dismantle stages without showing the parts been discribed in the text for better clarity.
This book is the output of someone who apparently is a good repairman but completely lacks any comunication skills
