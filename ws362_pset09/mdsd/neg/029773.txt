I studied the topic of consciousness for a biopsychology course, and this book served as my main resource. I enjoyed Damasio's model of consciousness, but it was a painful read. He regularly uses ineffective analogies to classical music and other high-brow topics. Worse, he stretches the information out over 400 pages, despite having written a 25-page review article on the very same subjects. Save yourself a lot of time, and just read that article:

Parvizi J., Damasio A. Consciousness and the brainstem (2001) Cognition, 79 (1-2), pp. 135-160
