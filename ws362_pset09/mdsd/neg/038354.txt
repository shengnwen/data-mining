I studied this book for my first broker's exam on December 14, 2005 at the Pasadena Center and failed.  I solved and reviewed twice all the chapter problems and all of the exam sets in the book.  I was very confident that I could answer correctly on all the questions in the book.  But the questions on the actual exam were nothing like the ones in the book.  The questions on the actual exam were much longer and harder.  They required much deeper knowledge than what the book presented.  It was like the authors never have seen the actual exam.  This is a real estate knowledge book, not an exam prep book.  I have wasted my time and money because of this book.  What could an exam prep book do worse if a book not only does not help, but also misleads about the actual exam?  Please do not buy this book to study for the exam.  This is a shame on the famous name 'Barron's'.  Do not be a victim like me.  Hope my and my family's suffer would do some good by letting other people know not to buy this book.
