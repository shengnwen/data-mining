Hi, 
I have used this book among others to get accepted to McKinsey (and with success) and I think this book gave me less then others. 
The advantages are the more or less detailed frameworks chapter and the real-life interviews chapter, but the cases themselves are rather superficial and sometimes even obviously ridiculous(like for example the case in which a Star-Trek like omnipotent people transporter has been invented, and the book claims that it wouldn't replace cars because it costs 100,000$. Come on, they would buy one for every block).
I think there are much better resources than this.

Good luck with your interviews
