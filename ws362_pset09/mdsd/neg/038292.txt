I am an avid reader and probably go through a book a week. When I can upon the book it looked interesting and even though it was the second book in the series (the book store did not have the first) I went ahead and got it. It was a BIG disappointment!  Many of the ideas and concept the author uses come strange from Laurel K. Hamilton and Anne Bishop books. The whole book seemed to be a mixture of these two writes previously used ideas. The copying is so blatant I am really surprised that it even got published. If you're interested in reading a good book try the authors she copied off of.
