We loved Murphy's "Henry the Fourth", but we didn't particularly like this book.  While the artwork is delightful, the rhymes are clumsy, and worse, the premise just is not very interesting.  At least, finding out what happened to the cow's utter-mittens did not engage my kids (almost 3 and 5).  

On the plus side, the book did give my almost 5 y.o. and myself a place to start talking about even and odd.  And the way that the artist showed the pairs of mittens and the missing mitten in outline made it easy to point out what the story was taking about.  

But I'd give this book a pass unless you are desparate to find an edutainment introduction to even/odd numbers
