Certainly a nice looking book.  From what I understand, Marvels launched the careers of its two principle creators, and it's definitely not a bad place to start.

Alex Ross's work is nothing short of spectacular.  His art is the closest comics will ever come to fine art, and demands respect.

However, I cannot give this book a glowing review because it failed on a very base level.  It failed to pull me into the Marvel Universe.  Sounds odd, I know.  But as a man in my early twenties with little to no understanding (or appreciation) of the Marvel Universe, I'm left in the dark.

I could easily understand why an older man, or a Marvel Comic enthusiast, would love this comic, but as a newcomer, I was left behind.

There is a very fine difference between inventing a concept, and perfecting it.  Marvels serves as the prototype for future masterpiece Kingdom Come, which also featured an everyman POV.

Naturally, there's a frustration on my part that comic creators often make allusions or other nostalgic call-backs to the Silver Age of comics.  This is problematic for comic readers who, like myself, have no intimate knowledge of that bygone era.  And from what I've read of it, there's not a lot that impresses me.

Do not buy this book unless you are very much aware of Marvel's content history.  Otherwise, you'll be left scratching your head.  (God only knows what was happening during that Galactus bout.
