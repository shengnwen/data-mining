For the second time, I tried to read a Sallis book and for the second time gave up half way through.  He does have a nice turn of phrase, and that's what brought me back for another try.  
Unfortunately, style is clearly his primary focus, leaving the balance of his writing in the two books in this series to shallow story line and characterization.  As a result, while the reader may be entertained by the author's style, there's no depth of story or characters to hold his curiosity.
At least this time around Sallis didn't serve up another gooey helping of his syrupy-sweet (and Walt Disney phony) view of the Deep South, as he did in "Cypress Grove"
