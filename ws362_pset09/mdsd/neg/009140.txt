This book seemed like the answer to my prayers.  I fit all of the descriptions on the back cover, and I was very stressed out most of the time so I purchased it.  What it doesn't tell you is that the entire premise of the book and the cornerstone of this Dr.'s practice is DHEA.  If you are under 40 years old or on any kind of hormones, including birth control, you cannot take DHEA, and you cannot benefit from this book.  That is about half of the female population!!  Also, DHEA is a hormone, not a vitamin, and there are no conclusive studies to prove that it does not have long term side effects.  Even if I was over 40 and not taking the pill I would feel very uncomfortable taking a hormone that may or may not lead to cancer, etc.  Bottom line- unless you are over 40 years old, not taking hormones but want to start, DO NOT waste your time and money on this book!!
