My book club and I all agreed that this book left much to be desired as a survey of Western Philosophy.  I had hoped for a better skeleton to hang the fabric of Philosophy upon.  However, one cannot go through such a survey without being stimulated to think deep thoughts - 'Do I see red the same way you see red?' - and so forth.

The author did refer to previous philosophers as he progressed in the book, however, It just didn't hang together
