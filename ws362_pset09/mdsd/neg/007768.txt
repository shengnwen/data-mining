Practical Geostatistics breaks new ground in providing excellent interactive media to supplement the text.  In fact, there is more information in the hyperlinked text on the enclosed CD then there is in the text book.  The CD is full of colorful 2-D and 3-D renderings and visualizations of various example data sets.  Regretfully, the text focuses more on the visualization techniques then on the art of evaluating spatial data.  There is little or no discussion of the mathematical concepts behind geostatistics.  The worked examples show excellent summary visualizations for the provided data sets, but do not walk the reader through the processes of semi-variogram analysis, cross-validation, kriging, or stochastic simulation.  I would recommend this book as a reference for someone interested in presenting geostatistical data evaluations using informative visualization techniques.  If the reader is interested in aquiring an understanding of geostatistic, I would instead recommend the texts by I.Clark, P.K.Kitanidis, or C.Deutsch and A.Journel
