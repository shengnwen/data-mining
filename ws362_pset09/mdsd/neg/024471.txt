Great supporting characters do not always make great lead characters.  Joe Pike is a great supporting character, and one of the things that made him so is the sense of blank mystery he has in the earlier books by Robert Crais.  Demystifying him, as happens to an extent here, makes him less impressive and less interesting.

Elvis Cole, by contrast, is a better lead character than supporting character.  The inner monologue that gives him so much life when he was the center of the book is here absent, and so we trade a lead character for a supporting one, and vice versa, and are worse off for both trades
