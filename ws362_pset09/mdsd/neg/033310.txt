This book takes the technology of 'readability' to new lows. The author clearly takes much pride in his extensive knowledge of the English language. I'm not saying you won't get useful information from this book,  it's just such a painful process. We all had classes we enjoyed and those  that put us to sleep. This is the class you had to bring coffee to. It's  also an invaluable resource if you want to learn countless stringent  guidelines for drawing an ER diagram
