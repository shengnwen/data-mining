I realize that this "novel" was written as a companion to a video game, but if you're going to write something and put your name on it, it should be better than this. The "story" is that the Chinese have invaded some contested islands in the South China Sea. The U.S. gets involved and the Chinese declare war on the U.S. A submarine, the Cheyenne, is sent to the area. What follows are a dozen or so scenarios that a U.S submarine might encounter in this setup. However, there is no character development nor depth to the story. The American sub encounters a Chinese sub and sinks it. Then it encounters 2 subs and sinks them and so on and so on. This one American sub is destroying the entire Chinese navy single handedly. There is no suspense at all as the Cheyenne is never in any danger. Everything it does works, nothing the Chinese do matters. Their equipment is inferior, their submariners are inferior. This book is very repetitive with no suspense, no real plot and no believability. There is an overabundance of technical data about the submarines and their weapons which makes for very boring reading. I don't really know what the point of this book was
