Has Danieele Steel been abducted by aliens or has she been "Kloned" and this insane Klone wrote this book.  I actually thought about not finishing this book but I thought there might be a logical ending...Beyond disappointing.  Her characters have no substance, I don't want to meet the person who could relate to these whimpy weirdos.  This might be the worst book I've ever read.
I just read this book, quite quickly in one afternoon. I think I've pretty much purchased and read every Danielle Steel book she's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads. I understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory. There is never much suprise as to how a DS book will end, the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns, historical and geographical research she puts into her books. This book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books. Definately not worth the hardcover price, the paperback price or even the used price. Time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity
