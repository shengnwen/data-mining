This book is probably useful for learning what missionaries are up to out there in the non-Christian world.  However, it does not stop to ask whether they SHOULD be out there.  And of course, from a cross-cultural and anthropological point of view, they should not.  It is arrogant, ethnocentric, and culturally destructive to spread a culturally-relative and almost certainly false ideology and belief system where it is not needed or wanted.  Missionaries have been the source of much of the world's trouble, and they still are.  But more essentially, the whole idea of missionazation is judgmental and intolerant. Why do those people need you and your "belief"?  How would you like it if they were missionizing you!  Oh, but you think your religion is true!  Well, so do they!  It seems all missionaries and those they missionize have in common is a lack of cultural understanding.  If we recognized religion as the relative (different in different places, not "true" in any meaningful way) and damaging, irrational thing it is, we would stop supporting it and start supporting real efforts that help people in real ways
