Though a few of the lesson plans may, in fact, be beneficial for students on a middle school level or lower, in general, these plans fall under the category of &quot;any high school student would see through them and roll their eyes at the cheese whiz factor.&quot; Though the book and the authors obviously have good intentions, the lesson plans and the attitudes with them reek more of political correctness than reality and seem to gloss over atmospheres that pervade our school systems today. 
 
 I was dissapointed with the format itself-- the chapter introductions were chock-full of uninspired teaching antidotes that did nothing to introduce the lesson plans themselves and seemed more of a way for the authors to toot their own horns, so to speak. The book is also organized by &quot;season&quot; which follows no pattern. 
 
 In short-- maybe in a suburban private school, these lesson plans and ideas are embraced by students. But in the real world, most high school students wouldn't take a single one of these seriously; especially with such wishy-washy political correct attitudes.
