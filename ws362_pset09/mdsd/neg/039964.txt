Like a previous reviewer I was also disappointed by the content of the book.  Made up of articles (albeit slightly changed) appearing in magazines, this book provided nothing new or indepth or of a different viewpoint from other fitness/cycling/triathlon books.  I wouldn't recommend to buy it.  Coffee book material it is.  if you want to get anything out of it and apply it to any training, then this isn't the book for you
