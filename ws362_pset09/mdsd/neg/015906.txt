I purchased this book for my 2nd grade classroom.  With a few exceptions, the kids didn't want to take the time necessary to color in all the designs.  They didn't mind doing the math, it was only the coloring that they rushed through.  I was disappointed because it seemed like a way to work some fun into the math lesson, but alas, it didn't work out that way
