The claims made in this book sound great, until you look at the other side of the Laetrile (a.k.a. B17) story. 

  I just can't find a CREDIBLE source that endorses Laetrile. According to the book that's because the Feds are out to get 'em. All mainstream Oncologists (or any M.D. for that matter) are part of a vast conspiracy fueled by greed and thinly veiled homicidal tendencies. (I should add suicidal to the list since DOCTORS DIE FROM CANCER TOO.)   
  We all need something to believe in when life stops being wonderful and gets tough, scary and incredibly unfair. When your sick and the best treatments available bring only a marginal chance of survival (sometimes leaving you with missing parts) it's only natural to become desperate and scour every resource you've got for a better way. 
THAT'S WHAT MAKES US THE PERFECT 'MARK' FOR CON-MEN/QUACKS!  
 
 If you're still curious go ahead and read the book, but don't stop there.
 Look at all sides to every story when considering treatment options, it's not like you have to believe every point of view you're exposed to.

 Go to the watchdog sites and look up Laetrile/B17. Checkout the wrap sheet of the individuals marketing this stuff, cross reference your search and look at what other miracles they market. Ask yourself...  
·	Do the articles and testimonials for these different products seem to be a form letter. 
·	How do they find the time to become experts in virtually every field of medical science and discover a cure for EVERY major disease known to man?
·	Are they really a doctor? Did the school they earned their diploma from have authority to grant doctoral degrees in that field?
·	What is the success rate and where are the reports to prove it? If there are no records, how could they be so stupid? (Our brightest minds have been toiling for decades and they have records of every tiny success and huge failure.)
·	There are dozens products for every bodily function known to man on the shelves of vitamin shops. They are there legally even though most are not proven or doubted by the mainstream medical community. Why is B17 allegedly singled out?
·	Keep in mind that alternative therapies that WORK (i.e. Acupuncture) ARE being more widely accepted everyday.  
·	Many Quacks claim that their cure has been widely used in some far off land for ages and everyone there agrees it's saved numerous lives. THE WEB IS WORLD WIDE! Check it out! Are Australians being cured without a doubt or has their government just not gotten around to banning the product yet? 
Making an informed decision is a lot of work, but it's a worthy investment of time if it prevents you from trading your life for a lie.
