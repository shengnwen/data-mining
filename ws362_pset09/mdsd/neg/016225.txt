I borrowed this from the library after a reviewer in The Boston Globe said it was one of the best books of 2006. I read the first story and didn't like it, but I tried to soldier on. Halfway through the second story, I gave up, completely bored. Don't judge this book by its cover, as the cover is brilliant, and the inside quickly disappoints
