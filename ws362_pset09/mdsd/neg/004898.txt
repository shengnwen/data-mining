It seems like Hard Core Logo is an example of a book that was not quiet as good as the film that was made out of it.  Perhaps I expected too much upon seeing the excellent film first, but I can't help but be disappointed with  the book.  It's novel in verse format is clever, although skimpy.  I feel  that Turner had a great story to tell, but left out all the best parts.   The characters are underdeveloped and the whole story feels empty and  unfulfilling.  It is a very short book (it took me about three times as  long to watch the movie than read the book), and while this is not  necessarily a bad thing, I felt that there had to be more in this book to  make it work.  A great idea, a great basis for a movie, this book is a bit  too hollow to be thoroughly enjoyed.  Check out American Whisky bar  instead, it's way better and a great book in itself
