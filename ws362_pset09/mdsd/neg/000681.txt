I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know
