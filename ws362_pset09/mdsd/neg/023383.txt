This book attempts to call the reader to a compassion that Campolo feels is lacking in the 20th centurty church.  What it does is call Christians to a liberal legalism.  While there are a few issues he gets right, the vast  majority he does not.  For example he advocates for &quot;celebate  homosexuals&quot; to live together in a sort of plutonic harmony.   Campolo  doesn't seem to feel this would give occasion to sin (he does comdemn the  homosexual lifestyle -- yet not as much as say, a Christian owning a BMW).   Or if he does he simply ignores the issue altogether
