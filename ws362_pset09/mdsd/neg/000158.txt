I found this book insulting to women.  The issue I have is that Roseann catered to her boss.. keeping his favorite yogurt on hand.  I personally was completely turned off when she wrote that she had no family (husband/kids).  If this is the kind of life you want.. to be the "left hand" of a powerful person, then this would be the book for you.  I'd be more impressed if Roseann fulfilled her role at work AND had a family.
