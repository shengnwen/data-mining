This is the second book about a group of four best friends who go their separate ways for a summer, keeping in touch through writing and passing along a shared pair of jeans.

The characters in this story were likable.  I enjoyed reading the story from the various points of view.  I liked the ways the four girls supported each other through hard times.

However, I found much of the story to be utterly predictable.  From the moment I started reading, I could tell exactly how Tibby's experience at the summer program and her adoration for the "cool" kids would turn out.  I also knew what would happen when Bee tracked down her grandmother.  Carmen's mother's relationship followed an equally predictable arc.

Although the characters were good, I found the story lines too dull to really sustain my interest
