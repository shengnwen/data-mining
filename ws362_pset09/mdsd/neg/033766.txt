I had a lot of high hopes for this book.  Sirona Knight has obvious experience with magic, and talent with the pen.  Dream Magic starts out weakly, yet another book that feels the need to defend itself in the first few chapters.  (The usual, and far too often repeated magic isn't Satanism, Some Christians aren't that understanding...blah blah blah.)  Then I started to really enjoy myself while working through her versions of quarter calling, circle castings, and astral meditations.  However, I expected her to go into more advanced studies...or further details and she never did.  The start of what could be an awesome book drops off into a number of love and wealth spells.  What a let down
