The brief, passionate title of Manes' book certainly caught my eye.  Unfortunately, Manes makes no convincing arguments on behalf of radical environmentalism in this tedious diatribe.  Instead, he simply spouts empty  rhetoric and a few conspiracy theories.  Manes emphasizes his contention  that civilization is on the brink of collapse due to our violent attitude  toward nature.  Do we need to change our attitude toward nature?  Well, I  think so.  Will Manes' book convince anybody of this?  I doubt it.  If you  want to read a good book about the Earth First! movement, read  &quot;Confessions of an Eco-Warrior,&quot; a homey but surprisingly  articulate collection of essays by Dave Foreman, an on-again, off-again  proponent of radicalism.  The best I can say about Green Rage is that if  you are into radical environmentalism, it will get you riled up.  The worst  I can say is that it does a disservice to the environment by being a waste  of the paper it is printed on
