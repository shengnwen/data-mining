Good read, interesting.  I have Crohn's Disease, and this is decidedly NOT a book for the type of Crohn's I have.  Many of the recipes are not low residue, which is helpful for me.  A word of caution--my doctor keeps insisting that I have to figure out what I can and can't eat, and in what quantities.  Everyone's digestive disorder is different--at least no one in my CCFA group can eat some things I can, and I can eat some things they can't.  I found the low residue information online much more helpful than this book, and IMHO I do not recommend it for anyone with a Crohn's stricture.
