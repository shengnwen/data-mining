If you are a single woman without children, this is not the book for you.  I was extremely disappointed in this book, especially given all the five star ratings.  It took me less then ten minutes to read any portion relevant to my own life, as it was almost exclusively about maintaining friendships when you are married and especially if you have children.  Furthermore, I completely reject the idea that a woman without children must make all the sacrifices to maintain a friendship with a woman who has children which is the premise of this book.  Friendship is a balancing act and the sacrifices should not be placed on the shoulders of one person.

And while other reviews have stated this book says men do not need friends, I did not see that.  However, this book is exclusively about female friendships with other females and does not include men in the equation at all.  After all, women can be friends with men.
