Well, it's not surprising that the author of this book chose to belittle the work of on of America's Great Afro/Latino artists.  It seems as if the author, with no real recourse, took it upon himself to speak of someone so  lowly whom he never had a chance to meet.  This author has no real  understanding of Basquiat's work and it is plainly obvious in the words  used to describe Basquiat as &quot;the Little Black Rimbaud of American  painting...&quot;   I would not recommend this book to anyone of  Afro/Latino Descent interested in a serious study of Black art..
