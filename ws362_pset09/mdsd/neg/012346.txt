Unfortunately I have become used to typos in books.  Although this was a rare occurrence 20 years ago almost every new book has a few.  But this Lawford book has at least one error per page.  Not just spelling, grammatical, and continuity errors but also chronological, factual, and historical.  Chris goes to a jewelry store to buy a "bobble."  Do you think he meant bauble?  He mentions a cat with a "gastronomical" disorder when he clearly means gastrointestinal.  Was there any editing done at all?  Or did the publishers just rush to print with yet another Kennedy book? And there were way too many glimpses of Jackie in the bathroom.  Chris, please show some restraint and have some respect for the dead. The addiction/"recovery" story is old news but having a few Kennedy connections will always sell a book, no matter how badly written
