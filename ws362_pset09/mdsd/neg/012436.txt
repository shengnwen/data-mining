If you want bang for your buck, pick up Rachael's 365 book instead of this one.  The recipes here are mostly found in that book as well.  These recipes really aren't all that innovative, as far as kids recipes go (you already know how to cook hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches, right?), and the Rachael Ray 365 book has lots more information about altering recipes to suit your needs and other really helpful hints.
