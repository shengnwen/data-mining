The White Hotel is a great book.  Unfortunately, after its release, researchers found that D.M. Thomas lifted passages from the work of other writers.  His career never recovered.  Can we forgive this if the book is still superb?  As a writer, I emphatically say no. Plagerism is the great sin of writers.  The idea that there is no such thing as plagerism, a notion put forth by the now dated "theorists," must be dismissed.  If you make use of another writer's work, you must give that writer credit. Otherwise, don't use it.
