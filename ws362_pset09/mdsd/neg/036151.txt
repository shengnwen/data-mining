I give this book a 1 star not because it wasn't interesting - it certainly was, but because the ending absolutely floored me!  Aghgh**&&*(7#!!!!!  I never thought it was going to end like that - where was the justice??  I feel like something is missing.  I want to reach into the book and smack Alex! Please tell me there is a follow-up book where Sam gets what's coming to him!!! -- Oh, and Daphne too
