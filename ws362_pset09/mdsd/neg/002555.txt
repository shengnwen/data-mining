Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend
