As one who has owned both an Extoic Dancer Web site and a Las Vegas Escort Web site, I have met known and photgraphed dancers and escorts going back to 1997 anf quiter frankly  a lot of information is just not right. While those he interviewed  those things might be true, but in general they seem out od whack with the many ladies I have known. This is true particularly for the escorts, as  anyone with any brains can see that  escorts don't start out at $500 for an hour. Don't waste money on this book, is mostly a lot of hype and while you might find it entertaining,  there is just too much that is flat out wrong. There are better books I am sure if you want to get the lowdown on the adult industry in Vegas
