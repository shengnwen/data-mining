I HAVE BEEN SOMERSIZING FOR ABOUT 5 WEEKS AND HAVE ENJOYED THE FOOD RECIPES IN SUZANNE SOMERS 3 BOOKS, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS DESSERT BOOK.  SO FAR I HAVE LOST 10 LBS AND AM LOVING THE RESULTS WITHOUT STARVING MYSELF.  HER PROGRAM IS TRUELY A WAY TO LIVE BY.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PURCHASE HER PRODUCTS, BECAUSE SHE GIVES YOU MOST OF THE RECIPES IN HER BOOKS, I LIKE THAT!  THIS DESSERT BOOK DID FALL SHORT THOUGH COMPARED TO THE OTHER WONDERFUL BOOKS.  I HAVE TRIED THE CHEESECAKE WHICH IS OK, BUT WHEN YOUR EARLY ON HAVING THE SUGAR CRAVINGS IT LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED, I SUFFERD THROUGH.  WE ALSO TRIED THE ICE CREAM AND THE PREVIOUS REVIEW IS EXACTLY RIGHT, THE SOMERSWEET MAKES THE ICE CREAM HARD AS A ROCK, IT WASNT VERY GOOD.  I HAVE YET TO TRY ANY OTHER RECIPES.  THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK MORE LIKE THE DESSERTS I AM USED TO ARE ON LEVEL 2, SO I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH.  I HAVE MADE A GOOD MOUSSE DESSERT USING SUGAR FREE CHOC PUDDING AND CREAM, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE AN ALMOST LEVEL ONE.  I PERSONALLY WOULDNT WASTE THE $ ON THIS BOOK.
