I gave this book 2 stars, because it's a good reference for seed bead techniques.  If that's what you're looking for, and you are a beginning beader, you might find this book useful, although many of the same techniques can be found in the back of most beading magazines.  I found the rest of the book to be extremely disappointing, offering little more than illustrations.  I am new to this hobby, and there wasn't much there (other than the seed bead techniques) that I couldn't figure out by looking at the illustrations or going to my local bead store
