Gardner, an English professor, decided to take the (first) monster from Beowulf, and flesh it out into a full-blown character.

Beowulf's Grendel lasts about 5 minutes.  He terrorizes the Danes for 12 years--breaking into their mead-hall by night and eating selected warriors--for no other reason than that he is evil (descendant of Cain) and hungry.  

Then Beowulf and the Geats show up, and, in good Clint Eastwood fashion, Beowulf dispatches Grendel bare-handed--tearing off his arm and shoulder and sending him bleeding home to die in his swamp.

This takes longer for me to write than it does to happen.

In short, in Beowulf, Grendel is a bit player.

Gardner gives him a childhood and a psyche full of angst and neuroses that would make Hamlet seem straightforward and decisive.

The book, having not much subject, is vastly overwritten--many too many adjectives, and many too many attempts at Anglo-Saxon "kennings" (pithy two-word constructions like "world-rim-roamer").

The character of the Dragon is interesting, if overwrought.  But Grendel himself is simply teenagerish: narcissistic, constantly complaining over nothing, excruciatingly self-aware and self-important.

Beowulf is great poetry but a dull plot.  This book is dull poetry and an inflated, equally dull, character.

Gardner, by the way, was emboldened by the commercial success of this to write several other novels.

Pity.

As a critic, he was great.  As a novelist, wordy and empty
