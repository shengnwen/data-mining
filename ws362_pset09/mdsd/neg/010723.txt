Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley &amp; Sons for publishing this book
