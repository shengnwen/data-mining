Probably one of the worst distortions in statistics is that of extratroplation of complex issues.  The UN and its followers are very prone to these kinds of mistakes as is this book.  To extropolate out and arrive at the kind of conclusions found in this book is a bit beyond ridiculous and borderline irresponsible.  I notice too that there is essentially no consideration/balance regarding Schumpeter's "creative destruction" theories. 

The title itself "The End of Work" is not something we should take seriously or utilize as a basis for further discussion
