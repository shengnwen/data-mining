This is a novel about a professor who is slightly cuckoo.  This is a story about a man who is filled with opinions that can not only be considered conservative for our time, but did for his time as well. I used this novel to exercise my Nabokov, and is my least favorite novel by the author.  I am glad he wrote others, because this alone would have stolen Nabokov's artistic genius.

The book is written well, but the plot is immensely boring.  I would suggest you NOT bother reading it.
