This is poetry? I know she calls it free verse or some nonsense but I don't agree that she can call this poetry. She should just call it a book of song lyrics that never made it into any songs. She could've called it a diary and it would have been fine. Poetry? I'm not so sure. Some of the poems don't make any sense. Some of them are boring. And none of them have any rhythm. I'd call this a collection of witty anecdotes or something, but not poetry. It just isn't poetry. I can't stress that enough. How does reading Bukowski give her a license to suck
