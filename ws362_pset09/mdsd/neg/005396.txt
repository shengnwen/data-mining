Wow, the rave reviews were puzzling.  I do respect that other readers have differing opinions and taste in books.  I read about 2 novels a week and about all sorts of different subjects.  Obviously there is no need to repeat what the story is about, but the bottom line is what an incredible bore the story turned out to be. I forced myself to finish it because I kept waiting for it to get better and it didn't.  Not really anyway.  The end was annoyingly predictable, also.

Ms. Strout, I've no doubt you are a good writer.  Just that this time this book wasn't for me
