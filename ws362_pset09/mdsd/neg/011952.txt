I have to admit, I didn't actually cook anything out of this book, so I can't comment on how anything tastes. I was so dissapointed in that the recipes didn't include any nutritional information other than the 'balanced portion' block information. Also, most of these recipes are for 1 serving! Some of the dinners were calculated for 4 servings, but they were in the minority! I'm just not interested in multiplying the recipes out every time I need to make a grocery list or prepare a meal to figure out what I need. I was looking for a way to prepare zone meals using food readily available in grocery stores (had to look up what steel-cut oats were), and not by adding zone perfect protein powder to everything. I normally use cookbooks by Oxmoor House (Southern Living, Cooking Light), and for now I'll continue to do so. This one's getting returned
