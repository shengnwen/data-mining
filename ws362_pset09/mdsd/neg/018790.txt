VALIS is PKD's quasi-autobiographical crazy mystical science fiction speculations about God.  This isn't a piece of fiction as much as it is a bunch of nonsensical fantasies about the nature of god pulled from nowhere.  This work is nowhere near the quality of PKD's *actual* science fiction, and I don't recommend that anybody bother reading this book.  Stick to the earlier stuff
