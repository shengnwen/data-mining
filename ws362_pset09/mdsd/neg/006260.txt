Norman Cantor's book, "Inventing the Middle Ages," hardly deserves being classified as non-fiction.  The main feature of this work is Cantor's inability to prove any of his assertions.  Instead of resting on solid arguments and dealing with the core beliefs of the historians he attempts to critique, he rests upon immature insults and a bizarre, ineffective attempt at providing an historical context to their works.  Cantor displays more of his own biases, from his individual center, right wing version of history to his repetitive complaints about the homosexuality of various historians.  Cantor's work fails to provide the historical context, the historical tradition or explain the vivid historiography of medieval writings.  Above all else, this book is uninteresting, uninformed, and intensely monotonous.  I am highly skeptical of the selection process by which Cantor adjudges the who's who of medieval historians
