This is the first DL book I've actively debated not finishing. This book made the Jean Rabe books seem great by comparison to this monotonous tub of dung. 

The beginning was slow and written with an excruciating level of detail, internal monologue, and bouncing around from past present and future in reference to Galen being a little brat and getting around punishments for his behavior. 

After the first few chapters the bouncing around was ditched...thank God, but the monotony of detail and internal conversations continued or even increased. 

I suffered through this until page 160 or so last night. I'm considering skipping the rest of this book or at least just jumping to the end to have closure on this crap I've read so far (something I've never done before with a book, especially a DL book!). I'd much rather read Kaz the Minotaur I think!
