Why were the streets in this book given names each combining two states? Florizona, for instance. Was that supposed to be funny? It was simply annoying, as was this entire book. The characters, with perhaps the exception of Boyd, were bloodless, lifeless. I had no sense that they existed beyong the moments when they appeared in the story. I couldn't wait to finish the book, not because there was any mystery to it, but because I wanted to be finished with it. I never warmed up to Ben or anyone else.
