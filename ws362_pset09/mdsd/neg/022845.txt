That's what I want to know. To all you men who are threatened by feminism, don't worry. We still don't get paid as much as you do, we still take your last names when we marry, and by the time Bush is through, we won't be able to get abortions either. Are male engineers and soldiers typically harrassed on the job, subject to domestic abuse, rape?

In nearly every society, men have universally assumed the superior role in every aspect of life (except, perhaps, childbearing, which they're not capable of doing). I'm sorry to hear that Thomas Ellis "losing patience with feminism, political correctness... and basically everything." To make it up to him, we'll all go back to be properly submissive housewives. We'll leave college, stop voting, and exist entirely for male gratification--just as we did before feminism. Will that make him feel properly superior?

Don't tell me that men are "the inferior sex" until wives take the wheel, husbands take wives' names, and a "First Man" finally graces the white house. It's time that modern women say "enough is enough" to yet another backlash against our dignity
