This map is meant to be an accompaniment to the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide to Paris, and it may be that it works well in that role. (I enjoy the books; I think the series is terrific.) But as a standalone product, I found it an unsatisfactory compromise between the Streetwise series and a "real" Michelin city map. It is larger than the Streetwise series, and shows a bit more of the city, but it is seriously lacking in the detail that comes with the Michelin city map. And if you want to go anywhere beyond the central arrondissments, you're out of luck.

The good aspect of the map is that it is laminated and folds easily, but it's a little too big to carry in a jacket pocket. If you're just looking to guide yourself around the center of town, you're better off with the Streetwise guide, which is of a more convenient size. If you really need to find a particular street, and/or you want to explore beyond the tourist areas, stick with the big Michelin or equivalent. They may be clumsy to handle, but the big maps have the best detail.

PS: I agree with the other review regarding the Metro map. It lacks route numbers and it is awfully small
