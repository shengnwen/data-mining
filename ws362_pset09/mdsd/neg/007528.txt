A big disappointment after Altered Carbon.  Some serious editing and re-writing was in order here.  The writing style, which seemed consistent with the detective mystery plot of Carbon, gets down right annoying in this dragged-out treasure hunt.  There are a few exciting & memorable chapters, but my main recollection of this book is the middle 50% spent at the archeological dig, during which the plot barely moves.  The characters are not particularly appealing, and the setting is just dismal.  Hopefully Morgan tightens things up considerably in the next Takeshi Kovacs novel
