the on-the-rock marriage scenes are pathetic, making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse. from the very beginning, this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living, yet she continuously whined, intervened, demanded, complained, pried into her husband jobs and duties. what is this? trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic, making him look more like the stereotyped american husband? making us enable to enter rapp's bedroom, wathching 'war of the roses'? come on, this is a thriller, not jackie collins or danielle steele's 'honey, no sex tonight'. get rid of the nagging wife pronto! also, this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller. a story falling apart in many ways
