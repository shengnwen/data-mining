This is the only truly dull book with Andre Norton's name on it that I have ever read. In so far as I was able to grasp the plot, the time travelers (only one of whom is partially described) have gone to a planet where a Russian team vanished. This is supposed to be an urgent, emergency mission although that makes no sense if they are time travellers. For some reason, not explained, they go to a time a hundred years AFTER the disappearance. They visit a city that is not described at all, a city inhabited by strange races that are not described, they meet people there who are not described, they conveniently get jobs with no questions although they must resemble none of the people there. One of their party is incarcerated in a House of Knowledge or something like that which is not explained though the characters seem to know something about it. In fact the characters and the author, no doubt, seem to know what this whole story is about although they do not communicate their vision to the reader. This is too silly even for science fiction. I fell asleep on page 173 so I cannot say how it ended, nor do I care. It is that bad. I gave it one star because the program wouldn't let me give it anything less
