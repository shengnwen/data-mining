When reading this, I wasn't sure the tone that Siddons was trying to set.  Was it supposed to be eerie, serene, or maybe peaceful?  It felt kind of creepy to me, and the neglect of a young girl was very depressing.  With the addition of the Lulu character, I thought maybe something was going to happen.  But with little action and lots of words, the author tried to achieve some sort of atmosphere that I just didn't catch. Was she aiming for gothic?   Toward the end, what in the world was chasing Emily from the creek bank?  

When I finished, I had more questions than before.  Why did her aunt abandon her?  Why didn't the aunt stand up to a skinny, sick, young visitor?  Wouldn't her all-accepting Grand have helped if Lulu had confided in her?  Since when can you not tell family about an alcohol problem, if you are trying to kick it?  This story might have been more convincing if it had been set in the 40's or 50's, not present day.

I'm sure the ending at the school was supposed to be touching, but adding yet another delusional voice for Emily to hear was just weird.  All that being said, I didn't hate the novel.  There just wasn't anything to love
