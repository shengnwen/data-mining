One of the most frustrating things about buying and reading parenting or pregnancy books has been the proseltizing, condescening, and dogmatic views so many authors take.  Parenting books would have you believe any other parenting method than their own is tantamount to child abuse.  Pregnancy books would have you believe drinking a Coke or dying your hair should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This book is the same - OB/GYNs are money grubbers who compromise what is best for mothers and babies, while midwives are all-knowing, altruistic souls who always do the right thing. The author makes no bones about it in the introduction. The author does quote studies, but uses studies showing negative benefit of some action or treatment to argue that the opposite must be superior - lack of data be damned.  If you want a "thinking" guide, look elsewhere.  If you need reassurance that "natural" childbirth is gonna make you and your baby superior to everyone else, go nuts with this one.
