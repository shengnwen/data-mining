My 9 year old was disappointed in this book.  He already expressed agnostic leanings, and I thought this book would help clarify the issues.  The thesis of this book is that the Judeo-Christian God is part of a  mythological tradition and people believe in God for nonrational reasons.  My son was disappointed that the book did not effectively explain why  really smart people believe in God.  The problem with the book is that it  does not present alternate conceptions of God (besides the old man in the  sky conception), so the book is an example of the straw man fallacy.   Another problem with the book is that it assumes a very simplistic view of  belief and knowledge.  The book raises the right issues, but it is too  superficial even for children.  I would recommend it only if presented with  another book that scratches the surface more deeply
