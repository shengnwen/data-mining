I read this a few years back, but I still remember it well for being the first book I couldn't bring myself to finish. I read about 100 pages, which took me over a month, after which I sat down and pondered whether the plot or characters actually justified going on reading. The book had its moments, but I found it to lack direction.

The language is absolutely excruciating. Some sentences are almost a page long, and just littered with commas, parentheses, strange use of colons, or all of the above. Often a sentence could begin with a story of something, then trailing off to a sub-story of that item, then trailing off to a sub-sub-story of the sub-story before going back to the sub-story, maybe to another sub-sub-story and back to the sub-story, and finally back again to the story where the sentence started. When you constantly have to go back half a page to remind yourself how the damn sentence STARTED, it's more frustrating than fun to read. I suppose Faulkner was going for some stream-of-consciousness approach, which I can safely say is not my cup of Scotch.

I should point out that I am an experienced reader and that I read it in my native tongue. Maybe the translator did a hack job, I have no idea. I only know it was a thoroughly painful read and I felt relieved to ditch it and move on. A book is NOT well written just because it's "difficult".

Of course, he won the Nobel prize, so what do I know
