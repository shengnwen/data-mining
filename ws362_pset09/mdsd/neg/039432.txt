Similar to most of the reviews of the book the strong points include helping a person form effective communication with others. It has a nice foundation for people who are new to public speaking, and a reminder for those who have been doing it for a while. 

However, the book is just plain dated. There must be a new book from another author that we could steer people towards. The business and professional world has changed in the 11 years since the book was released. The pace of conversation, the use of technology to communicate, etc. 

I must agree with another reviewer who noted that the book did little to address Executive status or sounding like a Leader, as the title infers. 

Sorry, I know it takes a lot to create a book for others to read, but this particular one just does not deliver.
