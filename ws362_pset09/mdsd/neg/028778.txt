The beauty of the ORIGINAL edition of this book is its simplicity and its straightforward style. It was/is the ultimate how to write a novel if you also have to have a day job guide. 

This second edition is full of hot air! It's laden with jargon and complex diagrams, assumes the reader knows way too much. Concedes completely that writers should adjust their vision because today's readers have been corrupted by TV and film. I STRONGLY disagree with the shift in focus from character to plot. I too will hang on to my worn copy of the original. 

Don't bother buying this one. It's not worth the money.
