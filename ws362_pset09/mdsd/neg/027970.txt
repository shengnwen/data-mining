If you are a teenager or student in your early 20s and are fascinated with the big mysterious world of I-Banking, this book is for you. It starts from ground zero and provides a cursory explanation of what investment banking is, along with some guidance on career paths in the field.

If you are anyone else, forget it. As I struggled to maintain interest, I couldn't help but be reminded of a scene from the movie "Back to School", where Paxton Whitehead plays a B-school professor lecturing his class on how to start a business and Rodney Dangerfield plays a veteran businessman with no formal education. As Whitehead's character is pontificating about the nuances of how global interest rates affect the construction costs that a hypnothetical business will incur, Dangerfield's character can't help but blurt out "Why in the world would you build when you can rent in this market for half a buck a square foot and let someone else have the headaches of property management?". It quickly becomes apparent that the real-world experience of Dangerfield's character is far more useful than the off-topic theoretical knowledge of the professor. This author reminds me of Whitehead's character: Thoroughly vetted in academia and obviously having zero experience in the real world, and thus having zero useful real-world insight to share with his readers.

The most-cited references in the chapter bibliographies are the annual reports of the big I-banks, and the rest of the book is written at the same naieve, glossy-overview level.

In summary, if you want to know what it's like to serve in the Navy, you can get yourself a copy of the Navy's glossy brochure on what Navy careers are supposed to be like, or you can find a vet who's been in the Navy to tell you what it's really like. Reading this book is like reading the Navy's glossy brochure.
