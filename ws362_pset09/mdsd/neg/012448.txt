The older editions of this book are wonderful. Tarrash's teaching methods are both unique and powerful. Unfotunately the "amatuers" that tried to reformat the new algebreic version essentially trashed it! Juxtaposition a Dover copy with the "new" version and see for yourself. If only they would have solicited some advice from John Nunn with respect to typesetting, or failing that, just convert the descriptive notation to algebreic. An opportunity missed.
