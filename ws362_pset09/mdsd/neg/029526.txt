The writer tries to generalize from the experience of four great statesmen in war times to make a conclusion that politicians should tell generals what to do! 

I think this book is political biased. 

Say if I was to reverse the equation and generalize from the experience of four great generals to make a conclusion that generals should tell statesmen what to do! Would the writer agree with me? 

I could also write a few essays where democratic leaders just left his military leaders to do their job and the military leaders did a very good job eg  prime minister Eshkol  of Israel in the six day war and the Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indian Gandhi in December 1971 in the Indian Pakistan war. Is the conclusion now that statesmen should stay out of the actual war. 

Also I should stress is that most people are not *great*. To try to generalize from a few great men is a very dangerous experience. Great men by their nature are gifted and unusual.
