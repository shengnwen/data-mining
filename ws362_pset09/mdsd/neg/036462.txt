This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. I had to force myself to finish it, mostly because the storyline was a slight bit interesting and I wanted to know "whodunnit," but there were so many distractions to that storyline that it was frustrating. I think the book would be half the size if it would stick to the investigation (it IS a murder mystery, isn't it?) Entire chapters were spent pining over his ex-wife, his shrink appointments and his drinking and his new girlfriend (a very promiscuous high school principal??? pul-ease!) A lot of unnecessary foul language (even the principal), gratuitous sex and alcohol abuse. And that's just the hero of the story! Even the underaged prostitution that Jesse was investigating didn't bother me as much as the rest of it did. If it hadn't been a library book, I would have thrown it in the trash. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it
