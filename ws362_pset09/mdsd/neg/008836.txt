This book was arcane and verbose which made it very difficult and unenlightening.  The author digresses often and seems to add-in superfluous commentary on unrelated subjects.   His references often point to "current events" which have long since lost relevance and the entire text has a dated, maze-like feeling.

If you're looking for an account of the life of St. Francis of Assisi, I would not recommend this book.  If you are familiar with the life of St. Francis and are looking for a commentary on the events of his life you may find this work helpful due to its supposed eminence among works about the saint
