I have a Ph.D studying the Christian right and this is the worst book on Fundamentalism and the Christian Right that I have ever seen.  What is not outright lies are "straw men" arguments meant to make anyone who believes in Christianity look like an idiot.  I feel bad for the people who gave it a good review, they have been duped by the authors who are not arguing a case or explaining the Christian Right, they are feeding propoganda for their own side.  I was given a free copy of this book and after reading it, I threw it in the trash instead of donating it to a library, it is that bad.  Be sure to know something about the author of a book before you buy it, especially on a controversial topics like this one.
