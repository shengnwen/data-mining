This is the worst Mountaineers book I own. The information inside is completely outdated and useless. It concentrates on gear for 3/4 of the book (outdated gear) and gives little useful information. If you are looking for a book on the history of snowshoes, look no further. If you are looking for useful information try elsewhere. I'm usually too lazy to review most books, but this was just that horrible
