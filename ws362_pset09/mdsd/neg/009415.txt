In an impulsive moment, I bought this book on the strength of its Amazon pairing with that other book about the pharmaceutical industry, and the five-star reviews. And only after reading it do I wonder how many of those reviewers might be associates of Dr. Kassirer himself. This is not a five-star book, folks; it is one long smear from beginning to end that seems to paint the entire medical profession with the same sticky, filthy brush. Yes, there is a fair amount of spice along the way--isn't that always true of "exposes"?--but the whole seems much less than the sum of its parts. For my money, there isn't NEARLY enough hard data here to support the sorts of dour conclusions the author would have us accept on his say-so.
