I've had to self-educate on thyroid problems since previous doctors had screwed me up. I saw this book and read it and I became very angry. When milk gets outdated and is no longer healthy to drink it starts to smell. This book should positively reek. The information in this book is more than a third of a century out of date. Barnes could be excused for not understanding basic workings of the thyroid, such as the pituitary controlling it through TSH and modern medications to treat thyroid problems, because his "theories" and "ideas" were made 40 years ago and before thi stuff had been discovered. On the other hand, you can't excuse any reader for thinking that this stuff is valid in the 21st Century.

If anyone thinks that they should be treated for thyroid problems based on the nonsense ideas in this book, they need to be educated.  There's good reason why board certified doctors diss this book. The reason why fake doctors and "natural" medicine people like this book is it gives them an angle to get customers. I don't want to be a meal ticket for those frauds. Health is too important to mess with
