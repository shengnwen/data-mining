I purchased this book while I was engaged to my British husband, in an effort to adjust to the cultural aspects of living in another country after our wedding. This book was *not* very helpful. It didn't help at all in the *adjustment* process. Also, if you live (or plan to live) outside of London don't waste your money. Sure, it talked about some of the things that people coming to the UK might need to know, like differences in language, but if you're American, this book can be a bit confusing because the author is a speaker of Asian English (I think Hong Kong), which is much closer to British English than to American English
