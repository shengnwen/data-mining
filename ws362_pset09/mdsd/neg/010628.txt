So lets see if this makes sense:

-Mormons are forcibly expelled by Missouri Militia (Gov. Boggs infamous "Extermination Order") in 1838;
-They are again expelled by Illinois Militia in 1846 after Joseph Smith is murdered in State custody;
-They flee to the desert wastes of the Great Basin where no one else wants to settle--they struggle against starvation to survive;
-Republican John C. Fremont (notable for killing Indian women/children with his sabre to save gunpowder) runs for President in 1856 on a platform to abolish "the twin relics of barbarism", namely slavery and polygamy;
-Southern Democrat James Buchanan is elected President in 1856--he won't do anything about slavery;
-But Buchanan pre-empts the Republican's religious bigotry platform by acting on bogus reports of a "Mormon Rebellion" to send the "Utah Expedition" to "quell" the insurrection;
-Utah Territorial Governor Brigham Young--fearing (with just cause) the worst--orders what turns out to be a bloodless defense by Mormon Raiders, who force Johnston's Army to winter in Ft. Bridger, Wyoming;
-This delay permits cooler heads in Washington/Salt Lake City to avoid open war in 1858;
-This in the context that newspapers in California and elsewhere had long advocated a "final solution" to the "Mormon Problem"; better to kill them than to tolerate them;
-Since the Mormons had been driven from state to state because of religious intolerance, why would they have reason to trust the good graces of Pres. Buchanan and a beligerent/hostile Federal Army marching on Utah?  

Author Will Bagley briefly mentions most of the above historical facts and acknowledges that Gov. Young had "virtually no military or political weapons to resist federal authority...".  But his entire book is spent minimalizing the ordeals of the Mormons--even insinuating they deserved to be driven--in order to slander Gov. Young with a supposed "crime of power".  In a nutshell, Bagley picks up the prosecutor's mantle of Cradlebaugh, Carlton and Baskin in their rigorous but dead-end attempts to "Pin the Tale on Brigham".  Those bigots couldn't produce evidence to indict Brigham Young then despite the full power and funding of the U.S. Government/Army behind them, and Bagley certainly fails to produce evidence to indict Brigham Young now.  

For example, Bagley's "smoking gun"--the journal of Dimick Huntington--speaks vaguely of Gov. Young's "giving" the cattle of emigrants on the road south to the Piutes, but fails to mention that none of the Indians present at that event were anywhere near Mountain Meadows until after the atrocity was consumated.  The Piutes who did participate knew nothing of this purported deal.  You'd expect such sham evidence from the likes of Barney Fife, not a serious or unbiased historian.   

Further, Bagley presumes to channel Gov. Young's thoughts regarding the Mormon's September, 1857 "war strategy" against the hostile U.S. Government/Army.  Bagley speculates that Gov. Young ordered the massacre of the Fancher train to in some way intimidate the U.S. Government by closing the overland trails and "violating" his oath of office.  This is utterly preposterous--especially in the context of a hostile Army marching on Utah.  Obviously, Bagley believes Gov. Young to be either exceptionally stupid/obtuse or perhaps "Jim Jones" suicidal to deliberately give Pres. Buchanan and the Army the very pretext/incident they needed to justify the elimination of the "Mormon Problem" once and for all.  Bagley acknowledges that Gov. Young was a "fox"--a very shrewd operator--another Bagley contradiction.  If Bagley is so biased to believe such tortured logic, perhaps he also can conjure the tunnel-vision necessary to believe in the tooth fairy.      

Bagley's research for the most part is detailed--if not tedious--though he should better acknowledge the tabloid nature of most of his sources.  He often quotes tabloid rather than primary sources.  His prose is pointedly inflamatory against Brigham Young and the Mormons; they are "fanatics" who are "oblivious" to the rancor the practice of their religion has on non-Mormons--as if this is license/justification to send mobs/militias/Armies to persecute, prosecute, and drive an entire religious movement.  Hasn't Bagley heard of the First Amendment?  Pres. Buchanan sure acted like he didn't...  Bagley's conclusions and analysis are preposterous--particularly the tortured parsing of Gov. Young's straight-forward order to Haight/Iron County to leave the wagon train alone.  ("Depends on what the meaning of 'is' is", right, Mr. Bagley?)  

Bagley's caricature of Mormon society as not being capable of doing anything with or without direction from Brigham Young is also groteque, insulting and utterly false.  I defy anyone anywhere to show where in the Book of Mormon the Indians are referred to  as the "Battle-axe Of The Lord".  Bagley works all the tired Mormon sterotypes possible to rationalize his bias.

Bagley insists he uses logic to put together the puzzle of Mountain Meadows.  He sez Gov. Young/Apostle Smith contributed to the tinderbox creating the conditions for the Massacre.  In the context of looming war, I agree because Young/Smith had every reason to believe they were about to be attacked/driven/exterminated by the US Army.  While trying to pin contextual blame on Young/Smith, Bagley brazenly fails to acknowledge the "elephant in the tent": Pres. Buchanan and the US Army.  This Massacre would absolutely not have happened had it not been for the bigoted and reckless warmongering by Pres. Buchanan to send the Army to Utah, regardless of the murder of Parley P. Pratt.  If Bagley wants to apportion blame on Young/Smith and is so insistant on an apology/repentance of the contemporary LDS Church, why doesn't he also demand the same of Pres. Buchanan's successors, the U.S. Army, and the descendents of the corrupt Federal appointees who clearly harrassed the Saints?  If he is so convinced of the benign behavior of the Fancher party who stampeded Utah with their very large (and presumably hungry) cattle herd (remember Utah is a desert with little grass, unlike Arkansas), why can't he give a scintilla of benefit-of-the-doubt to Gov. Young and the Mormons?  Clearly, Bagley is pandering to those Mormon haters whose mind is already made up and can't be confused with fact.

The bottom line is this: Southern Utah Mormons got caught up in the war hysteria caused by the outrageously unwarranted march of the US Army, feared that once again they as a people would be driven, over-reacted to an emigrant party that was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and commited a horrible atrocity.  Much to the chagrin of the Mormon haters, the act was local.  Perhaps for Bagley's sake, Mark Hoffman can "discover" a document that could really indict Gov. Young...  

As the great-nephew of Juanita Brooks, Bagley's presuming to carry on the truthful inquiry she initiated is a farce.  Brooks did not have an axe to grind, as Bagley obviously does.  Perhaps Bagley would do better to try his hand at writing comic books.
