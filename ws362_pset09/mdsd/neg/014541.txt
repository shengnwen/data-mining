I'm giving this book 2 stars because it did keep me entertained for a short while. Then, like many other reviewers, I began to get bored of all of her complaining and whining.  But the ending....horrible!!  I was left feeling bewildered & felt like perhaps my book had some pages left out of it.  The authors did a very poor job of tying up loose ends.  What happened to her and HH? 
 Also, she mentions that she needs to find a job using her degree, a whole section is even devoted to describing one interview.  Then, the only thing you ever here about her job hunting again is a one sentence reply during a dinner party???? What????  Did we miss something?  I was extremely disappointed and would encourage you to pass this one up
