I bought this book to read during work (caregiving involves lots of sitting around) because I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and felt there may be an interesting story behind the rest of the family. Boy was I wrong!

The plot was pretty forgettable. I just finished the book today and already can't remember half of what happened in the beginning. The characters, with the exception of Cassandra, were two dimensional. The "romance" portion of the book was laughable at times (the two main characters hardly said two words to each other when the fell into each other's arms and proclaimed their love). In fact, a plot beyond "Downtrodden girl narrowly averts becoming a mistress" was pretty weak. 

All in all, there are much better novels to be read out there. Unless you're stuck somewhere with this as your only reading option, I'd opt for something else
