I found the George Washington book by Burns and Dunn to be tedious and repetitive. The first part of the book was interesting and covered the subject in an interesting and readable way; I'm surprised that the last few chapters made it into a book in this series. It was a struggle to finish it (I typically read more than 150 books a year without this problem).

I feel that the writers were writing more for their own edification than to inform their readers.  I you happen to pick up a copy read page 143 as a "readability" test.  I am very surprised that the editors allowed this book to be published with the problems that I perceive.

I've enjoyed other books that I've read in the "The American Presidents Series"; don't let this review influence you on the whole series
