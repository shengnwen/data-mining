This is probably the worst edited book I have ever read. Every second page a sentence with a missing verb or something equally important. Then there are the "missing or misplaced quotation marks. Finally, many sentences have a mysterious, comma dropped into them. All this brings reading to a halt as you stop to figure out what the author is trying to say.

Honestly, how much would it have cost to hire a grad student in English Lit to read it over?

In terms of the content, it was less than impressive. This book borrows ideas heavily from Paul Hawken's Growing a Business and Amar Bhide's articles in Inc magazine. But the book never acknowledges either writer. Instead the author tries to come across as if all this is new and original material.

Here is his advice in a nutshell:

Before investing any money into your startup, make a list of your proposed products features (before it exists), and then call 200 potential customers to ask if they'd buy such a product.

If it's affirmative, then have the product made and start selling it via telephone from your kitchen table.

Don't spend any money on anything until you have enough sales for positive cashflow.

That's it.
