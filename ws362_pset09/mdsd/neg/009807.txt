Paper is appropriate in the title, the characters are utterly 2 dimensional as is the story.  Painfully dull with nothing to interest you in any further interaction with the characters.  I kept waiting for the good part and it never got there.  While parts of the book seemed to foreshadow greatness, it simply never developed.  The heroine is an utter turn off, by stages either seeming oblivious or dense.  The writing leaned toward poetic and could have set off a better story well
