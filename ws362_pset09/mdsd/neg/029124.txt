I was looking forward to reading this book on what I thought would be a keen insider's look at the Cuban missile crisis, and was somewhat disappointed.  I realize that RFK was not able to complete the text, and perhaps that is reflected in it's length (100 pages of narrative).  A large part of the printed material, about 1/3, is made up of supporting documents.  I had hoped for more detail about the minute-to-minute events of those 13 days.  The strength of the book is its undeniably interesting topic and author.  There was insight to the crisis that I had not previously known, and reading it here was interesting and informative.  For a mid-1900's buff, this might be one piece of a collection and its uniqueness may prove worthwhile.  This is the first book I read on the Cuban missile crisis, and I am left wanting a lot more
