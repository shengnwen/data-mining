 A strange and unsatisfactory work by two authors, this feels very much like
 two books packaged as one. One of the books reads the like work of a health
 nut, an extended panegyric on the joys of tea, primarily the health 
 benefits. The second book is a long rant about the evils of growing tea in
 Assam and the part the British had in this. 
 
 Both these books are not 
 especially inspiring; for example the rant against the British would have
 been a much more worthwhile work if placed the supposed evils of the 
 British in context, comparing what they created to what had gone before and
 to India outside the tea plantation. A chapter towards the end claims to 
 make some attempt to provide a balanced viewpoint, but still does nothing
 to actually place the situation in context; instead it simply treats us to 
 a &quot;he said, she said&quot; view of history.
 
 The book included two or three interesting points, for example: 
 * Introduction of tea in the west contributed to public health because it 
 resulted in boiled water being drunk; 
 * Likewise it contributed to a substantial reduction in drunkenness because
 it could be drunk all day without side effects:
 But really wasn't worth the hassle of wading to the dreck to get to them.
