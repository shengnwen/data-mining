I thought this book was terrible.  I don't understand why people think this author is so amazing (unless they have really low IQ's).  Yes the subject matter was interesting but the delivery was very poor.  I showed it to a friend of mine and she said, "She writes like she learned to write from watching TV."  The novel is all dialogue and very little description, which doesn't equal up to an interesting read for me.  There was little suspense, I was not sympathetic to the main character, and the attempt at romance was a joke.  You want some real suspense in a mystery revolving around the legal system?  Go read Grisham
