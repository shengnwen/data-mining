I picked this up after seeing Bookslut cite it as one of the year's best reads. 
The brief premise for the book sounded ok so I took a gamble. 
Half way through the book, which was pathetically slow going, the only "thin" thing going on is the plot. Not that there is one. 
Davis seems to get some major names dropped in-line with hers, so maybe -although doubtfully, I'm missing something. Or maybe she just swung and missed (big time) with this particular novel and her previous work is (at least) good. Although I'm not excited to give it a try based on this vapid effort. The occasional well written line and almost vaguely interesting characters (with no story though) but hardly worth a gamble. Or a dead tree.  
All in all an unreadable book that is hardly the best of anything, let alone a stand-out for a year's worth of books. Try Simon Ings' _The Weight of Numbers_ for the *easy* winner of that prize.
