You have to give kudos to Ms. Sher, she really does pull out all the stops on trying to figure out what you want to do with your life.  I fit into the last category of her book, those for whom "nothing interests me" was said to describe.  While she's quite blunt on the causes, she dosen't really give any concrete help on what to do about it.  And her suggestion to just remember a time when you DID find things interesting...well, if that helped I wouldn't be reading her book in the first place.  What if nothing interested you back then, either?  I mean, really?  She's very long on the theory and "pull yourself up by the bootstraps", but very short on what to do when you haven't the foggiest on what to do.  I had very high hopes for this book, and it was very disappointing
