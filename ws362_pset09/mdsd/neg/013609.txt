I bought this book because our County library system had no copies...now I see why. There are many more entertaining and better written books in this anti-romantic western genre (if it is a genre). I am not a big reader of westerns but BLOOD MERIDIAN by Cormac McCarthy is high on my list of all-time favorites. I got this book because the author had just came out with a new historical novel (MARCH about Sherman in the Civil War) that has received good reviews. I have read some other books by this author and never knew he'd written a western.
    The first chapter grabs you with good writing and fast action of the sex&violence variety. Then the rest of the book drags on and on about the suffering of a fairly whiney, uninteresting lot of folks who try to make a go of the little town of "Hard Times". I had to force myself to finish it
