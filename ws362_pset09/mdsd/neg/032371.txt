There's a lot of fluff and useless opinions littered through out the book. Some references to researched material were made but the author didn't expand on them too much. For a person who had never done any reading on this subject matter will find this very easy to read and will have a general understand of what book they should buy next :). For the rest of us that demand more, this book doesn't cut it
