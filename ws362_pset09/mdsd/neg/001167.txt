This book, although broad in scope, fails to cover important aspects with enough depth.  It is a hefty volume, close to 900 pages, but you would expect to have a lot more information available in such massive space, but most of it is blank spaces and big titles and subtitles.  In fact, most of the information available here is available in the Excel help and MS Office support website (free).  So, if you are looking for a printed version of Excel's online help, go for it, but if you are trying to find in-depth information and guidance, this is not the book for you
