Reading this book was like driving the interstate from point A to point B, exiting every ramp, driving around the countryside and then on-ramping again only to wonder when the end-point is reached why the journey was begun at all. I admit, I'm not a fan of half-page sentences, and there were far too many for me in this slow-moving, tedious misadventure. I admit to feeling some sympathy for Jackson Brodie, a sad plodding investigator who even his ex-wife beats up, but had little feeling for the other characters. Ms. Atkinson writes well and can turn a phrase, but for me, most of the phrases weren't worth turning. This book read much longer than its length and only sheer determination caused me to finish it. If you're looking for a well-written work of literary fiction where the journey means more than the plot, this may be a book you'd like. But if you're looking for a gripping mystery taut with suspense, keep looking. Maybe it was personal preference, but CASE HISTORIES just wasn't my cup of tea
