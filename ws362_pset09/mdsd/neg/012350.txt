There are about 20% power thoughts in this CD/Book and rest are unpractical nonsense.  Nonsense like:

"I love every cell of my body"
"Let the universe's solution come to you"
"I am decisive in my decisions.  If I make a poor one, I'll just make another one."

I guess if you are completely foolish or just ignorant, this book will not help you much.  Your mother probably gave you much more and better advise than this book.
