This book was terrible.  I couldn't believe how bad it was.  It was very out of date and made no sense.  The directions are very hard to follow and it doesn't give nearly enough details.  This didn't work for me at all.  My birdhouses kept falling apart!!!  I would highly suggest another book to replace this one, or better yet, you can have mine because I won't be using it
