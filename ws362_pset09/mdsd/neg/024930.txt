The sad reality is that year after year fewer American students are going into the fields of science and the best students (and teachers) are increasingly brought in from overseas. Most recently non-citizens in the U.S. have received more Phds in the sciences and engineering than citizens. 

The fact that (un-)intelligent design is given a sounding board or that idiots like Phd theologians are pining on scientific theory shows how far we've fallen behind. In a generation or two moronic ID theories will vie hand in hand with New Age idiot beliefs while leadership in real science and technology migrates to Europe and Asia.

Shame
