First of all, i wasn't sent out here by the "Illuminati," i couldn't tell you if they really exist or not.

But I will tell you that Jim Keith died because he broke his knee and didn't go to the hospital when it happened, he died of a blood clot during surgery.  (...)

Persoanlly, I believe that a few of the things Keith has brought up in this book are correct.  I'm sure there is CIA experimenting and other crooked things going on, and i think microchip implants are a bigger threat than people realize.  But that does not mean that this should be looked at as a gospel
