What a waste of money.  This book is lame, inaccurate and boring.  The author just rehashes most of his material from other biographies and uses very unreliable sources, and I use the word loosely.  Jo Jo whoever she is, seems to have a major ego problem since every man, including Paul Mccartney, wanted her and Linda was insanely jealous.  This nobody (Jo Jo) condemns the Mccartney's for drug use, but talks about her own insanely outrageous drug addiction where she's stealing for drugs and it seems making up stories to sell to this hack of a writer for this useless book.
