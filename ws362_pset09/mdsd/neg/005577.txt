What would you think of a rock "scholar" who says that Queensryche's Operation:mindcrime is a science-fiction opera? This person is way too lost and greatly uninformed. Cut to the chase. More than a history of heavy metal, what this dishonest book really offers is an open love declaration for Metallica. Each and every idea or happening in the book has to be related to that band. Remove all the Metallica related information and you will get maybe 3 pages about other bands. The book is light and shallow because the information is nothing but common knowledge for any metal fan. Summarizing: this a Metallica worship biography publication disguised as "the history of heavy metal.
