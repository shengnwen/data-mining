I have recently finished this disaster of a novel for a college honors course "Disability through Autobiography."  While attempting to read this book, my frustration took over and in a couple of instances, resulted in the book being thrown across the room.  Much of the book seems a criticism of those that are not blind as well as the depictions of the blind by those who are not blind, namely authors and Hollywood directors.  I can think of a much better topic for a book than nit-picking at random quotes in movies, books, and social groups.  Kleege seems to only show the ability for a blind person to criticize those who are not blind and may not completely understand what blindness is.  Although I have taken many courses that focus intensely on accepting those with disablilities in society, I find it very difficult to accept severe cynicism no matter what disability the author may have.
