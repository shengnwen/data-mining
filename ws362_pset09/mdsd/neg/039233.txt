If you are already familiar with the idea of cooking for a day, and eating for a week or month, then you will likely be disappointed with this bland and boring cookbook.  The best recipes in it are uninspired versions of spaghetti sauce, chili, and casseroles.  These are all concoctions that you probably already have recipes for, and could just double and freeze.  This cookbook also needs serious editing.  The author repeats recipes in several sections, and often has inaccurate measurements for her ingredients.  Save yourself some money and buy a traditional cookbook instead.
