I am interested in quick, easy salads, but these were too complicated for a novice cook such as myself.  And after a long day at work in the emergency room of a major city hospital, I don't have time for the exacting  and time consuming prep work.  I cook to relieve stress, not add to my own.   Even the dull quality of the photographs, didn't enhance my desire to make  any of the salads.  I have the chef's cookie AND chocolate book and were  were PLEASED with those, thats why I purchased the salad book,  unfortuneatly, I was very disappointed. Maybe I'm just a baker at heart.    I guess I'll stick to chocolate as a major food group
