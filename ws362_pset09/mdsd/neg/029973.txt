I flipped through this book in about 10 minutes and did not get many usable ideas from it. Some of the projects seemed like they would take forever to do for even a medium sized wedding. Some seemed pretty expensive. If you like Martha Stewert and Design magazines, you might like looking through this - but otherwise just flip through it at the bookstore. Its not worth the money
