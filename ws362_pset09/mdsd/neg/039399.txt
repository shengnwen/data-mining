I'm a new dad and received this title as a gift from a friend--thinking I might see "myself" in the book. My wife and I live and work in the Bay Area (the setting for the book), both hold down jobs (cost of living is outrageous here) and often feel utterly overwhelmed by trying integrate a new child into our lives and still make ends meet. I would give anything to have nothing more to do for an entire year than schleep my child down to Royal Grounds in the BabyBjorn every morning to people-watch and then go home to watch SportsCenter and eat PBJs. After a few chapters I wondered: "When does this guy go to work? And who's paying for those dinners at Chez Panisse?" This is not my reality at all nor of any parent I know. And that peeing in a cup business is just gross.
