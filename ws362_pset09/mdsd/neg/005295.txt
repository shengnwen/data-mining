If you have read about the Civil War in depth you will find this book maddening. The stories lurch between naming the regiments in a battle line to skipping over large portions of each battle. There seems to be no rhyme or reason in the approach to the information. I suppose I expected a battlefield book that would give me a topographical feel for the battle where in reality the bulk of the book is a synopsis of larger events and in some cases the battles themselves. 
Another problem I had with the book is the general point of view that the Yankees were a bunch of bumbling drunkards who by happenstance were successful and the Confederates, especially Lee, were brilliant, noble leaders who at critical moments the fates intervened to ruin their otherwise perfect battle plans. I literally had to reread the last page of the Gettysburg chapter four times to finally come to the conclusion that the author states the Lee won the battle!
