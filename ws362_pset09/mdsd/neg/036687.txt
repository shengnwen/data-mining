First, the review by Ed Cambell (above) is terribly unfair as he is listed in this book as assisting in the final product.

There are parts of the book where the chapter fails to address the "questions" that appear at the beginning of the chapter. So, some of it is incomplete. So, while the description of some chapters tell the reader what the chapter is about, you can finish the chapter and find that it did not live up to its description.  This is very odd.

Also, while the author has some very interesting insights, he interprets some lines of the palm is some fairly offbeat ways.  If you have been reading palms or have been reading a compendium of palmistry books, you will fine this book a little strange
