In many ways this book is just as interesting as previous books in the series. Adams humor is in tact and will have you snickering fairly often.

The main problem is that of the overall plot. It is unsatisfying and pessamistic. Not just the ending. Tricia Mcmillian or Trillan turns from being a likable and symathetic character to somone who uses people and makes them clean up her mess. It is a heartbeakingly unfit end to a series I have such fondness for. This is compounded by the fact that the late Douglas Adams wished to write a sixth book after this one but never got around to it. 

At this point it is better to consider the fourth book the final guide since it has such a satisfyingly beautiful end. For those who love the works of Adams should read it anyway, since it is well... a douglas adams book. Just dont be to dissapointed when you are dissapointed
