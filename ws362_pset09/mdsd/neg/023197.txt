This book is embarassing.  Even worse than Icons of Evolution.  What he presents as science is mostly a mix of ignorance and outright lies.  There are many sites by real scientists which expose Wells' errors and fabrications step by step (Panda's Thumb is a good one.) Anybody who is unfamiliar with the actual scientific literature on evolution would be well advised to visit one of those sites and at least begin the process of self education.  If you do, you will quickly see how unreliable Wells is as a science writer
