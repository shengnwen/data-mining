I purchased this book on the recommendation of a woodworking magazine writer I have come to respect.  Though the book is on architecture I can see how many of the principles apply to furniture making as well.  I understand what this author is saying, but sometimes thought that his geometric "hidden" relationships were somewhat stretched.  I think I could probably do the same thing with any building if I looked at it long enough.  It sometimes felt like a real tough read for me (it certainly helped me go to sleep many nights).  Given this book appears out of print and he hefty price I paid for it, I would certainly look elsewhere if you are coming from the same direction I came from on the purchase.  An understanding of the golden ratio, shadow lines and looking at some classic pieces (shaker, federal, etc.) will probably yield equal or better benefit to your own furniture design making.  Though out of my league, I would stretch to say the same exact thing to an architect
