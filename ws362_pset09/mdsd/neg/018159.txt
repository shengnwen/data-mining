There were things that I both liked and disliked about the book. Gordon W. Allport did a good job at showing you that prejudice is in your life from the very beginning till the very end, no matter who you are. Bringing up the nature vs. nurture debate numerous times made you really think about your own experiences and how you relate to the different situations he is bringing up. At the same time, the book had a tendency to become extremely repetitive and thick to read through. I felt that it got overwhelming and notably boring many times throughout the book, but when you thought back to what you read, you were amazed at what you got out of it. I don't think I would advise anyone to read this book, unless they are planning on taking the book a very little bit at a time, then coming back and picking it up again where they left off
