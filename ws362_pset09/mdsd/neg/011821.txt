This book is very poorly written. I don't know how it got past editors, but it is full of grammatical errors (about 5-10 per page), and unfortunately the errors get in the way of reading the material. Explanations are also poor, and knowledge is assumed without prior explanation. They even describe files that are not in the book itself, but are only visible from a web site! Some sentences make no sense at all. The text sometimes refers to the wrong figures. However, they do try and be comprehensive, and cover a huge amount of practical material. It is short on theory or any justification for many of the assertions they make. Some almost throw-away comments indicate they know their stuff well, but this book is very much for advanced practitioners only. I can't help feeling that some of it was directly transcribed from notes they made to themselves when they were bored in meetings. They tried to use previous projects as real-world examples, but the examples are so complex that you can't follow them unless you have expertise in various areas already (e.g. OC-48, OC-192, ATM, etc)
