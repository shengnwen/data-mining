Bishop Spong, I have this much to say. Either you don't know of all the information that is out there, or you have chosen to ignore it. A case in point is the Institute for Creation Research. To state that the planet is billions of years old without proof is like making something up out of thin air. ICR has plenty of information that makes the world only six thousand years old, not millions or billions. Their exhaustive research has been consistent and proves this. In fact, it has actually backed up Genesis 1, where God created the earth and all the flora and fauna in six literal days. This information at hand not only strengthens the faith, but eliminates the need to change it "or else it will die".

To switch BC/AD to BCE/CE is an old gnostic heresy redressed for the "enlightened modern mind." There is no need to do this. He does this to separate himself from orthodox theology.

Furthermore, Spong is self-aggrandizing and your typical self-serving leftist. He thinks Christianity should be reinterpreted through his vision (and those of his associates). His "faith" is definitely not in line with the canon of Scripture when everything is taken into context.

This is a book that I could not finish -- nor do I intend to
