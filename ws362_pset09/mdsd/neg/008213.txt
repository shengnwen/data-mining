Other reviewers have given the story outlines so I won't waste time repeating them.  

Suffice it to say, thank goodness I borrowed this from the library rather than spending actual money on it.  I have enjoyed Davidson's "Betsy" books over the years but these stories come no where near the level of those books.  Perhaps if each of the stories were longer and more developed - and eliminated a lot of the gratuitous sex - I might have enjoyed them better. As it is, I was not disappointed when I finished the book, only surprised that I had actually finished it
