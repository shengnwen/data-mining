M. Night Shyamalan's Lady In The Water was a bit disturbing.  As I was reading it, I tried to read it from a children's perspective.  I found that the content would have completely freaked me out as a child.  I'm certain that with the simple mind of a child, I would have focused only on those odd things living in my back yard, and not on the only small part of the book that focused on something positive.  That being, that if I become a "vessel", I will do something great in the world.  If I had children of my own, this is not a book I would choose for them to read.  I could hear it now, "Mom, do we have these scary creatures in our back yard?"  The other thing I noticed was the extreme waste of paper.  The author could have fit the entire story on one page.  Some might call it art, but thank goodness I am not an environmentalist, or I would have additional complaints added to those I have stated.  I believe a book written for children should trigger their imagination in a positive manner.  It shouldn't cause fear and anxiety of things that don't exist, giving them thoughts that, they might.  There is truly enough evil and fear in the world for kids today.  All they have to do is see the news, a newspaper or hear the adults around them talk about things going on in the world.  Unfortunately, there is also the World Wide Web that with one click of the mouse will take kids to scary places.  With the world we live in today, I feel that people who write books for children have a responsibility in looking out for them, writing something that will help them grow in a positive manner.  Not write things that will cause fear, doubt, anxiety, frustration and anger to just name a few.  The world will continue to decline in goodness as long as outside influences remain evil
