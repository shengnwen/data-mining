Picked this up based on a "Oh, you like China Mieville, you'll like this" recommendation.  Big mistake.  The prose is bland, the characters are universally one-dimensional, the plot "twists" are stunningly obvious throughout, and the whole thing feels like the quality of writing you expect to pick up at a 4th grade bookmobile stop.  I read through the first story, "Victoria" with rapidly dwindling interest.  Only because I felt it unfair to judge the book on less than half of the read did I bother reading through the second story, "Hottentots" which is no better (and in many ways worse) than the first.  

Steer clear of this one.  I'm sure you could find worse things to read, but it'd take effort
