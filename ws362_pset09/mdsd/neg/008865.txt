If I thought I could get my money back I would have returned this the same day I got it, however, with the shipping charge I would have broke even.

This book has little to do with fantasy art, in fact 2/3 of the book is BASIC art knowledge that is presented better in other books. The last third of the book does give various fantasy scene examples with brief information on some of the elements in the scene (ie: water reflection, distance colors etc), again all basic art knowledge.

Anyone with a passing knowledge of art and/or digital art should stay away from this book, there is absolutely nothing redeeming about it.

I got burned ...

PS. search online for fantasy art and find the free online comunities, there you will find a wealth of information, unlike this book ..
