I bought this book before I got my iPAQ in the hopes that it would give me a head start on using it, but there isn't enough detail on any instructions to actually be able to use the manual.  For example, it says includes Windows Mobile 5 model info, but when I wanted to find out how to adjust the Program vs Storage memory slider, it only refers to previous Windows versions.  Also, there is a lot of information on how to use your iPAQ phone, which of course I do not have the phone version.  Basically a useless book
