In grad school I learned that there was a statistically close correlation between teachers' salaries and alcohol consumption in the US.  Unfortunately, there is no "causal" relationship between these two sets of data.  So, close correlation or not, the relationship is meaningless.  That's the problem with this book, there's lots of data, but little in the way of interpretation to help you believe the data enough to put your money on it
