My husband & I bought this product after reading the reviews on Amazon, so we thought it would be OK for residents of New York state. However, before you buy it, you should check with the laws of the state you live in, because in New York state, it is now our understanding that a Notary cannot sign & witness a Will. We completed the information on the Will. We had to cut & paste a part of it, because it left out information on my husband's Will. My Will printed all OK, but his had empty spaces no matter how many times we tried to print it. After the final paste, we went to find a Notary. We went to banks, and to the town hall, and everywhere we were told none of the Notaries would sign for a Will. One Notary told us she'd lose her license if she did. Finally we checked on line at New York laws, and based on the information there, we now have an appointment with a lawyer to make our Wills. So for us, we couldn't find any Notary to notarize our Wills.
However, this program did help us formulate & organize a rough draft of our Wills. We are much more clear about what we want when we speak to the lawyer
