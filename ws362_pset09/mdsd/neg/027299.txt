I absolutely loved two of Lisa See's other novels: "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan" and "Dragon Bones" and recommend both of them highly - she is an incredibly talented writer. 

That being said, I had very high hopes for this book but was disappointed. The one-hundred year odyssey of her family is indeed fascinating and the amount of research she did is evident. The emotional journey she must have encountered while writing the story is palpable. As with the above-mentioned novels, you feel like you know her characters and get such a sense of their surroundings- the sights, smells, and tastes of their lives. On the flip side, however, this novel was just too packed with details. It felt like she tried to cram everything in. Certain chapters certainly could have been cut out entirely from the story and it would have had the same meaning and effect. 

It should have focused more on Fong See and his life as opposed to then focusing on his childrens' lives and going on and on from there. His story is undeniably both interesting and troubling- it depicts "American" prejudice, racism and the difficulties facing minorities in this country.  However, it would have been more poingnant if it stood alone as the focal point of the novel.
