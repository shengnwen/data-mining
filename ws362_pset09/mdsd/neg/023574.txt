This book was a total disappointment.  It didn't tell me anything different from the information that I received free from my hospital.  I was so frustrated when I got home from the hospital and I had read this book about a month before my daughter was born.  The best advice I can give is to see a lactation consultant at the hospital where your child was born or see if you can have someone come in and actually help you have your baby latch on.  The book has zero information as to how to wean your child as well.
