...I have to admit that I was quite disappointed. This book issuch a banausic tripe that I couldn't even finish it. If yourbackground is not in finance or if you have no clue as to what Portfolio Managers do, you will find this book somewhat interesting, but if you are like me, and you know a little bit about the stock market, you'll be truly disappointed. The story doesn't have a high, it doesn't get to a climax whatsoever. The story goes on to describe the daily life of an unknown Portfolio Manager. And it does just that. Each chapter starts with &quot;It's monday.....&quot;.  As for style is concerned, I'm just coming off reading &quot;The Tortilla Curtain&quot; from Tom Boyle and let me tell you, Molly Baker is no match. The words are uninspired, boring just like the story. It seems that Molly Baker has a technical writing background and it shows in the book. Nice try though
