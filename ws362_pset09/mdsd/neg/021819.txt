I watched as much as I could stand on PBS before concluding this was not a classic 19th century novel unknown to me but a poor recent imitation, and came online to verify that.  Anyone who is enjoying watching this has presumably never seen anything based on a really good novel, like those by Dickens, Dumas, or even Wilkie Collins. What ****!  I refuse to waste my time even to see it through to the end.  This is only for people in the current generation raised to observe frequent violence rather than intelligent plot and conversation.

It is not terrible, but not worth watching if you have anything at all worth doinng with your time
