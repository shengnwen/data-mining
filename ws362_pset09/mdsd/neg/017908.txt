When I bought this book I thought I was getting a simple living book about how to cook beans. I guess I should have read more about it in amazon, but it reminds me of 1960s hippy commune vegetarian cooking. Not what I had in mind. A lot of soy, tofu, honey and all that. I wish someone would write a book about plain cooking that uses beans and meat
