The copy I received does not have Geoffrey Brooks' name anywhere about it, though I would guess he is the translator.  The author is given as Albrech Wacker.  In the prologue, the author says "After the passage of so many years it is inevitable that many of his memories had become blurred and that only his most traumatic experiences had remained crystal clear in his mind, and the biographer was left to join up these pieces of information and to sort them into a coherent and readable narrative."  In other words, the author does not even claim factual accuracy.  He further indicates that 'Sepp Allerberger' is a pseudonym.  This is silly, because as a winner of the Knight's Cross, the protagonist should be fairly easily identifiable to any enthusiast willing to do the shovel work, assuming 'Allerberger' was one actual person.  Knowing what I do now, I would not have purchased this book, which I can only classify as a fairly good war novel
