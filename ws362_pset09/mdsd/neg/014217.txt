Most of the information in this book is common sense. Saying that all pregnancies are different and that juggling two (or more) kids is a challenge isn't exactly earth shattering news. Very few of the subjects in this book are really explored in depth. I agree with the reviewer who said this book is like something you'd expect from a magazine. It hits on several good topics but doesn't really say a lot about any of them. I got more out of re-reading the books I had with my first pregnancy. This book felt like a waste of time. I don't really think it's worth the money
