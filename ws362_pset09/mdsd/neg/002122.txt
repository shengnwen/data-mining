While De Zengotita's ideas are all fine, his writing style is much too convoluted and very often it's difficult to figure out what he is trying to say.  He jumps around a lot and it seems as if he's rambling too much and that there isn't much organization to the book.  I did learn a lot from his ideas, which I thought were great, but his writing was quite terrible
