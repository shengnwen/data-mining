If you are an avid Jance fan and have come to like and expect fast-paced action and lots of excitement from the "Beaumont" books, don't buy this one.  I usually can't quit reading a Beaumont book.  I've stayed up well past my bedtime on many, many, many occasions because I just couldn't put the book down.  I will usually spend hours reading the whole book in one setting.  But this book.....well, it just doesn't cut it.  I've started and stopped it on several occasions to read something else and only came back to it when I needed "filler" reading.  For one thing, several characters have undergone major personality changes.  Beverly, who was previously sort of a mousy, quiet, obedient character has suddenly become fiesty and mouthy and full of independence.  And I scarcely recognized Lars. And the plot is too contrived and the whole Kiksadi, Quicksady, Quixote thing is really stupid.  If this is the first Beaumont book you've read, please read some of the older books.  You will enjoy them.  But don't read this one
