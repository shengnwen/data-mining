If you feel a burning desire to read this, then I would recommend borrowing it from the library or a friend, but certainly not buying it. I had read another book by this author that I was also unimpressed by, but the title of this novel caught my eye. However, don't be fooled - the references to Nancy Drew are to the book titles or minuscule details. For lack of a better word, this book is lame. The plot is practically nonexistent, and the main character is not sympathetic. The ending is absolutely ridiculous and comes out of nowhere - which should not have come as a surprise seeing as the whole book was strung together by seemingly irrelevant events that ended in quite possibly the dumbest and most unbelievable finish ever. Don't waste your money or time.
