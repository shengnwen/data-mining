While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book.  Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out?  Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book?  This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point
