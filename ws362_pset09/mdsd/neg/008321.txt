An unreadable book.  Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.   
I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it.  Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  Not in this case.  Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read.
It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last
