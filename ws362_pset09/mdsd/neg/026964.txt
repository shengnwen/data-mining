I usually give books the benefit of the doubt and stick with them even if I don't like the first few chapters.  I think I made it to page 30 on this one before I took it back to the library (so glad I didn't spend $ on this book!).  

I just couldn't stand the name dropping and superficial characters.  Their lifestyle is just foreign to me and not something that appeals to me.

Maybe the book would have surprised me but I expect it followed a predictable formula.  Guess I'll never know but I really don't feel like I missed anything very special.

"Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman" or "The Good Wife Strikes Back" by Elizabeth Buchan are books of the same concept (I assume) and quite enjoyable.  Stick with them instead.
