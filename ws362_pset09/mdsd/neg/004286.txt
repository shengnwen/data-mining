Bought this book after reading Fat Girl by the same author.  This book is not as good in my view because it is really a loose collection of personal essays , supposedly around a food theme, but not all of them are about this theme.  Some essays just don't belong.  This makes me annoyed as I wonder if it's one of those things where the publisher says we need more stuff to fill up the book so they threw in random essays.  Fat Girl, in contrast, is a short, sharp, focused book that gets its point across.  I couldn't finish reading this one
