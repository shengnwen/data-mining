This is a good book for someone who has never delved into the subject.  I find that it follows the same track as others in making the golden proportioning system fit about anything they want it to.  Probably the most disappointing thing is the book's assembly:  there are numerous overlays in the book that are not aligned with the images they are overlaying.  The deviations are from slight to almost 1/4&quot; - very bothersome to view. This is more of a problem with mediocre quality control and concern by Princeton Architectural Press.  It's good that the book is relatively inexpensive or I would have returned it
