This is one of the least enjoyable books on films you will ever come across.  Totally dry and bland, Haskell just runs through women's history in motion pictures with thumbnail descriptions of classic films and the like, never really giving us the essence of any major female stars or even good analysis on specific films.  Don't take my word for it - check it out at the library and read it for yourself.  Bet you don't finish it!!
