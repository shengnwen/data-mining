Mr. Erasmus's book is possibly the most widely known book on the subject of fats. 

Unfortunately, the book's wide currency and authoritative stance does not hold up in light of crucial facts.

It contains a lot of awesome scientific formulas, tables, analyses, and so forth, and would appear to be an authoritative, definitive "final answer" on fats, but there is much in it that is alarmingly inaccurate and misleading. His conclusions on polyunsaturates, saturated fats, coconut oil, butter, flax and canola oil are all haphazard and inconsistent with fact-based science (For example, read the findings of Sally Fallon and Mary G. Enig in their document on canola oil: http[...]).

Much of Erasmus's conclusions, especially about vegetable based polyunsaturates, reflect current dietary trends than anything else. Hemp oil, which he espouses, contains cannabinoids, the compounds found in marijuana: people eating hemp oil have failed a clean test for drugs in corporation testing. Moreover, the book promotes manufactured oils which Mr. Erasmus utilizes in his very expensive oil blend, which are high in polyunsaturates. 

For true science and data on fats, one would be better to turn to Mary G. Enig's "Know Your Fats," which is the real, pioneering guide on fats. Enig is one of the world's foremost lipid biochemists, and she provides specific science and how fats work in the body and what the body needs. Also of value is her book 'Eat Fat Lose Fat' and Bruce Fife's 'The Coconut Oil Miracle,' which despels a lot of the myths regarding saturated and tropical fats. Erasmus provides very little information about the properties of coconut oil. Enig and Fife present common sense and scientific logic in their research and delivering of facts, something which is lacking in Erasmus's book. Enig is clear, and consistent from beginning to end: Erasmus's stand is contradictory.
