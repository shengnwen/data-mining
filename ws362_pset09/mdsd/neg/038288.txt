The first part is riveting, about a woman misled, then abandoned.  The second is mediocre- interesting but monotonuos and long, the third part is throwaway and even though it is short, it is monotonous as well.  There is not enough humor: a story about a man who chases a pig for 150 pages should  be hilarious but it didn't even bring a smile to this reader's lips.  Don't  waste your time
