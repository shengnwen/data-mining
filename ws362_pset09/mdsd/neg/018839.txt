In a word: Great!
Love this book! Along with Rich Dad Poor Dad (Robert Kiyosaki) The Automatic Millionaire, also by Bach, These books have really changed my life.
I'm even starting to carry cash again! Ha! It's incredible that simple, little things like writing down your expenses on a daily basis really changes your relationship with money, how you spend your time, etc., can change not only your bank account but your financial I.Q.

I'm now going to enroll in Personal Finance classes and courses on Investing.

Thank you Mr. Bach for sharing your knowledge and inspiring me in so many ways.

Sincerely,
Felici
