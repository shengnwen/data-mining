Redcoats is a book for the historian or academician but not the general reader. Brumwell has one point to make, more or less, that the English soldier in North America adapted to the style of fighting needed during the French-Indian War and was effective. This does not require an entire book and does not make for an interesting one. Every page contains several footnotes which usually don't explain anything further and could better be placed at the end. I had to work to finish the book. But possibly I'm being unfair in that I was looking for a book to build on my understanding of the war and not such an esoteric treatment of one part of it
