Higgs is obviously a great writer, getting you caught up in the story but this turns to be your downfall as she twists the story to tragedy. It will make you cry. But it is such that I put the book down with less than 100 pages left to read and have absolutely no desire to continue the story...the story is beyond redemption for me. I'm sad I started to read it and got caught up in this fatefully disappointing story.
