While this book is a classic in American history it does not compare to modern histories. While Parkman selectively uses his evidence and omits key details the prose is very good. Overall though this book should not be used due to the inaccuracies.  He also omits the contributions of the Indians which was a decisive factor in the war. See either Crucible of War, Empires at war or The Scratch of a Pen.
