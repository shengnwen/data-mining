This was a very nice book, but I have to admit that it was not quite what I had hoped for.  I was looking for alot of information on Modern/Contemporary homes, more toward the 50's and 60's style, and from the look of the cover, I felt that was what was inside. Unfortunately, thats not the case at all, even the cover house was somewhat of a let-down inside. There is a little information on the square block metal homes of the 50's period, but most of the works are completely unliveable, done only for an original look (we are talking about 2 room homes shaped like cars)...if you are looking for an interesting conversation/coffee table book, this is nice, but not a necessity for the lover of modern homes
