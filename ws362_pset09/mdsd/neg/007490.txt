This book is based on introducing new lies to an already misinformed public (majority of Americans), and playing the loyal dog part to some, I'm a Muslim from Saudi Arabia and find this book full of lies and hatreds towards Islam. 
Either that or the writer is a loony, It's like asking Charles Manson to write a book about Christianity.
