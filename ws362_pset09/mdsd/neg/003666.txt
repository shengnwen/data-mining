While I would like to rate this book more highly because of the good information that it contains, I cannot recommend it.  It is extremely poorly written, and there is no bio of the author.  This is a controversial topic and non-vaxers are bucking the mainstream, which means that they need to be extra meticulous when making the case against vaccines.  There are better resources out there, skip this one
