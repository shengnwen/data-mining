For some reason, Amazon deleted my earlier review, although it was not obscene or offensive. So I'll restate it in really simple terms:
David Brock contends that critics of the mainstream media are all narrow-minded conservatives who simply don't want to read about social trends they don't like. This is nonsense. You don't have to agree with the Christian right - I certainly don't - in order to perceive liberal bias in the media. I would give some examples, but I'd probably get censored again
