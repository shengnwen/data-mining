I started to read it.  I tried and tried, but in the end I gave it up.  Maybe I don't have the "intellectual equipment" to understand this book, or most of the other fraudulent tripe of that era.  I felt ashamed of myself for a while - until I found this gem in the Penguin edition of Somerset Maugham's "The Summing up" (page 60):

"It is strange that one can ever have admired that prose.  It does not flow.  There is no air in it.  A careful mosaic constructed by someone without great technical skill to decorate the walls of a station dining room.  Pater's attitude towards the life around him, cloistered, faintly supercilious, gentlemanly, donnish in short, repels me.  Art should be appreciated with passion and violence, not with a tepid, deprecating elegance that fears the censoriousness of a common-room.  But Walter Pater was a feeble creature: it is unnecessary to condemn him with intensity."

Alright, I'm a philistine for not enjoying "Marius", but I can take some comfort in being in excellent company.
