I purchased this book in an attempt to improve my hill climbing, and endurance while riding.  I was highly disappointed when this book arrived on my doorstep when I started reading through it.  Don't be fooled by the exceprts you can read on Amazon, this book is meant for people who NEVER in their lives have seen the inside of a gym, or guys who have been on the Varisty Band Squad throughout High School and College, and were trying to get in shape for the prom because they were trying to bang the Football Captain's girlfriend while he was away winning the State Championships for their school.  The first few tips on the "Basics of Weight Training" chapter (consists of 30 pages) starts out with really insightful tips such as : Choosing a Facility, (Is it in a convenient location?), Is the facility clean and well laid out?,  Does it have a knowledgeable, educated staff?, What are the hours of operation?.  Well thank God the authors added these questions to my list, because I was looking for a public gym in the least convenient location, with dirty machines and idiotic employees which isn't open when I am available to work out. (Can you smell my sarcasm?, good, because I'm laying it on pretty thick)

It gets better when they show pictures of things that are very hard to figure out such as a bench, a rack of free weights, and a Weight Tree (USed to store barbell plates...I actually thought they were pedal trees, to hang my old Shimanos on))

Seriously, save your money, buy The Cyclists Traing Bible, and you will learn more about cycling fitness in the first few sentences than you will in this book...
I am under the assumption that people who have taken an interest in cycling, are not the 800 pound people you see on the news ready to die of morbid obestity, who need to get the walls in their apartment buildings ripped down, and lifted off their couch by a crane with ten empty bags of Doritos resting on their bloated stomachs.  Buy another book, or just buy a Cycle Ops trainer, throw it in your basement and buy a CTS Training video.  You'll get much more out of it
