OMG!! Did this author OD on speed or something. This is just a free flow of thoughts and makes no sense. Here's a good example, a new character (of which there are a million) has a one line comment, then the author goes on a 13 page tangent that as about 4 different stories going on, and then comes back to the new character and you're supposed to remember who the heck it is. I have never read such a mess before. I was hoping to use this for my book review column - but i can't recommend this book to anyone. Sorry, Minot
