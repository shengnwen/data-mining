I just finished Bookman's Wake.  I wanted to like it a lot, but that didn't prove possible.  The story roams all over the place, characters appear, vanish without comment and reappear.  And characters there are galore!  There must be about 500 main characters...well, perhaps I overstate that.  There are many, many characters whose names appear once and then are brought up again 50 pages later.  We are expected to remember who they are and how they fit in.  Some of them are very important to the story, but I couldn't remember who they were.  My husband had the same problem.  We kept asking each other "Who's ---?" "Is she the woman who....?"  "I don't know, maybe she's ---."

This book has some thrilling parts and interesting parts, but the whole is just a mishmash.  There are also stanzas of a clunky poem fashioned after Poe's The Raven.  It attempts to set out clues and character descriptions while remaining a credible poem and succeeds at neither.  

I loved the beginning 100 pages or so and then it fell apart.  I kept reading to the end, hoping to have some sense made of the thing, but one of the most interesting characters just fades away 3/4 of the way through and that's that.  

This guy wrote one of my favorite mysteries, Deadline, so I was greatly disappointed with this scrambled, overwritten novel
