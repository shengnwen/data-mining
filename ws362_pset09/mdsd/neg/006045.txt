This book is nothing but a slightly updated re issue of "In Praise of Hard Industries" with an Introduction issued as a paperback.  The publishers page even states right at the top quote:  "Previously published as In Praise of Hard Industries in 1989 by Houghton Mifflin".

You might want to read this if you haven't read the original, but I find it very deceptive indeed to re issue it with a different name hoping to entice readers of the previous book into thinking they are going to get something other than a few cosmetic changes here and there
