I pity those in strategic planning if this textbook is the best around.  I found it to be the most boring text I had ever read.  It was hard to get more than two pages read before snoozing.  I finally gave up and started reading the summaries, and then going back over the details if I had time.  In addition to the boredom, the political correctness had me groaning all the way through.  Exploration of Venus? - give me a break!

In spite of my disgust with the textbook, the workbook was actually useful.  It was to-the-point and much more understandable.
