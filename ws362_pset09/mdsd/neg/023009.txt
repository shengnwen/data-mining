I agree with the reviewer who describes Ms. Wells as overly generous to certain bistrots, brasseries and cafes, and I would strongly suggest getting a second opinion before choosing one based on her recommendation alone. That said, with respect to high end restaurants (i.e. 1-star+), she's generally dead on
