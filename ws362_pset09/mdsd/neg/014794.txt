I loved Jack Whytes first 2 books. This was horrible. I majored in journalism and creative writing and this book seemed almost as if it was written by someone else....perhaps a 15 y.o. who's been spending too many hours pouring through Penthouse. Anyway, what a disappointment. I was ready to recommend this series to my son but cannot now. I also notice some other negative reviews that have been submitted, (which I should have heeded) have been removed so buyer beware. Perhaps Amazon is removing negative reviews to sell more of this garbage.
