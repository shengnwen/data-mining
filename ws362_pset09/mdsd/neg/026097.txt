This collection of articles is a poorly edited collection of lesser known writings by academic authors, most of which border on incoherence.  The articles contained in this edition reveal that the authors and their editors are sorely out of touch with the dynamics of the pop music industry in their naive view of global trends and styles.  The articles are largely unremarkable, labourious to slog through, and filled with useless jargon that renders it neither suitable for academic nor lay readers.  Save your money, as this volume is not worth the exhorbitant purchase price.  I hate to offer even one star's endorsement of this sad excuse for a book
