this book sucks.  plain and simple.   i have some respect for the author, i've used his libnet and he's a funny guy.. but this book is garbage.  the last good thing mike schiffman wrote was libnet, and after that he figured why not just take it easy and write dumb books like this for the rest of his life, be a manager @stake and get paid way more than the researchers who are doing the actual work.   he goes into stupid crap like backdoors in inetd.conf, how outdated can you get..  what is this?  incident response to that crappy phrack article he wrote years and years ago about simple unix backdoors?  hah.  the real challenge here is for a real hacker to read the whole book and maintain his sanity
