This product was a waste of the obvious. The book is joke. How are you going to teach using the "adventures of eggbert" and making example which are irrelevant to your point? Plus most of it is theory and very opinionated. Very opionated. He himself is infected with the "money" meme. He constantly shamelessly promotes his book "getting past okay". The book was designed for a person with a reading level below average. Unless you like to read inaccurate outdated information don't waste your money. I would suggest to u don't buy this book . Try getting another book. One actually written with someone with a PHD in that department , not by a second rate hack who got removed from micosoft. After all wat does a programmer really know about pyscology compared to a PHD pyscology proffesor like David J. Liberman
