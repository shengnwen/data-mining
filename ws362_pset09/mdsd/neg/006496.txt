I usually enjoy Ann M Martin's books very much, but I'm not too impressed with the information in this book. A previous reviewer pretty much said it all- also I would not be happy to see an instructor that would let a collision almost happen. I know I didn't begin cantering for a few months after I began riding, as did most of the other riders my instructor trains. But I must say that the book has a wonderful writing style for that age group. =O
