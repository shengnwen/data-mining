**This review pertains to the audiobook version, not the print version.**  
The narrator (Mirron Willis) does splendid voice characterizations for all of the characters -American, British, Ugandan...  All except for the Scot, Nicholas Garrigan.  Willis makes the Scottish doctor sound mildly retarded or speech-impaired (or both?).  Unfortunately, since the doctor's voice predominates throughout the book, I just couldn't bear listening to the whole thing.  Too bad..
