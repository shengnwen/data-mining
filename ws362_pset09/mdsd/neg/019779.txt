I thought this book started very strong; it set up everything very well, and i could start to see the themes emerging from the work. But then the author decides to have these long-winded conversations with herself that are very hard to follow. She uses hyphens instead of quoation marks to represent dialogue. The major problem with this is she combines more hyphens when she breaks away from conversation to describe how the person is talking or to depict a scene taking place. Sometimes she doesn't even bother to start another paragraph when the dialogue starts back up again. So this results in a very confusing read as it's hard to tell if someone is talking, or if it's a scene, or could it be how they are talking, or is it an aside, or is it just a thought, or maybe this is a convo, and who is talking again, oh, maybe she is describing the surrondings....? 

It drove me Crazy
