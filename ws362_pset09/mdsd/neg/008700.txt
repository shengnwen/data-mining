I agree with the first reviewer of this book, this is not hoodoo! The author seems to have created a perfectly silly follow up to her first book. I would say that it's probably wise to avoid most llewyllyn publications all together, they are sad attempts by new age authors to mass market nonsense to eager readers....stick with Hyatt, Yronwode, and Haskin
