This book was recommended to me by an inspirational speaker who spoke at my college. I can see how this book can be meant to inspire, especially the stories pertaining to "live your dream". Yes, this book does give you hope and to a certain degree persuades you to break the shackles which you have created for yourself; to break the rut which sometimes becomes our lives. Having said that, some stories were (to be perfectly honest) cheesy. Corny, even. "The Hugging Judge"? Come on, that sounds more like a scene from a C grade kid movie. Even so, good read at times, inspiring also .....at times. Short concise stories. Worth a read if you are willing to forgive the extra extra dose of too much sugar in the sou
