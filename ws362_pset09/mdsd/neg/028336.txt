I'm giving this book two stars instead of three because the author felt compelled to waste so much white space on her leftwing, feminist agenda.  Ms. Harwood has published several articles on the supposed sexism of Latin textbooks, and so litters her book with largely pointless textboxes containing "gender-specific historical tidbits" which she calls "Hysteria's Herstory." (Something tells me that doesn't have quite the alliterative ring the author intended.)  

Likewise, what Ms. Harwood refers to as "the Christian Church" of the so-called Dark Ages is in reality the Catholic Church.  Presumably, the correct identifier didn't sit well with her progressive sensibilities.

For an agenda-free discourse on Latin, get the Dummies book or stick with Wheelock's Latin 6e
