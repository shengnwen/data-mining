This is just a PR piece for the Disney company, a way to build hype so more people will buy their products and see their shows.  I was hoping for some nuts &amp; bolts advice on designing theme parks and theme park rides.  Everybody knows how to brainstorm;  everybody knows the importance of color and lighting and music;  everybody models on computers before they make physical models.  What do Imagineers do that's different?  Do they have special techniques for brainstorming, or for choosing colors, or stage lighting?  The answers are not here.  Also, what have Imagineers learned from their mistakes?  If you take this book at face value, Imagineers have never made mistakes;  everything they've done is perfect, and any criticism leveled at Walt Disney world was later retracted or countered
