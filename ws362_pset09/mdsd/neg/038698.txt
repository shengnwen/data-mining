I also purchased this book from seeing the author on the news.  I felt depressed after reading this book and it did not cover what I thought it would.  The author talks about drugs, physical and sexual abuse and later complains about going to counseling. It left me confused at the end.  This is not a book you would treasure and keep on your bookshelf for your children or relatives to read later.  I would actually be terrified if this book got into the hands of a teenager or child and embarrassed if guests were to think this is the kind of book I'm interested in.
