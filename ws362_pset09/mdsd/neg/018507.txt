I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.
