Wow.  This basically boiled down to a waste of about ( ) of the book's purchase price.  Before you buy, beware.  This would probably be a good book for you if you are just out of school or are just getting started in &quot;the biz&quot;. However, as an experienced musician who thought this  title might provide some helpful marketing tips and ideas, I was very  disappointed.  Its extremely basic.   Also, Weissman's idea of what  constitutes a local music market seems to be off as well-I would consider  Boston, or Portland or any of these cities major metropolitan areas-- not  just New York, LA, Nashville and Chicago.  At least 2 chapters are wasted  on the history of the music scenes of some cities, including those I just  mentioned-- how is this important to you if you live in a small  Metropolitan area, such as Harrisburg, where I'm at?  Also, as a former  Boston resident, I don't think Weissman really does the city's scene  justice-- major acts besides New Kids on the Block have been broken out of  Beantown-- look no farther than the Mighty Mighty Bosstones or Aerosmith.  However, there was some interesting, albeit vague, info about the Union,  Grants, and Artist in Residence programs. I would think that someone with  the qualifications of Weissman would be able to offer much more specified  info instead of vague statements such as &quot;Try to set up a meeting with  the Creative Director of an Ad Agency&quot;.  But, then again, maybe its  supposed to be more of an overview kinda book. If you're just getting  started, this might be a good book for you.  If you're out there doing it  full time, look elsewhere- there's not much I got out of this book
