What a shame. This book seemed so exciting when I ordered it. But this author doesn't understand musical theatre. He doesn't really know the art form; he just knows a bit about it. So much of the book is so condescending and so dismissive toward a lot of oustanding musicals. And there are so many small factual errors that I have to wonder if he's really seen some of the shows he writes about. Was there no one to proof this book? Did no one reading it know that there is no Oscar for &quot;best soundtrack&quot;? And in addition to factual errors, Singer also fudges the truth from time to time to support his pre-existing conclusions. He doesn't seem to have much respect for the art form, and from what I can tell from his book jacket bio, he's never worked in the musical theatre, so he has virtually no interesting insights into how musicals work. Though there is a bit of useful info in the book, there are far better books than this. Don't bother
