Save your money!!  Not even worth buying used.   If a field guide is going to be uncommon then it should be full of heart.  Lacking this it should have basic info with at least a chuckle.  I was left feeling MS Lichen never left her car and read better descriptions of Chickadees from grandma's diaries.   Do not be conned by Linda Feltner's good field sketches and the sales package.  This book is bought for the illustrations only
