What an awful book this is. On the pretext of telling women not to be preoccupied with their looks and weight, Wolf has written several hundred pages about women's looks and weight. Her intentions, I am sure, were righteous; but the "empowering" framing message fades away in comparison to the hypnotically graphic struggle-porn that forms the bulk of the text. As I read these horror stories about breast surgery and analyses of cosmetics advertisements, I had an all-too-familiar feeling of prurience. The cumulative effect was similar to that of the women's magazines Wolf deplores, but more inimical. I am a college-educated female with a history of mild eating disorders, and I closed the book feeling more insecure and depressed about my looks and weight than I had in years. In conclusion, anyone with a history of bulimia and / or anorexia ought to stay well away from "The Beauty Myth" unless she has total confidence in her immunity to triggering materials.

Another not-so-minor quibble: Wolf's chapter on "Religion" exposes her total ignorance of Christian doctrine, be it Catholic or Protestant. She writes from the premise that Christianity is anti-woman, apparently expecting that her readers will accept this common canard without any logical arguments to back it up. This further stains her intellectual credentials.
