After her mother's mysterious death in India, Gemma Doyle is sent to a boarding school in England. Gemma is troubled by her mother's death and the strange visions that she is receiving. At Spence Academy, she feels like an outsider until her magical powers manifest themselves in the ability to travel to another realm. Things unravel as Gemma has to separate evil from good.

This book is written in as a first-person-present-tense narrative, which makes it very awkward to read. The point of a novel is to tell a story, not to think it. Besides--who thinks in coherent sentences? There are several inconsistencies in the writing tense which should have been caught by the editor. 

The characters are at times inconsistent. They seem more like girls of the 21st century than the 19th. The girls can't seem to make up there minds whether to be 'blushing maidens' or not. One minute they are blushing at the mere mention of the word "chastity", and the next they are joking about sex over a bottle of whiskey. The general behavior of the characters would have been more realistic if the setting had been the 20th or 21st century rather than the late Victorian era. 

A weak point with this book is the magic itself. The sources are never fully explained, and suddenly finding Gemma flying up a staircase was disorienting. The idea was good, but all explanations were vague and confusing.

The entire novel is inconsistent and sensationalized. I felt as if Ms. Bray had created this novel then thrown in some corsets and etiquette to create a sort of modern, Victorian-Gothic, melodrama. The overall effect is weak and unsatisfying.
