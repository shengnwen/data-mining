I was in the mood for &quot;chick lit&quot; when I picked this book up, so was predisposed to enjoy it.  But although it had amusing moments, I was fairly bored throughout.  None of the characters are really defined, and the main character is derivative of far too many other books, television shows and movies.  There are better &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; ripoffs out there
