This book's tongue-in-cheek title led me to expect an entertaining and informative history of one of the world's great foods. I discovered, rather, an informative but tediously boring history of the rural peasantry  of Ireland, England and France in the 18th and 19th centuries. I can only  recommend the book as a potent soporific capable of curing the most  pernicious case of insomnia. If your sleep habits provide sufficient rest,  don't bother
