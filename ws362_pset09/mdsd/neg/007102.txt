I only wish I had not only the money back I spent on this book, but also the time I wasted reading it. A good book should inspire readers to think for themselves and form their own opinions on issues. All this book does is force feed the author's political leanings on the reader. Her spin on today's politics, in other words. Her view on today's issues is very naive and the story defies any sense of reality or belief. Don't waste your time or your money!
