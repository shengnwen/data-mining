I returned this book as soon as I received it.  I thought it was  overpriced for its small size.  I'd also expected the pictures to be irresistable; they turned out to be very mundane and cliche.  I've seen better amateur pictures taken by lab owners themselves.  Bottom line--I would have given this book 0 stars if it were an option
