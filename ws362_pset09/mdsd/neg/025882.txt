Brown Girl
Peer Review

To my Peers:


I would recommend Brown Girl to all of my fellow peers.  This is a story that shows many problems.  One was that most of us do not have positive remodels to look up to.  Therefore, we just go about our life without anyone to look up.  To the same exact way, the character in this story grew up also.  However, always someone came so that we can look up to.  However, that does not always happen to us.  So there are certain times or situations that are not the same as our life but most of the time we can relate to the work.  As a person in life. So we can really understand what the character was going through so we would be able to say that we would have done the same thing.  Therefore, we would under stand the story a lot better.  In addition, like in the story, we could do better in receiving feedback and using it in a good way .so; we can use that to improve our selves.  This would show that we understand what we are doing. And we can go further into detail in every problem in the book. And further understand what the character was going through.
