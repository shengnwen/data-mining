Every English major has one writer who is responsible for their journey into the field.  I have two: Muriel Spark and Kurt Vonnegut.  I am not the kind of guy who walks around pretending to be a writer; I am no writer.  I  do, however, love to read about what makes writers tick, what inspires them  to write.  This is one of the reasons I picked up this tiny book--I hoped  it would give me some insight.  I didn't.       The conversations, at  times, are interesting.  But it wasn't worth the cash I shelled out for the  79 pages.  If this had of appeared in a magazine, I would have read it and  not whined.  If this had appeared in a magazine, I wouldn't have wasted  over 10 bucks
