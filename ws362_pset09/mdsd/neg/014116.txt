  
This book is written entirely in bullet points and one-page "chapters" consisting of more white space than text. If it were subtitled "Positive Affirmations," rather than "Practical Solutions," I would not object. But I would also not have been misled into buying it.
  
The author has an informative website that I would endorse, and the content of the book is appropriate in that format. It would make a good give-away pamphlet to families in treatment.  As someone who truly is looking for practical solutions, however, I was disappointed that Postpartum Husband does not delve much deeper than, "Be patient and supportive."
  
And despite the title, the book gives surprisingly minimal attention to what a postpartum husband might do to take care of his own well-being while patiently supporting his emotionally struggling wife and fulfilling all of his other family and work obligations.
  
The book promises more than it delivers, which is unfortunate because there is a real need for advice directed to the practical-minded husband
