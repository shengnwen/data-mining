Based on all the positive reviews I decided to give this collection a try. The first story was great and I thought that I had discovered an exciting new writer! But boy, was I wrong! The rest of the stories are plain boring, consisting of disjointed prose that either fails to make any sense or is just very uninteresting. Some reviewers compare Link with Jonathan Carroll but while Carroll's stories also tend to the absurd, his prose is always interesting and his characters are so lifelike that they seem to jump off the page!

Apparently I am a dissenting voice but Link is clearly an author that is not for me
