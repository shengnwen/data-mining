I was disappointed with this book.  I enjoy popular physics writing and feel that Greene is one the best science writers around (as well as being a capable physicist in his own right).

Greene's earlier work the Elegant Universe was a classic.  This book, as others have noted, offers little new thought and appears to be a rehash of the author's previous work. 

Although not badly written it will probably only be of interest to readers new to this area.  On a side note the audio tape is well done.
