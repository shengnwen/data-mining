This books contains the basic information on style and fashion, but it is more a collection of quotes from various "experts."  If you know nothing about fashion, grooming, etc, this book would be useful.  But if you want to go beyond matching your T-shirt and jeans, then you should read something by Alan Flusser.  Overall I was disappointed
