 I don't know where to start with this book. I've been a Wiccan for over 20 years and this book is incredibly inaccurate. The author mixes in crappy fiction with " nonfiction" misinformation and distortions. The fiction part is so awful and stereotypical it's almost laughable. The author wrongly mixes Wicca with satanism and shows and incredble ( even for an evangelical Christian) LACK of knowledge about even the basics. Lovecraft INVENTED the Necornomicon and he was NOT a Satanist. You won't find those facts here. In fact what little factual information you COULD gleam from distinguising between the fiction and the nonfiction is hiding among the quagmie of disinformation.

The fiction is insulting. I have NEVER killed an animal in my rituals, ever. And the tone the author puts about " tolerance" is as if he's making the " evil" pagans mocking it. Make up our mind. Did you want to write a FICTION or a NONFICTION book? Not only that, but adding the crappy fiction makes his "nonfiction" look discreditable by association ( which, OC it is anyway).

Now I realize some Christians praise this book. They are blind and naive. Like others have said, want to know about Wicca, go to a Wiccan. This is akin to the KKK writing about African American history or a Neo-Nazi talking about Jewish customs. The bias is that blatant. Ironically the author says that Christians should be informed and not recite the same old 'satanic ritual abuse" evil claims, while he himself does exacly that, equating Wicca in his fiction and nonfiction with satanism. Folks, if you think this book will convince Wiccans about our own religion, you are sadly mistaken. Could you Christians just ONCE actually BE informed, not indoctrinated by this garnage
