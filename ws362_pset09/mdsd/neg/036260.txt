It is American pop culture which continues the horrible trend in the United States of idolizing consumerism and placing materialistic goals and possessions in front of human beings and how they are treated individually and collectively.  He would have us believe that bands like Nirvana communicate through their music some type of hippster leftist ideal (for kids).  This coming from a music exec, an individual who on a daily basis worked in a business segment which regularly abuses the naivete of its consumers (teenagers), all in the name of making a buck (or rather, millions of them).  It's disgusting.  I'm not going to waste more time on this trash, I already feel violated after reading 2/3 of the book (at which point I admittedly gave up and moved on -- there's no way the last 1/3 was going to save it, I guarantee it)
