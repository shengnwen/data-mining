This book is a poor attempt to use the good Atkins name to appear to be related with a true diet genius.  I was surprised when I read that Markham was not only NOT affiliated with Atkins, but Markham had no academic credentials to write this book. 

Chiropractors, who I don't trust, believe that they are experts at everything while they don't even like to mention that they are only chiropractors.  Real doctors have MDs after their names and aren't ashamed to use those initials.  Markham, like most chiropractors must be really insecure.  Since they are trained to straighten backs, for whatever that is worth, it makes sense.   

Markham lists a bunch of brands that he says he likes.  Paid endoresements are not very useful. 

Aurora said that Markham's bungee was cheap enough when better and more versatile units are sold at Big 5 and other stores for much less.  Is Aurora really Markham like Persnickety is?

If Atkins wasn't the real thing then Markham would not have used his name in the title
