Richard Booker in this book approaches the Bible from a Calvinistic, charismatic, and Premillennialist view point.  This is seen when he states on p. 77, that a Christian has been given supernatural faith and that it is impossible for a person to fall away from the blood covenant.  To support this he changes the author's meaning of Hebrews 6:4-6 quoted from the KJV, "...if they should fall away....".  The Greek of the original language as translated by George Ricker Berry should read, "and who fell away (past tense)."  Thus a distinct possibility of apostasy and not just a hypothetical thought which is impossible.  Booker states that humans inherit Adam's sin (p. 92, 96), implying total depravity thus requiring God to operate directly on the hunman heart which becomes God's faith given to the sinner and not the faith of the believer.

Booker also states that the Jews will rebuild the literal Temple in the latter days just before the return of Jesus Christ (p. 64), whom he renames "Jeshua Hamashiah" (p. 84).

While there are some good thoughts in the book, one must remember that Booker's approach to the Bible is through the preconceived theology of Calvinism and despensationalism
