I found this book to be schizophrenic at best. Not well written and an absolutely non-sensical storyline. The plot was rather dumb and dull, and I found myself not caring one whit about the main character in the book. I'm wondering if Ms Hodgson was perhaps a bit delusional herself when putting this book together.

I DO like well-done fantasies and mysteries...unfortunately, this was neither
