What "Amadeus" did for Salieri, Stewart's book does for Leibniz. If Spinoza and Leibniz were in the midst of a bitter divorce, this is precisely the sort of book Spinoza's attorney would come up with. Here's the method...

*Dig up as much dirt as you can on Leibniz's character, make him look like a scoundrel and a buffoon, and when one has no proof, either make insinuations or "leave open" the question as to whether Leibniz was guilty of additional flaws. In the most comical instance, Stewart insinuates ever-so-vaguely that Spinoza may have been poisoned to death by a certain rascal Schuller, whose ties of friendship with Leibniz may implicate the latter in Spinoza's death in ways that are never quite specified. Stewart also "leaves open" the question of whether Leibniz had a homosexual lover, though he never leaves it open in the case of the equally ladyless bachelor Spinoza, his hero. 

*Portray Spinoza as handsome and Leibniz as physically repugnant. We hear repeatedly that Leibniz looked like a dork when he walked, that his prematurely balding head bulged with some sort of disgusting protuberance, and finally read a strangely amused description of a "discharge of gas" in the philosopher's last moments that gave his attendant a headache. (Stewart also enjoys making fun of the outdated fashion sense of a 70-year-old man, which is one of the cheapest of cheap shots.)

*Admit in passing that Leibniz was "the last great universal genius" and "one of the two greatest philosophers of the 17th century", but then don't dwell on the reasons for either of these phrases being in widespread use. Chuckle as his machines break down and his efforts at court fall flat. Expose his philosophy as a "reactive" medieval relic haunted at every layer by an obsession with Spinoza, whom he can never hope to equal.

*On the flimsiest of evidence, assert that Spinoza hurt Leibniz's feelings so badly during their one personal meeting that Leibniz was filled with suppressed rage for the remainder of his life. Concoct an Oliver Stone-like scene of Leibniz jumping up from the table, enraged at Spinoza and demanding recognition from him. (Come on, you know that one's going to make it into the final film script.)

*As an additional technique, don't put all the criticisms in your own mouth, but let others do some of the work for you. Cite Voltaire to make Leibniz look stupid ("can a drop of urine really contain an infinite number of monads?") when the same drop of urine would also take on equally remarkable powers in the philosophy of Spinoza, Stewart's hero.

*Psychologize Leibniz as "needy," while avoiding any psychologization of Spinoza's actions. Let these shine in pure Platonic nobility.

Despite all of the above, I did enjoy some aspects of Stewart's book. It's always interesting when someone brings a lost historical period to life. What I missed in his book is any trace of Leibniz the "universal genius" and "great philosopher" to whom Stewart refers in intermittent throwaway phrases. Instead, what we find is Leibniz the awkward, gangling suck-up and pathological liar whose doctrines are presented as nothing more than a vulgarized sell-out of the more radical philosophy of Spinoza.  Stewart's sense of humor also tends toward the corny: abundant desktop computer metaphors and cheap plays for laughs whenever Leibniz's words coincide with the lyrics to present-day popular songs.

One could easily imagine the inverse to this book, written by a Leibniz fan with a grudge against Spinoza: "The Diplomat and the Outcast", perhaps. Spinoza could be presented as an antisocial invalid enfeebled by tuberculosis, cribbing his main ideas from Descartes, too cowardly to publish his own major work, obsessed due to "neediness" with provoking the religious authorities and getting a reaction out of them, and far behind his contemporaries such as Huygens, Leibniz, and Newton in generating concrete mathematical or scientific discoveries. In parallel, Leibniz could be portrayed as balanced and erudite, a philosophical revolutionary who managed to retrieve Aristotelian ideas for modern philosophy in a way that escaped both Descartes and Spinoza, co-inventor of the most important method in modern mathematics, someone who united theory and praxis and tried to engage in responsible political action rather than living a hermetic existence at home, and a generous man of the world willing to share his ideas with hundreds of correspondents across the continent. Such a book would teach us much about Leibniz and little about Spinoza-- the opposite of Stewart's problem. 

There is a reason that Spinoza and Leibniz are both so highly regarded for their intellectual achievements. Stewart gives us the most flattering possible portrait of Spinoza, while making Leibniz look even more stupid and ridiculous than Voltaire already tried to make him look (at least Voltaire didn't tell us that Leibniz was ugly and a geek, as Stewart with his high school cruelty does). It's a shame that he has so little sympathy for Leibniz, since this could have been a dramatic story of Spinoza's hitherto unrecognized lifelong influence on Leibniz's thought.

Despite extensive background research (and he did come up with some fascinating tales that I've never heard of before), Stewart shows a lack of philosophical balance or depth. He also falls into occasional research howlers (such as claiming that Descartes thought the *pituitary* gland was the seat of the soul, when it was actually the pineal gland; Descartes specifically denied that it could be the pituitary).

I enjoyed reading the book in the same way that I enjoy watching "Amadeus" from time to time. It brings a certain lost historical period to life, and in that sense is refreshing. It might even be fun to see Stewart's book turned into a film, so we could catch periodized glimpses of Amsterdam canals and Leibniz's baroque clothing. But no one takes "Amadeus" seriously either as music history or as  musicology, and no one should take Stewart's book seriously either as intellectual history or as philosophy.

Like most dust-jacket materials, the captions beneath author photos are generally drawn from material provided by the author. Stewart's caption tells us, with remarkable self-congratulation, that he has "retired in order to pursue a life of contemplation." I was surprised not to read that he's grinding lenses for a living
