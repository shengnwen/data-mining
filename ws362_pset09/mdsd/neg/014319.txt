This is, by far, the worst vocal selections I've ever bought!  And I've bought a lot of bad ones!  I was in this show two years ago and had a fantastic time(I played Nicely-Nicely)!  So I didn't hesitate to order the music, but when it arrived I found the selections chopped beyond recognition!  And not only are they chopped, but they're also simplified!  This book should be marked "Easy Piano!"  If you're looking for a good rendition of this music, spend the extra $20 and buy the score
