The lives of a cell  is an alright book that has a outstanding  information that you can use in everyday life. It has a lot of chapters in the book like every page there is always something important. The author Lewis Thomas did an ok job or arranging it. But I did not like the fact that  your learning something and all of a sudden something random comes up and you are back about cells. It seems like a very interesting book. I learned a lot by reading this. This is a type of a book for a 20 year old person who is interested in science technology and physics. Not a kind of a book for a 9th grader to be reading. But I give the author credit because even some things interested me and I am a very hard critic.  Lewis Thomas' book is a basically  about  a well written collection of essays. It views a biological life also people opinions on it. In most chapters it tells you about things that could happen that are bad. If something hit a cell and it could cause damage to your body. For instance they talk about germs, and pheromones things like that. The guy is saying threw out the book we must learn to have a more caring and protective attitude toward Nature and environment. (which I agree on ). In this book you learn about a lot of things like DNA, mitochondria and bacteria, pheromones,meningitis,diptheria things like that. It has a lot of biological facts and theories, but does not really make the reader understand. You need to have strong knowledge of all these scientific terms to understand some of the book. I would probably rate this a 2 because I need more knowledge to understand the concept on this book.
