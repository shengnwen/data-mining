I saw the book in the discount bin at the book store and I thought the title was cute.  I thought, well, the guy gotta eat so that's why he wrote a book so he could sell something to dopes and have enough money to eat...that should have been the whole title.  The book was awful.  The recipes were unappetizing, and the nutrition doubtful.  It would have been nice if the author, and I use that term loosely, just like the stools some of the recipes induced, if the author had given us the nutrition content of the paper it was written on...surely it is better for you than any advice they tried to put on you
