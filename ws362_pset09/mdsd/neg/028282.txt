There are many different opinions about this book. I did read Hotel Paradise but don't remember reading Cold Flat Junction, so that may account for the reasons why I had a hard time getting into this book. I have read Grimes' other novels and numerous Jury books, and I like her style of writing. This book is just not up to par with the others
