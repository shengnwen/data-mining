I found the book extremely helpful and am very grateful for the sharing of professional tips and techniques.  The author takes great pains to tell us that all the chefs she encountered at the CIA emphasised how important it is to measure all ingredients by weight rather than volume (cups).  Then, what do we find, but the recipes are all in cups with no weights offered!  How will the cooking/baking culture ever change if even this book does not practice what it preaches?
