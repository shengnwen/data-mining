I'd never heard of Ian Rankin, but the book reviewer on Fresh Air, Maureen Corrigan, happened to mention that she limited her reading of Rankin to one book a month so she could longer savor his stuff.   I don't if know this is one of his weaker efforts, but it would be difficult to motivate myself enough to try another.  Simply, while the prose and dialogue are generally adequate, the main character is both hackneyed and sketchily drawn.  He seems like a fictional detective, rather than a real and original presence.  Beyond this, the plotting is extremely lazy and incredible, with coincidental connections and meetings happening in London as if it were a village of a few hundred.  Alas, the villain is revealed at the end in the manner of a rabbit from a hat with no logical or clever foreshadowing, and a &quot;solution&quot; by the sadsack hero which is uninteresting and highly unlikely.  Followed this shortly later with Dennis Lehane's &quot;Mystic River&quot; and it took his clean, sharp, evocative prose to fully dissolve my disappointment.  Lehane will be revisited, but I think I'll lose Rankin's address
