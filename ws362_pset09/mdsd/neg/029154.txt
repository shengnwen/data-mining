This book is beautifully illustrated but not for the average upper elementary age child. The are lots of long and unusual words that will prove frustrating to the average 4th &amp; 5th grader.  It may work well for a read-aloud, but the momentum of the story will be lost by the time you stop and explain the meaning of so many words.  Considering the vocabulary, a high school student could easily enjoy and learn about creative writing from this book
