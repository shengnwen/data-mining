I had to read this book in grad school and lead my class in a discussion of the book-total flop because I hated the book and the rest of the class didn't.  I hated Tupperware mostly because it wasn't about tupperware or it's effect on America--it was all about the soap opera between Earl Tupper and Brownie Wise.  The title is totally misleading-where is the mention of tupperware's famous return policy?  What about the effect that it had on food and food preparation?  What about the copy-cats?  Tupperware could have been so much more.  If I wanted a soap opera, I would turn on the TV
