This book is composed of two stories.  The first, called Folded Hands is nothing short of brilliant.  Jack Williamson created a rather bizarre, almost tongue and cheek idea, that works well in this quick blast that had me laughing and feeling chilled all at the same time.  Williamson didn't take himself too seriously but the short story had some terrific ideas.  Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the novella.  The second story, for me anyway, felt weighed down by far too much dramatic dialog and unrelenting techno babble that dragged the story down.  The Humanoids idea -- that mankind must be protected from itself ,can't help but sound a bit silly in execution and in the second story, Williamson goes for the straight dramatic and it feels awkward.  Granted there are some brilliant ideas but they don't play out because the author is too busy trying to explain this bizarre science that can defeat the humanoids.  That in itself sounds like a parady but he plays it straight! When Asimov wrote robot stories he understood when not to take himself too seriously.  On top of that, I found it a bit hard not to feel sorry for the Humanoids.  They really are passionate and just completely naive about what they are doing and its consequences.  I wish logic instead of mass destruction would have been formulated to deal with the issue.  Oh well
