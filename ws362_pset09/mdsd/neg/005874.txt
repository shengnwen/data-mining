We went to many spots in this book, and found the rating system to be a little off. In general, the Caribbean offers superior snorkeling to Hawaii, and even the best spot that the authors may rave about in this book is mediocre at best. We also found other guide books to give more accurate info on the best snorkel spots. This book is good if you are afraid of the water or have kids, but those more experienced may actually be better off without the book, relying instead on timely advice from locals
