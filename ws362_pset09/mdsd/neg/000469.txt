To be fair, I only got 2/3rds of the way through the book. I'm a voracious reader, and this now has the dubious distinction of being one of very few books I simply could not force myself to finish. Perhaps it would have improved enough in the final chapters to be worth my time investment. And perhaps I was expecting something from the book that it wasn't. I expected a clever, witty satire. Instead, the plotline was non-existent, most of the scenes were simply boring if not sad, and the Nanny character was every bit as shallow and valueless as the rich employers whom she mocked. I found nothing to admire about any of them, and the little boy Grayer was the only character worthy of sympathy. This book is mindless entertainment. I don't feel that I've missed anything by never knowing how it ended
