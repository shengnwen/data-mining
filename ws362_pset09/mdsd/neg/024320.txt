Before reading this book, I was extremely cautious to avoid any information/review which might spoil and prejudice my opinion.  In that I was successful.

It had been a while since reading the other four books, so they were not on my mind and in fact I worried about forgetting minor plot points and whether that would affect my enjoyment.

I needn't have worried.  There was nothing enjoyable about Mostly Harmless.  I was overwhelmed by a sense of bitterness coming from the prose, found myself wondering, "Does he even *like* these characters?"

It struck me as the work of a man who hated what he was doing and wanted to kill it in the most complete and irrevocable way possible.

Two stars for occassional flashes of the non-bitter Adams
