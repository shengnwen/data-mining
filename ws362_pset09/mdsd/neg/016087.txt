I was hoping for great things- but was disappointed in the text.  There are not many history books that I give up on, but this was one- put it down after the first two chapters and haven't picked it back up yet.

The major problem- more of a Brunelleschi bio than anything.  Even worse, - at least in the first two chapters- every paragraph seems to be a new topic, and not related to the previous.  I was really hoping for a nice, easy to read, narrative.

Also seemed a little light on facts, but maybe they come later
