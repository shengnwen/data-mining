I had not read Ted Dekker until I read his collaboration with Frank Peretti with the recent "House".  I really liked that book so I was looking forward to reading more by Dekker.  Unfortunately this was the one I read next and I was very disappointed.  It was hokey.  I'm hoping that some of his others are better
