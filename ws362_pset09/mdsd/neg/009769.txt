My taste runs to P.D. James and Martha Grimes.  I picked this up hoping to find a new series.  It reads like a Harlequin romance with a body in it.  Everything aches - eyes ache, voices ache, the gaslights ache.  Hardened policemen speak in voices husky with emotion.  And everyone but the villain is so blindingly good hearted as to be disgusting.  Throughout the story the author keeps building up to a horrible impending disaster - something so much worse and more terrifying than a cave-in.  The disaster turns out, surprisingly enough, to be a cave-in.  Absolutely tedious.
