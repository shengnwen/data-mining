As a veterinarian I am involved in serveral bird rescue groups and this book disturbs me on several levels.  One, the author presents the idea of cockatiel breeding as a way to support the hobby.  There is currently a huge problem with bird mills as there used to be with puppy mills, and the last thing needed is novice breeder thinking they can make money by breeding cockatiels.  Two, the author is poorly informed or inaccurate about several points of diet,taxonomy, and general health.  I do not reccomend this book
