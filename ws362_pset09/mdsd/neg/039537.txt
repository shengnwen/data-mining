The assassination claim in this book has been vigorously contested in a discussion forum founded by me:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FETZERclaimsDEBUNK

In David Ray's Griffin's review of "American Assassination" above, Griffin concludes: "The authors conclude that the evidence shows beyond reasonable doubt that Wellstone was assassinated. They have, in my view, made a convincing case."

But in his recent Message #1756 in the above forum, Professor Fetzer conceded: "Bieter is right, the evidence is not sufficiently detailed and specific to bring an indictment in a court of law."

An indictment (the legal document accusing the defendant of having committed a crime) is legally sufficient if it based upon "probable cause". Probable cause is a much lower standard of proof than the standard "proof beyond a reasonable doubt," which is required to convict the defendant of the crime charged.

In Professor Fetzer's above concession, he actually concedes more and he directly contradicts the conclusion attributed to him by Mr. Griffin in the latter's review above.

Professor Fetzer uses a scientific mode of reasoning (inference to the best explanation) in his presentation of evidence and argument. I contend, however, that a conspiracy theory alleging the commission of a crime, is properly evaluated under a jurisprudential model of analysis, i.e. criminal law and procedure.

I'm a retired lawyer and former lecturer in the philosophy of law.    

In my opinion, interested parties should read "American Assassination" carefully, but also evaluate the author's claim under the jurisprudential model of analysis (Messages#1755 and #1757) which is described in the above discussion forum, before the reader makes a final judgment on the validity of the authors' claim.
