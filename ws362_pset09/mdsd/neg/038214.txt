The story becomes somewhat more interesting as the plot shifts from the mundane life of a middle-aged woman to a supernatural connection linking contemporary characters and events to historical characters and events.  I was hoping for more sci-fi to go with the supernatural theme, but didn't find it.   

Sadly, when the story runs its course, much of the mystery is unsolved and the roles of some seemingly important characters remain unclear. Even worse, last minute plots are introduced in a "stay tuned for next week's episode" way. 

Overall, this book introduces an imaginative idea for a story but it fails to support it with interesting details. Rather than telling a complete story, it seems that the author is setting you up to buy a sequel.  I'm okay with serials and sequels, but prefer to have it disclosed on the cover.
