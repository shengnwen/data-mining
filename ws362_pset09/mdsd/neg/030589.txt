Don't be fooled by the title that includes the word "Parish."  This book looks at sexual issues from a secular / liberal perspective.  The writer uses no theological or biblical basis for her conclusions.  If you are looking for a standard liberal book on sexual issues in the work place base (and the work place just happens to be the church), this is your book.  If you are looking for a deeper theological perspective, this is not your book
