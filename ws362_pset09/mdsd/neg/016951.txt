There are some interesting interviews and selected passages in Gail Sheehy's Hillary' Choice, but on the whole, the book is a slightly more literate National Enquirer tabloid-style trashing of the First Lady and President Clinton.  There are a few nods toward the Clintons' great achievements during their 8 years in the White House, but the book is written for the lowest-common denominator among those fascinated by hyperbolic, negatve gossip.  The most unconscionable element to the book is its pseudo-psycholanalysis of the Clintons' respective childhood &quot;traumas&quot; and their relationship with one another.  It's a ridiculously one-sided and negative interpretation of one of the nation's smartest, most charismatic, and most effective couples
