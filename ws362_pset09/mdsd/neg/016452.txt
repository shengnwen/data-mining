Usually, I'll give a book about 50 pages to get interesting before putting it down. This is one book that failed the test. It would seem that any author who set about offering an alternate theory of IQ would not be able to fail to create an interesting discussion, but this author did just that.

We did not need to know about all the structures of the brain that make it such that intellect is such a separate thing from emotion. With the functions of only 10% of the brain known, the author is setting himself up for someone to prove him wrong. It would have been better if he had assumed that IQ and EQ exist and are distinct in terms of what they correspond to in real world results.

Don't invest any money in this
