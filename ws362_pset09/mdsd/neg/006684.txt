I gave this only one star as I didn't actually read it. I thought I was ordering books for my grand-daughter, but it turned out to be audio tapes. I paid over $12. for it, but was only refunded $7. Extra fees were added that weren't there when I purchased.  I wrote to Amazon about not wanting a refund, but wanting the actual books, I got NO RESPONSE. I will never order from Amazon again, I am very disappointed with the way this was handled
