Do not judge this man simply by his two books - go the distance, and judge him by the entirely of his published work. It's all available for review on his web site.

This is a man who would have you believe that he is interested in moral and ethical behavior, and good citzenship. He is not. His work makes clear that in his view, immorality reigned at the time of Reagan, and reigns now under Bush, but evidently, it was supplanted by the good, moral people during the Clinton years. Right.

This man is at best delusional and crippled by his myopic, tyrannical view. But assuming he is not mentally incompetent, he is worse than intellectually dishonest - he is a propagandist. True scum. Why do I read this stuff? Because a "friend" loaned it to me, and I read it out of respect. Something good came out of it - I was wondering why my friend was so warped, and now I believe I've got some insight into him that I hadn't had before.

Look, I'm sure the world would be quite peaceful if all agreed with Mr. Loeb. Of course, the world doesn't work that way - and in the real world, rational people have keep our guard up against such "ethicists." This man's work, and in particular his evident credo, is simply terrifying
