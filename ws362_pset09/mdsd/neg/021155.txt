The first third of the book has quite a bit of
repetition.  Perhaps this was an attempt at establishing
greater breadth but it just comes across as loosely structured
prose. 
Maybe the editor could have taken a cue from Cantor and deleted
the middle third of the text in which the author gives a rather
watered down version of the proof for incompleteness - thus 
failing to live up to the book's subtitle.
The final part deals with some of the personalities around
Godel at the institute and - having finished with the more
technical material - makes for an easier read
