I read this book with absolutely no knowledge of Barna, his revolution, or any biases in relation to it.  I would like to make the comment that this book is seriously flawed in the superficial and short-sightedness that it demonstrates.  

Thankfully, the author does not claim to have pulled any of his data that he uses to support his theory from anywhere other than the American churches.  However, he then uses it to apply to the Church, which is global in nature, and that is the book's serious flaw.  It is short-sighted in that he does not seem to apply anything about the global Church and local churches to his theories other than what is happening, according to his observations, in the US.  While there may be some value to these insights, I resent that he is equating what he observes in American churches as what is happening and will happen in the global Church.  

I'd like to see him ask the question why while American churches, in his opinion, are failing, are so many churches globally flowering and prospering?  What makes him think that American churches, which make up a MINORITY of all churches worldwide, should be the sole trendsetter.  From the perspective of what is presented in this book, it seems the author is living in a bubble and is making a superficial and overly generalized prediction for the Church.    

Sure, this book is easy to read and understand.  Sadly, I believe it is actually the poorer for these qualities.  If it weren't, I could at least try to believe that his writing is not as superficial as it is.
