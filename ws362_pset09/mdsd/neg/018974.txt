I was thoroughly disappointed in this book.  It looked like a really interesting idea and topic.  It was painful to read--it felt like the author lacked affection for any of these "outsider" women, which made it difficult to care as a reader unfamiliar with many of the women included.  
We did, however have a good time laughing as we attempted to come up with witty comments to post here, like: "This book would have been great if it were written by someone else."
