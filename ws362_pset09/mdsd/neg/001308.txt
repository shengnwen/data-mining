This book details Ms Davis' struggles for personhood. She surfs through a charmed life on her parents' fame, and then claims to be courageous and independent because she argues with her parents. At the end of her  struggle, she acheives a rare shallowness of which she is extremely proud  because it's not quite as bad as her parents'. The dirt on the Reagan  family was interesting, but only in an Enquirer sort of way. This book  reminds me a lot of BD Hyman's book about her mother, Bette Davis
