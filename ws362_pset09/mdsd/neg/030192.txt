I hope the writing sytle of Dr. Dement's journal articles and public relations peices are different then the one he used in this book.  If they are the same, it would explain a lot about why there isn't as much public recognition of sleep problems...

That said, I wanted to like this book.  I tried.  Really.  But I couldn't make it 1/4 of the way through.

The content of this book is very interesting and important, or at least it should be.  For example, the notion of sleep debt is a very important one and should become part of our everyday lives.

However, the style of this book is thick and meandering, making it hard to skim or digest any key points.  If you ask any technical writer what the worst thing you could possible say about a peice of writing, they'd tell you "so what?"; which basically means an author failed to do their primary function: successfully communicate.  Many, many times I was asking myself "so what?  whats your point??"  For example there was a page long digression about a conference where there was a naked dancer (I think that is what it was talking about anyway).  Is this book about sleep, or about Dr. Dement's conference trips?  Who knows...

Clocking in at around 450 pages, this book is far, far to long.  With some basic editing, the book could easily be distilled to about 1/2 it size and not loose any of its message.  I really wish somebody would do it too, then maybe I could finish reading all this man knows about sleep...  But at this length and with this writing style, I just can't bare it
