I am going to be very opinionated here, but just to make the point to you of what it is like.  I could not stand this book.  I thought the ideas were LOONEY!  They recomend that when you child has a tantrum, you join them to help them understand that you understand, even in front of others.  Ha!  No thanks.  I do love my kids, but I also would like them to learn what is correct behavior in front of others.  They do have to grow up eventually!
