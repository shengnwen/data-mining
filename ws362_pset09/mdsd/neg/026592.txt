This is the first time I've read a book by Ted Dekker.   The salesperson at  the Christian bookstore where I bought it raved about Dekker.  I purchased this particular book because it had been recommended to me by a friend at church.  As far as Christian fiction goes, I'm most familiar with Lawhead, Peretti, Theone, and Francine Rivers.  This book was disappointing, to say the least, and I would agree with the  Publishers  Weekly assessment.  It  has some intriguing  themes, to be sure, the nature of Islam among  them.  But the clairvoyancy angle gets tiresome, and appears to be little more than a gimmick and certainly does not do justice to the biblical concept of prophecy.  And, even with a reader's necessary suspension of disbelief, it just didn't seem credible to me that all the philosophical talk about alternative futures would be the main topic of conversation in a constantly high stress situation for people on the run from potential killers from Saudi Arabia.   At one point I found myself saying "this is just stupid, ridiculous," and wanted to trash  the book; nevertheless I plugged ahead to the end. 

I must say I am rather astonished by the uncritical nature of the audience for this book.   It tends to affirm the suspicion of many that Christian fiction readers do not have very deep standards.   If you measure a book like this against a major secular-market author in the adventure genre like, say, Greg  Iles, there is no comparison.  None. 

And what's with all the toilet encounters in this book?
