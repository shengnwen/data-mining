This book may be helpful for some people who want to know more about possible conspiracies. Personally, I believe some of them; but that's not why I purchased this book. This book is highly misrepresented on Trudeau's infomecials. There are no specific recommendations for treatment of any illnes in this book. Only some vague references to start you on a paper chase. There is not even an index in the book to direct you to information on a specific illness. This book is basically another infomercial for his subscription website.
