I was very dissappointed with this book.  First of all the title is a little misleading ... Taking the Leap.  I was more interested in a book that would help me switch from my current job to a career as an artist.  This book is designed more to help the artist just starting out in his/her career (presumably just out of artschool) to set realistic goals, build a body of work, and guide the artist through the business side of the artworld, ie approaching galleries, selling, copyright and other legal stuff etc.  
For what it actually is, the book is about average.  Clearly written, easy to understand if not on occasion dumbed down.  For example, the section on understanding who the major players are in the artworld includes such catagories as, The Artist: you, The Collector, The Gallery Owner.  Including definitions for these terms seemed more like filler than actual usefull information.  
Another problem with the book is outdated information.  Mainly where the internet is concerned but also when it comes to the sample resumes and artist statements.  
The book has it's good points too.  As I said it's well written and easy to understand.  The section on photographing your artwork is a keeper as well as the guide for creating a submission package to send out to galleries.  If you have trouble with setting and keeping realistic goals for yourself this book will help you with that as well.  
I'd be interested in finding out what's in Lang's new book- Taking the Leap 05 (which unfortunately I wasn't aware of until after I bought this one and at the time of writing this review, it's still yet to be released.)  I don't think I'd invest the money in buying the new addition, but I might breeze through it if I saw it at the book store.
