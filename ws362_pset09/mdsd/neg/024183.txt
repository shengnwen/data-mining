One expects one's textbooks to present material in a structured way. This book is all over the place. It is full of references to material &quot;covered in the next section&quot; or &quot;I explain this later in the book&quot;. It is also full of incomplete sentences, spelling errors, and uncoordinated subjects and predicates. For failness' sake on must admit that some useful information may be gleaned with some effort
