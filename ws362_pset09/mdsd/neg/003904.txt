What was once an indispensable guide to US politics has been steadily ruined over the years by the shrill, sanctimonious editorializing of Michael Barone.  I used to by new editions of this series every two years but quit several years ago because I was getting less information and more op-ed preaching.  I did pick up a copy of this edition at a local book store and spent a great deal of time flipping thorough it and saw that little has changed.  Barone is simply a blind apologists for the Bush administration and contemptuously dismisses anyone who does not subscribe to his philosophy as merely being a part of the "feminist left."

It is such a shame, as a lot of the information in here is valuable to someone with an interest in US politics and elections.  It is too bad Barone's ego has gotten in the way and ruined a once great series
