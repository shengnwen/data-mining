BREAKING THE CODE, by Princeton Theological School professor and New Testament paleography legend Bruce Metzger, is an attempt to explain the Revelation to St. John the Divine in an approachable and easy-going manner.

While many Christians hear of Revelation from those who would interpret it exceedingly literally, Metzger's emphasis is on the book as a form of apocalyptic writing where so much is meant allegorically. He makes comparisons with the Book of Daniel to show the Old Testament roots of Revelation. Most helpful will be his explanation of what we know about the seven churches which John addresses.

Metzger's book is something of a disappointment because it underestimates the intelligence of the average reader. He deals only with the surface of the text, but there's no need to be that simplistic when anyone, even the non-theological layman, can get the same information from merely reading Revelation itself. The biggest failing of BREAKING THE CODE is that it does not deal with interpretations of the work through the long history of the Church. This might not bother Protestants, but members of other denominations will want to take Tradition into account. Metzger also does not explain why the early Church Fathers closely linked Revelation and the Gospel According to John, even assuming they had the same author, and how (as Sofia Gubaidulina put it) John's Gospel might be seen to represent the temporal/horizontal and Revelation the eternal/vertical.

Instead of relying on BREAKING THE CODE, one interested in Revelation would do better just to carefully read the book itself and consider each line attentively. Those who want to explore the ramifications of the work in Church history should turn to more extensive coverage
