The Winter Room is about a boy, who lives with his family, on a farm and tells his story from his point of view. His family includes his mom,dad,brother,Wayne and his two uncles,Nels and David.Nels and David are not reallly his uncles, but thats just what they call them. 
The book is split up into sections of the seasons on the farm as they pass through the year. Each season has new adventures and jobs for thefamily to take on. Even though Uncle David and Nels have lived with the boys their whole life,they learn that they both have a big secret. Uncle David tells them stories mostly in the winter, in the living room.
I though this book was a little boring for people my age. It has too many details and gives you the surprise at the end and doesn;t give you any details about the surprise, it just ends
