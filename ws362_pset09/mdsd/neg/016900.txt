I will not write much on the obvious flaws of this book, how it left many questions unanswered, etc. This has been written by others already. I just wanted to add something that no one else seems to have commented on. The ghost writer screwed up the timeline again (as he has done in previous books). In the beginning of the book, (big) Celeste is interviewed at the mental clinic. The doctor's report says she is 17 yrs, 4 months old. The doctor mentions that Baby Celeste was 6 yrs old at the time. That would've made big Celeste 11 yrs old when she had her! Huh?! In the book "Celeste", when Celeste meets Elliot Fletcher (who later gets her pregnant), she tells him she is 15 yrs old. So, by the beginning of the book "Child of Darkness", big Celeste should've been 21 yrs old. Apparently, Andrew Neiderman does not know how to count! Get with the program, dude!
   And you should have written more about the fate of big Celeste, who was a much more interesting character anyway.
