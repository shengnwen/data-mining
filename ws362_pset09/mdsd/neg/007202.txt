I am unsure if this book is available in English trans from someone other than Ed Vit. and Mondial book publishers, but there are several mistakes in translation that are more oversights and bad editing than any real translational problem between English/French. As well, there is an entire section in which the translator removed a description of Zola's, because he thinks the English audience wouldn't be interested. Incase he's reading this, I was interested. Zola is an excellent observer, that's part of the charm of his writing, his fabulous descriptions that allow the reader to nearly take part in an event for which they were not present, the descriptions are so detailed and interesting. To have instead an astrisk by Ed telling me at the bottom of the page that my sentiments couldn't take the brutal description...if there isn't a new translation, there needs to be one and a better edited version too! 

That said, of course, even shoddy trans and editing mistakes can't ruin Zola. I am half way through and just like all others this novel immediately presents great characters that make you curious for more and keep you hooked until the end!!
