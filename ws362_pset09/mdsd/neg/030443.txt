I could not finish this book.  The writing was stilted and generally not readable to me.  The plot seemed interesting, but the writing style coupled with the unbelievability of the characters at the beginning of the book left me simply not caring about the story, or characters.  You have to have one of three things to make a book readable:  Good writing style, good characters or good plot.  This book almost had a good plot, but it was buried with poor writing and wooden characters.  I do not recommend this book
