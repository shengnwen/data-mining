When I was first chosen to narrate this book, I knew nothing of the racist past of its author -- I knew only that it was the single worst book I'd ever been assigned.  The negative AudioFile Magazine review of the recording (quoted here on Amazon) is completely fair.  Reading the book to myself in order to prepare to record it, I found it annoying in the extreme -- the so-called prose is precious and poorly written, and the allegedly authentic colloquialisms are grating.  When it came time to say it all aloud, for the first time ever (and I've narrated upwards of 200 audiobooks) I found it impossible to invest this piece of literary flotsam with any emotional content whatsoever.  As declining the job was no longer an option, I merely tried to stay out of the way and give it as simple and logical a performance as I could, but I was unable to compensate for the God awful writing, and unable to disguise my contempt for the entire enterprise.  It remains the worst recording I have ever done, and I was, for a time, quite ashamed of it.  Now that I discover more about its hate mongering author, I'm actually quite pleased that the recording stinks.  I now believe I gave this garbage exactly the reading it deserved.  (I must add that I learned a valuable lesson: never record a book you loathe.  I was subsequently offered the execrable "Left Behind - The Kids" series for young adults, but having suffered through "Little Tree," knew better than to lend my voice to the spewing of "Christian" hate.
