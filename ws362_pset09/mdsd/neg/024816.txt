If you can get past the over-the-top exagerations, you might even finish this book.

Example (pages 57 & 58):  

"The most gut-wrenching loss I personally experienced was a $10 million betting disaster when I was 17."

"They were all kingpins, sitting on ridiculous cash surpluses." 

"They played, as did I, soley with C-notes..."

"The pot was brewing, $30 million strong..."

$30 million is the equivilent of 300,000 C-notes...just how big was the table?
