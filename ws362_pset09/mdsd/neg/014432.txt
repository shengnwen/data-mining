I came to this after reading &quot;The Pact,&quot; which had its problems too (occasionally cardboard characters/unbelievable situations) but was quite readable overall and kept me awake too late at least one night! This, while the idea was good enough, was a real disappointment. Having Rebecca tell it backwards took away all the suspense, so I was kind of like, who cares? Plus, we didn't really get a sense that Hadley and Rebecca had such a wonderful romance. &quot;show, not tell,&quot; is the basic principle of fiction (and non-fiction) writing, yet all of this was just based on Rebecca telling us what a romance it was -- we didn't actually see it. Also, the different voices -- while not a bad idea -- Weren't handled well here. The best way of using different voices is to give you truly new insights into a situation, not to just repeat the same scene twice or even three times. As someone struggling with fiction writing myself, I may be too sensitive, but it seemed that this book should have been structured differently, and perhaps edited more comprehensively, to be truly effective. Jodi has certainly gone on to bigger and better things, which is good to know, but don't start with this one if you want to read her stuff
