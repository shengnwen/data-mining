Spiritual memoirs tend to follow the same plot line.  It's the boy meets girl story with God substituted for the girl.  There's nothing wrong with the formula, the author's job is to make it fresh and interesting.  Dan Wakefield doesn't get the job done.  The structure of "Returning" is linear, the pace is ponderous, and the insights only moderately interesting.  In fact, the entire book is an exercise in moderation, written by a moderate talent, who, on the evidence presented, has lived a moderate life.  It's no wonder Bill Moyer's, a paragon of moderation, liked this book.  There are parts of this book where the author could have revealed more.   The account of his nervous breakdown is scary, but all too brief, and on too many occasions - bouts of adolescent [activity], unsuccessful psychoanalysis, addiction to alcohol - Mr. Wakefield seems like a kid in a confessional.  He rushes through his sins in order to be unburdened, but also undiscovered.  It doesn't work.  If we give the penitent the benefit of our attention, he should give us the benefit of a compelling story
