In this book, Robert Kaplan makes a case for a revival of Fascism. As in the 1930s, the world is to turn its back on normal morality in favor of the ends justify any means and to adopt National Darwinism. The book idolizes the strongman leader and the arbitrary use of military force unconstrained by a civil society.

He laughs at Jewish and Christian concepts of morality. They are for fools and children. The ethos he reaches for calling it "Pagan" is in truth not that at all. Rather than presenting anything about leadership, he presents domination. Morality is for idiots and all true leaders are supposed to recognize that life (and government) is nothing more than a struggle between men for greatness and survival. To be moral is to be a fool that will be crushed by the real leaders of the world.

Kaplan would have been right at home in Imperial Japan, Fascist Italy or up on the platform with Franco. The book isn't worth reading and I would not recommend it to anyone
