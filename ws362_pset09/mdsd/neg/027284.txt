due to a snafu with my computer, the first review i wrote for this book was lost.  i could have just given up, but i am determined to implore those of you considering adding this book to your library to please resist!  only because i had to choose a star rating did i give it a one star.  i would have chosen 0 star if given the choice.  though milton is obviously a talented writer and did much research for this project, she obviously has some kind of grudge against chaplin.  true, he unfortunately left a great deal to exploit with the scandals, both personal and political.  but what she so obviously neglected was his creative genius that earned him the title King of Comedy.  she emphasizes rumors as facts and takes it upon herself to tell us what chaplin was more than likely feeling or thinking about any particular subject, when there is no way she could assume.  for instance, in describing 'city lights,' a clear masterpiece, she completely distorts, in my opinion, the best movie ending EVER.  that look on the tramp's face as he looks at the girl he loves - his face so full of love, fear, hopefulness - it is unbelievably touching and beautiful, but milton insists that he is using it to manipulate his audience - hopeful he still has their devotion and fearing his hold on them has passed.  she portrays him to be an absolute monster.  clearly, he couldn't have been the easiest person to live with, but it gives her no right to drag him through the mud as she did.  i hate to think of the people out there just discovering the genius of charles chaplin - seeing her book and thinking it will be a good, truthful read.  start with the david robinson book, or jeffrey vance - they are much more honest and fair.  i keep my milton book only because i refuse to turn it over to a library or used book store to infect a future reader's mind.
