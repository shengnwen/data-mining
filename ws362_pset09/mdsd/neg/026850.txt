I'm a huge fan of Mr. Pop, and have been waiting for a definitive biography for some time. Unfortunately, this isn't it. Ambrose has effectively reprinted huge sections from "Please Kill Me," "I Need More," and "Neighbourhood Threat." Virtually no interviews or research was done from anywhere but these three books. Virtually nothing is said about Iggy's son Eric, and the last ten years of Pop's career are glossed over. Ambrose admits to not being a Pop fan, but feels compelled to repeatedly criticize his work (particularly the use of Pop's songs in commercials). Despite an awesome cover, Gimme Danger is basically a poor researched term-paper on Iggy Pop
