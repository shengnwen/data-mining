Cut and Dry.. Iowa's Cousin Rick Black is by far the leader with us deer hunters and how we cook our harvest. I got a copy of 301 Venison Recipes from my uncle. I asked him why he was tossing it out? His reply? "Heck boy, I got The Deer Burger Cookbook and the Venison Cookbook by Cousin Rick Black"!
Yepper! Like everyone else. "We will stick with Rick" and his Deer Burger Cookbook and Bag Em and Tag Em
