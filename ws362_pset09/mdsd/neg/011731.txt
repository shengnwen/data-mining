Like many others who read this, I was a teen in the 70's, and Jonathan Schwartz was a big part of my life, along with Scott Muni and the rest of the WNEW-FM team. And I've read other works by him and really enjoyed them.

But this book...this book left me thoroughly unmoved. He comes across as a somewhat spoiled child of priviledge, a kid who had so much and didn't value it at all. His bout with alcoholism comes across like a petulant episode, rather than a life-changing struggle. 

What was particularly disappointing to me was his take on the music. Now, let me preface my remarks by stating that I've spent my whole life in the music industry...I have a lifelong love of music of all kinds, and a deep appreciation for Sinatra, and everything from classical to jazz to rock and beyond. That said, Schwartz comes across as caring little for the music he helped to popularize in the 70's. Yes, he has praise for many of the artists of the era, but in the end I was left with the feeling none of them, in his opinion, can hold a candle to Frank the Almighty. It's a disturbing impression from someone who, in my nascent days of discovering music and musicianship, was instrumental in opening my eyes to so much new music of the day. 

Several years before reading the book, I emailed Schwartz with a question. Every evening he closed his show with a particular recording of Chopin's Prelude in E minor, played on flute and classical guitar, and I wondered who it was. He replied he couldn't recall. (Turned out to be Laurindo Almieda and Sali Teri...hope I spelled that right) At the time I was mildly surprised he'd not remember something he played literally every night for so many years, but after reading this book it only served to reinforce the feeling that, rather than having a true love of the music he was playing, he was in some sense just along for the ride. What a letdown
