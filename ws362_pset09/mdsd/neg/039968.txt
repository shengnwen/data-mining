Although Healy seems to be in support of technology in education, she chooses to present only the worst case scenarios in her book and takes a very pessimistic view of educational technology.  She visits several  schools, both in low and high economic areas, and seems to find all of the  worst examples of computers being used with students.  For example, she  observes a group of students using 2 computers to do writing, and tells  only of those who appear to be wasting time, not of those who are being  successful.  She criticizes the activity and calls it a waste of time.  At  the same time, she quotes teachers saying things like &quot;Isn't it great  what they can do with the computer?&quot; which then makes the teacher look  like she doesn't know what is going on.   	It is true that often times  parents and teachers don't use computers to their fullest potential, but  spending an entire book pointing out all of the faults is not the way to  change people's ways.  The problem essentially falls on the software  manufacturers who see a profitable market in &quot;edutainment&quot;  software. To Healy's credit, she gives several different suggestions for  parents when they are buying software for their children at home and  suggests ways to use the techonolgy as a tool, not as a substitute for the  television.   	Instead of pointing out everything that is wrong with  technology in schools, Healy and others like her would be better served  looking for what is right and working to make these good practices  available to those who need it most
