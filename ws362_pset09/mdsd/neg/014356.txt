It's a good thing she doesn't use Hebrew writing. On the inside cover, she does for the shehecheyanu prayer, and makes six writing errors in it. She mispronounces often, and makes errors in meaning and word form (mistaking verbs for nouns, etc.). I've spent only a few minutes looking at the book, but found stunningly many and ghastly errors, in addition to very poor translations. Can you imagine, if you know Hebrew, accenting the word "koach" (strength) at the end, instead of the "ko" part. I could add a long list of such items, in spite of the fact that I've only looked at it for a few minutes.
It's not only "for" dummies, possibly, but also "of" and "by". I am giving it two stars based on the impression that it could be useful to some folks such as tourists. But don't trust it
