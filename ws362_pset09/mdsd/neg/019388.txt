I bought this book for my Pre-K class, to go along with our weather unit on Rain. The cover looked so nice I thought it would be a great book. In fact, the illustrations are quite nice; the problem is there's really no story here. The language doesn't flow; its very choppy. The children didn't enjoy this book, and have not asked for it to be read again. Good children's literature should have a story to it: a setting, problem and solution; a definite beginning, middle and ending; and well-defined characters. This book has none of that
