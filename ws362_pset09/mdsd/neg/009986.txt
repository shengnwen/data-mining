I read On the Road over 30 years ago in college. I was hooked and within two years I read everything JK had written. I bought a first edition of Visions Of Cody some years later and found it a monumental bore. While I'll nod to the readers that get off on the experimental nature of the prose, for someone like me, who thinks On The Road and The Dharma Bums are almost perfect, Cody is not much more than the rough cut...very rough...for On The Road
