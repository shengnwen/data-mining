I wanted to read the book before watching the film. I have heard how inspirational the film is. The book should be, but is too full of excuses and bragging. When Chris Gardner eventually started to make a sucessful career for himself, he sent his son away to live with the mother who abandoned him. Not very inspirational. I would not recommend this book
