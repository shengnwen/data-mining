It's a beautiful book but it's poorly organized for those people unfamilar with all the Japanese ingredient. She refers to the same item by several names which is very confusing. Also she need to do a better job explaining what you need to have to prepare her recipes. She make a point of explaining the different types of miso but then just calls for "miso" in the reciepe. If you knew enough to understand what type of miso to use you wouldn't need her book
