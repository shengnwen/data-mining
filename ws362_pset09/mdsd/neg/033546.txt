There must be a serious vacuum in today's counter/sub-culture around psychedelics. Daniel thrills us with the confrontation with the Bwiti King around the Iboga ceremony. Beyond telling us about some of his own experiences we get to hear what sounds like the drone of a cocktail party. 

This work is fairly uneven. If you have never read Terence McKenna you might be intrigued by some parts of this book. Beyond that the work is a ramble, often not just opinionated but also filled with trite wanderings, sometimes you feel like a gadfly as the author dances about in his mind about a wide range of topics and his own spin on psychedelic cultural history. But in the end, there is not much here. 

What is also uncomfortable is that the author in person (e.g. Burning Man) brings in liberal use of a certain Four letter word cojoined with it's 7 letter verb form. You get that same kind of hipster spin at times in this book. However it's not hip.
