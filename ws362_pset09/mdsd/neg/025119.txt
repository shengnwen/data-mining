I had never read anything by Terry Brooks, so I thought I would try listening to Armageddon's Children because I thought the premise sounded interesting. I guess the story is interesting, but I found it extremely slow and boring. The narrator has a dreary boring voice that drove me crazy. I couldn't even finish listening to the whole thing because it became torture
