This book is useless to those who dont understand algebra. I tried to learn some of the concepts just by reading and found myself nodding out.  What irritated me the most was the author was "kind" enough to offer to sell you an excel spreadsheet program to figure out all his calculations...........at $195.00 each commodity! And another $29.00 for the historical data. Seems like an infomercial to me. I mean if you cant use the book by itself, why not just sell it as a course with everything included. Not to say his methods do not work but it just turned my off.  I am currently working on several trading methodolgies requiring programming knowldge and if anyone can help me with this, we can bypass all this other stuff. Contact me at:mince38 @ yahoo.com   I al also putting together a global think tank of trading ideas of cutting edge thinkers all over the world.
