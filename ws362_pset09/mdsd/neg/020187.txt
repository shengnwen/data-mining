 I enjoyed the Forward to the book. The, albeit, brief reference to 'elegance' being a package - the importance of a great walk and pleasant voice being a given. After the 'Forward' I found the book progressively downhill. Sure, there was the usual worthwhile guidance - the quintessential little black dress, simplicity- less is more and choose quality over quantity - but hardly groundbreaking for anyone with more than a cursory knowledge of fashion. Much of the text stressed silly, outdated and/or erroneous rules- don't wear black in the morning, don't wear bright coloured shoes except in the evening, choose neutral handbags in black and brown (much prefer Kimora's ideas in 'Fabulosity' she suggests choosing handbags in cherry, emerald or orange -let's face it, way more colorful and interesting), women over 21 look better in one piece swimsuits-(surely this is a matter of abdominal firmness- a 40 year old can look stunning in a bikini an overweight 16yr old not so). It went on to refer to Queen Elizabeth as a style icon.
As I read the book, I kept seeing glimpses of a girlfriend. She's 40, well groomed, always wears expensive quality clothes but frankly it's all deathly dull - there is no individuality, no surprise in her dress, seems aging- it fits her partner is decades older. 
'A Guide To Elegance' focuses on rigidity in fashion (heavy on do's and dont's)which has hopefully been surpassed by CREATIVITY. Interesting, youthful dressing is pleasing at any age and gives vibrancy and youth- my brother in law's mum,70 wore a colorful folk skirt and matching bright shoes to Christmas lunch and looked wonderful.
Many readers have commented on compliments when implementing the book but when you give thought and time to your wardrobe, coordinating pieces and ensuring all is clean and fresh, shoes polished etc, hair and make up well done, a great walk and smile and then... irrespective of any supposed 'fashion' book you will indeed be stunning and elegant.
