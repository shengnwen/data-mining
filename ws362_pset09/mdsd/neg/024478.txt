The author makes excellent points about the wind of pompous, meaningless jargon and deceptive spin that has swept through government, business and academia.  I personally trudged through a lot of this muck in the social "sciences" and share the author's concern for the erosion of the language.  We are losing our ability (or is it will?) to say what we mean in a way that is easy to understand and worth the reader's time.   

Chapter 1 should be digested by everyone whose job requires them to write or speak.  In the beginning I thought the book was a 4; by page 58 I was thinking 3 stars; and by chapter 3 it was in freefall.  His own writing bogs down in muddy thinking and poorly chosen examples.  I lost sight of his sails as he drifted off point and disappeared in a fog of philosophical opportunism. 

I still recommend chapter 1, but get it from your library.  It's not worth the money.
