Abid Ullah Jan 's ridiculous insinuation in this intellectually bankrupt dissertation is that western democracy is a failure and it should be replaced by islamic rule,perhaps such as found in the Islamic Republic of Iran or the Taliban. 
 
 It is hard to get through this book without pondering whether the author has even an inkling of knowledge on how democracy works.After toiling through the first half of the book it becomes rather obvious that the book is promoting a political agenda akin to the typical islamic fundamentalist assault on western values and societies. 
 
 'The End of Democracy'  is filled with bias, twisted facts and erroneous conclusions that sadly are the usual fare of contemporary islamic thinking these days. The narrowness of Abid Ullah Jan's interpretation of world events and history is not convincing at all and the the assertions he makes are pure nonsense. His assertion that Islamic rule is superior to Democracy in the areas of justice , civil rights and civil liberties may sound good on paper, but anyone who lives in the real world can clearly see that this is patently false. 
 
 Evidently the great arab thinkers of the distant past seem to have all been replaced by narrow minded islamic propagandist such as Abid Ullah Jan whose lives seems dedicated to discrediting western societies and promoting islamic radicalism
