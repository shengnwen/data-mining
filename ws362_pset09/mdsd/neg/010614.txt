The fact that this book has received nearly all five star ratings confirms my belief that the majority of modern-day Americans are practically illiterate.  There is nothing particularly profound in this book, and much that is mis-leading.  A couple of examples: an early Celtic Christian prayer is quoted, but omitting most of the prayer and its references to God and the angels, so that it appears that the prayer is pantheistic (which in its true form is not).  Also in the first chapter we are told that the Celts were "nature people".  Well, I suppose that you could say that most of the tribes in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America two thousand years ago were "nature people".  In other words, the enlightenment in this book has more to do with New-Age fancy and 19th century exoticism than historical reality.  If you want something legitimately mystical, and a thousand times more profound, try volume 1 of the Philokalia, or The Way of A Pilgrim.  Sorry if I sound arrogant; I'm not.  I just hate to see people get taken in by this stuff when there are truly great works languishing in obscurity because you might have to read a page three times a day for three days before you get it...but when you do get it, you KNOW you've got something.  Peace.  Out
