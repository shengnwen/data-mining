Sorry, but this is both an unimportant work, and pornographic (when every chapter revolves around one sex scene, I think it is safe to accuse a book of being pornographic).  Understandably, it has been written that this book was intended to be exploitative, and di Prima wrote it because she needed money.  Great.  I hold nothing against writers doing what they need to do to make a living.  If I recall correctly, Stephen King got his start writing articles for Playboy.  With all that said, however, I think it is also important not to hold a book to unrealistic expectations, simply because of the author.  Porn, porn, porn.  Let's see: chapter 1, sex with Ivan.  Chapter 2, recollection of the first time she had sex with Ivan.  Chapter 3, sex with Robin (a man in love with Ivan).  Chapter 4, Sex with Tomi (a female friend).  Chapter 5, Tomi has sex with Tomi's brother.  Chapter 6, Sex with 4 other women.  Chapter 7, sex with Tomi's father Serge.  Chapter 8, sex with young Jack and some guy with big ears while runaway girl watches.  And so it goes, through all the chapters.  So, if you're looking for a "spank" book, then check it out.  If you're looking for a book about the beats from a woman's perspective (as it is boldly proclaimed on the front cover), look somewhere else.
