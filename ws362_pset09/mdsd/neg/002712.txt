The most frequent advice the author seems to give, is &quot;Take a sabbatical&quot;. Iberra ofers little advice for the person who is ready for change, but simply can't afford to make it. If you make less than six figures a year, you'll find yourself asking &quot;Uh... what am I going to eat while I do that?&quot;. 
 
 Beyind this, though, the book does deal with how to emotionally navigate the hurdles of being &quot;between two worlds&quot; while changing careers, so it's not a total loss. 
 
 Myself, I find that I fell into a career track that I never wanted, and know I want out. I need the financial and navigational help to move back towards where I wanted to be originally, or find something new. This book doesn't provide that, as much as the emotional support needed to convince yourself you really have chosen the wrong path.
 
 If you're wealthy, this book will work for you. If not, you may want to look for another one, as this one has some items of use for you, but you'll have to work to find them
