Dr Mack has written an attack on what he describes as Christian Myths under the guise of scholarship.  This book has been overtaken by recent scholarship by Robinson and others and has little value with respect to the study of Q.  I recommend instead that the interested reader purchase "The Sayings Gospel Q in Greek and English" by Robinson, Hoffmann & Kloppenborg.  Mack presupposes the validity of his arguments in the prologue by claiming the birth and death accounts in the gospels are mythological.  Then he proceeds to support this by pointing out the Sayings of Jesus in Q lack these accounts.  Total sophistry!   His rantings conform closely to the "secular-Progressive" movement in the United States, taking a strong anti-Christian (traditional) and anti-Church stance.  His understanding of American culture as conformed to and practiced by the majority of middle and lower class Americans is negligible, and his statements concerning American attitudes and beliefs are limited solely to American academics and the liberal elite.  Contemporary social issues are emphasized in his conclusions -- a nice bit of propaganda by a tenured academic who doesn't have to work in the real world.  When he stated "Q's challenge to Christians is therefore an invitation to join the human race....", I eagerly awaited his next sentence that would enumerate those religions or societies which have eliminated myths and myth-making from their cultures and that Christians could join.  Sadly Processor Mack didn't list any such examples in "the human race", and could only exhort Christians and Americans to understand and overcome their own religious and cultural myths for the good of mankind.  So his treatise was just another politically correct polemic blaming Christians and specifically Americans for the troubles of the world.  Using the discussion and presentation of Q to make his point was absolutely unconscionable
