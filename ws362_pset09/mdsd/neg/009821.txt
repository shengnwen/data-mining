If you have read other titles in this series, and you think Lee's slips of the tongue are "charming", you'll be delighted with this book.  If, like me, you view them as very annoying breaks in the narrative, run for the hills.  The tongue tangles are just over the top this time around, MANY more than in previous books.  I enjoyed the earlier books despite the slips, but there are just too many to ignore in this one
