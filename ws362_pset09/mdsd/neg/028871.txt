I read Flags of Our Fathers and enjoyed it more than Flyboys.  Bradley has a writing style that is difficult at times as has personal biases come through very clearly.  As one other reviewer has written, I found it very odd that he often referred to MG Curtis LeMay as "Curtis."  As someone writing about military history, Bradley should have more respect for the uniform and should not call a two star general by his first name like he is talking about one of his golfing buddies.  This was very distracting.  I also found the first couple of chapters of his history lesson very tedious and unfocused - so much so that I nearly quit reading the book.  The latter chapters pick up the pace and are insightful.  Bradley also devotes too much time attempting to demonize the American firebombing tactics.  Thankfully Bradley's bias and negativity toward the Navy and Army is not as pronounced in Flyboys as in FOOF.  This bias is especially odd considering his father was a Navy Corpsman.
