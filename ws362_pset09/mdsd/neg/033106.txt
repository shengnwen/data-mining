I picked this up after reading Calder's Dead Things trillogy which I enjoyed a great deal for its fetishistic, perverse, and increasingly disjointed world.   Frenzetta does create an interesting world which could provide an interesting story but it seems that Calder has lost his pace.

One of the major drives in Dead Things was the fetishistic intensity which he sucessfully integrated into the plot.  The same intensity is present in this book but the world he created disallows the same integration in to the story.   As a result, it comes off as obscessive rather than interesting.   

I was even more dissapointed by The Twist so while this wasn't as good as I expected, it was still readable.   If you're a Calder fan, its worth a read... as long as you find it used.  

Otherwise Calder needs to give up on the deadly dolly thing until he can make it work again
