At least the book was accurately titled.  It was definitely more memoir than autobiography.  I always hate to give bad reviews to books that a person seems to have put so much effort into, but this was just boring.  I am a big fan of biographies and this one falls short.  Being a proper southern lady, Sela does not go into detail about what seems to have been an interesting life.  Instead she spends lots of time talking about her thoughts and feelings.  It all seemed forced.  

She speaks in detail about how great life is in Mississippi, yet she raises her kids in LA, of all places.  She seems to be a good mother, but yet her children have spent hours in the care of nannies as she goes to work in the wee hours of the morning and returns long after they are put to bed.  

Quite the confusing and contrary mishmash, but I understand her need for putting something down on paper.  Losing a mother does that to a person.  Perhaps she should have just kept it for herself, family and friends.  They would not have found it boring I'm sure
