I felt as if I were reading a book for teens - the plot was thin and continued to hold one theme as the central "mystery" or glue to hold the story together.  It was tiresome and even the ending was a disappointment.  The author wrote in southern cliche's which failed to bring humor to a tiresome, drug out subject.
Unlike the author's book Sunday Wife - it seemed to fail in it's delivery.
