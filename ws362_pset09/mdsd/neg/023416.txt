Rise of the Vulcans contains some useful information.  However, Mr. Mann is on a respected historian's PNAC list of 320 members, signatories, and authors. This  would, from my perspective as a published researcher, disqualify him as an "excellent source."  Far better to read Gary Dorrien's impartial  "Imperial Designs."  Mr. Dorrien is not a member of the PNAC lobby.
