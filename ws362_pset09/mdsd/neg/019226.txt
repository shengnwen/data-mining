I thought from the title of this book that it would be like a synopsis of how to do the ART technique.  Instead, most of it was info about how wonderful ART is with some useful information about injuries in general.  It does inform about specific anatomy but I didn't really need that part, although it was nice. I just wanted to know how to use the techniques, and I was a bit disappointed
