If Tom Perrotta meant "Joe College" to be a coming-of-age story, he fell flat on his face.  Danny (the protagonist) comes from a working-class family and struggles and scrapes his way into Yale.  Good for him!  Too bad that's not the story.  By the time we meet Danny, he's already an ivy leaguer.  Despite his proletariat backstory, Danny tends to behave just as selfishly and irresponsibly as any of his silver-spoon, trust-fund classmates who I guess we're supposed to think he's better than.  

I don't want to give too much away here, so suffice it to say that Danny makes one of those BIG, life-altering mistakes that any guy can make. You know, the tried and true premise of the young man with everything going for him who suddenly faces something that threatens to screw up his future.  Does he face it like a man, resolve the conflict, and "grow" as a human being?  Nope.  Perrotta lets Danny get away with ignoring the serious consequences of his actions and, instead, focuses on a ridiculous sub-plot (or was it the main plot? I couldn't tell) about the mafia and ruthless bodybuilding snack food vendors.  What's worse, Danny basically gets a free pass.  He ignores his self-created crisis, and it just sort of fades away.  And once it's gone, Danny strolls right out and does the same, stupid thing he did the first time to get himself in serious trouble.

Lessee . . . a self-centered Yale student who makes big mistakes, screws up other people's lives, ignores the consequences, shirks responsibility, lets other people deal with his mistakes for him, and then caps it off by going out partying and acting irresponsibly again. 'Psssst,' Mr. Perrotta -- That's not the kind of character we root for.  That's the kind of character we boo. And occasionally elect President.

Two stars because "Joe College," despite its flawed premise, is pretty readable and provides some insight into the mildly interesting, seedy underworld of mobile snack stand vendors
