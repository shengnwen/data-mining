You have got to be kidding me. This stuff was tacky when it ran in magazines...  so now a book of it? Whatev... not to mention the horribly CHEAPO paper and way crummy binding. What was the guy thinking? Filthy lucre, I suppose. Three to six months until it hits the remainder table. A better subtitle might have been, "How I Stopped Worrying About What a Decent Book Should Be". Save  yourself the bread
