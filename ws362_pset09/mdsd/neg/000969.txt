Megan Mccafferty is one of my favorite authors of all time, but as an editor, not so much. I was looking forward to this compilation because Megan has a knack for writing attention-grabbing novels, and I had faith in her selection of authors. I enjoyed roughly half of the stories. To my surprise, one or two were so bad that I couldn't even get through the first page. Very few of the authors managed to write a satisfying short story, and even though Megan had the crutch of her other books to fall back on, she kept her story safe and rather bland. 

If I could fix anything in this book (besides the selection of some authors), I would lengthen the stories. After finishing this book, I was thoroughly unsatisfied and I'm sure others were (and will be) too. The gems in this book are overshadowed by many bland, boring and realy too out-there stories. My favorites were "Mona Lisa, Jesus, Chad and me", "Infinity" and "the alumni interview". Borrow this one from a friend, maybe, but certainly don't waste your money.
