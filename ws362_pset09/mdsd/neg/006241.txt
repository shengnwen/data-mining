I usually like this genre, but I am giving up on this book after 40 pages. I thought it would be similar to The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls, but it's not nearly as engaging. It was as if I kept waiting for the story to get started. I even flipped ahead from time to time to see if it got better. It didn't appear to. 
I also got tired of the bad language
