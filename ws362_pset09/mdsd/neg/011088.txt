-Everyone expressing a erudite opinion about Clausewitz or "ON WAR" has completely missed the point here. 
-The question is NOT whether Clausewitz or "On War" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. THAT is a moot piont to the Nth Degree.

-The REAL question IS - WHY would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?  
-That is the ONLY question regarding THIS particular version of "ON WAR". 
-Its the ECONOMICS, stupid !
