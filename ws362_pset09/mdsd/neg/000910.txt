Because the guy who initiated the project of writing the book is here at Rice, the rest of us are unlucky enough to have to use this book. If your class uses this book, prepare to go to class. All the time. That's because if you fall behind, the book does not do a good job of explaining things to you. Examples are generally vague and only apply to a few types of problems provided at the back of each section. A lot of the time, I'd find myself stumped on a problem, looking back, and realizing there was no example problem for me to get ideas from.

Yes there are lots of problems and that's good, in a way. But what's the point of having all those problems if the book never teaches you how to do them?

Furthermore, it is a poorly written book. Generally, reading through the book is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Literally speaking. You spend all that time figuring out what the authors talk about and once you figure it out, it was not even worth all that time.

So go to class. All the time. If the prof isnt that great, get yourself another workbook. I havent seen Schaum's but I'm pretty sure they'll do a better job on covering the topics than this text does
