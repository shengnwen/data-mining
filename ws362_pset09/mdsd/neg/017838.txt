Too much psycho-babble and not enough real life advise.  It was a chore to get through it when what I really needed was a swift kick in the pants! Turns out that dumping my zero of a husband was the best thing I ever did - and I just went with my gut.  I guess I was looking for justification - turned out later he was a drug addict!  Duh!  Sometimes we just need to listen to God's voice directing us and that's good enough
