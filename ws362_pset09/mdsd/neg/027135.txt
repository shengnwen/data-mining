I seriously didn't like it. It is definetly not for the young and weak hearted. The characters were not likeable and the fact that everything was sexual was not exactly a positive feature. It sickened me, and i really felt bad after finishing it. Truly skip this book, it's not worthwhile, please i beg of you don't read it. I'm incredibly disappointed in Richard Peck in this one
