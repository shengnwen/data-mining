I read the blurbs from other writers, some I really enjoy, like Jeff Vandermeer, and was excited about this book.  I was extremely disappointed.  A lot of the writing is very good, but a lot of it is just terribly over-written.  The opening was strong, with the two main characters fleeing across a desert, but once they reach the city of Ashamoil, things deteriorate.  There is only really one sympathetic character, and I expected her to be the main character; she isn't.  Instead, it's the other of the two from the opening.  He is gradually revealed to be a vile person, and frankly, just not very interesting.  There are echoes of China Mieville and Jeff Vandermeer and M. John Harrison...maybe even a little Fritz Leiber.  But while I would love to visit cities like New Crobuzon or Ambergris or Viriconium or Lankhmar, I have no desire to visit (or revisit) Ashamoil, despite its vivid depiction
