Hindsight is always 20/20. People critical of the New Deal
have no idea of the fear and hopelessness that the average
American was facing in the 1930s. The New Deal/Roosevelt
were not without flaws, but look at our modern response to 
war and natural disasters. Seventy years later people are still affected by the depression. This author of this book needs to loose his life savings and go hungry before being critical of 
the New Dealers.
