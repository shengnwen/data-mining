This was a good read if you want to learn about the Ayurvedic health principles.  If that is what you are looking for, then this is the book for you.  My disappointment was in the title.  I expected more of Quantum Healing.  I still plan on reading more Deepak, but wish I had known that this book was strictly Ayurvedic methodology only
