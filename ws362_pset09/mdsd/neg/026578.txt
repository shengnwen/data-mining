Yancey fills a necessary niche with those who have had experience with church which causes them to fall away and then fill a void that needs filling.  However, his bottom line perspective of worship being God has an audience watching worshippers seeking His presence in their hearts is not what God seeks at all.  God seeks those who worship Him in spirit and in truth.  Thus, where is God in worship?  In our heart?  What would He want with that sin-filled, darkened, old thing?  What He wants is &quot;chesed,&quot; Hebrew word for &quot;covenant faithfulness.&quot; Our inability totally to do &quot;chesed&quot; caused God to do it for us, incarnate, sacramentally in Christ.  Thus, where is God for us?  In the Gospel preached in its purity and distributed in the sacraments distributed according to His Testament.  Yancey is yet to discover this.  Maybe his void will lead him to this.  Suggest Yancey and others still seeking God would read Gene Vieth's terrific spiritual journey: &quot;The Spirituality of the Cross.&quot
