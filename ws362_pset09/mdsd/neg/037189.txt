Ulrich leads up to believe that the likes named here are the holy grail of best practice. The list of names reads like the book of deadbeats and the academically challenged, Agilent thrashed its self to a fraction of its former glory by the people he named and we are supposed to kneel in worship. Its leaders were clueless buffoons.

The other three reviewers must be Ulrichs relatives, or on the payroll. If you take on board this rubbish, do your current employer a favour and find work in another field of endeavour.
