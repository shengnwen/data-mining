The early part of the book was pure Ludlum, good opening, strong plot buildup, etc. The second quarter went off on a tangent of the spy hero suddenly meeting up with another spy, an old female flame, and yet another spy, a British tongue-in-cheek type. 

This was followed by paragraph after paragraph of what they all once meant to each other, ad nauseam.....gaaaaaagggg. The whole story took a new direction possibly aimed at getting women to read spy thrillers. 

I don't know. I don't care. The unread remains of this trivial pursuit spy scam lies buried in a wastepaper basket somewhere in my house waiting for next week's trash collection. I'm just glad I bought it second-hand.
