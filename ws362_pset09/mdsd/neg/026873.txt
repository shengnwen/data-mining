I am a huge fan of the first Quilts from the Quiltmaker's Gift publication.  I loved the book and have made three quilts that were inspired from the patterns found there.  This sequel, More Quilts from the Quiltmaker's Gift is inferior on nearly every level.  The patterns are not so interesting, and seem more fussy and complex.  In addition, in this sequel publication, the patterns are not rated by level of difficulty, which I believe is a detriment.  Finally, the actual quality of the book is not good.   Within a day of bringing it home from the store, the cover of the book had curled up like a wood shaving!   I think the authors would have done well to stick with the same publisher who put out their first effort.  About the only good things I can say about the book is that the instructions seem clear and the photos of other color options are helpful
