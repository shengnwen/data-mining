I am quite amazed that this novel has an average rating of 4 stars. I had to FORCE myself to complete this book because I could only read about 10 pages at a time before being utterly bored. 

I believe the book started with a good premise: a boy who can "read" photographs. If the author had just stuck with that idea and developed it a bit more, the book could have been decent. However, the author introduced all sorts of lame plot elements and characters, all the way to the end. It was as if she didn't plan the story and just sort of made it up as she went along. In addition, the character development was shallow. I really could have cared less if any of them died. The only remotely interesting character for me was Uncle Paton. 

Please avoid this book. It's drivel, utter drivel.
