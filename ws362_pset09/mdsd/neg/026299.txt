Am I new to gauge theory: no.
Why does he make me feel I am?

Are these new generalized symbols really necessary to his treatment.
Apparently the author  believes that rather than use words to explain
theorems...
He can rely almost entirely on this new set of symbols
 that he has used to translate gauge theory to fiber bundles.
Why is it that so many times
the reader is the one who is made to do the work
of teaching himself  and learning new "languages"
when the author claims he will be teaching you?

I feel that I have to warn the reader, that although he claims to be "mainstream"
differential geometry,  he lies.
he uses very non-standard ( at least for the papers I've read)
notation and instead of starting at the simple gives the most abstract examples
of the notation even in chapter "0".

I grade this book as a "F"... way below even the worst
group theory book I have by an English set of professors!
I'm really as sorry as I can be, but he got me for the money,
by false advertising...
It is a very badly written book,
more a "show off"... see what I can do book,
than a I will teach you to understand book.
I had to go back to other books to compare the notation
so many times that I stack them with this book.
I spent half a year plotting solitons in Mathematica,
and I don't recognize anything in his treatment of them.
Monopoles and Instantons are even worse in this book, if possible.
It is not that I I don't believe he is using correct mathematics,
it is just that it is so hard to tell if he is!
