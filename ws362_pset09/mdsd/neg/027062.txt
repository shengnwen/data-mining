This was the most useless book I have ever read on being a parent.  The author goes on and on about how painful and excruciating breastfeeding is, and how all "girlfriends" can relate to this pain if they are breastfeeding.  Huh??  If she had read any books on breastfeeding at all or gotten some basic advice from a lactation consultant, she would realize that her baby was latched on incorrectly and would have corrected the problem.  Also, she talks about girlfriends hiding from their husbands in the house so that they can breastfeed?  What?!?!  This book just infuriated me, it was so shallow and pointless, I feel like the author lives in a world all her own, inhabited by stepford wife-like "girlfriends" who struggle incessantly with mothering a new baby and have to hide everything from their dumb husbands who are completely incompetent.  How insulting!!  Don't waste your time or money on this garbage
