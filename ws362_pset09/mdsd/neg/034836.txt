We just returned from visiting Oahu in August 2006.  We found that the "new edition" is at least 3 years out of date.  It is clear that the author has not set foot on Oahu or visited Waikiki in quite a while as many of her resturant picks have changed hands, hotels don't offer services listed and the parks have all changed prices and hours of operation.  We laughingly called it "The Book of Lies," for its inept and incorrect information.  You would be better off seeking information from the local cabbies and street vendors.  Find another book and use this one for compost.
