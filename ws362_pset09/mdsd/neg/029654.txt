This isn't really a novel, it's more like a book length collection of semi-comic bits. Despite massive hype it quickly and rightfully went out of print when it came out and it's amazing to me that it was reprinted. The author, his friends and former students have managed to give this tedious read five stars, but believe me you'd be wasting time, money and paper if you picked up a copy. AIDS is a tragic, terrible problem, but silly books like this that use the disease to appropriate some drama and gravity only trivialize the situation
