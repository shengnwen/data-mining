There were two reasons why I picked up this book: the first being that it was illustrated by Lisbeth Zwerger, whose art I greatly admire, and the second because "Swan Lake" is one of my favorite ballets. Unfortunately, this book turned out to be a real disappointment for me. Those familiar with the ballet know of its unhappy conclusion. However, originally the ballet was written with a happy ending which was preserved in this edition. I am not against happy endings, but the way it was presented was too bare bones---no meat at all. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, girl quickly forgives boy and they live happily ever after, the end. Both the narration and characters were flat and left me indifferent. Even Zwerger's illustrations lacked a certain something. I would recommend treating a child to Tchaikovsky's music than this work. For those wishing to enjoy Zwerger's superb art, as well as a captivating story should check out "Dwarf Nose", "The Wizard of Oz", "Alice in Wonderland", and if you are able to obtain them in an out-of-print shop, "The Deliverers of Their Country" and "The Nutcracker"
