Snore.  I too have loved and read the others in this series.  This one bored me to death.  I agree with most of the negative comments here.
 I was happy that Harry and Fair got married again, but with the
emotional tension between the two of them gone, something is missing.  I missed
Maranda, too, who only appeared briefly at the end. I loved her bible-quoting moments and the descriptions of her yummy baked goods.

I think it was a mistake to have Harry leave the post office.  Gone are the wonderful
cameo appearances from minor characters throughout the book. With the shocking knowedge that Mrs. Murphy has not been spayed, are we going to see little Murphies running about?  

Well, every good writer -- and Rita Mae Brown is indeed a good writer -- is entitled to one bad book now and then.  Hope this is the last bad one in this series
