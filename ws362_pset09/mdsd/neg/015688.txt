It's no great feat to hold up a decade thirty years on and make easy sport of it when viewed from a contemporary perspective. If you agree with this statement, then read on:

                                                           Tiresome and catty poster child for a mean-spirited decade/"American Idol" torturer Simon Cowell has already cornered the market on spitting bitchy observation while gleefully breaking the spirits of easy targets. Having been made painfuly aware of that, the author's snarky schtick of "Oh, just LOOK at the ridiculous tastes and norms of the past and aren't we able to see CLEARLY now how HIDEOUS and HILARIOUS such inferior things are from our superior position HERE in the Superior Land of Now" is a pale imitation, and grinds painfully, like metal against bone. 

One read of the unfunny potshots levelled at the trappings of seventies style by the author of this book, and I felt like I was being subjected to one of the lamer episodes of tv's "South Park" where the show's childish writers take shotgun aim at the nearest slow moving pop icon in hopes of getting a cheap laugh. 

While certainly there is much to giggle about in that funked-out, doobie-tokin', plaid and shag carpeted but still mostly sunny and optimistic decade, this particularly superior sounding and unkind take covers no new comic territory. Going after the bright and well-meaning but kinda dumb and clunky interiors the way a school bully singles out the sweet-natured but slow special needs kid on the playground (easy target),the author finds no difficulty spreading the hate equally among the book's sometimes surreal images which feature vibrant paint schemes, cheerful furnishings, and whimsical wall graphics. 

If it's true that every bullying child's actions stem from some unresolved childhood emotional damage, then the reader may be left to wonder just what this particular schoolyard bully's seventies childhood damage must be. 

And for the record, Mr.Lileks, if you were paying ANY attention as a kid in the seventies (as I was) then you already KNEW it was silly, was happy, was camp--hell, even members of the dorky/hip Partridge Family regularly exclaimed "campy!" to accurately describe a situation or concept, for God's sake--which made that time (interiors included) not unbearable, but alot of fun.
