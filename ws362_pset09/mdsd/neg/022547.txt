If you see yourself as a strong, intelligent woman, DO NOT read this book. The 'heroine' is anything but!  Her rationalizations of why not to report key information regarding a murderer to her 'wonderful Texas Ranger' husband, and her reluctance to 'clue' this hunk in on her lucrative business, is beyond any normal persons reasoning. And her teen aged daughters behaviors?  Is anyone that foolish?
Oh, and can she possible squeeze "Texas Ranger" into anymore sentences...on the SAME page?
Normally I consider all books worth reading, but I'll not soon pick up another one of Carla's.
