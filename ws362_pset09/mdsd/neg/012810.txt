prior to reading this book, i had already taken a more difficult , engineering-oriented Digital Signal Processing class (groundwork for Geophysics) so I had a good background it in.  

this book attempts to dummy down DSP concepts for the laymen (or layscientists) but fails in doing so.  half of the ideas are well articulated, but the other-half are written poorly (confusingly or expounded insufficiently) or are illustrated poorly. 

i imagined that if i had no background in dsp or engineering--the target of this book--i would have found it very frustrating.

since this is a textbook, most of the readers will have no choice in book selection, anyways, so tough luck :
