  Ok, I read about 3-4 books a week and this was certaintly not my first by Shannon Drake a.k.a. Heather Graham.  Her normal plot twists keep me on the edge of my seat, prodding me to read on.  And her characters normaly, are well written.  The more I read this book the more I grew in my disappointment!  
  Brian Sterling "The Beast" seemed to have split personalites.  Borish and mean most of the book and then did a total 180 at the end of the book.  The "love" that came to be between Brian and Camille was forced.  Mrs. Drake needed this to have romance in it and they were their.  
  Their were to many players in this game and they only added confussion.  The plot was good if it had been written better.  While most chapters rambled, she failed to explain so much.  It was as if she had a deadline to meet and simply threw it together.  
  Very poorly written.  Do yourself the favor and not bother you will only be left shaking your head in disappointment
