The info contained in the chapters is pretty good and I appreciated the examples of how to do the work, however...if you're a student and you want to check your homework, that might be a little hard.  The author only lists SOME of the answers to the homework, and the answers they do have usually don't tell you how they arrived at those answers.  What they NEED to provide is a student solutions manual.  I'd be happy to pay extra for it, but they don't have it.  They do sell a student study guide, which I did purchase and that does help some, but it's not even close to what would allow the student to understand the homework problems in a step by step manner.  Would someone at the publishing house PLEASE provide a student solutions manual???  PLEEEEASE!!!!!!!
