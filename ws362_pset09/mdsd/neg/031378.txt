I tend to agree with those who have written a negative review on this book. I might even absolve its contents - beginners or not experienced designers can still get something out of it. Clarity and didactics seem to have no consistency in that very often terms, concepts, and acronyms are given for granted, whereas other simple ideas are repeated twice within the same page (and more embarassingly with exactly the same words!).
But what really irritated me is that this book (or at least this edition) HAS NOT BEEN REVIEWED - or at least, not by anyone with more than very limited understanding skills.
Explanations are sometimes made more puzzling by using opposite sentences or words (e.g. "slower" instead of "faster"). Typo's are frequent, and even figures are missing (how can you publish a book where a blank half-page is followed by a figure's title?!?!?!?!).
Of course I have not read (and I am not going to read) subsequent editions of this book, but on (partial) excuse, I can suppose that this book's edition was hurriedly sent to press, and then (more) hurriedly withdrawn, given the amount of corrections it needs.
But then, what do you do with all that printed paper?
You sell it on the internet for a lower price...
Well, it would have been better to recycle it, it would have spared some trees and the buyers' money
