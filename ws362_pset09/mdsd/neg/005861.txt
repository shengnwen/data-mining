    No this book did not leave off unfinished, well it may have, I'll never know since I cannot bring myself to pick it up again and I'm only about halfway through it. One reviewer said if you could stick it out through the first 150 pages you'd be glad, but I felt that reaching that point did not signify any speeding up of the story after it's sloooow start.  The only reason I stuck it out as long as I did was due to a lack of anything else to read at the time, but since I have replenished my reading materials, I feel no need to continue further.  This book is miserable and stays that way.  I can't imagine even wanting to see a happy ending for it, as the characters being so miserable themselves make them very unlikeable for me. I like escaping into the lives of ordinary people, but not to become miserable, I need no book to do that.  If you're looking for something along those lines try Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres, but avoid this book if, well, just avoid it really.
