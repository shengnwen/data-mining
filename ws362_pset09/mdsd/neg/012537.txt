Wow. This book was so incredibly bad, it's hard to imagine. I've read a number of books on building bird houses, and I've built dozens of them myself. I bought this book based on the Stokes name and reputation. Bad move.  There is only ONE plan. It's the standard &quot;single board bird house&quot; design. And they require you to use two boards!!!

Let me say it again. This book only includes ONE plan. The rest of the book is fluff. It tells you what birds like bird houses. It tells you other types of houses that you can make (if you go out and buy a real book), and it tells you a little about the birds. All things that are much better explained in other books.

Do yourself a favour. Don't buy this book. Or, since you can always return it, buy t and see how pathetic it is for yourself. What a disappointment
