I really loved The Fall of a Sparrow and greatly looked forward to another beautiful novel by the same author.  Unfortunately this one fell apart about halfway through.  Unlike the characters in The Fall of a Sparrow, too many of the characters in this book didn't sound or feel like real people, especially the grown-up Cory.  The girl who painted an obscenity on the Appleton water tower was an intriguing character of few words seen mostly through the adoring eyes of the book's narrator:  the grown-up woman just never took life on the page, despite the many long conversations in which she took part.  The story of an American white boy's attraction to a black girl and his (surely realated) lifelong devotion to black music could have been a fascinating and far-reaching one: unfortunately this time the author fails to bring any satisfying insight to the subject
