This book was just a major disappointment. The subject is superb, perhaps the true golden age of baseball, but Roger Kahn ruined it with his windy political opinons. Mr. Kahn seems almost confrontational with his political views, and seems unable to present any baseball history without them. I finally stopped reading it about a fifth of the way through and am very sorry I bought it. Read &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Bums&quot; by Peter Golenbock for real history. Don't waste your money on this stinker
