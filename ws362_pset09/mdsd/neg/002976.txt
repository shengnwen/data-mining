The author writes well and I certainly appreciated that.  However, his spiritual journey seems primarily to emphasize his lack of focus and his ability to see Judaism and Buddhism as &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; spiritual companions.  I felt that his analogies between the two religious philosophies were stretched rather thin and I was never entirely certain why he felt so strongly that the two must be related or joined together.  I also felt that in several instances, he misrepresented Jewish theological ideas in order to make them fit more neatly into a Buddhist mold.  For example, he tries to relate the Buddhist notions of reincarnation with those of Jewish Kabbalistic mystics.  While there are similarities, he never makes note of the fact that reincarnation is not a particularly strong thread within any of the major denominations of Judaism.  All in all, after reading this book, the phrase, &quot;self-indulgent&quot; keeps coming to mind.  I'm sure it was important for him to write it -- I'm just not convinced that it's important for others to read
