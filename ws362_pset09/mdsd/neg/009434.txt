I'm a huge BC fan and I thought his first book was great, I actually laughed out loud multiple times while reading it (which looks kind of weird on an airplane). This one misses the mark completely. As a made up account of making a movie, it fails completely. The story and events are rediculously not plausible or funny. He should stick to non-fiction
