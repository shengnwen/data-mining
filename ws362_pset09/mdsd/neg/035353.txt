This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary
