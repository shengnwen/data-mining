I read this because someone recommended Janet Evonovich's books as being good reads - pretty hilarious- etc.  I had also seen a couple of her books on the best seller list.  I could not get into them at all.  They are very simple with character development that doesn't really occur.  When I read I am usually able to picture a character in my mind - not so with these books.To me, the recommend was highly over rated.  If you want to read something simple, fast and easy on an airplane to kill time - maybe - otherwise skip Evonovich
