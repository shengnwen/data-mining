The problem I find with Goswami is his choice of terms, particularly "monistic idealism."  According to my education, "monistic" means you believe in one kind of substance, namely matter or soul substance.  If Goswami admits the reality of matter, as he does in the first chapter and even implies in the subtitle of the book, then how can he call himself a "MONISTIC idealist?"  The term denotes that he must believe that mind or "consciousness" is all that exists, but he hangs himself by allowing the reality of matter.  So, he's really a DUALIST after all.

Don't waste your time on this book.  For a better example of pure idealistic monism, check out George Berkeley (you can find him in a book titled _The Empiricists_), or go back to the Hindu and other Indian sages upon whom Goswami draws
