I read this book as part of my participation in the high school extracurricular event Academic Decathlon.  From this book, I was supposed to learn about the medical profession, the scientific research profession, the lives of scientists and doctors and how they fared in a rural, Midwestern America populated by bible-thumpers, illiterates, country hicks, and indigent farmers.  What I got was the biography of a workaholic.  

Martin Arrowsmith, the protagonist of this book, is devoted to basic medical research, and is willing to sacrifice much in life to do it.  These include money, fame, time with his loving wife, and time to himself to do things like exercise, go on a vacation, go out for a good meal, etc...  In short, Mr. Arrowsmith is a workaholic, pure and simple.  Just because his work is medical research instead of say selling cars does not excuse his undying love of work.  In reading this book I saw the reflection of many people I know; single or divorced workaholics.  Yes their jobs are important and yes they love their jobs, but they, like Arrowsmith, lack balance in their life.  Overall, I found the book quite boring, and do not believe it should have won the Pulitzer Prize
