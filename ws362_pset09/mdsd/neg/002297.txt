Here is another self-help book that didn't need to be written. The useful information could be summerized in a phamplet, if so much - the cover would be sufficient. Why this writing style is so popular is beyond my comprehension (maybe because people like me keep picking them up...AHHH!!!). The use of filler "stories" are quite uneccessary if the author has something unique or interesting to say, but in most of these books it is just a rehash of the same basic information. If this is the first of this type of book you are reading you may find some of it interesting and useful, but that is being generous, but, if you have read any other self-help book remotely similar, don't even waste your time
