This is total waste of time, because the misleading of the previous review, I bought this book.   Reading through the pages, you will find out it is a mind training, and project your mind out.  It is not astral projection.   

Like one of the reviewer wrote which I should have got another book intead this one.   It is a meditation ONLY book.  It is waste of money and time.

The author does not know what he is talking about, to help you futher, you can google this book other people's reviews and in one of the famous encyclopedia quotes about this book, "but no explanation is given as to how forms and entire environments can exist without spatial dimensions, nor why there can be a sequence of events and yet no such thing as time."

Another book is better which is -Successful Astral Projection to the Space and Universe by Sapphire
