This book is based on pretty scrawny evidence throughout, mostly interviews with apparently quite jaded exiles. Also, the title is very misleading. The title should be more along the lines of a biography of two power hungry brothers, Raul and Fidel.

Apart from that it is a good read for a Cuba novice and has good flow.
