I hate it when a good character gets boring, and that's what has happened to poor Detective Inspector Carol Ashton. I think this series either needs to retire or be reborn.  Actually it could have stopped several books before.  What happened to Carol?  She use to be intriguing, multidementional, not to mention sexy. Now we the typical Niad 200 page, spit out another of a series of watered down (maybe edited out), over priced piece of junk.    My hope is when number 14 shows up I have enough sense to hold on the my money
