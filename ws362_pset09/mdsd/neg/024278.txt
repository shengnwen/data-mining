This is without a doubt one of the most boring books I have ever read.  You need to take notes to understand it.  It is very disjointed; it feels like a bunch of different chapter articles bound together in book form. It deals with a fascinating subject; it is a pity that it was not better written because it could have been an excelent book.  This may be the fault of the editor rather than the writer; she certainly needed some expert help with making her chapters fit together in a cohesive manner
