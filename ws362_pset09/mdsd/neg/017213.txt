Berenstain Bears First Time Books usually touch upon some true to life problem that children encounter in their lives.  The stories end with some meaning, helpful solution or an understanding that maybe it's not really a  big problem.  &quot;Mad, Mad, Mad Toy Craze&quot; does neither of these.   The story is true to the Beanie Baby craze but there is no solution or even  an understanding at the end.  My children and myself were for the first  time truly confused and disappointed with an ending of a Berenstain Bear  book.  If the goal of the book was for the children to come up with better  ending to this story,  then we succeeded. I will still continue buying this  series but I will not recommend this book to anyone
