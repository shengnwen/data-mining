From others review, I thought the story would be great.  Dont mind guy who tried to reform or wooed back his wife.  As every human are not perfect.
I somehow felt SICK when Emma Rawlins show up with his infant son.  It is not that I mind John decided to raise his bastard son in the house afterwards.  But from my understanding that son was more important during that time, why the writer not have just girl from Mistress and boy from the real wife to compensate the reader's feeling?  
I could not keep this book (I normally collect all books I like and less like) but this one I donate it to local library the next day after I purchased it (I read through the nite).  I will never touch this book ever.  I read books for pleasure, not to be left feeling angry for all week
