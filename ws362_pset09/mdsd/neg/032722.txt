There are characters in Proust that are so cartoonishly shallow, vain, parochial, and lacking in self-knowledge that one laughs in spite of thinking no such person could exist in real life. 

Phyllis Rose proves that such people do exist.

Of course it is possible that her book is a satiric fiction disguised as autobiography. If so, it is not funny enough. (Learn from Proust!) If this really is an autobiography, it is surprising that an author would allow publication of something that makes her look so ridiculous.
