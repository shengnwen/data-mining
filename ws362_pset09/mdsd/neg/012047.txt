Maybe at the time it was written I would have reviewed it more favorably. In light of the life Miller led I can't help but to be disappointed by the cheap commericialization of the socialist superiority over capitalist theme that permeates the play. Here Miller creates a character only to destroy that character to point out the ills of capitalism, then Miller spends the rest of his life living an indulgent capitalist life here in the good ole USA: the very capitalist society that was supposedly Willy's oppressor. I think the years have taken the shine off of Miller a bit. I'm sure the Liberal 101 literature professor will disagree
