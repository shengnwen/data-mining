I enjoyed the first two novels in this series, but not this one.  Her attorney protagonist became a shrill, irrational, self righteous zealot with no facts to support her breathless polemics.  (All it would take is an  unspecified &quot;natural disaster&quot; and then The Terrible Thing would  happen!). The contrived &quot;factual&quot; rationalization for her  position was as predictible as it was silly.  This is a novel long on  overly emotional protagonists drenched in self absorbed angst and prolix,  confession prone bad guys, but short on rational plot development.  It  makes one long for Laconic Joe Leaphorn from Hillerman's novels.  If you  like the manufactured emotional trapeze of a soap opera, you will like this  book
