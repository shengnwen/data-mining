Unless you are an immature tramp I cannot fathom how you could enjoy, relate or even read this nonsense. The style and to a lesser extent the story hold merit on a historical basis, but the plot is dated and obscured to the wanna-feel-empowered nobodies of the world. That people think this is a great book betrays how foolish the reading public are; seriously, just stick to what Oprah tells you to read, or better, simply plop down in front of the television and watch 'reality.' 

I am not saying this is not an important book; it is. But if you think it possesses literary Quality, read 'Confessions of Nat Turner,' 'Go Tell It On the Mountain,' 'The Invisible Man,' 'Native Son,' and tell me that this book belongs in the same class of fiction as these novels.

Am I biased? Yes, completely, I think that the work of women does not compare favorably to what men have achieved in letters. I mean, "Atlas Shrugged" is one of the most horrid things mankind has produced! But there is the converse....I mean, how many great wives, how many good stay-at-home moms have been men
