This book tries to cover a lot of ground, but in the end you get a sense that it has gotten you anywhere.  The first impression I got was that this book was actually a bunch of journal articles thrown together because there isn't much sense of continuity to this book.  It doesn't have an overall theme and the topics covered don't seem to connect well.  It starts off with a short biography of the Grimms, so far so good.  After that, it covers the orgins of the tales, a little dry, but not bad.  After that, there's a chapter about how the Grimm tales indoctrinate children into the bourgeoisie.  The Marxism seems a little dated.  After that, out of the blue, you get a chapter on Henri Pourrault, an obscure writer of fairy tales.  It's never explained why this writer is in this book, but I guess the author really liked this journal article and couldn't resist throwing it in.

After this, it gets really weird.  You get a chapter about how fairy tales are all about childhood sexual abuse.  If that doesn't kill your mood to read fairy tales, then the following chapter in which the author attacks the Grimm tales as outdated and obsolete and advocates the rewriting of the tales for more modern perspectives will.  One gem that the author singles out for praise is a rewriting of Cinderella.  In this version, Cinderella is a labor organizer who organizes all the workers in her kingdom.  The prince, impressed by her accomplishments, falls in lover with her and proposes.  However, Cinderella refuses to betray the worker and rejects the prince.  In the end, Cinderella moves to America and the prince commits suicide over the heartbreak.  Wow, the kids will love that one.  It's not even entertaining or enlightening for adults and borders on masochistic.  That's some of the nonsense that you'll run into in this book.  I really recommend that you pass on this
