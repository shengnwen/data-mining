This selfpaced training is one of the worst Microsoft has produced so far. The only one that i can think of that is worse is the selfpaced training kit for IEAK 4. If you have bought it and are preparing for the MCP test. I  advice you to read the chapters in the Windows 2000 Srv RK on the subjects  for the test. Also be sure to download some whitepapers from Microsoft. The  book alone just don't prepare you good enough for the test
