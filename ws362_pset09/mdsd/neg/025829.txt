I wrote quite a long review concerning this book which resided on these pages for months.  When I checked back recently, I noticed it had been removed.  But here it is in a nutshell:

This book is not in any real sense a scholarly treatment of the Book of Mormon or it's origins.  Givens is an apologist for the traditionally accepted LDS view of the origin of the Book of Mormon, and he has marshalled his considerable intellect (and prodigious writing skills) to prove the wisdom of this view.  The fact that he supposedly presents counter-arguments to the book's historicity should not obscure this central fact; indeed, these arguments are consistently shown to be flawed (or at least open to serious doubts), while arguments that support the BOM's divine origins are constructed with the most fantastical interpretations of both history and archeology.  His book masquerades as a scholarly work, but it is mostly useful as an insight into the lengths some LDS "scholars" will go to prove their holy book is something more than a wonderfully inventive novel written by a charismatic young man in the 19th Century.

As a side note, this book should make excellect reading for intelligent LDS devotees who wish to engage Gentiles (non-believers) in a discussion of the Book of Mormon's origins.  It will provide them with apparently cogent arguments with which they can astound thier interlocutors, who - without sufficient information at their fingertips - will be unable to detect the fundamental absurdity beneath.  

I gave the book 2 stars (rather than 1) because it is illuminating as an insight into the phenomenon of Mormonism and, more specifically, what passes for Mormon scholarship
