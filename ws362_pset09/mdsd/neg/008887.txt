I started this book about 6 months ago and never finished but I started reading it on a recent vacation and unfortunately had nothing else to read so I finished it. Lila, the supposed-heroine of the book is the most annoying and selfish character I have read lately. The rest of the characters were no better and seemed so stereo-typical and boring. I think the whole story was completely illogical, especially how she had never been in love yet but when she gets married she turns into a co-dependent and pathetic excuse for a woman who then is supposed to be this nationally acclaimed poet who seems like nothing but a shallow 30-sometihng who sleeps around. Plus the characterization of her family is completely ridiculous; I know of no one whose own family is that insensitive. The whole story was so trite and so predictable. I wish I would have read all of the reviews before I bought this book
