This book will sucker you, and I don't mean that in a good way. It starts out as a hard-nosed, nicely-written discussion of what it means to help someone and the rewards and troubles that may ensue. The first half of the book presents a number-but not as many as the jacket blurbs would have you believe-of the philosophical conundrums of giving and receiving help; as a one-time teacher and recently-retired minister the author has had lots of personal and practical experience in the area. Then about halfway through the screen of objectivity starts to slip and the author's radical leftist colors begin peeking out here and there. By the last third of the book the text has become a confused, softheaded 'social liberation theory' polemic for some sort of a semi-Marxist utopia where, I guess, everyone devotes his or her existence to helping each other. This may be fine if you already believe that sort of thing, but the argument isn't convincing and to a more neutral reader it comes off like a rant. Heaven help the conservative who stumbles on this piece of work; the author has no help (or compassion) for him or her. Which is too bad because the original topic-the paradox of help-is worthy of any amount of reasoned discussion, and the author's nice writing (if you discount the usual self-centered boomer "I this... and I that..." style) draws you in. But the journey doesn't go to its advertised destintation, and I'd say spend your time and money elsewhere.
