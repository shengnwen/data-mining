I would not even give this book ONE star if I had a choice!  Although some people state that this book may be informative and easy reading, and one poster even stated that it helped him pass a DIFFERENT exam, it fails miserably in preparing you for the 70-291 exam.  The book should have been titled "Some really really basic Windows Server Infrastructure info and JUST BARELY scratching the surface of the 70-291 exam!"  The book was short and easy reading and I aced all the questions at the end of each chapter.  But when I took a real practice test by SelfTest software, I got 5 questions out of 50 correct on my first try.  NOT A GOOD START for the exam which I wanted to take next week.  The questions on the practice test that I got wrong were NOT even covered in any respect in the book.  I've passed 70-290 and 70-270 and I can tell you that I know what to expect from a book and from the MS tests and this book does almost NOTHING for you in regards to the exam.  Sure, it may be nice reading and it may have some interesting info, but if you are planning on buying a book to prepare for the 70-291 exam, SKIP this one.  

I am going to reschedule my exam for a few weeks later and buy a REAL book!
