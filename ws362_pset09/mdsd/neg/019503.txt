The author chose a very important topic, but he's attacking straw men throughout the entire thing. He complains about religious people who supposedly use isolated Bible quotes to endorse poverty's existence, and then he spends a half-chapter piling on the Bible quotes to say why we should act. I agree we should act and the Bible says we should act, but I could do with a little less condescension. No religious person uses the Bible to argue in favor of poverty. Who on earth does the author think he's arguing against?  

He says there's a problem, and we all agree with that, but then he assumes that the existence of poverty somehow predetermines the particular solutions he recommends.  He fails to conclusively link the causes of poverty with those solutions.  Knowing how someone fell into a hole does not provide sufficient information about how to get them out of the hole.  Repeating the same assertions a dozen times is not the same as a reasoned argument.

The author needs to realize that people don't differ much about whether poverty is bad. They disagree on how to reduce it, and the author does not address these other opinions much.  Instead we get a lot of caricature of religious people and conservatives
