The opening of this memoir was enjoyable; any adoptee might want to know about his or her birth parents, but the author too often fills in the gaps in narrative with her own "imaginings" about what her birth parents thought and felt. Doesn't she ever question that her birth mother's version of events is highly suspect? 

From my own experiences, you just cannot begin to understand what a woman in 1960's Washington, D.C. might be going through. The Kennedys had women in and out of the White House, parents were not "proud" of unwed, pregnant daughters and young women made mistakes just like today. Did the author's mother decide to have a child on her own, too? 

Rather the attacking the motives of a man she doesn't know, I'd have liked a lot more stories like the one she tells about her adoptive father's family history. That's family history, not family fiction. 

I just listened to her new interview on NPR, and I wish she had really answered the questions the interviewer was asking. Why didn't she just call her birth father directly? Had she considered the birth father's wife's feelings? 

My mother never let my father see or speak about the woman he had dallied with one summer. She forgave him, and they moved on. The "other woman" never let him "do the right thing." When he found out the child had died of neglect, he never spoke of it (because of his promise), but it broke his heart. I'm sure there are many other stories like his out there. 

I only hope Homes's daughter has a better life
