If someone would please do me and the rest of the readers a favor and remove his computer, word processor, notebook, pens and pencils, we might be spared another Omar Tyree novel!  After reading the dreadfully boring College Boy, I didn't think Omar could possibly write another novel as bad as that one.  While not quite as awful as College Boy, Sweet St. Louis is a close second.  Filled with page after page of long, boring narrative, this book took forever to go anywhere and forever to get to a point (assuming that there was a point, that is).  I won't be reading another book by him again as there are way too many better authors than him to choose from
