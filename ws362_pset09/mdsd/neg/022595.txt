Rick Moody's writing isn't of a "style" as so many would praise. It's pure redundancy  mixed with instances of information that is meaningless to a story. I had to FORCE myself to read through the first story of this book. And that was only in an attempt to be fair.

His interjections of special detail (i.e., the kind and color of rug Ms. Rondale purchased in the first story) are not at all "genius" or "challenging". They are distracting and pointless. If they do anything to what might have been a good story, they dismember it one organ at a time.

I won't call it all bad writing - but it certainly isn't the kind of writing that I'd call good. Or recommend to anyone
