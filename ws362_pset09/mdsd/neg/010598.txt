This book is conservative Boller's cash cow.  All he has to do is take grade school myths and "debunk" them using the encyclopedia.  Who really thought Columbus was trying to prove that the world was round?  Not since Kindergarten have I thought on such a precious issue.  Let's face it, only conservatives who rarely read books actually believe such things.  Chances are, if you believe, or care, that Columbus was trying to prove the world round, you probably also believe it rained for 40 days and 40 nights and a big boat with a male and female of every species on the planet could fit onto the Titanic.

Boller also intends to "prove" that the Indians were not "one with nature" but polluters and warmongers like us.  Is his chortling at this supposed myth supposed to be an implicit justification for our ancestors horrible treatment of them or our pollution of the environment?  Such is the implication.

In any case, the brainwashing is so thinly veiled as to be almost embarrassing, not that a conservative would be able to lift the wool from their eyes.  In the very title we have his real thesis: "Clinton = questionable," and the names of the chapters inside follow suit "environmental pollution = OK,"  "Hillary = lazy lesbian."

Attention readers, leave it to the gullible students at the University where this guy teaches to sink their wooden teeth into questions of orthadontal history.  A better book: Man rises from the dead: Not so!  Man lives inside a whale: Not so!  Frogs rain down from the sky: Not so!  Man feeds a whorde of beachnicks with 10 fish: Not so
