The backgrond information was interesting, however it did not make up for the mistakes in the restaurant section, etc.  I found the book confusing and inaccurate on a number of occaisions.  The book also lists only a smattering of hotels and restaurants which was very frustrating.  For example, the book states that Gabrielle's Restaurant is on the &quot;edge of the French Quarter&quot; which could be further from the truth.  The restaurant is far past Rampart St., which is the edge of the French Quarter.  The bok also lists the St. Louis Cemetaries No. 1 &amp; 2 in the Garden District.  This also could be farther from the truth.  Save your ... for a book on N.O. with accurate info
