Ray La Fountain obviously feels inspired by Don De Lillo's excellant novel LIBRA but he is not up to the heights of De Lillo's masterpiece.  I think there should be more emphasis on Oswald's character.  A book like this should make you feel like you know Oswald but it does not accomplish this task at all
