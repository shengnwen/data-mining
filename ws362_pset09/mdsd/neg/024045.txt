I had read glowing reviews about this book and was very eager to begin reading it.  What a disappointment!  The heroine is uninspired, the writing is abysmal, and the plot never seems to move anywhere.  I love soap operas and couldn't wait for the "juicy" reveals about soaps that the book previews promised. Overall, I was incredibly bored by the novel.  Let me illustrate it this way.  I always read every page of every book before making up my mind about it.  With this one, I stopped about a fourth of the way.  Your time would be better spent watching an episode of "All My Children.
