This book is, at best, an intro to ADHD.I bought it hoping that there would be some specific "how to study" tips for highschool and college students with AD/HD, but there is nothing of the sort.  In fact, there is very little in this book that isn't found in other books written for children or adults.  The chapter, "Legal rights of students with ADD" is useful and relevant, but that is 10 pages out of a 150.  

There are two other annoying things about this book.  First, Quinn uses the term 'ADD', which has been scientifically obsolete since the 1980s.  Second, Quinn's writing style is somewhat condescending.

I would recommend that a person new to their diagnosis, or even somebody who is old hand, read "You Mean I'm not Lazy, Stupid, or Crazy?"  as opposed to this book.
