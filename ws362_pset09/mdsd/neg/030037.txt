Some readers may be interested to know that the setting of this novel -"Sambuco" - is actually Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast, until recently the home of Gore Vidal.  The movie being filmed in the village was Beat  the Devil, directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart.  (In the book Bogie is the obnoxious drunk Burnsie.)  Cass Kinsovling's household seems to be in the ground floor of the old Caruso Belvedere.  The atmosphere of this book is not unlike the film version of The Talented Mr. Ripley, another tale of Americans in Italy in the 1950's.  For all of Styron's fine writing, this is something of a period piece.  The moral crisis that is at the heart of the book - the "fantastic going to pot" of  Americans in the post-war period - is not of much concern to anyone today.  Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice are Styron's masterpieces.  May he rest in peace.
