I strongly encourage you to read the excerpt pages before buying this book. If you look carefully, you will find many opinions snuck in as fact. These opinions are always slanted toward the Muslim side. For example, it calls the difference between the Koran's account of Jesus' birth and the Bible's, "inspired." That is an opinion. This is not an objective comparision of the two religion's viewpoints. It is more positive toward the Muslim religion than the Christian one. That may or may not have been the author's intention, but it is there. You may want to consider this in deciding if this book is for you or not
