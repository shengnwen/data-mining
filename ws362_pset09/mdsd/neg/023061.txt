I know that Philip K. Dick is one of the great classic sci-fi writers, but this book seemed dreadful to me. At many points I had a difficult time figuring out just what was happening, and when I did , it seemed to be such pretentious rubbish. For example "I see now what Plotinus saw , he realized. But , more than that, I have rejoined the sundered realms within me; I have restored the Shekhina to En Sof". Another sample,  "The cosmic cycle will bring this age inevitably, it will be the next shemittah , very much like the first; the Torah will again rearrange itself out of its jumbled matrix." Some will find this very profound and delight in the obscure Hebrew references. For me, it was confusing , boring ,  and at times made me suspect the author was intoxicated. 
   More a poorly written religious fantasy than sci-fi , I must say this is one of the worst books I have read in some time
