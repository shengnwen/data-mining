I bought this book for my wife - a feminist, a mother of 4, a psychology graduate student, a conservative and a Christian. According to this book the down fall of motherhood is because of people like "Clair Huxtable", Princess Diana, Kathie Lee Gifford and the Christian Right. This author has some skeletons in her closet and carries her baggage through the whole book. This book was so jaded by this my wife was unable to read it. Here is an example of the bias in the book. In the center of the book are a few pages of pictures, here are two of the captions, "When Susan Smith killed her two children, she was widely vilified, and became a symbol of motherhood in peril. Smith got little sympathy for suffering from mental illness or for having been, for years, a victim of sexual abuse by her Christian Coalition stepfather." and "When Andrea Yates, a stay-at-home, fundamentalist Christian, home-schooling mother with five small children, drowned them all in 2001, much was made of the dangers of post-partum depression and psychosis. But many mothers also saw the tragedy as a warning sign about the tyranny of the new momism."

Typically I would resell the book here on Amazon, but in order to spare you... I threw it away
