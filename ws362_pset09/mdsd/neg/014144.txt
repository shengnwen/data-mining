I thought this book was disappointing.  I was looking for more general ideas on how to decorate, but this book doesn't give that type of information.  It shows specific rooms and how they were decorated.  Also, in the quiz to find your decorating style, there are 20 question, and I scored 5 points in three of the categories (Traditional, Country, and Ethinic.) So, you'd think there would be a section on decorating in an ecletic style, but there isn't.  If you want to see this book for decorating ideas, check it out from the library before buying--you'll be glad you didn't spend the money
