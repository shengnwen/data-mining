This story takes place in South Africa. It starts off with the promise of a great read as Silas encounters Francoise Du Boise, who had raped his wife Lydia decades earlier. This wound is freshly reopened not only for Silas but for Lydia when he tells her about it.
Then the book becomes boring and as slow as molasses with very little action, which when it fleetingly appears is interspersed with a whole lot of thinking. Example: On page 95 "he urinated" but since page 92 we'd been hearing of the hospitalized Silas's "unbearable need to urinate."
On page 30 the action here is Mikey peeing and watching "the steamed froth with some satisfaction, shivers with delight at the end. How pleasing the simplest acts of gratification." I think the author loves to pad.
The story improves slightly (pg.36) when Mikey remembers how he and Mireille as youngsters "played Ghandi." However when Mikey falls asleep while he is looking at Lydia's diary hidden in her bureau, for which he went out of his way to search for the key, there was something definitely askew here, I thought.
On page 78 Kate stumbles on Mikey's ritual but the story gets diluted with that time when she sees a leopard up close. Aouch!!
And that "stuff" between Silas and Betty was..... (pg. 98). I persevered to page 100 (1/3 of the book). Couldn't take more.
The author's positives were in some of his descriptions, which were sometimes interesting and humorous
