Thank goodness I borrowed this book, because there are better investments out there.

It's ironic that Kevin J. Anderson has a blurb on the book's cover, because I was just about to compare this book to the terrible Butlerian Jihad novel by Anderson in terms of writing style--not a good thing!  This book isn't quite as bad, but that's the only good thing I can say about DEATHDAY.  I, for one, am not even going to contemplate buying the sequel.  This book has no literary soul, and no resolution of any kind either.  What's worse, it lacks any of the qualities I would expect in a Dietz book.  His novels had been going uphill since Legion of the Damned, with strong characterizations and intricate portraits of fascinating universes.  This book lacks effective character development, and there is NO fascinating universe, just Earth on fire.  There are too many good books out there to waste time on this product--using the word literature implies too much that just doesn't apply here
