I had really high hopes for this book when I bought it.  Seemed like an interesting premise.  I've read other books by this author and they were interesting, at least.  This book was confusing and really quite boring.  The first half of the book (200 pages) basically has the very forgettable characters doing not much of anything.  When the "action" finally starts, the menacing artifact is about as scary as a ham sandwich.  I have to be honest, I didn't even finish the book.  I stopped about 50 pages from the ending because I just couldn't stand it anymore
