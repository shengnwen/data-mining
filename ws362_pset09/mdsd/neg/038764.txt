I read this book because my mother and father, a career soldier, were married shortly before World War II, after knowing each other only 3 months. I hoped this book would offer me some interesting insights. But trust me, this book has no insights to offer. The vignettes are too short and most seem incomplete; further, they are repetitious and shallow, and the whole book is poorly written. Do not waste your time. Instead, spend it finding one of the really good books on WWII; there are plenty out there. Larry King must be spreading himself too thin these days
