The book was put together in an informative and easy to read way.  It's a travel log, for anyone wanting to visit the Nez Perce Trail National Park, plus it gives a summarized overview of that happened.  I loved the author's method of narrating the story of what happened, with easy to read maps and tables of information.  Her list of references was also impressive.    More detail will require further reading, but this is a starter.  What is missing from her story is what this band of renegades really was.  They were outlaws, shunned by their own Nez Perce Nation and what is also missing is the national impact of this unfortunate Indian outbreak had on our Country.  That is why I didn't rate the book higher.  It's a view into history "through rose colored glasses", which is quit in style today, but that gives the starters on history a dangerously biased view.  Real history is often painful to read about.   These Indians were not heroes. Hundreds of innocent people were murdered and the real Nez Perce almost lost their wonderful Idaho Reservation because of this War.  Congress was in a complete uproar.  They were also opposed by other Indian Nations, specifically the Bannock, Shoshone and the Crow to mention a few.  This is the story of a national disaster and tragedy.  The real heroes were often those they attacked and the horse soldiers that had to chase them.  Still, as a travelog and guide to 80% of the historic sites along the Nez Perce Trail, this book is a good starter.  I also loved the historic photographs, some of which I have not found anywhere else
