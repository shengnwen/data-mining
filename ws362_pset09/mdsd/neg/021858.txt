if you are looking for a story with a plot, you will not find it in this book.  reading this book reminded me of watching EYES WIDE SHUT with tom cruise.  i guess i am niave because i kept wondering if this kind of stuff really happens.  if you think you would enjoy reading about a love triangle involving the sex lives of two guys and a woman, then this is the book to read
