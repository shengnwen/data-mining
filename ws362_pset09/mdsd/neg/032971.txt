I am a huge Tananarive Due fan---My Soul to Keep is one of my favorite books and The Living Blood is not far behind.  So it pains me to say just how disappointed I was with Joplin's Ghost.  It is clear that Ms. Due has given up her true voice to keep up with urban drivel that has, for some unknown reason, become so popular as of late.  Joplin's is an easy read--which is not a good thing, as it lacks the dimension and coplexity of her previous works.  The Joplin piece was interesting but the rest of the story tries to be hip and falls way short of the mark. I hope that Ms. Due finds her way back to her voice.
