To me, Richard Laymon's books read like early 80's slasher films.  Not exactly high-art, pretty misogonystic, and ultra-violent.  Some people, like me, like this type of film and book, but this one just doesn't really do it for me.

First of all, it's really two novels in one.  I kinda don't understand why that author just didn't make this into two books.  I think it would have worked better.  We don't need any Tarantino-esque plot melding in the literary equivalent of a Friday the 13th film.

Also, as with all of Laymon's novels, but especially in this one, the female characters are ridiculous.  They are always wearing next to nothing, they always want to have sex with strangers, they're always beautiful.  It seems like a lot of horror authors, especially Laymon, create female characters to be like what they wish most women were like.  I know it's "fiction" but come on.  

Additionally, every time a character in the novel comes across another person, their first thought is that the other person is a serial killer rapist.  When I'm out hiking, or walking down the street, and I run across another group of hikers or pedestrians, I don't automatically think "thank god I brought my gun because these people are going to sodomize and mutilate my girlfriend."  Laymon must have been one paranoid guy.  I don't know, maybe it's just me.

It's also pretty slow and devoid of suspense until the end of the novel(s).  Nothing, and I mean nothing, (not even any successful character development) happens within the first 200 pages.

Also, the word "breast" or "nipple" appears at least once every three pages.  Seriously.

It's redeeming quality is that is does deliver the splatterpunk goods before all is said and done.  Still, not recommended. Pick up "Night in the Lonesome October" as a much better example of what Laymon is capable of
