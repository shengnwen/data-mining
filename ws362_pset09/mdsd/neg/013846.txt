I had reservations about it when my small group decided to give this book a whirl, and although I was game and tried to like it, I just couldn't.  

Liz's overfamiliar style, her judgemental tone, and pandering to churchy already-good-girls reads like a book that reinforces smugness among the churched.

I especially did not like the way she glossed over the difference in 21st Century standards for women, and instead just judged them against today's free-er women's options and opportunities.

I will say that we had many good conversations because we read the book, but in the end, we were all severely disappointed in the book itself. 

Examples of what I mean:  some of the "bad girl" scenarios seemed like she was stretching to fill pages, "bad for a good reason" - what?, or nattering on and on about David's sin with Bathsheba - wait, he's not a girl!
