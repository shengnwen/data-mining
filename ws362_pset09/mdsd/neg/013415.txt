Maybe this book had some good information in it during the early 90's when all of this stuff was new but now this book doesn't offer anything to anyone. All of the technical stuff is very old and the focus is on very simple stuff like HTML page directories and images while, the team structure chapters are conflicting seem to be written by someone who doesn't really understand the development process, and the project scenarios have little to no value
