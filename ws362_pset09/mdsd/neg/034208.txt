I was pretty dissapointed with this book.  All the "inside information" has been pretty much common knowledge.  Although "taking sides" is pretty much a natural in doing Beatles books, the author seems particularly anti Paul/Linda.   It seemed to me the author's main interest wasn't even the Beatles, but Hare Krishna.
I'd suggest "Magical Mystery Tours, My Life With the Beatles" by Tony Bramwell.  It was a much more detailed and enjoyable read
