I read this book many years ago and reviewed it yet again at the prompting of yet another Leftist dolt, I found it illogically constructed, breathlessly conspiratorial and vacuous. It is the favored deceit of Leftists that there is some distinction between "Fascism" or National Socialism and International Socialism. There is none. National Socialism in Germany, Fascism in Italy and other state worshiping monopolistic governmental construct has no distinguishing characteristics from states based upon Lenin/Stalin/Mao/Castro's Socialism.  

It is a lie that the Comintern invented after the collapse of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact for the division of Eastern Europe between the National Socialist state and the Soviet Union. This cooperation terminated by the opening of hostilities between the two socialist entities. Germany's attack was predicated upon  competition over the east's wealth not ideology. 


Reagan and Bush are the defenders of the democratic institutions of the west in line with the founders of the United State while the Left is the heir of a foreign born, degenerate and alien ideology that has produced nothing but slaughter and despair wherever and whenever it overthrows the established order.
