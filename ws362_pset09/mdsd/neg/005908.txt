The author is very articulate and humorous in describing the horrible experience of having a life threatening illness and severe disability.  She is obviously witty and intelligent.  However, I found her often cruel remarks about other people, doctors, nurses, bystanders to be unnecessary.  While sometimes her rude and immature remarks were a response to insensitivity, at times it was directed towards people who because they were in a professional capacity, could not defend themselves.  For example, she chose to make fun of a nurse who wore a hat she thought looked funny and didn't give her the eye contact that she wanted.  I work in the health professions and occasionally meet patients who are bitter and angry about their situation, venting it on others. Ms. Garrison reports her snide comments to others to the readers with glee. I wondered if the stroke had caused some kind of disinhibition or if she was merely somewhat nasty even before the stroke.  In any case, it detracts from her overall account and reduces the level of sympathy of the reader toward her genuinely unfortunate situation
