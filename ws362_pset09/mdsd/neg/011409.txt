I love reading Tamara Hayle's mysteries, however this is the second one that I have read that was a disappointment with the characters and the climax of the mystery.  I truly wish Ms. Wilson will create a more exciting  love life for Tamara, starting out with maybe a steady man in her life.  I  also suggest better clients for her excellent skills and a more exciting  role for her son Jamal instead of the usual unsteady teenager.  I hope  these suggestions will help in the next novel and I look forward Ms.  Wilson
