I wish when I was young someone had sat me down and explained explained some of the life stages I would go through as a teen, young adult, young married person, young father, and a young "provider."

The good thing about this book is that it gives some clues about the stages people typically go through from about 55 onward.  Since I'm 49 I appreciate the clues about what is coming.

The bad thing about this book is that it only touches the surface of the subject it addresses, and the writer is not extremely gifted at conveying his material.

Nevertheless, the writer performs a valuable service and I'm sure he does the best he can
