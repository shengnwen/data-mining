Upon careful examination of her theories, I have concluded that she is an internally torn individual who confuses the woman's role (that of respect, human rights, but different roles) with that of a man's. Being equal doesn't mean you have to do everything the other person does. I find comfort in The Quran, which informs us that men have a degree of responsibility over the woman, i.e. to provide, protect. I think bearing children and raising them is a huge responsibility, and the woman shouldn't be in a position to try to "do it all" (both the man and woman's role). Until men start having babies, I don't see how the overall principles can change regarding roles. 

I find Ms. Wadud's theories to be an extension of her desire to feel respected. I do not see them as scholarly, because they only pander to those who think there is something wrong with the religion of Islam and feel they have the authority to change Allah's/God's commands
