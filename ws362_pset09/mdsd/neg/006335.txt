Find out the back-story to the Stones songs - what a great read I thought as I opened this book. Naw! The author HAS gathered some good pictures of the Stones, however, the synopsis of the songs is horrible. There are no quotes about the songwriting from either Keith or Mick; the comments are all the author's GUESSES of what the stones were writing about. Some of the comments are very trivial. I agree whole-heartedly with Richard Carlton, a most knowledgable reviewer regarding the Rolling Stones. See his review also. One star for the photos
