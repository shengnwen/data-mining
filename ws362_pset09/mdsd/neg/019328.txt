Okay, I got it! Michelle was a bad lady, full of deceitful and murderous thoughts. She's the kind of lady we all love to hate. Good true crime story. But, reading this book is a lot like spending all day with my aunt Helen in Queens. I kept waiting for the author to write something creative to help move the story along, but it never happened. Bore, bore, bore! I just finished reading a similar story about another lady who conspired to murder her husband with her boyfriend (Dale Hudson's Dance of Death) and it was like riding a roller coaster. I couldn't put Hudson's book down. But with Fleeman's book, I couldn't wait to put it down. I assure you I won't be telling my friends about this book. Hey, I'm a generous guy, but two stars is all you'll get from me on this one.
