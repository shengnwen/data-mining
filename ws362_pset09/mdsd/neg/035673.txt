Book assumes basic knowledge of layers manipulation which I don't have. Further frustration; several editing procedures which are mentioned as part of the book are only available on the Internet after filling out a registration and market survey. To top it off I could find no such information at the site specified after I went through the aggravation of completing the required registration and survey.
