...at least it wasn't what I was expecting.  The title, "The Big Book of Self-Reliant Living" lead me to believe that it was a handbook for living off the land.  However, when it arrived I was dismayed to find that the "health" section did not contain home remedies or herbal medicine, but 40 pages (40 pages!!) of lists of the nutritional value of foods.  Who has time to count calories on a farm?  Furthermore, the "health" section had oodles of detailed information on diagnosing a wide variety of cancers and chronic diseases.  I found this to be frustratingly unhelpful information.  The bizarre material can be perfectly illustrated by the bee-keeping page.  It instructs the reader to buy factory made hives, and to have a bee-keeper bring you bees.  Self-reliant my foot.  So, in summary: if you are a hypochondriac who lives in a city and you want a book with tips on environment-friendly heating methods, instructions for removing stains from clothing, money saving ideas for the grocery store or a chart of toy dog breeds, then please contact me because I have the book for you!
