Dr. Boyd is a smart and dedicated apologist.  In this book, he seeks a comprehensive answer to the problem of evil (theodicy), an admirable apologetics effort.

However, Dr. Boyd badly misses the mark, swerving dangerously close to pagan dualism.  A God who does not know the future battles a Devil who is partially out of control.

Dr. Boyd's worldview is similar to Zoroastrianism, in which a good God and a slightly weaker evil god battle for human souls.  This lets God off the hook, because he is busy with a larger spiritual war, and cannot be expected to take care of every human problem and pain.

Respectfully, Dr. Boyd is taking the easy way out on theodicy, like an athlete using steriods.  

There is no need to artificially weaken God or strengthen the devil.  Most of the evils in this life come from corrupt humanity.  The mystery is why God allows humans so much latitude to cause ourselves so much harm.  What is the long-term good?  Is it for character growth, to highlight the need for forgiveness, to illustrate God's justice, to prepare souls for the life to come?  These are the real and difficult questions of theodicy.
