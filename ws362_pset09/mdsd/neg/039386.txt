The author does a good job expressing her difficulty in being a Jew and a Buddhist, and then tries to squeeze in a few ideas that try to bring the two together. I have studied Judaism for many years and I can say that she doesn't really know much about Authentic Judaism all she knows is what a Jew is in the modern western world, but that is not true Judaism. 
True authentic Judaism doesn't have to be forced into symmetry with Buddhism, it is readily apparent how both traditions come from the same source and flow beautifully together. What is needed is for someone to explain what Judaism is.
There is a wonderful book that just came out and I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to find out about this subject. I promise you wont be disappointed. 
It is a conversation between a Torah Scholar (Akiva Tatz) and a Buddhist Jew (David Gottlieb) called "Letters to a Buddhist Jew." 
Enjoy!
