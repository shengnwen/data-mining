Guenter Lewy seems to have one mission in life: to prove that there was only one genocide in world history, that of the Jewish people during WWII, and that no other ethnic or religious groups have ever been victims of genocide. In recent years, he has been publishing one book after another that attempt to demonstrate that various peoples (American Indians, Gypsies, Armenians) were never victims of genocide. To achieve his objective, he makes a selective use of historical documents, using only the ones that corroborate his thesis, and ignoring those that would prove him wrong. His reading of history is permeated with bias. I recommend anyone to read the negative review of this book by a world-class scholar of genocide, Robert Melson, in Holocaust and Genocide Studies (vol. 16, no. 1, 2002).
