It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.
