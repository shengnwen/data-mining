I found this book to be extremely depressing and full of despair, which someone who has lost a child doesn't need to feel more of.  This book offered no hope and must have been written by authors who believe they will never see their children again.  I refuse to look at life and death that way and instead choose to have hope of reuniting with my daughter and peace in knowing that she is in a much better place than we are.  Obviously I would not recommed this book for anyone who has lost a child.
