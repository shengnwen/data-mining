I bought this without reading the reviews, it was a mistake.  I am designing an addition and need a clear guide from forms to finishing.  This isn't it.  As meantioned, it is a collection of articles.  While informative, there are major gaps in coverage and I am no more ready to design my foundation than before.  There is more useful info on foundations in the framing books I purchased
