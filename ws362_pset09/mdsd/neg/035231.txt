Most of the reviews as far as I can tell are for the actual paper version of the book, but I just wanted to comment on the audio verson.  It's bad as you can tell from the title of my review.  The reader is slow and makes the story drag on and drag.  Despite that, I managed to get through 15 hours of agony because I spent so much buying this audio CD.  Again, the story moves very slow in the audio CD version
