It's difficult to surmise that Margaret Cho, who's usually funny (at least when you watch only one of her shows, and only once, because repeating the experience is often tiring), can write such a boring, unfunny book that feels like Chicken Soup for the Sexually-liberal Korean Soul. 

Granted, some situations Cho describes ably, but she often winds up beating the humor into the ground, as with the incident when the producer grabbed her breast. Most of the book is annoying because of its italicized reflections and questions about the Self that are reminiscent of a diary of a teenage girl, but definitely not one of Cho's caliber. 

And that's too bad. Cho had the potential to hash out a really great book here. It's sad she didn't take advantage of that opportunity.
