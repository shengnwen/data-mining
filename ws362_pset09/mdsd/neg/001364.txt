at its outset, "the invisibles" looked to be powerful. and, no doubt, the first 25 issues were hypnotic. the next 25 less so, but still great. then came Volume 3 ...

despite the fact that it took morrison nearly two years to publish the last twelve issues of the monthly series, they still seem rushed. i've heard that DC/Vertigo cut the final volume from 25 issues to just 12, so perhaps morrison's hand was forced. or he just found himself against a wall -- after all, at the time he was writing about a half-dozen other monthly comics.

anyway ... 

with this last volume, morrison simply tosses out various plot lines that were painstakingly built up in the previous volumes, permanently and inexplicably writing off two key characters. the comic then begins to suffer from "x-men syndrome" in which new (redundant) team members materialize out of nowhere and minor characters are brought to the forefront.

to make matters worse, the series' climax is rendered incomprehensible by a terrible, terrible lapse in grant's judgment: having six or seven different artists of dubious  qualification contribute to the final three-issue arc.

adding insult to injury, the very last issue -- in which the veil was to have been torn from our eyes; in which life, the universe, EVERYTHING were to have been explained -- is instead a ridiculous jumble of new-age psychobabble and pseudo-science that, four years after the series' conclusion, today makes me wonder what i ever saw in the series to begin with. and i think about something johnny rotten once said: "ever get the feeling you've been cheated?"

perhaps it's too much to ask that a writer as bold and as high-concept-minded as grant morrison be expected to adhere standards of coherent storytelling. but if you want innovation AND a tightly-crafted story AND a satisfying read that stands the test of time, skip this "the invisibles" and pick up neil gaiman's "the sandman" collections
