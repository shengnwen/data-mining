My wife wrote the review below, just after we bought our deck of Eker's cards.  We both liked them.  For about two hours.  Then we went to a local office supply store, where one of the stupid little cards fell out of my wife's wallet and she angrily shouted "Oh fine! That's really inspiring!"  

Eker really is a shark with no spiritual conscience (try accessing his website without your secret "code"), and the more my wife and I tried to use the cards, the more annoyed we got.  If, after reading this, you still want a deck, check out the "Buy One Used" option here at Amazon.  Our cards are up for bid
