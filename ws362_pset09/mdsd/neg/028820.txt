A great topic, credible contributors, plus an eye-popping cover all led me to believe this was a "must have". After an hour of UNDERSTANDING I realized this was a hoax.

UNDERSTANDING fails as a design reference and data resource both: some designs are more complex than the data they're communicating; layouts and print quality are often so poor they render the information unreadable; errors of all kinds riddle the pages, from typos to missing digits to transposed characters to uncited sources. 

You'd think a bunch of people (who are) invested in design would be sticklers for clarity, accuracy and quality; UNDERSTANDING proves otherwise. 

If you agree that good design facilitates understanding, look elsewhere. Edward Tufte, Nigel Holmes, Alan MacEachren and Robert Harris come to mind..
