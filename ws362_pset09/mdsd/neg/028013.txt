I purchased this book as a requirement for a new job.  I recently left the practice of law and went to work for a company that designs, sells and installs home theaters.  Having graduated from law school, one would think I could understand just about everything.  Wrong.  This book touts itself as one that is for the masses - the everyday schmo who is looking to do this themselves.  While extraordinarily well written, it is NOT for everyone.  It is overly complex and technical for the everyday guy and is more apropos for electrical engineers or experts in the field.  finally, the issue I received was supposed to be a recent edition and, if it was, it's already painfully out of date and needs revamped
