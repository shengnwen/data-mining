I came across McCarry after reading Mark Steyn's claim that he was another real ex-spook novelist and better than LeCarre.  Well, lots of things are better than recent LeCarre, but at least to judge by this book McCarry is a journeyman writer who doesn't come close to comparing to LeCarre in his prime.  

Yes, his intelligence background lends surface realism to his descriptions of a hunt from one end of the world to the other-- the part set in a remote corner of China where Kafka meets Genghis Khan is especially convincing and amusing.  But too much of this covers standard airport novel stuff-- the old (by now very old) Nazi in South America, the way-too-much-to-swallow-mystery (which covers all the ground from ancient Judea to Osama bin Laden-- by way of Heydrich's Czechoslovakia!), the band of retirees assembled to solve it all who fall somewhere between Doc Savage's Fantastic Five and one of those aging-actor-work-program movies like The Wild Geese.

The real point is that McCarry is telling a plot-- a whopper of one-- and can only tell it by sending his main character from one part of the world to the next where, conveniently, someone who we are told will tell him nothing promptly tells him everything.  LeCarre, on the other hand, uses the dilemmas of spying to explore character.  The mystery in Tinker, Tailor could hardly be smaller (one's a mole, which one is it?) yet it's vitally involving.  The mystery in Old Boys could hardly be bigger yet it's-- oh, that old thing again.  Whatever
