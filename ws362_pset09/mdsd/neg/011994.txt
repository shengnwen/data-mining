There is a reason that this recent book is out of print while many classics have been in print for hundreds of years.  There is a reason it is in audio recording form and not print form.  

The authors talk with extreme confidence but talk at random.  When they discuss things I am a minor expert on I find that they are way off base.  One amusing thing is their projections into the future that are totally wrong after less than 40 years.

I get the impression that this book was aimed at people who failed to qualify to enter college but wanted to put on airs of being intellectuals
