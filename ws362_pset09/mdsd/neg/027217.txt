This book desperately needed a thorough editing.  The writing is dull and repetitive, and the lumpy structure simply does not work, including multiple repetitions of the same scenes, long and uninteresting "character development" scenes that flop around, and inexplicable jumping back and fro between timeframes.  The book is boring -- after slogging through about half the book I started jumping entire pages ahead to reach the end, which is ridiculously flat.  The characters are uninteresting and confusing.  And the prose is banal -- even scenes that could support exciting changes in pace are poorly written.  This is undoubtedly the worst book I have read in years and I felt cheated by the glowing reviews that were simply misleading
