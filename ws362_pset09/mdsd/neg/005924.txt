I was stuck without a book at the library a few days ago, and this was what I came up with.  I've read "Confessions" and "Shopaholic Ties the Knot" before, but really, this is too much.  Why would Luke Brandon love Becky?  She is constantly immature, sneaky, and deceitful, and I don't really get what goodness overcomes this.  I probably wouldn't be so frustrated except that I always have to finish a book once I start it, so I was stuck with it until the end
