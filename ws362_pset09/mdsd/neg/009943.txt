I own and/or have read their other books and regretfully have to say that their books aren't professionally edited. Their works seem to project an "aw shucks" tone but I find them to contain too much hyperbole.

I don't bother with their new books anymore since the writing is tiresome and predictable. They may have new information to share but that fact is lost because of the book's poor editorial presentation
