This is an exremely informative book.  It gives a history of the development of different cheeses, how to make many of them at home, the uses of various cheeses and recipes.  I got a little bogged down in the history of cheese, and don't really plan to make my own, but it was great for giving me more information about the uses of various cheeses.  If you want to learn about cheese, this is your book
