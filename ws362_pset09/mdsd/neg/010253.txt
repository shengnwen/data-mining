'Moving Target, The' is the first novel in which noir-American writer Ross McDonald introduces his most famous detective, Lew Archer. Published in 1948, in a time when noir movies was at the top, the book is just a unremarkable pulp fiction story with classic ingredients as murder, treason, much money, kidnapped and poor ladies in distress.
When you read 'Moving Target, The' you feel that McDonald was very far to develop a strong and convincing work; in fact, most of the time the reader will feel the influence of some other authors hovering above Mc Donald's style. Great authors, to be sure, as Raymond Chandler, for instance.
The story is just normal, and sometimes even full of flaws. But Archer is a good characther. In a way, his sympathy and easy way saves this book to be a complete misfire.
