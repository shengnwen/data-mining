go for Frank Stitt's Southern Table which is what a real Southern cooking book should be. This book is very pretty, but not well written. It's simply kitschy, and the recipes are not good at all. I made several things from this book, and they did not work. I would not advise buying this book. I'm sorry, but Tanya Holland is not a 'real' chef, maybe one of those many people who write cookbooks and put in pretty pictures to sell it. Just my personal opinion
