This book's story AND title is a ripoff of the TERRIBLE and RIDICULOUS script the character of Donald Kaufman writes in that movie.  It is unbelievable that this guy seriously wrote the same story and that so many people are taking him and it so seriously.  It's like Metallica releasing their black album.  Hadn't they seen "This is Spinal Tap"
