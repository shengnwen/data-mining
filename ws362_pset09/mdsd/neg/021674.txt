I tried to read it. No luck. I almost finished it. But every time I picked it up I felt like I was punishing myself. Why force my way through a book that is so . .. . boring? I think I was hoping the end would twist the whole thing around. Maybe it does. But the more I read, the less faith I had in the book to be interesting. 

What is wrong with it? All it offers is the charm of the main character. If the main character had charm, that would keep me reading. But he didn't.

It reads sort of like a tract for some sort of progressive, new-ageish, neo-pagan, pluralistic spirituality. The main character discovers some sort of ancient ultimate truth that only he and a few other people are gifted enough to realize. It is reminiscent of the spirituality of some of the Modernists, particularly Yeats.

All I can say is the book was too boring to finish.
