This book was not of any help to me. It mentions all the aspects of business you need to be familiar with before starting one of your own, but it does not give any help on any of these aspects. 
For example in financing your startup, it mentions geting a loan and using your credit cards. Honestly if thats the way to finance a business then you can add going on a diet and saving your lunch money. It goes on giving you mostly unintelligent information and advice like "buy a computer", "save rent, work from home". Put your money on another book and save yourself the trouble of reading it
