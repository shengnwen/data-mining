Martin Amis' long (perhaps long-winded) novel about a femme fatale-psychic who is predisposed to being murdered as she entraps Keith Talent, a brutish dart player, and Guy Clinch, a struggling writer into her web of seduction and deceit. Amis pads this thin story with typically entertaining and satisfying scenarios that he seems to have a knack for, but the novel just isn't nearly as interesting as his Information or Money. At some point during the project, Amis lost touch with the original force of his conception, and you can tell that the rest of the material is simply a weak attempt to complete the aborted project. Not a bad read, but probably too much of a commitment for the quality, even among fans of Amis' usually interesting prose.
