The contenet of this book was fine -- exactly what a Jackie Collins fan would expect.  However, the ending is so disappointing, it made me angry!  It seems more like cliffhanger than an ending.  To tell you the truth, I'm still half expecting a sequel!  Just when you're getting to the book's climax, IT ENDS!  It is absolutely unnerving!  This may be due to the facts that it was Ms. Collins' first book and was written back in 1968, I don't know.  But I do know that of all the books she's written, this has got to be the worst
