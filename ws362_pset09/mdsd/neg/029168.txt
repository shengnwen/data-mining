When a co-worker first told me about the book I was very intrigued and wanted to read it for myself.  She loaned it to me and in the beginning it was kind of scary to think there are so many black men, whom most of society looks at as the epitome of masculinity, are actually sleeping with other men.  This book had some info I definitely did not know about but as far as the actual writing it was very boring and repetetive.  If you are looking for some interesting statistics about black men on the down low or HIV/AIDS and black women go on google.  This book is not worth buying.
