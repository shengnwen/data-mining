This is maybe a 4 Star book - IF, and ONLY if, this is the first book on Jack Welch and GE you have picked up.  If you have already read "Jack" skip it.  There is nothing here that hasn't already been said elsewhere. I was disappointed how little "new" information was presented in this book.

If you are looking for something on the topic of controlling your own destiny this title is somewhat misleading.
