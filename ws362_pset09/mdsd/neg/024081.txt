As a Vodou Houngan I read this book with expectations of it being the usual banter with only a marginal amount of information.  What I found was something else entirely.  A book that has false information in it and manages to have an author against Vodou.  Calling it &quot;hysterical nonsense&quot; I believe was the term used.  The author stated this near the end of the book.  Please!...  Unless you know A LOT about Vodou don't read this book.  The Tao of Physics or Divine Horsemen are MUCH better alternatives
