If you've read her Amanda Quick novels, this contemporary story is almost the exact replica of the novel, "Scandal".

Heroine proposes to hero, who has a hidden agenda. Of course he's rich and he has almost the same history as "Scandal", whose father has gotten into debt and gets out of the picture leaving the family to deal w/ the debt, and the oldest child having to pay back debts that his father's friends/business associates want paid right away.  Of course hero grows up and wants vengence for this when he grows up. But his plans get waylaid when heroine interferes and convinces hero that vengence is not the right path.

The book is so similar that a couple of times I caught myself looking at the cover to make sure I had the right book. The only difference in this book is that one is set in contemporary times and the other in historical time
