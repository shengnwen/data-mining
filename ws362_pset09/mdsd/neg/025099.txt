I cannot give this volume a very positive review.

This is a very good book to read on the development of the company and on the internal workings of Goldman Sachs- which is one of the world's great investment banks.

The difficulty arises from  the author's strong bias toward the positive, which is reflected in the subtitle of the work. This bias penetrates the work in all aspects of the operation- culture, people, history, etc. 

Yes, it is a strong company, but it has made its share of mistakes, most notably in the book in aligning itself with the "false tycoon" Robert Maxwell and his dealings. The various mistakes made along the way are polished over by the author or ignored entirely.

Again, I would raise my review from two stars to four with the caveat that the reader view the book as part history lesson and part unabashed advertisement while consuming its wisdom.
