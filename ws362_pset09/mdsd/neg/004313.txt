Unfortunately, I picked this book up by accident in the library.  I can accept that Smith is a product of her time, but the content of this book is based on romantic myths about black culture.  Of course Nonnie is happy she  is having this white man's child, in the white male hierearchal system that  we live in it is romanticized that all black women, and black people in  general, want to claim what is white.  This story is about Nonnie and how  horribly mixed up she is. Why on earth would she return to Maxwell to chase  after someone else's child when she has a college degree?  She does have  other options. I am sorry, but this book is sub-par at best
