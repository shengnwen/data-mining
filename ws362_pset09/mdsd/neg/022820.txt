I just had my first extended browse through here. It's laid out well, and the photography is very good.

It's an excellent book for not only instruction, but inspiration as well. And...the back page on yarn overs is worth the entire purchase price for anyone with Yarn Over Phobia (me).

This is the first Vogue knitting book I have bought, but it will not be the last
