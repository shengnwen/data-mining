The Influetials is either just a big statistical blob or I missed something.  Keller et al start out by describing the influential as someone who other people in the community kind of look toward.  They are very socially connected and respected.  There is no doubt in my mind that the proposition that one in ten people has a huge influence on how the other nine think, however instead of exploring the social patterns Keller et al try to define that person whom they call an "Influential"  They begin by saying in the first chapter that statistics can't pinpoint an influential and then spend most of the book tossing statistics on influentials at the reader - lots of tables that don't tell me anything.

One thing that I found interesting were the case studies scattered through the book.  Basically these were mini-biographies of influentials slanted more towards what they were up to at the moment.  Even these weren't all that helpful.

I recommend skipping The Influentials.  The title is really good but the book doesn't focus or do much to back it up.  Actually things just get muddled.  The Tipping Point by Malcome Gladwell has a good bit of discussion about who influences opinions and how.  Check that out instead
