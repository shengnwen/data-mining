If you're not either very experienced in outsourcing already or a college level instructor in outsourcing, I would not recommend this book.

Since it was written, a couple more creative and straight shooting books on "how to outsource" are available, particularly in 2005.  I advise you to search and find those books independently as I found them much more enlightening, current and relevant to providing directions on outsourcing's nuts and bolts to true strategic and transformational outsourcing elsewhere. Outsourcing has evolved along way since this book was written. It needs updating or should simply be viewed as a reference book after you've read the recent selections by other authors to be on top of your game
