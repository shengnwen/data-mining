I'm relatively new to eclipse and I really like the idea of slim books - I like distilled cut-to-the chase books.  Dr. Carlson's book is concise, clear, succinct and packed with useful information for the Java developer.  But, there is one gigantic omission... The source code he uses and references in the example that runs through out the book is missing.  I've looked to no avail. I hope that the author corrects this with a posting of the source on the web
