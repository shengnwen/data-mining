A few years ago, I read Carole Matthews' first big U.S. hit 'For Better or For Worse'. While not electrified by the humor or characters, I did enjoy it. I can't say the same for this attempt.

For one, the plot is ridiculously boring. It moves about as quickly as a snail on sleeping pills. After the initial revelation concerning her boyfriend's disgusting betrayal (he put nude pictures of her on the internet to help his failing web site), Matthews apparently decided to take a breather from the action and focus on... well, I'm not entirely sure. She introduced a lot of really unlikable characters and one nice but boring one. Oh, and she wrote a lot of scenes involving our heroine crying in her bathrobe. 

Now, I love chick lit as much as the next girl; I wasn't expecting Shakespeare. But if you want a funny, sweet, entertaining beach read, then go somewhere else. My suggestions? For humor, try Elizabeth Young. For sweet stuff, try Cecilia Ahern. 

Bottom line: Don't bother
