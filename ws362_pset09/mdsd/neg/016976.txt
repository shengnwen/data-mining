Although I myself confess I am no great fan of Heinlein's, I found it hard to believe this was written by the author of "Stranger in a Strange Land" which is a masterly work. The idea behind "The Number of the  Beast" is appealing: a vast number of alternative universes, endless possibilities for exploring mysteries and opportunities for a real sense of wonder. Unfortunately this is all wasted as heinlein trawls seemingly without purpose through an interminable series of unfunny jokes and mundane inanities. For example he invents a universe just like ours except with no letter J. He indulges his predeliction for creating middle aged women referred to as "Auntie" and adopts a writing  style which actually manages to parody his own already flawed and overly jaunty mannerisms. The satire is lost in a tale that is quite simply, utterly lifeless. In short , "The Number of the Beast" is a disaster and caused me to avoid Heinlein for years until I read "Stranger in a Strange Land." Even though I don't really like his works as a whole, even I was able to recognise the extent to which he has fallen below his own standard with this trash
