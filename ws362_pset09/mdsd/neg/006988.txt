i find it difficult to purchase your cookbooks, mostly because i do not know what they contain. a bigger picture(hero)does not give me any indication of what is offers. the reviews are great but i would like to know what's between the covers, if it new and inspiring or is it the same recipes that have been revised or just reprinted
