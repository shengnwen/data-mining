If there were a list of the worst books ever written, this one would be on top of the list. 

What bothered me the most was the fact that the author portrayed the mother as loving her children with all her heart, but when this "mother," and I use the term loosely, saw her husband drowning, she jumped in the water to drown along with him because the thought of living without him was too much to bear. With all those children???? She could have been saved along with her children, but she cared so little about them, she committed suicide and left them in the care of Edwina, her eldest daughter. Tell me what mother would do this to her children?  To add insult to injury, those children were so annoying, I didn't care what happened to them. I wanted to throw myself in the ocean after reading this poor excuse for a book. 

I wrote a letter to Ms Steel to let her know how much I despised this book, but she never replied, not that I thought she would. Save your money and buy anything but this book.
