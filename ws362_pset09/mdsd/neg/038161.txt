I am very disappointed to have had to pay $23 plus shipping for this minimal information book. Its scant 159 pages includes 18 blank pages for journaling, 4 pages of advertisements, 27 pages with small amounts of text ranging from one sentence to less than half a page, huge typeface (few words per page folks!), 2 pages of code of ethics, 2 pages of miminum teaching requirements, and many pages of about 1/2 page of text artfully centered on the page. So this leaves us with what - 98 pages of information, half of which is fluffy stories about the author? Please, wait for a better book - don't bother with this one unless you can get it for a few bucks
