although there is an intense void in the subject of trans and gender queer writings this book does little to fill it.  there are occational glimering voices of truth and clarity most notably the essay by the transman with MS, but overall there was too much youthful exuberance and not enough thoughful, mature writing.  i would much rather read a personal account of someone's reality than someone perched on a soapbox telling about how they live outside the gender binary.  although i believe gender is something worth deconstructing, to not acknowledge that it exists in this world, or to say you live outside of it without giving examples of how you make this possible shows to me a lack of maturity on the part of the writer.  

I know mr. diamond to be a very prolific artist, but in this case i simply felt the quality was lacking.
