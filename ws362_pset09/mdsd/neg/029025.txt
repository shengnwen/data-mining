My first disappointment with this book was that out of 348 pages, the last 112 pages are credits, acknowledgements, and pages upon pages of vendor lists ranging from calligraphy to ethnic artifacts.  I could not believe when I got to page 236, the credits began!  My disappointment was complete when I turned to the Winter section.  I am having a winter wedding and thought this book might provide some ideas on winter wedding receptions.  Not so... The chapter focuses on a single home wedding.  I had hoped the book would cover pictures and ideas of multiple wedding receptions.  I was so disappointed that I wrote this review.  It's the first and only review of a book I've ever written.  Don't waste your money on this one.
