The book does contain a lot of pens that are unusual; however, I wanted more information about turning small coves or other decorations.  I also wanted some unusual design ideas - not just using different wood or putting in blocks of different wood, but designing the pen itself.  Making it easier to hold or write with or changing the balance or length etc for the purpose of improving the product, not just the look.

Anyway, the book does have a lot of pens displayed and gives the pen turner a lot of ideas about changing the look by changing the wood and how the wood is cut and glued together.  The key is using different materials for the pen itself.
