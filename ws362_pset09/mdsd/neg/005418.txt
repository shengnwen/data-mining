Ok there are a few things I noticed wrong with this book. First, the quantities seem to be off, probably b/c the author is british, and the UK cups are different than the cups here. Second, the book is poorly organized - one would have to flip through most of it to find a recipe, since there are only four divisions - which I believe are appetizers, salads and light meals, main entrees, and deserts. And third, the recipes are just not practical to make - I like to try new things, but this book takes the exotic really too far. Plus she uses a lot of specialty ingredients that one would have to go hunting for. I found the whole book disappointing
