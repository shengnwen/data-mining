I love books about evil, deranged killers. Usually, I would say the more deranged, the better the story, but this book crosses the line. It is just too harsh, too wretchedly cruel for me. For a metally-ill villian to work well, he/she must have some human characteristics, even if miniscule. Michael O'Connell has none. He is incomprehensibly mean. His motivation seems to be that of a robot, programed to kill. And his ability to insinuate himself into his victims lives and mentally torture them is beyond believable. This story went beyond my comfort level, until I finally gave it up half way through. I like scary books; I don't like books that cross the line into gratuitous torture
