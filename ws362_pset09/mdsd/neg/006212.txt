This book is like one of those diet books that spends a lot of space telling you how great the diet plan is. In fact, the first 46 pages of the book tell you almost nothing, except how the author will let you know how to market your company in upcoming chapters. Again, like a diet book, he has come up with a cute term to sell books: "Extreme Marketing." And like those diet books, which can be summed up with, "eat fewer calories than you burn, and exercise for your health," his ideas are simplistic. Here is the summary:

- Make sure your marketing activities are accountable for sales. Any marketing activity should have a direct correlation to increased sales and a measurable return on investment (ROI).
- Use multiple marketing activities at the same time for the best results.
- Make sure you have the trained salespeople to follow up on marketing activities and close the sale.

That's it. While good advice, it doesn't justify a whole book. But, neither does, "eat less, exercise more.
