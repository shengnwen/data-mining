I haven't read a Picoult book in a while because her formula was bothering me but I saw this in the airport and decided it would be a easy yet entertaining read for the tedious 3 hour journey.

It was entertaining to the extent that I finished it. Unfortunately - it was still formulaic and completely predictable.

Elements that I liked: 
 - Rape is very rarely easy to sort out and date rape cases involving drugs, ex-boyfriends and alcohol are especially difficult. The confusion and obfuscation that Picoult writes (whether that was her intention or just poor writing) surrounding the issue can be representative of an actual rape. 

 - Teenagers are notoriously melodramatic and self pitying and Trixie, though a little over the top, seemed like a typical teenager... the reaction of other students at her school to the rape and Trixie also seem plausible.

 - I liked the graphic novel. The melodramatic aspects are typical of the genre and it was a great way to try and illustrate Daniel. The hidden word bit - hokey.

 - I liked learning about the native cultures in Alaska. I would like to read a whole book that takes place there and explores the themes though maybe not by Picoult.

 - I liked the idiot's guide to Dante that was incorporated into the book.

Things I didn't like: 
 - Picoult tries to incorporate too much into this book and thus wasn't able to fully develop it all. Though I liked the native Alaskan bit, it was too jumbled and it didn't really add to the plot. Like another reviewer I wasn't left with the impression that Daniel's haunted past resurfaced. I was expecting a lot more. Murder? That's too much to add to this already overburdened plot. 

We lose threads here and there like Daniel's career and the wife's affair - he just disappears after his admission. Cutting is a very real phenomena for many young women and Jodi doesn't explain or develop it.

I don't know that it was at all believable. Could the myopic Trixie have had the wherewithal to make it to Alaska when she could barely see beyond her own break-up and tried to commit suicide multiple times?

The cop, the DNA analyst, the lawyers, the parents, the twist - I've seen them all before in Jodi's other books... it's part of her formula.

I wonder what would happen if Jodi spent maybe three or four years researching a novel and devoting time to its plot. She could excel in character development and careful analysis of difficult topics. I feel like this novel writing machine is doing herself, her readers and literature a disservice
