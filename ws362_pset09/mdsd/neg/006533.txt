If you're an amateur historian that prefers a logical sequential order to your reading, then don't buy this one.  It's more like a scrapbook, or collage than a step-by-step history.  I suppose if you've already done a little reading on this subject, and you simply want a reference book to put on your shelf, then this may be the buy.  Otherwise, there's got to be some much better choices
