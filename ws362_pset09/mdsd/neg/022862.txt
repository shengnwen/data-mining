Having studied Japanese literature for nearly ten years now, I have probably read this book three times and once in Japanese (bitz-n-places).  I am not a fan of the book however.  It is Abe's best known work although I think that's a shame.  With Teshigahara's film adaptations of Abe's works (to wit:  this book, "Face of Another" and "Ruined Map"), I have heard many say that the film version of "Woman in the Dunes" is much more interesting than the book.  In many ways, it is.  The book though does have some interesting features.

One thing, I think, one gets out of the book is that thought process of the man:  his mind is a real mess of mediaspeak, psychobabble, intellectual-posing, spoonfed-existentialism.  He is an anti-hero (perhaps the so-called "failed hero" of Meiji Japanese fiction) and it is hard to root for him.  Although it is easy to associate Abe's work with existentialism, I think the author is more interested in criticizing any kind of dogma -- even if existentialism was hip when he wrote the book in 1962.  At times, the novel gets bogged down with its deconstruction of thought-processes as seen in the unbelievably long part two.  At times, one is better off seeing the film, getting a 2-hour or less shot of its existentialist take, and moving on.

Parts one and three are really the more interesting sections of the novel.  How he gets lured in and how he figures he can escape -- to me, these show more imagination and creativity of the author than its brooding middle section.  Having read "Ark Sakura", "Face of Another" and Abe's short stories, I would say see the movies for his longer works (Teshigahara and Abe together are great) but try to get a hold of his short stories:  Abe is much better in shorter doses
