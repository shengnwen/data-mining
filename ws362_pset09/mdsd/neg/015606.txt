the whole structure of the book is ot comprehensible. it gives out 3 financial statements at the first 3 chapters, without letting the readers to have time digest the concepts. after you are confused enough, the book will then introduce concepts of each items listed in the statements, and have you look back at the first three chapters. 

the layout is not good either. for some chapters, you need to turn the pages back and forth, again and again, because the text content and the illustration table are back to back. 

the book is just very confusing
