If you are looking for a very easy and quick to read book this is the one for you.  What to Expect When You're Expecting is written by a mother (Arlene Eisenberg) and her two daughters Heidi and Sandee.  These ladies have written several books in the series, they call "What to Expect When..." 

There are a few positive aspects of this book; the author's give information on the month to month physical changes that occur during pregnancy, including physical discomforts and how the fetus changes throughout the nine months.  There is some basic information on medical conditions that may arise during pregnancy and basic breastfeeding information for the immediate postpartum period.  

This is a good book to read for an overview of pregnancy, labor, birth and the early postpartum period.  I would recommend that you also read other more in-depth books such as: The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth written by Henci Goer, The Pregnancy Book, by Dr William Sears and his wife Martha Sears, RN, and Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, RN, Midwife.
