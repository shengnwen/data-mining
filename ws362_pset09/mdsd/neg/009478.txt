Perhaps I'd put too much stock in all the praise I'd seen heaped on Charles McCarry and this book. What a great espionage writer he is, the party line went. Our Le Carré, etc., etc. But this book, which I purchased at full price in hardcover, was so dull and disappointing that I gave up in anger and disinterest not even half way through. McCarry probably has been as good as his admirers say, but in this book, he seems to have switched on the auto-pilot, taken the money, and run. I quickly grew tired of all his fancy brand names - dropped, it appears, as a way to suggest authenticity and insider knowledge - and all the exotic locales he pushes his characters to, as if scouting locations for a movie. I have not given up; I will now try his earlier books, starting with 'Tears of Autumn,' and keep my fingers crossed. I remain hopeful
