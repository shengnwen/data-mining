On the whole I wasn't satisfied with the book.  In all fairness I did take DE as a summer class.  Maybe that's why I don't have fond memories of this book.  I'm not an engineering major.  I'm not physics major.  I found the books almost constant reliance on engineering and physics to introduce concepts to be very disappointing.  I think the book lacks balance.  Also I found some of the examples lacking.  I found better explanations of identical topics in my calculus book (Larson) and in my linear algebra book (Kolman).  An engineer that I know tried to use the book to review some stuff and found it fairly useless.  Dover makes some good cheap DE book
