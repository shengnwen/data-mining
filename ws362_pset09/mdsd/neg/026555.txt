I heard about this book and unfortunately bought it before I could read the reviews here. I didn't know a book could be boring and over-the-top at the same time. Her descriptions of the punishments are so ludicrous and repetitive, that I found myself skipping them over. Beauty seems to have no personality or thought processes and the end is utterly confusing. All that said, I want to find out what happens in the next book! I just don't want to spend money on it! Hopefully I can find it in the library, although I doubt it
