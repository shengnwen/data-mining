This book reads like a dull sociology treatise.  It is hard to argue with most of the points, but much of what is stated is obvious.  Dawson is heavy on theory, but light on example and ways to apply the theory.  A book this hard to read (i.e., dull) should at least deliver a great deal of  wisdom.  It doesn't.  Contrasted with a lively and example-filled book like Thomas Stewart's &quot;Intellectual Capital&quot;, Dawson's work doesn't make the grade
