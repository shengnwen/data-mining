I hate how this book protrays the father, as an unattached lion who watches tv rather than helping his son bloom. I bought this book for my autistic son for Christmas, read it and put it in the trash. It makes Dads look uninvolved and is not a good portrayal at all. My husband is an excellent father and certianly would not choose to watch tv over helping my son learn.

Very dissapointed in this book and honestly surprised by all these positive comments
