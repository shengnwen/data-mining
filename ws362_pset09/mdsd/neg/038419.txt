If you are in search of an autobiography of a dedicated and intrinsically emotional scientist, then this is the book for you.  However, if truly interested in the actual neuroscience this book claims to teach, search for a more nonfictional and scientific work.  Pithy factual information of such molecules of emotion is obstructed with unnecessary personal dramatics and stories loosely tied to the intended subject matter.  While the book provides insight to the life of a cutting-edge scientist, the autobiographical nature obscures the supposed purport of the book: to teach the neuroscience of emotions.
