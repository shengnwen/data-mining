if i could, i'd give it no stars!!! lame book. lots of errors. even though it is a guide to the friday films, it glosses over several of the latter movies. why? too much trouble???? and I have to agree with previous comments laugh at alot of the reviews here, most of them likely written by the same person! that's just sad, and kinda lame.
