Like another one of the reviewers, I have a four-year degree in English, and couldn't make it through this book (I managed to plod trough a lot of difficult "classics" in my life, but could not finish this book). Zen, as I understand it, revolves around simplifying one's life and shedding the burdens of the world. I didn't see that here. I think this author could cut this book down to 200 - 300 pages and make it a much better read. If an author can't make his point more concisely, he needs to employ a good editor or writing teacher to help him focus on the important points that need to go into the book and then to cut out the ideas that don't belong
