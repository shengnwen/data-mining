I've been cutting myself since I was 14, now I'm 24. I'm currently writing my own book about self-injury and personally I felt this book was boring. I pushed myself to continue to read it and by the end of the book it ended up being just another book on my shelf.

I wouldn't recommend this book to people, self-injurers or non-self-injurers.

I believe the stories that were told within the book had a lot of the same storyline. I would've liked to have read different types of stories. The majority of the stories were about those who were abused. Not every self-injurer was abused. Some just had troubling pasts like myself that weren't able to cope with life.
