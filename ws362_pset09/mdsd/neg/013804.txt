Willow was a good movie, but hopefully they don't turn the Shadow series books into a movie.  Too much description, not much action.  I kept reading, though, hoping the next book in the series would be better, only to be disappointed.  I skipped pages at a time just to get to some sort of dialog or action.  The brownies supposedly had a great wit, but there was no evidence of it in the books.  Too bad, they could've been a great plus, like Tas the kender in the Chronicles series.  As far as the Elora, the wittiest she ever got was by sticking her tongue out in response to any lame jokes the brownies made. In conclusion, don't waste your time with these books
