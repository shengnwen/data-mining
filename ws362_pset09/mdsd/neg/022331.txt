This book, like several others in this genre, provides the reader with different nuances on how to brief cases, take lecture notes, study for exams and other components that every other book in this field suggests.

This book is a rather long and difficult read.  It contains a few decent suggestions on study aids, but one can receive this information from practically any other pre-law book or website.

My suggestion is to stick to other pre-law books and not waste your money on this one.
