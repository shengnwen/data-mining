Barbara's books usually keep me captivated.  This one did not.  I waded about one-third of the way though this book and finally gave up.  I did want to know who Haskell's father was, so I skipped to the end. The ending was good, but the rest I found boring.  Maybe if you're into Egyptology it's a better read
