As an agnostic female who has achieved success at high tech companies in various positions and who has a well rounded life including volunteerism, I thought this book might help me define what I want to do for the second half of my life.

Instead I found it filled with example of example of people whose lives turned to serving God/faith based causes (granted I skimmed after a while but didn't see any examples of Indians or successful people of other relgions, only Christians). 

There were about 5 women out of 61 people total profiled.

On the contrary Po Bronson's book focused on people from all walks of life, not those who have been VP or higher or had "interesting" lives. 

I found this book completely useless in that it seemed to have sneakily omitted it's true agenda of pushing faith by having NO MENTION ANYWHERE ON THE BOOK JACKET OF RELIGION
