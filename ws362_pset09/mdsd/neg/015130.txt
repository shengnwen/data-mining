I bought this book for my two year old daughter because she was learning her colors and shapes.  I had bought other books from this author before and have been pleased.  The concept of this book is excellent.  As you flip each page the cut out shapes form a different (sometimes hard to recognize)animal. My daughter loved to call out the shapes and colors of each page. What I want to know is why they made this book out of such flimsy paper.  This book lasted one week before it started losing pages.  First the shapes started ripping at the edges and then we lost whole pages.  This book is geared for small children but they made it so that it will stand up to only the most delicate adult.  My daughter is not very aggressive, this is just a poorly made book.  Usually I don't mind if a book becomes tattered through a lot of love but for a book to last one week is just ridiculous.  The publishers should be ashamed of themselves!  Save your money and aggravation and buy shape books made of sturdy paper or coardboard
