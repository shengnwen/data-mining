I am a bit bothered by all those 5-star reviews and feel obligated to tell any potential readers of this book the other side of the story. (Please also check out another review of this book by guttes on January 21, 2001.)

First of all, this book lacks a focus. It jumps back and forth with things related or even unrelated to the number e (it spends more than a chapter on the discovery of calculus, and on and off on the topic of pi).  While it is more than verbose on something not (totally) relevant, it simply does not have some topics that you wanna know more about -- for instance, who/why there is such a notation 'e' for the number, or what are the latest hot topics about the number.  It has no consistency in presenting its mathematical formulation either, in the first half of the book it assumes readers with minimal calculus background, but then in the second half of the book it assumes readers with background on complex and multi-variable analysis.  In the very last chapter, it touches on the topic of transcendence, but again, fails to deliver anything substantial and signifies an hollow story for such an interesting and promising topic.

In a nutshell, the problems of the whole book are the choice of materials presented and the organization of the materials for the topic.  It may be one of the very few books out there with a title related to the number 'e', but it surely is not a book telling you a story of this number.

For those who also finds this book disappointing, there are indeed way better "popular" math books out there.  I would recommend books written by William Dunham, such as "Journey Through Genius" (for some easy reading) or "The Calculus Gallery" (for those with more calculus backgroud)
