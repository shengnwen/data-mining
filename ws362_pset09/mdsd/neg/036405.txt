I've bought and read all of Dan's No B.S. books and was very dissapointed with this one. While he does promote his books and services in the other books, it's not in a blatant hard sell fashion as in this book. So much so, the whole book seems to be a tease and a marketing attempt for his inner cicle's services. 

Nonetheless, I'd give Dan the benefit of the doubt, he is after all a marketing guru. In fact, I got a lot of good ideas from his free newsletter. It seems to me, however, that ever since he partnered with Bill Glazer, everything that's published under his name is a non-stop commercial for the Kennedy inner cirlce.
