Read all of Chuck's other books and this is the worst of the bunch.  SD&CP was funny.  This is just a bad collection of articles that he has written.  If you want to read about femal cover bands, or the scene in Fargo ND when he was 23, go right ahead.  It feels like you are reading the Village Voice cover to cover...one crappy article at a time.  Torture
