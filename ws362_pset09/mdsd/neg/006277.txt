I am disappointed in this cookbook.  I have a hardbound copy that has fallen apart and only wanted to replace it.  The format is strange, a number of my favorite recipes are not in this 'newer' edition.  I also thought the spiral bound book would wear better then the hardbound, but it is difficult to turn pages and without the tabs finding what you're looking for is difficult.  Wish I had gotten the anniversary edition
