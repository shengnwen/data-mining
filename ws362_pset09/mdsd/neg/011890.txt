This new monograph has been released to coincide with the Whitney's retrospective.  Both the long over due retrospective and the new monograph are lacking in quantity and depth needed in doing justice to  this  amazingly prolific and important artist.  Abrams' previous Neel  monograph  had many more images and excerpts of  important interviews with Neel   throughout the book (provided by the forsight of Patricia  Hills.)  The new  book, under the Whitney museums' auspice, includes interviews with some of  the sitters.  While these anecdotes are interesting it doesn't make up for  the total superiority of the 1983 monograph (reprinted in 1995.)  If you  can find a used version of the previous monograph, you would be wise to  aquire it.  I also recommend Pamela Allara's &quot;Pictures of People,  Alice Neel's American Portrait Gallery&quot;  which puts Neel's work in a  cultural context (from the depression through the feminist movement.
