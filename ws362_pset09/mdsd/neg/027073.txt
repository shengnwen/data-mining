Like many things from the Certified Fraud Examiners, this book comes with a hefty price tag.  

The book is alright but it is definitly not worth 100 dollars.  

If you have read a few other good books about fraud (books by Chuck Whitlock, Frank Abagnale, Carl Sifakis) then you will find that less than 1/4 of the information in this book is new.  Since it is written by an accountant, it is not as enjoyable or readable as most books out there.  

Furthermore, anyone who as ever changed font sizes, page margins, fonts, and line spacing to make a boring term paper meet the minimum requirements will notice that this 'encyclopedia' is double spaced and the inner margins are massive.  In fact, the inner page margins are more than twice the size of the margins in 'Frauds, Deceptions and Swindles' by Cark Sifakis.  

If this book had normal margins and single spacing its 840+ pages would probably shrink to approximately 350 pages.  

If you are willing to spend 100 dollars on books about fraud, you'd be better off buying a smorgasborg of used books by Whitlock, Abagnale, Sifakis, and whatever else the Amazon AI recommends.
