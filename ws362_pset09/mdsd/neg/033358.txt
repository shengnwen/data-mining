'Sceptic' (See March 2nd review below) is right - the author has conjured up a slew of similar 5 star reviews from family, friends and SAC office co-workers. His ego knows no bounds.

If you have his first two books you would be wasting your money to get this one. And it would be nice to expect better of an author on subjects of peak performance than to pad reviews. Sorry, Ari.
