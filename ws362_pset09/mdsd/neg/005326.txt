There were many contradictions to the Gospel . The book describes the mother of Jesus as an elderly lady at the crucifixion . Mary was probably in her 40's . Mary Magdalene is described as stating that it is Monday morning and the Lord has been in the grave 3 days . ( Easter Monday ? ) On finding Jesus in the garden , Mary is described as embracing him tightly where the Gospels state Jesus forbid her to touch him . The Bible tells the stone was rolled away from the tomb . The author has Jesus walking through the stone . The author has Jesus and the 2 others crucified with him being hung on 3 different sides of the same tree rather than being nailed to 3 seperate crosses . This book was meaningless to me
