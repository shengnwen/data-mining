There are limited texts on East Asian history and it is unfortunate that this author decided to spike his with unabashed personal commentary.  Overall, the content is impressive but some of Murphey's claims are hard to stomach.    

An example of such outlandish claims is the theme in later chapters that American Cold War policy drove Asian Communists to a harder line by resisting them with military campaigns and non-democratic governments.  Murphey insinuates that Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Min, and other Communist leaders had more moderate programs planned for when they came to power but were forced into reeducation programs and political purges because of American policy.  

Besides this outright opinion paraded as fact, Murphey also annoyingly snickers and gripes with hyphenated and parenthetical commentary.  There are also facts suspiciously left out.  For example, Murphey spends a great deal of effort detailing conservative corruption in earlier Korean politics but mentions nothing of the massive scandals accompanying the end of Kim Dae-Jun's term.  Lastly, many of Murphey's dubious claims can not be investigated by the readers.  Facts are not referenced and a bibliography of only 40 sources is available at the end -- suspiciously thin for a work of this magnitude and considering the many "facts" quoted.  Murphey's bias and this lack of sourcing make this book marginally useful for graduate level research, unless one is willing to accept the good professor at his word.
