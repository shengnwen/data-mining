I was recently diagnosed with systemic sclerosis so my wife bought this book to learn more about the disease and treatment options.  We were particularly interested as Dr. Daniel Furst, a well known scleroderma expert, was listed as one of the authors.

The book was a big disappointment - it looks like Dr. Furst only wrote the forward - and there was not much material of any use to me as a newly diagnosed patient.  It reads more like a breezy self-help book than an essential guide for the newly diagnosed.  You will get more information from the excellent scleroderma websites out there - I wish I had saved the money for next month's methotrexate.
