Though the recipies in this book sound delicious this book is far from written for dummies as it claims. Being a beginning cook I find it hard to follow what would seem to be the basic instruction for each recipe. I get lost figuring out just how to cut an onion "coursely" as I've never done it before. There is even a figure missing from chapter 5 that is supposed to show a key ingredient for Braise Endive (what the heck is endive?) This book is obviously written for someone who has basic knowledge of cooking and its very frustrating to read. The instructions are too vague for beginners and the descriptions of techniques leave me wondering what the author is talking about. Not to mention each recipe expects that you have an entire kitchen full of gadgets at your disposal to prepare these fancy dishes. I think I'm going to have to find a different book to teach me to cook before I can dive into "Cooking for Dummies" and understand whats going on. Look for a different book!
