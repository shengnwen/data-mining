The title of this book says it all.  "The Panic-Free Pregnancy..." probably does relieve panic for expecting mothers, but it does so at the cost of potential harm to the fetus. Numerous statements in this book are completely misleading and inaccurate. It may be comforting for those who want to hear it's alright to drink alcohol or other well established risky behaviors, but it would be better for them to simply use a little common sense.  Obviously, there are two extremes (too much or too little caution) and the truth is somewhere in the middle, not where this book pretends it is.  Don't waste your time reading or money purchasing this book.
