This book is atrocious.  It is THE worst book I have read in the last decade.  A 10 year old could have done better. The plot gets more ridiculous as the book progresses, the characters act unbelievably and it is amazing that someone can actually get paid to write such garbage.  The only plus was that I got it out of the library and didn't pay for it
