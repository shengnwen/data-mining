I having been waiting since 2005 for the release of this book and I am very disappointed because so very little was added to this revision and certainly not enough to justify the cost of the book if you purchased the previous edition, Flash MX 2004 Game Development, which I own. The first edition was outstanding. Because I followed the GlenRhodes.com blog and viewed the really cool stuff he is doing like the LightSaber Configurator and the WolfenFlash Game featuring the "Flash Ray Engine", I expected to get more insight into how he is pushing Flash 8 to create such outstanding work! The book would have been much more valuable to me if 4+ games added to the revision and more insight into his current Flash 8 work
