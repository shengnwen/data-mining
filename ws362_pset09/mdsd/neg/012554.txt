This is a typical J-Walk book with lots of padding eg. the complete history of Excel starting from version 1 plus lists, lists of lists etc. etc. Why would anyone want to spend 100's of hours learning all the complexities of VBA so as to be able to display a simple Message Box or reformat a range? Where is the incentive? Provide real, practical and useful examples as an inducement for people to make this sort of investment or you are merely writing to satisfy your own ego
