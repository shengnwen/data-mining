Every one think that lincoln help end slavery! Yea he did but the only reason why he did it because he believed that if slavery would ever end with out his help we would take over the good jobs ane there houses. Lincoln never liked african american people and i can prove it, lincoln's remarks say's he could have never been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political aquality of the whites and blacks races,that he'll never be in favor of making blacks vorters or jurors or qualifying them to hold office. He thought that there was a physical difference between the whites in blacks. He also believed that blacks was inferior to whites and that whites should have the position of superior. I wouldn't tell a lie about this think about this do your research
