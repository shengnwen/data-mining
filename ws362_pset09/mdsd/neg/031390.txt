I used to be a huge X-Men/Chris Clairmont/Jim Lee fan and bought this because it came out right after I had stopped collecting.  I was very disapointed.  The story is weak, and the art is even weaker, except for the Jim Lee issues.  The whole thing seems rushed and thrown together, with a very contrived plot, as if they needed a cross over story arc to sell more New Mutants and X-Factor books.  Not recommende
