Don't let the beautiful cover fool you, this book contains dreadfully complex, dry text that confuses rather than enlightens. Unless you are enticed by topics such as, &quot;Interpreting the D/Log E Curve&quot; or &quot;Converting Log Density Ranges&quot; there are easily better choices. If you're looking for clarity - whether novice or advanced photography skill - buy Bryan Peterson's &quot;Understanding Exposure.&quot; Its simplicity is effective and refreshing
