Many of us have the sinking feeling that the Internet is starting to resemble television. As the saying goes, "There are 500 television stations, but nothing's on." Estimates vary about the number of Web sites on the Internet. By some estimates, there are 300 million. Which means there are 300 million Web sites and nothing's on. Most of the Web sites aren't worth visiting.

The author of "Best of the Internet" wants to direct you to the Web sites that are worth going to. To that end, he has assembled some 1,000 Web site names and descriptions into 19 categories -- reference, communicating, computing, entertainment, news, sports, hobbies, family, education, health, lifestyles, religion, finance, careers, shopping, travel, government, and the weird.

If you are willing to trudge through this book's 420 pages, you will find more than a few good Web sites. I found a number of good online stores, for example. But the problem with this book is that the author mostly presents the tried and true. He doesn't stray from the beaten track. You discover Web sites that you could probably find on your own or already know about.

I thought the book book presented far too many corporate Web sites. Do I need to know that Disney.com is a good family-oriented Web site? The author could have searched a little farther for eccentric Web sites that are of interest to families. I find corporate Web sites dull and uninspiring, but many are listed in this book.

Another thing: The Web site descriptions are long-winded. By the time you read some of these descriptions, you could have visited the Web site on your own and decided for yourself whether it is worth visiting.

I hope if the author revises this book that he cuts back on the Web site descriptions and gives us more Web sites instead. How about 2,000 Web sites next time instead of 1,000, with fewer words to describe each Web site?
