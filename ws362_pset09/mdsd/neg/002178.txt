My son loves trains, but this book is so boring it doesn't hold either of our interests.  Margaret Wise Brown is kind of hit and miss to me.  I love Color Kittens, but really don't care for quite of few of her other books including the infamous Goodnight Moon.  Pick up Chugga Chugga Choo Choo by Kevin Lewis instead.  We love that one.  It's fun to read with great pictures
