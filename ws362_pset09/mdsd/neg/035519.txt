I will keep this review short and simple, as a book of this genre really doesn't warrant much thought or criticism. I bought this book as a result of Karla Homolka's recent release from prison. I have followed the story a little on television and the internet and feel that this book adds nothing to the things I already know. The Amazon review touts the book to be well-researched and written, but I completely disagree. This book, like many other crime books, is cliched, repetitive (so, tired of scences in which Paul rapes a girl -- the language IS exactly the same every time and it isn't a stylistic choice, it's just sheer laziness of this hack writer), and boring. I suppose I will finish it, but it's the type of book that makes you feel guilty about reading it(like watching Jerry Springer or reading US magazine), since it is a total waste of time and so terribly written. 

So, if you are interested in this strange criminal case, I wouldn't bother purchasing this book. The only positive thing I can say about it, is the introduction by Kirk Makin. It's misleading, as he isn't a bad writer, so he sets you up for a terrible disappointment when you read the actual author.
