I have been doing origami for about 10 years, and have had great success with modular origami (mostly from "Unit Origami" by Tomoko Fuse).  This book has diagrams that are hard to understand, the colored side of the paper is not even marked so it's very difficult to know if you are folding correctly.  There are no written instructions, only the bad diagrams and I could not make a single model from this book.  Even the few photos of the completed models were in black and white and not very good photos at all.  I would recommend Fuse's book or another modular origami book with better diagrams.  For those that have had success with models from this book, congratulations, but even with my usual vast amount of patience it did not take long for me to throw this book across the room in frustration.  However, I will say that the models are very unique and beatiful and if you can do them, they should be very satisfying. I am copying this same review for "3-d Geometric Origami" by Gurkewitz and Arnstein, for I felt the same was true of that book
