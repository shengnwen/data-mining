I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.
