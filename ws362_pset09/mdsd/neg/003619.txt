but this abridgement is the poorest that I have ever heard or read. There were many elements left out of the story, including some that were mentioned on the cover! With all the missing elements of the story, I'm sure there were nuances that were totally missed, leaving just a fair story with no build up or satisfying resolution. What remained was a &quot;B&quot; grade short story, making me very cautious to ever buy another abridgement. If you like Robin Cook, and want to hear this audio book, I strongly suggest you listen to the unabridged version. It most definitely has to be much better!
