Finally, after 343 pages of utter drivel, all the while searching for the buried qualities that would make 1) this a best-seller, 2) the critics hail this as his best since Garp, 3)it a good laugh, I threw it away in complete disgust and maddening frustration. I won't donate this book. I'll pretend I didn't waste good money on it, thank myself for not buying the hardback version at twice the price, already wary of Irving's decline.

Maybe Irving was playing with us, maybe he knows his substantial reputation would carry the day, maybe he just does not have it any more, maybe the critics should get a case of collective amnesia, forgetting Irving's past success with Garp, so that they could approach his work with unbiased faculties. Maybe.....I've been sucked into the Undertoad.

In any case I've never been more relieved to stop the torture arising from my dumbed down expectations about an Irving novel. I can't imagine I'd ever buy another one without sitting down and reading 50 pages before plunking down the cold cash to own one. 

Boo.
