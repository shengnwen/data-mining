This novel is engaging, I must admit; but as such an unchallenging read, it seems to have been written for thirteen year-olds.  The writing does not flow well, and the author really struggles to get the novel started.  As a college graduate, I am a bit embarassed at having read this book, which I only finished because I paid fourteen dollars for it.  I agree with the previous review that suggested this book should NOT be categorized as an historical novel, but rather as a romance.  Among those who may enjoy this book are women who read "chic lit" such as "The Devil Wears Prada" etc.  Unstimulating, though somewhat interesting, similar to TV shows like "Date my Mom" and "ElimaDate."
