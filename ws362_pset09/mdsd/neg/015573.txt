I found Mitchell's topic very interesting and approached the books with a lot of enthusiasm.  However, in the end I found Mitchell's description disappointing.  While he does note a few concrete changes he expects to come about in the urban landscape (e.g. buildings being less clearly distinguished in terms of the kinds of activities they contain, and perhaps a shift in the importance of the urban center as digital connectivity diminishes the emphasis on physical location) that were good starting points for a consideration of architecture in the digital age, the bulk of this book was characterized by repetitive speculation about the changes associated with the digital age (accounts that may have made more of an impact on his readers in 1995 when the book was first published, but today seem rather obvious or exagerated and tiresome to read) without really relating them to architecture in an insightful way.  Mitchell's vague and speculative language distracted me from the few interesting points that he did make. Interesting topic, but Mitchell's treatment of it was not particularly satisfying.
