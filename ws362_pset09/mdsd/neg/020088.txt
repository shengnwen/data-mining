I am against Sufism in general and against the Ibne `ul-Arabism in particular. Sufism is nothing more than a philosophy based on hallucination, either self-induced or drug induced.  A greater danger of Sufism is their smooth approach in leading people towards shiism and this man, ibne ul-arabi is champion at that.  I have read his main book,  futuhat, which I consider his master non-sense, and time after time I was amazed how his argument was pointing towards shiism. Don't be fooled by his few sentences here and there which he makes against "shias", look at the essence of what he is telling people. Does ibne ularabi really think that people are that naïve?  If I were a shia, I would have known no better book to use as a shia propaganda than this person's book.  Corbin, without knowing perhaps, has done Moslems, especially the one who live in the west and are not very familiar with their religion, a great service by exposing Arabi as who he was, a shia or shia sympathetic. I look at him a very smooth and clever shai.  That is why many Sunni scholars have written so many books against this man and his evil teachings.  I just see it my religious duty to warn my brothers about the danger of this most famous hypocrite n the Islamic world
