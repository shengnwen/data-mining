Don't bother with this book.  Every place Richard went he ran into more characters and the whole point of the story had to be explained in painful detail to the new characters.  I have read the whole series and this was one of the worst.  Even a big important battle scene is barely talked about so they could focus on repeating Richards feelings to someone new... blegh
