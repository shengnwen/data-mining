This book is definitely not one to purchase if you are looking for detailed accounts of climbing these mountains.We read far more about the planning and personal lives of these men; neither of whom is interesting enough to command this attention. The dialogue between the two men is incredibly canned and sappy and Ridgeway tries in vain to capture the true feelings resulting from these ascents. You would probably be better off reading individual guides if you want to get a feel for these climbs. There are definitely better books on the subject
