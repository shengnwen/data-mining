I received this book as a gift, ....after reading it I disposed of it.  I found it to be disrespectful of our Savior.  Lucado suggests that the reason Jesus went to the wedding at Cana was because He wanted to "twirl the bride around the dance floor".  This is the Son of God we're talking about, not some red-blooded human ordinary male.  

He uses a lot of space to write short, incomplete sentences that are supposed to grip us, I guess.  It didn't grip me
