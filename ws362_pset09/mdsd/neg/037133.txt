I first read this book in 1995 when it was released. Mr. McCall's struggle out of poverty and achievement of success as a reknowned journalist sets an excellent example.

However, I was consistently surprised and dismayed by how he refuses to take responsibility for his actions as a youth, instead blaming white society for his troubles. This is a disturbing thread that continues throughout the book, and causes me to wonder if Mr. McCall really learned anything from his experiences, other than blaming everyone else for whatever problems you face in life
