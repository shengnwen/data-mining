Picked this up on a whim, and it was disappointing. I didn't finish it -- the book is repetitious and surprisingly dull, considering what a good writer Kate Wilhelm is. Though there are moments. Likely to be of more interest to Clarion alums and aspiring students. For others, caveat lector.

Sadly,
Peter D. Tillman
