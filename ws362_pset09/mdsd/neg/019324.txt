I have worked quite a bit with Somali refugees, and have established friendships with several individuals. I picked this book up in hopes of understanding more about the background of the older individuals I encounter (same &quot;age&quot; as Aman). The first third of the book I really enjoyed, and I think, learned much from. From that point onward, it seems to become less and less representative of &quot;the general&quot; experience or &quot;a typical&quot; experience. Though I cruised through the first part, by midpoint my interest was dropping off quickly, and I had to convince myself to finish it. If this is one of the better books to read about Somalia or Somalis, it is only because there are so few contenders
