While the book is well written, I am very used to Susan's dog mystery books, which I enjoy alot.    I did not find the mystery writer an enjoyable or particularily sympathetic  character.  I did get some insight into an author's life, which was interesting, Susan Conant's love for dogs shines thru the Holly Winter series.  But I didn't get the impression that she is a catlover.  
For part of the fun of an "animal" mystery is thinking, my pet does that, or I know a dog/cat like that.  While the cats seemed like lovely cats, I wasn't drawn into their personalities.  Wait for the second hand copy, if you really want to try it.
