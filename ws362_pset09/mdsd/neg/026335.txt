I wish L.M. Montgomery had stopped at book number seven. The joy in reading the "Anne of Green Gables" series was that they were so optimisitic, humorous, and full of hope and happiness. This book was such a downer that I wish I hadn't read it - but how could I know I'd wish that until after I'd read it? I loved the first seven books, but if you can stand not to read the final book of a series, I'd recommend skipping this one. It was a real disappointment for me. If I want to read history and stories about "the real world" (which I certainly often do), then I would choose a book that I expected to be about that. This book does not belong in the "Anne" series
