A friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday after someone else recommended it to her. We decided to read it with a group of friends, so then we could all see what it was about. Having just finished the book, I can say that I really did not enjoy reading it and had to force myself to finish it. The mix of Spanish and English may appeal to some, but to a non-Spanish speaker, it was more of a hindrance. The plot goes way off the deep end, and before there is any real character or plot development, the reader is suddenly overwhelmed with a major event, just a few pages into the book. Various details included in the story seemed rather useless and excessive, being tossed in and never brought up again, at least not in a major way. For example, the interruption of the plot to discuss the lesbian couple from Oakland was not much than that, just an interruption. The effect of these characters was so subtle that a few of my reading group friends didn't quite understand the reason for its inclusion in the book. In this example, the author seemed to lack the ability to tie it into the overall plot, merely hinting at the ramifications. However, actually bringing these minor details into the book may have been even worse, only because the book would have been longer then! If you're considering reading this &quot;novel&quot;, I'd suggest you find a better, more well-written book to spend your time with instead
