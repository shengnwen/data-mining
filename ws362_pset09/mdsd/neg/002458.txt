The cover and title sure does fool you.  Best Friends.  Looked like a great book for people like me that enjoy stories about how friends meet and make their journey through life together.  But this book was confusing as far as jumping around.  Porn?  Come on, give me a break.  This book is freakish, yet I read the whole thing... too long and I yet have to know what the entire point of the book was.  These characters were disturbing to me and instead of the title "Best Friends"... try "Selfish Psychos".  Do not waste your time and get this book.  If you are truly interested, see if your local library has it... that way you save your money.  Most terrible book EVER!  OH and my copy of the book had sections to where the letter "x" was replaced by the letter "y".  Nice proofreading
