Is it just me who thinks that the Discworld has lost its life? I always loved Discworld- I read and re-read every book up to Fifth Elephant with gusto, and I loved them like no other books in the world. But when I read Fifth Elephant, I found something had changed. There is just no life to this book. It wasn't remotely funny, the plot was confusing and unexciting... I don't know why, but I just didn't enjoy reading this one. I got bored with it after the first few pages, and it was a chore to read the rest. It was awful for me; like having a good friend suddenly turn on me. Every book following Fifth Elephant has, in my opinion, only gone downhill. It's not that Pratchett has run out of ideas, but that he seems to have lost his enthusiasm. It's horribly depressing
