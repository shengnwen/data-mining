Mediocre work of philosophy which is riddled with overly sentimental and often corny language which drowns the originality and power of Nietzsche's thinking. Actually, Nietszche's preface to the book, which is a self-critique is excellent, and lays out the problems of the work better than I ever could, the essay is often considered a model of self-criticism. "The Birth of the Tragedy" attempts to explicate the nature of Greek tragedy, which Nietzsche argues was born when the Apollonian world view collided with the Dionysian. The second half of the book seeks to examine modern culture and art through the lens of classical Greek Tragedy, and he argues that the modern cultural era can be redeemed through a re-birth of Dionysian tragedy, which Nietzsche sees in the music of Wagner. Aside from some interesting comments on music and ancient Greek thought and mythology, "The Birth of the Tragedy" is ultimately a disappointing and pompous work.
