In search of a good grammar guide that would cover the bizarre exceptions I'm always finding to the accepted rules, I stumbled across this offering from Writer's Digest Books. At first glance, I thought it would be just the ticket. Having a spiral binding is always an enormous plus, and the price is right. I've used a Gregg Reference Manual for years, which this book resembles, but a new Gregg is pricey.

But on opening the Grammar Desk Reference, I had to wonder what Writer's Digest was thinking. I may be in my early forties, but I do have 20/20 vision in both eyes. One glance at the pages in this book actually hurt my eyes. The print literally pulses on the page like some bad op-art design. That goes beyond the font size issue that some others have mentioned. I can't ever recall this happening with any book I've ever read, so this one creates a first.

Thinking it was just me, I showed this book to some other people to get their opinion; they all said the textual design was off. If it's painful to look at this book, no matter how good its content actually is, will you ever use it for any length of time? 

I have good vision, but I'm failing to understand this trend in style guides and references toward smaller font faces and more text crammed on a page. If anything, a reference should have liberal whitespace to aid in locating information with a simple scan of the page.

Writer's Digest, please consider a more usable version of this reference. Maybe then more people will consider purchasing it
