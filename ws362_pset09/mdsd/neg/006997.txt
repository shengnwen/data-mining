I love to read christian fiction but this was a bit disapointing.  For the first time I actually wished that the main character, Jessica, would just go away.  I mean I actually wanted to throw this book out a window a couple of times.  I didn't even bother to finish it.  And I don't think I would call this a christian faith based book.  In fact it said in very broad terms that all you need to do is go to church and pray and everything will work out in the end.  Not a single mention of the plan of Salvation, which christian faith is based on.
