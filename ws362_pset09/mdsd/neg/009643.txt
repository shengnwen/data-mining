I'm sorry, but this is just too much.   Had the book been called 'The People Manifesto', it would be great.  But a book that pushes for MORE benefits for mothers?  Good gravy...why?  Are FMLA, WIC, Medicaid, Medical, Social Security, HUD, child tax deductions, child tax credits, childcare tax credits, child support, and all the other benefits not enough?  

The women's movement gave us choice and equality.  Why now, are we saying that one choice is better than another?  Why are we pushing for extra benefits rather than equal benefits?  Doesn't everyone deserve better wages, healthcare, flex time, and all the other things the authors want just for mothers?  Why don't the other 72% of the population deserve those things?  The authors of this book have done little to further the cause of women.  For example, the authors' use of the words "women" and "mothers" interchangeably, gave me a 50s flashback and a headache.  Woman =/= Mother.  They did, however, succeeded in ruining years of hard work by convincing women that any choice that doesn't include motherhood isn't worthwhile.   Thanks a lot
