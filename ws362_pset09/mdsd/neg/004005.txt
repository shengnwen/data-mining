I found this an interesting book, but not that believable.  Ryall claims to be describing a family tradition (famtrad) of Wicca not connect to Gardnerian or Gardnerian derived Wicca.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to hold water, and most people who know about the subject don't believe her claims.  Still, it is an interesting read
