I was so impressed that Mr. Rubenstein had been named teacher of the year, and that he used humor in his title that I really wanted to read his book.
Many of us want to hear eachothers' stories and gain knowledge, new perspective, or steal from another teacher's toolbox of tricks. 
My opinion of Mr. Rubenstein's experience is that he has become a hardened, sarcastic, and unresponsive teacher. His theories and strategies are very last century, and I do not mean 1990.  While I applaud his ability to poke fun at himself, to recognize that he is always under the microscope of his students, and to have created a strategy that "worked" for him, I cringe at the lessons (humane, societal, responsive, responsible) that he's teaching his high school students.
My suggestion to all educators' looking for a helpful book on classroom management and discipline is to first take a good long hard look at themselves and ask two questions. First, What do I want the children to learn? Second, How am I planning hte activity for success?
