I consider myself a fairly well-read individual and as a 1st generation Mexican American, I thought this would be an interesting book to read read.  Early on, it became abundantly clear what this book was about.  

It was garbage.  The moral of the story is that if you want a better life, your S- outta luck.  Settle for what you have and don't ask for more!  

"Materialism is bad".  Isn't materialism and the right to complain what this country was built on?
