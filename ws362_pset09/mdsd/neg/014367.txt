Now, I think talking about any child, regardless of sex, being violent is ian important subject. But when you focus the discussion on girls then you're completely missing the point and putting the undeserved and unfair attention on girls NOT BOYS. For example:

Let's say you're a parent and you have 6 kids (5 boys, 1 girl) and every week, your 5 boys fight with each other and they get into fights at school. Every week they get sent home for fighting, cursing, bad behavior, etc. Then one day, your one daughter, who has no history of such behavior, gets sent home from school for fighting. Suddenly its "OMG Peggy Sue got into a fight. What's wrong with my daughter!? This is all the WNBA's fault!!!"

Boys fighting should not be "boys being boys." teaching young men and boys that this is normal, and not calling them out while lambasting girls is such a male-dominated view to take. 

ZERO stars folks! stay away
