The book cover, the editor's introduction, and the Amazon blurb all suggest that the stories in this book come directly from Freshman magazine. Well, maybe they did originally, but ALL of the stories here have appeared in the Friction volumes, and some again in the Best of Friction volume. So if you own any or all of the Friction series, you already have some/all of the stories here. This duplication, of course, isn't illegal, and one expects some of it in anthologies, but the editor and Alyson Books have gone way beyond what's ethical in this case, since there is no hint that all the material has been previously released in their own anthologies. The stories themselves are as good/bad as they were in Friction volumes
