Perhaps a better title for this book would have been "Poor Choices". I found this book to be about someone who was quite depressed about life and went from one bad choice to another. There was very little about cycling in the book and the little that was led me to believe that the author doesn't know very much about cycling.  I kept hoping that the character in the book was going to run into a true cyclist who was going to teach him about the sport(how to ride, how to dress, etc.) This however was not the case.  Based purely on this book, I will not read another Greg Garrett novel.
