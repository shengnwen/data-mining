What in the world was Jax Peters Lowell thinking when she wrote Chapter 17, "Rx for Health"?  I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten.  I stopped taking it immediately and began searching for a gluten-free alternative.  I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex.  I had thought it was gluten-free!  I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394,  Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication.  Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list.  I contacted Pfizer....no gluten!  I Googled gluten and Celebrex.....NO Gluten!   There are many responsible guides for celiacs.  Lowell's book is certainly not one of them
