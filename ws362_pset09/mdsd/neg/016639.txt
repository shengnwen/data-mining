I had been excited to read of Daniel Boulud's Braise. He is a great chef, and having become comfortable with the braising technique from Molly Steven's book, I was looking forward to Daniel's ideas.
I tried seven dishes. Of the four beef dishes my family ate, only the Beef Shoulder with Jerusalem Artichokes and Carrots was tasty enough to be served again. It was complex and the Jerusalem Artichokes were exotic but did taste like they belonged in a beef stew.
We also ate the Paleron de Boeuf au Vin Rouge, which was merely an adequate variation on a daube,and Smoky Beef Chili, which uses lime juice instead of tomato for its acid,but cooking dimished the tang, so the final flavor seemed tamed and dull. We tried the Braised Ground Beef with Split Peas, Apricots and Apples and the Red Cabbage with Apples and Honey,and they were both way sweet. My daughter loved the cabbage candy.
I also cooked the Veal Breast Braised with Cinnamon and Green Olives, which was edible(unlike the two previous) but, well, maybe the nuance of the 20/lb serrano ham is lost after being braised for 2 hours. Again, the cinnamon seemed to give an excessive sweetness to the dish.
I tried the dessert braise of Mangoes and Carrots With Honey and Ginger-Lime Whipped Cream. The cream was outstanding, but the braise was a what was I thinking moment.
Over all, I've been disappointed. Maybe I'll have tastier times with fowl and pork.
