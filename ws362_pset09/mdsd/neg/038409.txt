I have nearly 100 'baby name' books. Lansky's books are among the most shoddily researched. He also employs tactics to beef up his almighty name count such as misspelling names and adding each misspelling as a separate name in its own right and he even sometimes gives these misspellings different meanings from its correctly spelled root name. He also garners more numbers by adding male names to the female side, euphemistically femininizing their meanings to match the switch. I check the accuracy of each book I get with some easily researchable 'benchmark' names (Alexandra, Benjamin, William, etc) and even with these 'gimmies' he has around a 60% accuracy. That's not even counting the names that comprise the majority of his books, tribal-type names, such as from Africa, Native American tribes, and even those from Celtic roots. I wonder, would Webster get away with 60% accuracy? Certainly not and the same standards of accuracy and research should be applied to name books as well. The thing I find redeeming about Lansky's books is that it's full of outrageously spelled oddities, making it perfect for finding a name for your elven wizard in your next Dungeons and Dragons game
