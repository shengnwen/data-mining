The Da Vinci Code is a worldwide phenomenon, staying on the New York Times Bestseller List for over 2 years.  I think I'll throw together a quicky book with some alternate intepretations of biblical "history" that I got from looking up websites with Google one weekend.  I'll slap the name "Da Vinci Code" in the title of my book and market it to delusional paranoids who spend every waking minute thinking about how the arts and entertainment world is at war with Christianity. I'll make a forture off someone else's success. It sure beats working for a living!

God Bless Americ
