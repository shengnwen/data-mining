She starts out slowly to explain the transformation from an individual based responsibility society to one that resolve individual responsibility and blames all woes on the vary society that creates the problem.  A hand full of perverts and commies have taken control of our institutions and perverted the institution's purpose. Sounding like she stumbled upon some great secret and is giving the alarm, this book then quickly turns in to some bitch session that moves from one institution to another. It become very repetitive and offers no solution. She should have stopped when she was ahead.

I haven't heard terms like the deserving and undeserving poor since the re-runs of "My Fair Lady" when Alfred P. Doolittle said "I intend to go on being undeserving". 

Maybe it is just that a lot of her descriptions of society are of some place far off or unique and have never made it here. However her descriptions of schools do not match the ones I went to or the local ones that kids are going to today. She must have gone to a different Smithsonian than I did and none of the examples of daily life matches any reality that I have come across.

If the book had a solution section it would be "The Capitalist Manifesto" (a revolutionary plan for a Capitalistic distribution of wealth to preserve our free society) by Louis O. Kelso and Mortimer J. Adler.

This book is the "Turner Diaries" without the story line. I rate it up there with the best of conspiracy theories. If you make it through this book with out wondering what her problem is then be sure to read "None Dare call it Conspiracy" at least there is an attempt to put some meat behind it.

However the book does describe a good nightmare if you can find it.
