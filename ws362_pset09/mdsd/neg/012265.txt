I must admit that a misguided person gave me this book. Worse yet, she expected me to swoon and join her on my knees and pray for rapture. 

Of all the foolishness that is damaging our world, LaHaye's products must be among the worst culprits. I managed to finish this book, and between laughter and rolling of eyes, all I can say is "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
