Clever marketing ploy, calling this the last novel written by an author, supposedly a passenger on Oceanic Flight 815, portrayed in the ABC series LOST. There are even LOST references sprinkled throughout the book - Hanso, Mr. Cluck's, John Locke, Oceanic. Unfortunately, it's the only clever aspect to this book. It's a wholly sophomoric effort in the private dick genre.

PI Paul Artisan is hired by a rich man to find the man's identical twin, the supposed "bad" twin of the title. For a novel this short, Artisan spends an enormous amount of time thinking screamingly inappropriate thoughts about women he meets along the way - some simply in passing - including bedding the rich man's stepmother and a hippie yoga instructor named Sky. About half-way through the story, Paul makes some high-handed comment that he's not doing to the job just for money anymore. This statement comes completely out of the blue. I didn't find his thoughts or his actions backing this up.

The author has the annoying habit of repeatedly referring to the protagonist by his full name. Really not necessary, since they're the first two words of the book. Paul has a mentor with whom he discusses the case, a former college instructor named Manny, with whom he shares custody of an aging, but young-at-heart Labrador named Argos. Manny has a knack for making his point by referring to classics like Lord of the Flies and King Lear. References which, invariably, Paul never gets, and Manny has to explain.

Frankly, I would have rather read a book about the dog
