I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories.  This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing.  There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult.  I felt like I was in the "fog of war", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end.  Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?
