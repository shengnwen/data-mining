I bought "Words That Sell" and the companion book " Phrases That Sell" based on a recommendation from a new letter published by D H Communications. Both of these books were a major disappointment. These words may work on the dumbed-down consumer market lemmings with an affinity for the Pacific coast, but they are not effective for technical marketing literature aimed at an educated clientele. I would change the titles to "If you find any of these phrases or word in your copy, rewrite it." I stop listening and dismiss the possibility of truth or relevancy of the message when these words are present
