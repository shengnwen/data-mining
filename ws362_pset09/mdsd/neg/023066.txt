I don't know if earlier editions are better, but this one (4th) is definitely poor quality. The writing is absolutely terrible in some places--short, choppy sentences that often don't connect to the rest of the paragraph--and gives the feeling of having been cut-and-pasted. The style feels almost amateurish and is very distracting, making it hard to actually learn the subject being presented. Not at all a good choice as the main textbook for a class
