I brought this book after reading the reviews of the many people it has clearly helped.  I have suffered from chronic neck pain for many years now.  I wondered if the chronic nature of my pain could be due to emotional or other reasons.   Unfortunately, the book did not help.  It appears that either this is not the cause or I am in the small group of people that Dr Sarno believes need counseling.  

One thing I did find frustrating was the abruptness with which the book ended.  Dr Sarno concludes that some people will need counseling to achieve relief.  However he provides no guidance about the type of counseling or what sort of issues may need to be addressed.  I got to the end of the book with no where else to go.  I couldn't envision going to a psychologist and saying "I have neck pain, help me discover what is causing it".  

I have since decided that this is not the cause of my problem.  It appears to be an intermittent physical problem.  So far my I've found that yoga and remedial massage have been the most successful in controlling my problem.  Regular yoga in particular often provides weeks and weeks of relief.

This book didn't help me, but from the many glowing reviews it has obviously helped many other people.  Mostly, I wrote this review so that people would be aware that it doesn't work in all cases.
