What a disappointment!  I requested this book for Christmas, but after about 125 pages I pitched it.  In addition to bad writing, it became clear the author had a political agenda in writing it.  Not that injecting personal points of view is inappropriate; T.H. White does it brilliantly in his Once and Future King and Book of Merlin. It's just that the worldview Jack Whyte advocates is adolescent, ignorant and simplistic.  I won't know how Whyte will treat the complex mythopoeic stories of Merlin and Arthur; I hope with a lot more depth and nuance than he began his series
