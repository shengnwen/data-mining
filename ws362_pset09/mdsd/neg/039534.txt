I was eagerly anticipating the information from this book, having studied the narrative artform for the past 3 years and having read through the Mcloud, Eisner, Janson and various books on film.
I couldnt believe how little actual information is in this book, it jumps from here to there with no flow and it's lack of content hidden in examples obviously from the works of those adding to the book.
Don't waste your time, buy Both Will Eisners Books on storytelling then Scott Mclouds books, leave this boring jumble of arse on the shelf
