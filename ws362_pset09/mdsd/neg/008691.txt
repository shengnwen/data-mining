This venture into the murky waters of historical speculation and machine-consciousness debates does tell you a few things if you are unfamiliar with Turing and Wittgenstein (otherwise, don't bother reading it). But while Turing's viewpoint is clearly stated from the start, Wittgenstein's is only done justice at the end. The other three characters in the book could be merged into a single one without any loss, and in general the entire book's message could be condensed in a few pages. Which would be pages worth reading if you like articles in easy-reading popular science magazines (which I have nothing against, and indeed subscribe to)
