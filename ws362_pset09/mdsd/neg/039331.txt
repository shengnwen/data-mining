When I reviewed Franken's "Why Not Me?" I explained that I had read it because I loved "Rush Limbaugh is a Big..." but "Why Not Me?" had fallen short of my high expectations.  THIS book was even MORE disappointing.  The subject matter is worn and the material is not that creative, and sadly, just not that funny.  Honestly, I WANTED to laugh- I LIKE Al Franken, but this book just feels forced, the kind of thing that's churned out just to meet a publisher's deadline and get Franken's face back to the front of book racks (Pre- "Lies..." of course).  It's worth reading if you are stuck on an airplane, or an elevator, or something.  Otherwise, pick something else by Franken.  ANYTHING else by Franken
