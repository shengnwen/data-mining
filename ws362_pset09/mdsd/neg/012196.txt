I expect a guide like this to pick up where the instruction manual leaves off.  But this book spends 3/4 of its pages just reproducing what is already included with the book's online and printed help.  The rest provides some very abstract ideas on strategy.  It does not tell you what units or buildings to build or when to build them.  Civ 4 is a great game, but you won't get much here.  Stick to the game's manual and visit some of the fan sites for helpful hints
