Without going on too much, these stories are fragmented, unclear, poorly written, and the plots are lame and basically make no sense.  I wrote a more in depth reveiw for "Edward's Exploit", which we bought along with this one.  While some other (but most definitely not all) Thomas books revolve around a core group of charaters and seem to teach lessons and have some excitement to them, this book has a new character speaking less and less sense on every page.  My toddler can't get into these. 

My two year old will read "Trouble for Thomas", "A Cow on the Line" and "Thomas gets Tricked" over and over and over, but he lost interest in this collection of stories before we had even read it once.  It wouldn't have been too hard for me to have read one story before buying this, but since the other Thomas books we had we such hits I figured I didn't need to . . . BIG mistake!
