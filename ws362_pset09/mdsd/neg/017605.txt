This book may be lauded by professionals and amateurs alike, but the author is so god-awfully wordy that I couldn't get beyond the second chapter.  I actually tossed it across the room in frustration--which I NEVER do to a book.  It reads like an infomercial or sales letter where the main tactic is interminable repetition.  If the redundancies were removed, it would be one-third to one-half its current length--and a MUCH better book.  

I'm disappointed that frustration and boredom will not allow me to get to the excellent lessons I've heard it contains.  Perhaps the author could give it over to a good proofreader or editor for condensing and offer us a third version
