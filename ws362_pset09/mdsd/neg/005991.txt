I was more interested in reading about different perspectives in the business environment, and the most effective way to communicate between different roles. I did not buy the book to memorize long lists of words and phrases - the "good" ones and the "bad" ones. 

The lists really put me off. They do get the right concepts across, in their own inept way, but they aren't all-inclusive, and it only stands to reason that sometimes they'll be wrong, depending upon the situation. Sure words are powerful, but delivery is everything. Body language, attitude, and neutral words used in the wrong way can have the same effect as words on the "bad" list, so the lists hardly make sense. I think the only time I will use these lists will be when I want to mock the late 90's and early 2000's with tired, overused phrases that I really can't stand to hear anymore. This book is at such a superficial level that it isn't even about communication.
