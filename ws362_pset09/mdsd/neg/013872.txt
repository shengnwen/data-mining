The Good:
The book contains an abundance of illustrations which can be very helpful.  The author uses the text of the book itself as bad examples of design. 
The Bad:
As a newbie to publication design, I approached this book as a student.  I probably would have never even opened the cover of it if it weren't required for a class.  The design of the cover (and most of the book) is horrible.  I can't read the title and it does nothing to attract me visually.  The illustrations are so sloppy they are unprofessional.  Although sketches in real life should be messy, the sketches in the book should at least be interpretable.  The author never uses any concrete terminology, so it is difficult categorize information as you absorb it.
