I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this book!  I am an avid Ann Rule fan - it's hard for me to find a book of hers that I don't already own.  When I saw this one (at Target, no less) I was suprised and bought it right away.  What a disappointment! I already owned 90% of it in other publications, and really felt that I had been scammed into buying something. I rated this with 2 stars, because as always, Ann's writing is superb, and if you aren't an avid follower, this book would be great for you.  But if you've already read most of her work, don't get suckered into buying this
