I was quite disappointed with this book. I've heard that the results in the British Health System after implementing TOC are quite outstanding. If it's true, this book doesn't reflect it.
First of all, written as a novel, the backround story is not good. Two brothers are in a great fight and won't talk to each other because one of them is a TOC follower. Come on! I'm sure the authors's could've found a better backround story. 
The description of how the NHS works is poor. The Health System is different from the one in my country, so I found it very hard to try to figure out how the NHS works, the different departments, the interactions, etc.
From the TOC point of view, good for someone just starting with TOC, but too light for someone who has read any other book. 
To explain the concept of a system constraint, the book uses the same type of analogy used in Goldratt's "The Goal" (the boy scout trip), but the example and the explanation is not good.
The clouds built to find these problems conclude that the core problem of the NHS is the lack of communication between the different levels. I was expecting a more detailed analysis from the operations point of view.
In the last chapter a year has passed, and there is a summary of everything I would have expected the book to explain throughout the book, all in one chapter, with insufficient detail.
This book is good if you are involved in the NHS, and therefore know its problems, and if you know nothing about TOC. 
If you want to learn about TOC Thinking Processes, I recommend Dettmer's "Goldratt's Theory of Constraints" with the main concepts, and "Management Dilemmas" (Shragenheim) with many interesting practical examples. Also "It's not luck".
If you want to learn TOC Operations, "Manufacturing at Warp Speed" (Dettmer & Shragenheim).
Project Management: Project Management in the fast lane (Newbold).
