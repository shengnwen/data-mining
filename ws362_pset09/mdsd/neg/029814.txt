Intellectually the book is drivel, a high-school level history of the United States wherein Barone gets to label things as either Soft or Hard(he actually capitalizes the adjectives.  Hard he likes (the GI Bill, FHA mortgages), Soft he don't (Welfare, Social Security, most modern education.).  It is short, an hour should get you through it.
