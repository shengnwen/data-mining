This guide is ambiguous and provides very little information about obscure topics such as inversive geometry. The text is difficult to comprehend not because of its vocabulary, but because it tend to veer off course. Although  the subject matter is interesting, it is very difficult to expose when  confronted to diagrams that are basically not explained. This could not be  used as a classroom guide because it tends to confound even gifted math  students. An interesting remark was made, which was, &quot;I think he's  going to start talking about his dog right now.&quot; This book would only  be reccomended to the top 2% of math students, because it is not accesible  to the general public. I should hope that someone who reads this book  writes a revision of it
