Stay away, all Parrotheads! This book should be called &quot;An intruder's guide to Jimmy Buffett,&quot; not &quot;An insider's guide to Jimmy Buffett&quot;! Mr. Ryan is writing this book upon assignment, not because  he is a fan of Buffett's, and this is quite obvious.  Although he states by  the end of the book, he has become a Buffett fan, his review of both  Buffett's music and the Parrotheads as a whole is amateurish and insulting.   He portrays the Parrotheads as a nameless, faceless group with nothing  better to do with their lives than get drunk and wear Hawaiian shirts.  His  book ends with an encounter with Jimmy Buffett, in which Buffett becomes  angered at the thought of Mr. Ryan writing a book about him.  Although he  couldn't have known it at the time, Buffett's reaction was quite  appropriate
