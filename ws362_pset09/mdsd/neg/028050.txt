The Southwest Airlines Way offers little applicable business process knowledge.  Instead the author provides a steady diet of amibiguities and generic case studies.  Drucker this is not.  I was particularly interested in the relationship between unions and Southwest management.  What I expected was a discussion on the management side of the economic value added of union involvement and on the rank-and-file side a discussion of the reasons unions were needed in lieu of employee empowerment programs.  What you get is "we're all in this together".  I recommend this only for those readers who know little about the airline's history and seek a basic primer.  Buy it used
