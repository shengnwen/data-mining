After reading the great reviews of this book, I was eager to start learning Italian in anticipation of a trip to Italy. What a disappointment this book is. In the introduction of this book it says, &quot;You don't want to have to memorize long lists of vocabulary words or a bunch of boring grammar rules.&quot; It then goes on to do just that: lists and rules to memorize from pages 9 to 40. It is indeed boring. If you have to buy this book for some reason, skip these pages, and go back after you've read Chapter 3: Bongiorno! Meeting and Greeting
