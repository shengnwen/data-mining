I'm thankful that I was able to get this book at the library and didn't spend $15.00 buying it.  I own The Blue Day Book by the same author and I think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away.  He should have stopped with that book. It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way.  The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures.  It did have one thought that I really liked:  &quot;Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge.  If that's true, then why do smart people dress so badly?&quot
