This is one of my all-time favorite cookbooks, well-used and well-worn. This new bargain edition is better than not owning the book at all, but it is really cheap and poorly made. The graphics all appear to be photocopies. The line drawings look awful, but at least they are "readable." Many of the photos are so dark that you can't tell what they are supposed to represent.

I would look for a used copy of the original edition
