This book was not good, and that hurts to say because I agreed with the overall diagnosis. Society - Western civilization specifically - is in trouble. Anyone who bothers to look past the rosy 'two cars in every garage' and the multiculti 'diversity is the greatest morality ever' can see that today we face problems which did not exist fifty years ago. There were no Columbines, there was no loss of purpose. I also dare say that desegregation has caused as much animosity between the races - if not more - than originally existed. Heresy, I know.

If you don't agree with that last suggestion, that would be because it is my opinion. Mrs. Jacobs has a lot of opinions in her book...though none so 'unenlightened', I'm sure. This book is just an intelligent person's attempt to talk about the things that irk her. There are no timeless insights, which is what a problem the magnitude of her thesis requires. Blunt ideas liks "Cars bad! Roads bad!" are not going to dissect our woes. Opinion is often presented as fact or maxim. I did not agree with many of those opinions. Although I have not read Jared Diamond's work cited, the applause he receives here had an unintended consequence for me. Many of Diamond's own reviews hint of the same problem that beleaguers Jacobs' work: opinion given as fact.

The positives I would attribute to Jacobs' Dark Age Ahead is that the subject matter is a poignant question of our time. Victory is bittersweet in that 'it is all down hill from here'; but if there is one constant of Western civilization, it is that the citizens are authors of their own destiny. Regrettably, too many of these same people choose to author a brave new world. The debate is needed, and anything that spurs that is ultimately a good thing. I would first read Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence or Bloom's Closing of the American Mind, however
