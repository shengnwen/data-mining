If you're from the Boston area, and you haven't read at least a couple of Spencer novels,  you're missing a cultural icon.  Boston and environs are as much a star as the erudite ex-boxer turned detective, Spencer. 

This is the 30th book of the Spencer series, and it's tired and formulaic.  There's no real tension, the ending isn't particularly surprising (or interesting).  It's not clear to me if the characterizations would hold at all if you hadn't read some of the other Spencer books.

Maybe it's time for Spencer to retire
