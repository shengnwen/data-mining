I cant find any place in the book where the author teaches you how to think. If the book were about, say...sex...Maxwell never gets around to teaching any practical techniques for better sex. The book is all about attitude and setting....which might make sex or thinking or whatever more enjoyable, but still fails to deliver the goods about how to do "it." The book is an infomercial about thinking. Like the one's that promise to teach you how to make a fortune playing the stock market but never quite get to the part where you learn how to do "it." The infomercial is all anecdotes and quotes, like this book. And that's okay because Maxwell uses good material. 

Much of what Maxwell asserts I agree with. Amen! Candy and dinner and flowers and liquor are terrific for the right mood. Plus proximity...you need to be there! But no where does Maxwell instruct you how to score. How to get from the right friends and the right place and the right time etc, etc., etc. to "Eureka!"

But in fairness to Maxwell, I dont believe you can teach anyone to think any more than you can command a feeling or mood or orgasm to materialize. I dont believe thinking and emotions etc. are THAT auto-manipulative. I mean, some very creative people swear by drugs and booze
