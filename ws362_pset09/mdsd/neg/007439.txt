I think Lynn Picknett sat down one night with a big bottle of wine and decided to rant her feelings, her research and strong opinions on some paper. She has some interesting ideas about who the Magdalene may have been or come from, and then never mentions it again- in fact here isn't much specifically about Magdalene at all.  And statements like "..when the Gnostics were silly they were extremely silly"- excuse me?? I resisted reading this book for a long time because friends who, like me, thought The Templar Revelation was an exellent book, didn't really like this one. Well, I gave it a shot, and it was not worth it
