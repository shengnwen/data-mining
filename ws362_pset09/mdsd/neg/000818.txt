This book reflects a reality in Israel to which you - the reader - are an unsuspecting party: a battle for the soul of Israel between religious and secular, conservatives and liberals, friends and enemies of the state.  From my perspective - a recent Oleh in Jerusalem - this book could not be more skewed to the political and social left.  In every chapter, assuming there is potential, the author finds a way to skewer observant Jews, accusing them of everything from warped sexuality to outright racism.  One example is an account of the Shas Party's anti-Russian campaign, presenting them as an expression of religious Jewish Israels..... without ever explaining that the Shas party is the expression primarily of very religious Mizrahi Jews and does not even remotely appeal to the greater Orthodox community.  Statistics are also highly inaccurate: bandied about is this strange statistic that 500,000 Russian Olim are non-Jewish, when in reality it is closer to 330,000 and includes those who consider themselves Jews but do not meet the halakhic definition of such.  Russian immigration has plummeted, recently, from 100,000 per year during the nineties to something like 3,500 per year, now.  The author is pitching one more stone in the camp of pluralistic, pro-Palestinian liberal Israelis, hoping that you'll join in the quest to remould Israel in the cast of liberal American wishes.  Do yourself a favor: don't bother with this one
