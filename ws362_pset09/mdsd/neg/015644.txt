This is an interesting, knowledgeable, but very short and skimpy, paperback book by a professor of neurobiology whose perspective is that of a primatology/evolutionary psychologist. The book contains some tiny photographs of the primates in question. It is a decent addition to the collection of anybody who is obsessed with learning every last thing about our various ape relatives. 

My complaint/concern is that the author's description of the book, and the example photos shown on Amazon, might lead one to expect it to contain high quality photographs. Instead, what you get is a tiny paperback of miniscule, grainy, terribly reproduced amateur black-and-white photographs by the professor, many of them shot at the zoo. 

Do NOT be deceived by the lovely color photographs in the publicity. There are no color photographs, or well-reproduced photographs, except on the front and back covers. Really, this has the feel of a home-made vanity press kind of book. 

For a more thorough treatment of the topic of human/ape nature, consider reading Frans De Waal's "Our Inner Ape". De Waal also published a book of gorgeous photographs of primates. For a more thorough exploration of evolutionary psychology, see Pinker's How The Mind Works.
