This book has several mentions of the Baha'i Faith in it, referring to the Faith as &quot;an offshoot of Islam&quot;, and in one part quoting someone as making the Baha'is out to look like violent animals. I will never read anything by this author again, she may be aware of Iran's history and politics, but is very miseducated in the area of the Baha'i Faith (not Bahaism as she writes it). The Baha'is are quite the opposite of what this author believes
