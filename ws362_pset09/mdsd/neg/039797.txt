This book was almost a complete waste of time. Why almost? It offered a few good tips for teenagers who are beginning to use makeup (emphasis on the "few"). However, not everyone wants the natural look, and not every teenager is a beginner. Also, Bobbi tends to overgeneralize and neglects to consider the self-esteem of those who have blonde hair and blue eyes (like me). I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, even beginners. There are books written by makeup artists who don't want to be the Hitler of the makeup world
