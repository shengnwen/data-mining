O please. This is totally yin view on business. Light house example, which they use through the book, shows clearly that author is out of the touch. Light house for boats is only usable in clear nights, it is switched of at day (50% of time) and you can not charge for it. I would rather use GPS navigation example because you must get the device. Light gives you only an information (what can you expect other from consultant). GPS navigates you in all weather conditions and ALSO on the land. 

Their view is a romantic one. You fill that you must almost fell in love with each customer to be good to work with. Real life is a little more complicated, so my non reaction to my ego suggestions on the not so perfect customer will make much better results. Still better if I can remove these responses for good and in same time acquire some wisdom.

In the first part they always point you to the second one, where you will finally here about it - us stay with us because we must make same thickness for the book. In the second part after a few pages I have taken away electricity from their light house. In the third part you have 20 pages of their contacts to other light houses. Can I return the book?
