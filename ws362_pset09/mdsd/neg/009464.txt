The book was kind of boring.  It wasn't very interesting reading about Hollywood back in the thirties.  Adults may get into it more, because they will be a little bit more familiar with the time period.  But for teenagers-not very interesting to read.  There are alot of names to remeber throughout the book, and you don't know how it really ends, because it is unfinished.  You may want to know if one of the characters will get rid of his boring liferstyle, but you never find out.  I have not read any other books by this author, but by reading this one first, I don't think I'll read any more of his books
