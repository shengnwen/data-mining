this book has the same info as colette harris' previous book, the pcos diet book. and it actually has less info regarding natural suppliments. the authors make sure to point out very often to go to a doctor and depend on doctors, which is contradictory to the first book colette harris had published. she seems to be watching her p's and q's regarding the medical community and it is possible she stepped on a few toes with her first book and is trying to make up for it.
i did not get any real information from this book. nothing new to me. and am now trying to actually sell my book and am sad at the fact that i wasted money on it to begin with. save your money or buy the pcos diet book instead
