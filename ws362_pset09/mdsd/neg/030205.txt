This book seems to be a guide to people who know absolutely nothing about holding, kissing, caressing etc. etc. Though it does a very good job at  explaining all the above but its about as useful as reading detailed  instructions on how to make a sandwich, you allready know how to do it you  dont need a book to tell you. Id recomend this book only if you have no  idea how to make contact with the opposite sex
