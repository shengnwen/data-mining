We are supposed to believe that Joan Anderson has created a new and better self in her year of solitude by the sea. Self? Or selfishness? While she pretends to be self-analytical, she proves herself to be self-centered. Where is her affection for her husband? And how does she expect to do her part in creating a marriage if she doesn't have it?  I sympathized with Robin and kept wondering why she didn't. She doesn't describe him positively. He is often described by what he can't do. He is *rarely beguiling.* While the reader is expected to listen to and learn from her forays into the past, she sees nothing of value in the moment when Robin pulls things saved in a box, precious since childhood. While she took a year to *find herself,* she has no patience with Robin's own attempts to adjust to their new life together. She doesn't want him to find his own way; she wants it him to do it HER way. She would like the reader to think this book is about how she and her husband create a new phase of their marriage together. But don't let her fool you. This book is all about HER, and everyone else, friends, family, and most especially poor Robin, are merely minor characters. Joan may have learned to love herself in that year by the sea, and good for her,  but she  is far from being the role model she sets herself up as in this book. She still has much to learn about loving other people
