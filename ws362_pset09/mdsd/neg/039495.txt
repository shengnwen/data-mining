I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read.  I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability.  The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it.  As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting.  I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable.
