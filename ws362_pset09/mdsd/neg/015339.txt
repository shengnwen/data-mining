Let's look at page 7.  The  author states that because traditional ceremonies often subordinate a woman's role in marriage, one might adapt the vows to highlight the symmetry of the relationship between husband and wife. As an example, she compares the standard Episcopal ceremony from the Book of Common Prayer 1945 with a modification that "still holds much of the tone of the original"  I beg to differ.  The former is a religious ceremony specifically mentioning God and Christ.  The later is not at all religious and does not mention God or Christ.  Thus, the tone of the original is completely lost on the modified version. It is interesting to note that there is not one mention of subodination of a woman in her role in marriage in the Book of Common Prayer example given. If the author wanted to give an example of taking religion out of the ceremony for the non-religious, that would have been fine. But calling the non-religious version a modification of a traditional ceremony to meet the needs of modern times was a farce.  I cannot believe a minister would even agree to participate in a ceremony using the modified version
