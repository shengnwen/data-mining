Well, there's a reason this book is a bargain.  One major and inexusable problem with it is that Philip Caputo failed utterly in his background research for this book.  It is quite obvious that he knows nothing about sailing, let alone sailing traditionally-rigged boats, and he chose to make up for that deficiency by making it up as he went along. With page after page of mangled terminology (you don't haul on SHEETS to raise sails!), poor charachter developement, and dubious plot, I just couldn't take it any more and gave up. It comes off as something that was knocked together in a weekend and sold on the basis of previous sucess.  This may sound a bit harsh, but I read several books a week and this is the only one in the past year or so that stands out as a truly bad book.  It looks like this is being marketed towards the sailing adventure story crowd, and if you're a fan of that genre, I would highly recommend looking elsewere
