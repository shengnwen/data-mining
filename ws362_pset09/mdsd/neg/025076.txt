The author of this book should have never received his degree. The book is very confusing and vaguely describes any mathematical process in arriving to its conclusions. An example of this is in chapter two where the author attempts to describe call blocking but ignores any input traffic to the system. The author obtains values from thin air and does not describe how the process used in obtaining the answers. This type of confusing gibberish is seen through out the book. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this book
