For a college profession thinking about choosing a text for this subject I urge you to skip this book. The book touches on many topics but does not explain them well. Examples are few and poorly explained. If a professor  uses the test bank questions accompanied with this book urge the students  to buy the study guide. Much of the material in the test bank questions is  not covered in the text in the necessary detail if at all. A student who  takes a test bank type test without the benefit of reviewing the study  guide first will be severely handicapped
