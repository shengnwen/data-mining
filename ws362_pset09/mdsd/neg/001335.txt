I am a huge Clyde Edgerton fan, and I'm sorry to say I was VERY disappointed with this book.  It just never seemed to get off the ground.  I was expecting the type of story that I fell in love with in *Raney* and *Walking Across Egypt* (both of which left me in tears, I laughed so hard). If you're looking for Listre, you're not going to find it in this book  Oh well, I guess I'll wait on his next one..
