This refers to the audio version only:

The wife has read the entire series one after the other and really enjoyed them.  Since I'm in the car for my job I listen to a lot of audio tapes.  I liked the story well enough, but the reader is terrible.  For some reason he thinks Banks' voice is deeper than whale dodo.  He strains to get the deepest possible register and frankly I found it very annoying.  I mean no one talks like that.  It may be that the reader has no confidence using his voice for femine characters, so he uses his regular voice for the female characters, then feels he has to go super low for the masculine.  I managed to get through the whole book but just barely.
I tried another of the Bank's series, but got so irritated at the unbelieveable voice I had to give it up.  If I ever get the time I'll have to read the series as I sort of enjoyed the story
