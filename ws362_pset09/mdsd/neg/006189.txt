As a profesional investment writer and editor myself, maybe I am fussy, but I couldn't believe how badly put together this book was.

Nice idea for a book though:  in the words of John Templeton, "There's always a bull market SOMEWHERE." 

The authors' thesis in Bull Hunter is that, for the next decade or so at least, that bull market won't be in US stocks.

Maybe so. And, some good alternatives are offered for consideration.

However, I found the book badly written and repetitve.  It could have benefitted tremendously from being properly edited.  Then I might not have become dizzy from going round in circles as I read.  

All in all, a disappointment
