Richard, there must be more info in all the research that you did.  I thought you would pick up where Anthony Sommers left off.  Hoovers faults were taken rather lightly instead of showing what an evil person he was-probably the most flagrant violator of civil rights this country has ever seen.  I do give you credit for the fact you did bring up-if you didn't tow his line , you were ostrasized.  His crime fighting skills were vastly overrated
