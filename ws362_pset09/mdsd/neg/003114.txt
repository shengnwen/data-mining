I used to really enjoy Mary Higgins Clark's books, but I get the feeling that the more successful she becomes, the more she's just phoning it in. This story was irritating on several levels, not the least of which was the author's trademark formulaicism that's becoming almost comical (the protagonist is beautiful and wealthy, ludicrous coincidences pile up until everyone but the reader believes she's guilty, etc.) I saw the ending coming a mile away, which you will too if you've read more than two of her books. And MHC's subtle bourgeoisie attitude is a bit offensive (when a villain is relaxing at home, you know he's a bad guy because his chair is made of "imitation leather," while the innocent main character has lovely European antiques distributed throughout her home.) Finally, MHC's characters are supposed to be young and modern-day, but not one of them speaks like today's young adults. This author's total inability to capture authentic language or everyday slang makes my suspension of disbelief even more difficult. More than one character uses the word "quarrel," more than one time each. How many native New Jerseyites in the year 2006 would ever just casually drop that word instead of "argue" or "fight"? Because of this tendency to inadvertently use language that was probably commonplace when MHC herself was young, conversations between the characters sound stilted and almost amusing. 

Overall, I can't say I recommend this book even as a beach read. If you're looking for a fast, fluffy but satisfying mystery, turn to her old work first (better ones that come to mind are "A Cry in the Night" and "Let Me Call You Sweetheart.") The things "No Place Like Home" feels it can get away with are, by the end, just too ridiculous to accept
