Just got done looking at some of the lovely pics in this trash of a book. Joseph Goebells and Julius Streicher would be proud!

I challenge the author/illustrator to provide one picture of a relocation center that has the type of high wire fencing as illustrated in this book. They can't! The relocation centers were surrounded with three-strand cattle wire that could be passed through at will (and regularly was!)

Any fencing remotely similar to what is portrayed in this book would have been at a Dept of Jutice Interment such as that at Crystal City, Texas for enemy aliens - or at Tule Lake, half of which became a segregation center for fanatical and disloyal Japanese Americans who daily engaged in Banzai drills while tooting on their Sears/Roebuck tin horns....

Guard towers? Each camp had one tower that served as a fire watch. Sure it could be used to hold a guard when militants were rioting, but the relocation centers had their own security composed of ethnic Japanese....

This entire history has become a big bucks business with your taxpayer dollars used to brainwash your kids. Cut the emotional crap like kids playing baseball and learn the real history. To so easily brush off the men forced to make tuff decisions in a time of war when the evidienced proved ethnic Japanese were a threat it WRONG!

P.S. I challenge any of you to provide one example of ethnic Japanese living previously in any country occupied by the Japanese Imperial Army that took up arms against the invaders! You can't! In every country they welcomed the Japanese invaders with open arms immediately started collabarating.

This book and all the pro-reparations books are mind-numbing propaganistic garbage
