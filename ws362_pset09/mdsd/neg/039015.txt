Overall, being the first book I've read on the CIA, I would say I learned a little bit from this book. It goes a long way to humanize the CIA, but at the same time criticizes them severely. Very little meat to this book, though. I'm sure that any other book about the CIA could give you just as much or even more information about the CIA's structure. 

Kessler clearly has a bias in favor of the FBI. The only parts of this book that seem to go into extensive detail are those about the former FBI director, Webster's administration. Kessler goes into extensive details about Webster and his assistants, but unfortunately, he jumps around so much I'm often not sure if he is talking about Webster at the FBI, Webster at the CIA, or both. Overall, I'm led to the impression that Webster was so favorably treated by this book (and not denigrated like the other directors) simply because he was a former FBI Director. Also, I'm really glad to read that Webster was given a stuffed FBI bear upon leaving the FBI in a book supposedly about the CIA. 

All the same, the book does definitely have some good parts, but it gets very repetitive at times especially when bringing up the mistakes of the CIA. It seems that Kessler had so very little factual information on the CIA that in order to write a full book about it, he had to include 80+ pages about the FBI and 50-60 pages of pure repetition. 

Still, it's not so terrible that I will throw it away or anything, but I'm really trying hard not to buy another book of Kessler's; I don't want to contribute any more money at all to his retirement.
