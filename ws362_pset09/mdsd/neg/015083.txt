I find myself in the minority with these reviewers.  "Emma" in this book is the same character as the "Shopoholic" series main character (whose name I have forgotten already).  

After reading the Shopoholic series, I was hoping to find a bit of something different in this book and I was disappointed.  

The "Emma" character is flaky, shallow and insecure and for the most part so untrue to herself that I find myself (same as in reading the "shopoholic" series) hoping that something horrid will happen to her because she's so annoying and unrealistic.  And yet, the great successful rich man falls in love with her for being her quirky honest self.  I sincerely believe in being honest in relationships too, I agree with the theme that you should be yourself and not settle, that was the best part of this book.  

However, I'm left feeling like the rich successful man wouldn't have fallen in love with her if she wasn't a (in her words fat) size six(which is a US size four).  Please.  It's always a lot more believeable that the man really likes her for who she is if the main character isn't so "perfect" physically.  

Good things about this book and author:  Good escapism, can read book in a day, good English references.  This is why I keep buying the author's books, perhaps hoping one of them will be more realistic.  So far hasn't happened.  But we all love reading some fantasy/fluff once in a while, and for that I'm grateful for this book.
