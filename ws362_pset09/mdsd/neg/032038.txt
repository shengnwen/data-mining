I'm not surprised that many of the reviewers here gave the books such high marks.  Their reviews, much like the book, are littered with misspellings and other inaccuracies.  Perhaps we can blame this on the evil Conservative Right-Wing establishment known as our education system....oh, wait....it's largely Liberal?  Holy cow.  Oh, sorry, a religious reference.  Shame on me
