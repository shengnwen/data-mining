I have watched these two for quite awhile and find myself, not only tiring of the endless re-runs, but of the two women advisers touching peoples' derrieres and bosoms.  They are rather snobbish, not very attractive women, who lost me completely when they pushed wearing hide-tight maternity clothes that made them look like blimps, they apparently never heard of a good hair cut and finally, the hideous recommendation that you wear a dress over a pair of slacks.  The posturing and face making when wearing something "wrong" is off-putting, silly, but not amusing.  
I am very glad I bought a copy from the new and used section of Amazon, I would have been quite cranky if I had paid full price
