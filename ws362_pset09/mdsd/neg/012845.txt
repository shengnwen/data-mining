Cruver opens his book from an ethical high horse, but his own actions make me wonder who he is to accuse others of greed. He has shown he can take the low road himself, by:

-- scheming to continue getting paychecks even though he was no longer earning them;
-- taking advantage of delays in shutting down the program to provide employees with free computer;
-- attempting to take out of the company the program he and his team developed;
-- spending his job-hunting time burning "free" CDs of downloaded music. (By the way, Brian, if you are listening in, I read a library copy of your book, so you have a reader for which you have received no incremental royalty.)

The unfortunate thing is that, to many of us, there is nothing wrong with taking advantage of an out-of-control benefits programs and downloading CDs instead of buying them. The differences are subtle, perhaps. But you should not steal from your employer, even if your employer has been underhanded. Under oath, before Congress, most Enron executives took the Fifth, implying that that they had done wrong and knew it. It seems to me that Cruver has done wrong and may not know it, which is even more tragic.

Ethics? I think Cruver has a lot to learn. Greed? He knows a bit about that, as a victim and as a perpetrator.
