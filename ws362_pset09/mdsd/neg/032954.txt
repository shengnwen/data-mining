After reading a good part of this book I am hopelessly lost. The examples are confusing, the terminology is shoddily explained, there is no glossary and it appears that many concepts of manufacturing are assumed to be known.
I am a novice and have no insight in manufacturing. While I do not doubt that this book is useful for the professional it is definitely the wrong book for the beginner. It probably will work as a reference book or resource for enhancing existing knowledge. I am forced to learn from this book. Unfortunately, the authors are experts in their field and may have not written a book for beginners intentionally.
Besides that, the mathematical notation of equations is plain horrible and often wrong. Any student in Calculus 101 would fail the class delivering equations in this form. The examples vary a lot while trying to explain one concept, which does not make understanding the concepts easy. If you are an instructor and think about using this book even for a graduate level course, be kind to your students and look for a different book
