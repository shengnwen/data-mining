I really wish I had read the book flap before buying this book.  Had I read that it had anything to do with NASCAR, I would have put it down and spent my $25+ on another book....my mistake.  The ONLY reason I actually read the whole book is because I did pay $25+ for it and just felt like I should.  It was not entertaining and just dragged on and on.  So, not only was it dull and slow, it was about NASCAR...a sport and subject that is just not my cup of tea.  I love the Stephanie Plum series and will continue to purchase Evanovich books in that series, but will not buy anything else
