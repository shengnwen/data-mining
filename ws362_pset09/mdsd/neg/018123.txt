I thought Tom Clancy was a  great writer after reading Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising. But this novel I found virtually impenetrable. It takes hundreds of apges for anything to actauly happen. Japanese men soaking in hot tubs discussing economics isn't my idea of a gripping read. And for the family killed in a car accident to we really need to know that the baby "did a job" beforehand? To me that's simply pointless detail that slows down the narrative to a crawl. And at 1000+ pages that style of writing is going to really wear a reader down. In all truth I skipped about half this book out of tedium.
