I usually don't buy a book until I borrow it from the library first and look it over, but people said such wonderful things about this cookbook that I bought it sight unseen. (I'm a flybaby and heard about it there.) My husband, who is pretty easy to please when it comes to cooking and usually compliments my food, was uncharacteristically silent after every meal I prepared from this cookbook.  At the end of the first week I was left with a turkey ham that was on the shopping list but never showed up in any of the recipes.  The next week, I made a stew that was too watery to qualify as stew, but too lumpy to be soup.  It looked so unappetizing that I threw it out and made something else. After a few more weeks of bland, mediocre meals made from sometimes difficult-to-find ingredients that my kids wouldn't eat, I tossed the book aside and eventually dropped it off at the VOA with a load of donations. I was disappointed that I couldn't use Leanne's cookbook in the way it was promoted. It fell way short of my expectations, which were based on all the praise it got from so many people.       
  
On the positive side, the concept of this cookbook is great.  I made a number of my own menus and shopping lists using recipes I found on the internet.  There are so many delicious, easy recipes on the internet...it's fantastic.  I am thankful to Leanne for the concept and for pushing healthy eating.  Obviously, she struck a chord with many families and is helping them eat better.  More power to them.
