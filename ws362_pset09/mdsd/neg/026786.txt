Typically, Tess Gerritsen (TG) has shown herself a decent writer ... nothing stellar but always competent and better than many of her peers.  However, she now apparently has an agenda to fulfill.  Whether it's self-imposed or her editor mandated it, TG has attempted to write a romance thriller.  And, unfortunately, in her crusade to complete this book she felt that she must constantly figuratively shove the following themes down the readers' collective throats.

- Women are strong and can serve in the same position as men
- Women have the added burden of child-bearing
- Catholic school upbringing is very tough, especially for women
- Other than a few studs sprinkled throughout the book, most of the men are criminals or ultimately heartless.  Oh yeah, there was one fat ex-cop who had a crush on Jane Rizzoli.

OKAY, Mrs. Gerritsen, we get it.  Most men are jerks!

Much of my problem with the book lies with the fact that I never was able to buy into several of TG's proposed premises.  The remotely potential love interest in the priest.  The ex-husband stud/suspect.  The crime itself, I could see why the coverup but I never understood --- did Octagon pay Dr. Sutcliffe to kill the people and, if indeed he was the sole killer, why would Sutcliffe, a doctor mind you, murder the victims using such gruesome methods?  And most embarassingly for my self, since I'd rather lost interest by this point, did Sutcliffe even do all of the killings?  It never made sense to me and seemed very slapped-together.

For the few readers who don't already know this, TG used to write romance thrillers.  This novel was more like a throwback to that genre.  I picked The Sinner up thinking it would be a concise, riveting thriller, instead, through mind-numbingly average writing, I was reminded for 342 pages how unreliable and underhanded my gender (male) always acts.

Sorry, TG, that's another premise I'm just not able to subscribe to
