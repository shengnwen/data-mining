Although I loved the paintings and the transparency, even I who have been painting watercolors for more than 10 years found the number of paints used are too many and, in trying to do them, found the demonstrations too complicated.  I remember an instructor saying that 3 colors to mix was enough.  I wouldn't recommend the book to a beginner
