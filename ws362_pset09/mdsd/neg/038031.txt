I was hired as a cable subcontractor last summer, under the assumption that the contract owner was going to make me his company manager and crew supervisor. Knowing more about public relations, marketing and journalism than management, I did what any good college student would do - I ordered some books and got to studying.

Michael Gerber's books sounded good in the summaries and had promising endorsements and blurbs on the jackets, but they were misleading. His books (Manager and Contractor) have little in the way of tangible methods and practices that you can jot down into notes and use. The book seemed to focus on anecdotes and points that were spread out over so many meaningless paragraphs that their consistency was almost that of vapor.

As I said, I tried taking notes. Or, more accurately, I sat there with a pad of paper and pen on the verge of jotting something down. None of it seemed worthy of the effort and what little of value there was was spread out over so many pages of verbosity that the undertaking would have been headache inducing.

This book, and his others, seem to be aimed at managers who need self-help assistance to fix their life away from management. In this case, the subtitles should read "The E-Myth Manger: Why your life sucks as a manager - and what to do about it" and "The E-Myth Contractor: Why most contractors' marriages don't work and what to do about it."

Seriously, these books are that bad
