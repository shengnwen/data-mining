This was the first book I read by Faulkner and did not leave a good impression at all. I was attracted by the concept, which was hardly adressed throughout the book. It is told through vignettes of different characters and their perception of what is happening, which is an amazing idea and I loved it greatly. However, I found that the book circled the "story" and "point" a lot, instead of keeping to it. A lot of the vignettes have no relevance but character development, which is good...just not when it interferes with the overall "story". I dragged my attention through this book, and regretfully the only parts that could intrigue me was the beginning and the end...the core was just a simple story of an eventless journey. I guess the best way to describe this story is: Imagine writing about a long family road trip...long, scenarically devoid, and dead. "As I Lay Dying" relates to the reader dying from boredom
