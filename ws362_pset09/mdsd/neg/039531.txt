I've read a lot of break up books since my break up.  This book was helpful, but not sure if it actually helped me?  Anyway, I found 2 sites...one for girls and for guys that ended up helping me because of the support groups. brokenheartedgirl.com and brokenheartedguy.com.  Sometimes you need to talk to people and they also recommend other books
