After reading the preceding review of Mariana Torgovnick's book, I have to say that it is refreshing to see my views shared by another scholar.  I agree that contemporary academic scholarship seems to be horribly behind the times.  If I may be so bold to read between the lines of Andrew's comments, I might add that this is certainly the problem with post-colonial studies today.  Post-colonialism, often synonymous with "multicultural studies" in academia, is quickly becoming a field whose views are revealing its own bias - and one that often shares a bias with colonialism.  We are living in a time where the "us/them" mentality - whether argued to the negative or positive -
lacks the ability to see the complexity of the real issue in cultural studies, not to mention the issue itself.  All that said, I certainly do not argue for imperialism as the alternative to post-colonialism; there is, _has been_ a more progressive arena of cultural studies that has become the new standard (for scholars) and new direction of cultural studies altogether.  For the sake of brevity, see Homi Bhabha's _Location of Culture_ for a description of this direction that rids us once and for all of this base (and inherently imperialist) "us/them" rhetoric
