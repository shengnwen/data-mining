I was hoping this book would provide insights into how to present complex information in a more comprehensible, useful format, using PowerPoint as the tool. Instead, the overall gist of this book is that presentations should be "dumbed down" as much as possible. The theme the author presents is that presentations should be story based. This is reasonable. However, the method the author recommends is that essentially *all* meaningful, complex (or, as the author prefers "boring") content be removed from the presentation. Presentations then become nothing more than catchy headlines and colorful graphics. All content should be in the presenter's notes (not typically to be provided). This is juvenile and useless and frankly reflects a complete lack of understanding of how presentations are made in a complex business environment.
