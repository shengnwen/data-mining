Or maybe "Weekend with Jesus and the Girls". I get very frustrated when authors don't tell you up front that a book that sounds as if it is for every woman is actually full of religious messages. My girlfriends and I would no sooner pray over each other than eat "cheese and crackers" on "hoity toity night" or pack fake doggie doo or a whoopee cushion for laughs! 

It doesn't take all of the psychological manipulation of your sisters that they describe in this book to create strong female bonds. The truth comes naturally and doesn't require scheduled sessions of prayer, nor does it require scripted questions that are meant to break someones spirit and build an artificial need for the group. Plan your own weekend... and just have fun
