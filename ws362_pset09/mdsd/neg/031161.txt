A Very disappointed read! I grew up in NYC (Manhattan) and had heard about the 500 Club from my Father, friends and relatives. This book did not do it justice. I could not even stay focused on this it was soooooo boring at times. Unlike Atlantic City should have been in those times. To give the book some credit there were a few interesting tidbits about Joe Di Maggio, Toots Shor, and Sinatra and Crew! It was nothing I could not have learned watching Biography
