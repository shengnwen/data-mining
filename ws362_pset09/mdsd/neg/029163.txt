I cannot believe all the 5 star reviews for this book. If you want to read a book filled with graphic descriptions of child abuse, then this book is for you. I am a DS fan, but I was shocked and disturbed by this book. BUT, perhaps that's what DS wanted to achieve, and if so, she succeeded. But for me, I will stick to her other, uplifting stories that are not so brutal
