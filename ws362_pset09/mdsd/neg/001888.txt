I could not use this book for a reference. The content is to brief. This book is like a novel, Once you've read it, your're done, and will never go back read it again.  The pictures inside is also very poor, some even  completely can not be read. I bought this book because I wanted to know  about web site security. But the security chapter only (briefly) discuss on  several types encryption. This book should not titled as Web Programming  Methods
