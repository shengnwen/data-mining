It is amazing that a writer with the skill to craft Hyperion, after that crafts a book like Ilium and Olympus.

The good thing about Ilium and Olympus is the amount of ideas mr. Simmons has in his story. Combining Homer's Iliad with literary robots from Jupiter and 'Gods' on Mars' Olympos that use quantum and nanotechnology, what could be cooler? Even in his worst books Simmons has more ideas, literature and vivid imagination than most average science fiction writers have in their life. 

However, the execution of this book is plain horrific, especially with Hyperion in my mind, that that in my opinion is one of the best science fiction books ever written. The biggest problem in my regard is the lack of motive. Characters in the book just have no motive to do the things they do. 

* Spoiler alert *

Some examples of events for which no motives is given.

- Professor Hockenberry stays with the Greek troops while they are loosing, he can be hit and die every minute, they don't like him or accept him and he can choose to teleport and have sex with the most beautiful woman of earth. Why did he want to stay? 
- Why did Prospero send Harman on a senseless thousands mile walk when his race badly needed him. Just for the submarine, after which he almost died and about which he could do nothing? 
- Why did the evil monsters with almost eternal power that even could wreck the whole solar system just go away, even without putting up a fight. "Because it was rumored that the silent one was comming"? Give me a break. 
- Why was Ilium transported to the future? 
- Why was Moira revived and why did she ever went to sleep anyway? She could virtually live forever with the hospitums and she didn't need a body anyway. Again no reason. 
- Why did Setebos remove all humans from the old earth and put them in a tachyon beam in current earth? 
- Why, after aeons of their lifestiles do Harman and Ada want to start a family and suddenly have current day ethics? 
- Why would robots be programmed to love poetry and need centuries for studying only one writer. 

* End Spoiler Alert *

Besides not having motives the characters are very shallow. You have no idea what goes on in the mind of the Gods or in the heroes like Achilles. They never feel fear, nor are enthusiastic about anything. They just do stuff because they do or because it is written by Homer. All the Gods act the same, all the "ancient" people act the same, all the "new" people except for a mild variation Harman act the same. 

Furthermore, there is no real danger. Mr. Simmons fell into the trap of putting lead characters in infinite danger, but always be saved in the last second. Yuck. 

Then there is the issue of style. To make future beings probable they talk this pseudo-science all the time. Sentences are filled with "nano", "quantum", "brane" so much that it is clear that mr. Simmons tries to show off that he knows something about these scientific concepts. While I have the feeling he doesn't, really. Furthermore, these beings communicate with others of which they know they cannot know anything about these concepts, but just keep on talking the same way. And all characters do that. Plain ridiculous. 

Also the literary reference, Simmon's trademark, is done really badly here. The references (mostly Shakespeare) go nowhere, he even throws in a mediocre poem of his wife. It all seems very forced and totally irrelevant. What a shame.

And don't let me even start on the anti-Islam and anti-gay references that come out of nowhere. Why?!?

To conclude, I really cannot recommend this book. If you just want to be shortly amused and don't care about quality you can read it. If you want to read some good science fiction I'd recommend to read Hyperion and possibly Endymion from the same writer. Those are terrific, great, splendid. The Ilium / Olympos is unworthy to be even in those books' shadow.

Please, PLEASE, mr. Simmons, start writing high quality Science Fiction again
