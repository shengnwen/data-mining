I bought this book becuase I read Lets Get Real or Lets Not Play by Mahan Khalsa and was very intruiged by it.  Lets Get Real is a TERRIFIC book.  Little did I know that BusinessThink is basicly the coles notes version of Lets Get Real with two other names plunked above his.  There is little additional value added here.  If you want to get the same material but more of it and better presented, buy Lets Get Real
