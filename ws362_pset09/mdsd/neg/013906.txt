I have no idea where Warner dredged up these desperate, anxiety ridden mommies fretting over Baby Einstein and private schools. As a stay home mom, by choice, I resent the implication that all women who choose to stay home are mired in a unfulfilled tedious life. And as far as these crazy women running themselves ragged - Ladies, you made a CHOICE to book your kids into a gazillion activities. My children are at their most creative with a few blankets, the kitchen table and some cardboards boxes. Remember making kitchen table forts on rainy days? And I am pretty well convinced neither of my kids are going to end up mentally impaired, at the bottom of their class or having their college admission applications rejected because I wasn't tutoring them in conversational Japanese rather than coloring in a color book together each afternoon. And if the childcare system/motherhood support system is so great in France, then move back to France! Encouraging the US government to provide some pie in the sky support is naive and short sighted. Instead, look to cultivating your community and embracing your neighbors as friends and helpmates rather than competition. Making true connection with others in community is a rare and splendid thing. Here on planet Earth, despite the anxious paranoid feeling we are all supposed to be feeling, the Joneses don't give a hang if we drive a Mercedes and they  really aren't out to get us
