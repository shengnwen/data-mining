Flayderman's has not revised gun values since 2001.  They put a date on the reverse of the fly page of 2004, but it just a re-print of the one compiled in 2000 and printed in 2001.  I hope others are not fooled like I was thinking they are getting an updated book.  I feel I wasted my money.  Gun values have changed too much in the last few years, and I find this book worthless
