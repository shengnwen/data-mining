Those of us old enough to be familiar with a range of "rabbit classics" immediately realized, I am sure, that The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane is a cobbled together rip-off of several classics. The most obvious, of course, is the "Velveteen Rabbit," who makes his sad journey toward being a "real rabbit." But, of course, DiCammillo makes Edward Tulane a CHINA rabbit with velvety ears, rather than a velveteen bunny, and his owner a little girl instead of a little boy. The book and its illustrations are even packaged to "look like" a Velveteen Rabbit-type classic. In short, a "classic knock off."

   Then, of course, there is the fact that he is a jauntily dressed bunny who owns a pocket watch. Remember Alice in Wonderland/Through the Lookingglass? Bunny with waistcoat and pocketwatch.

   And let's not forget the movie "Harvey," in which there is the very vain invisible rabbit who is six feet tall. Dicamillo compromises and makes Edward 3 feet high. 

    Oh, yes, and then there's "Watership Down," the bunny tale for older readers that recounts a harrowing rabbit journey and includes much dark violence. 

    Dicamillo seems determined to throw in everything that seems to be a "sure seller," from ripping off classic elements, to weaving in violence, and finally, religious elements. 

    In short, "Miraculous Journey" is a fine example of today's publishing philosophy:  Packaging and marketing are everything, content (and originality) are distant seconds
