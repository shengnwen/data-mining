This book is amateur stuff...clearly written by a non-professional.  The book includes the supplements Dirgo took, but not the dosages of each.  This is critical.  I followed the regime for over 3 months at doses recommended by an "expert" in supplements at a health food store.Three months later, I still had Hashimoto's, I was just hundreds of dollars poorer for it.  Who knows if it will work or not if you don't tell readers what dosages to take.  I realize he is not a doctor, but he could still have provided more detail about his own treatment.  He claims that he will respond to e-mails.  My e-mails asking for this information were never responded to. Don't waste your money or get your hopes up with this book!  The book is mostly blank pages anyway
