My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.

Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.

Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.

TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up
