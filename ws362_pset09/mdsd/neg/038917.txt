Dr. Lande has poorly researched the aspects of Civil War, preferring instead to demur to general logistics, rather than in-depth perusal of legitimate history.  His writing resembles that of a high school report, with poorly constructed sentences, run-on phrases, choppy verbosity and a verbal cadence that approaches boredom.  The true battlefield in the book is the one between the author and his lack of writing expertise.  Read it with a grain of salt, and spare your wits for much better treatises on Civil War history
