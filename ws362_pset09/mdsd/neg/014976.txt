I have red this book and I think this book compleatly mislead people about Buddhism and Sri Lankan comunity. For a person who wants to find out more about Sri Lanka and Buddhism (The truth I mean) there are lots of books. I think that the Tamils who started the war and whole word knows it. Buddhists are normally peaceful people and Tamil Tigers and people who support them like this one hate Buddhists.....Please get a life...
