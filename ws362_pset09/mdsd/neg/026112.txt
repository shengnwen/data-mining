This book was clearly for beginners only.  Although the book says "for dummies", you'd really HAVE to be a dummy to get much out of this.  The book is simply too vague when talking about important internet concepts and doen't show you how to REALLY get an online business going.  I personally would reccomend 33 Days to Profits by Yank Silver  www.33daystoprofits.com as a much better way to get PRACTICAL advice on starting an online business
