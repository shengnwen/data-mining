Flannery O'Connor's novel is a blending together of nine short stories, all independent of one another working together to achieve a common goal.  In my opinion, if I have read 155 books in my life, this book does not make the top 150.  No single story was very appealing, making it nine slow starts and nine mediocre finishes.  To give a more objective view of the book, it was written in a third person omniscient point of view.  O'Connor takes a somewhat cynical approach toward each of her characters.  In their descriptions, the flaws of each character are pointed out rather than the virtues.  These are some of the more obvious styles that O'Connor uses.  In the stories, various devices are used.  Among these are flashback, imagery, and hyperbole.  Each of these individually contributes to the overall story.  Without these devices, the point O'Connor was trying to make would not be as solid.  The overall theme in the book seen throughout the stories is a need for personal change.  Each protagonist goes through a series of events and detailed descriptions of what is wrong with everyone else, only to point the finger at themselves at the end.  The moral of this is that rather than trying to pin our problems on others, maybe we should take responsibilities for our own flaws.  If from what I have said you still wish to read the book, by all means, go ahead.  Many people have liked this book, but I am quite convinced, it is not my style
