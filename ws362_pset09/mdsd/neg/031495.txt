If one reads this, they might do it with one of those foam collars about their necks that people use for whiplash, because that is precisely how you will feel when you finish this work.  It's not bad enough the writer gets SO many facts wrong, out of order or does about faces on her own statement - it's a marathon of WRONG - she actually and consistently contradicts herself!  One can write a small book on the errors this author carelessly makes.

Take this as TOTAL FICTION and you MIGHT enjoy it.  If you are looking for a feel for the period, look elsewhere.  Save your money - and the headache!  To see a writer do so much research and get it ALL so wrong, jumping around in chronological order with the consistency of a ping pong ball, had to be a fine madness. 

I don't think someone could deliberately set out to get something so wrong and do half a thorough job as Murray did
