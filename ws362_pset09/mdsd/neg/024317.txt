Although the book has some good tips I had trouble getting started and once I did well lets put it this way i did not stick with it for long. The only reason I am keeping the book is because it list alot of foods and how much protein, carb, fat information is in them. They hype the book up and I fell in hook line and sinker. I guess that old saying applies right about know " If it sounds to good to be true Etc...." 40 carb 30 protien 30 fat dont cut it. But I did figure out how to loose weight and keep it off; Its simple I got off my lazy butt started to excersise ate better and walla 10lbs lighter and working for more AND HERES THE CATCH ITS FREE walking 30min and common sense tells you wich foods in your fridge are good and bad for you
