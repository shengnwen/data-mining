This book was suggested to me by one of my co-workers with whom I frequently debated different topics.  I picked it up with slight hesistation because of differences of opinion between the two of us.
While Harris addresses several issues within this book, I often felt that he moved between cause's too quickly.  Instead of addressing one cause and demonstrating it's impact on the myth completly, he tends to introduce the point, and then just as quickly move on to the next point with out finalizing his point.
I think I may have enjoyed the point a bit more had he followed through on his points a bit more.
The other issue I had with this book boiled down to Harris' writing style.  While reading the book, I felt as though every other sentence was "I believe", "I will demonstrate", "I propose", etc.  It should be understood that these are the authors points, that is why his name is on the cover.  The inclusion of these phrases detracted from the reading of this book while adding nothing to the subject at hand.  The book also seemed to be written as a teaching aid to a college class in the regards that at the end of the chapters, it felt as if there was no conclusion reached....almost that the book was written to introduce thoughts and to promote speculation by the readers, without taking a stance on the issues at hand.
Overall, this book had the potential to be a real page turner, but the authors questionable writing style made it almost unreadable, at least for this reader
