Jenn and Sunny, I mean. I have never met a woman like either of them. (And I've been friends with females, and been one myself, for my entire life!) Jenn is a promiscuous, ambitious weathergirl/newscaster who will sleep with anyone to get ahead, but who has no interest in current affairs, her industry or the goings-on at her own station. Huh? (Towards the end of the book, Jenn reports having heard about the resolution of Jesse's case "on the news," an odd choice of words for a woman who theoretically spends hours each day in a news room.) Yet, like Susan in the Spenser books, every man, woman and child who meets her admires her and likes her. Okeedokee. Then we have Sunny. Bright, attractive and self-reliant, she remains in love with her ex-husband Richie, even though he has remarried and has a baby on the way (at least his wife was pregnant in a recent Sunny novel; no mention of it here). Why can't she move on? Does the Good Lord need to write IT'S OVER on her forehead? Even better, Parker has these two women, who are sharing the same man, spend enormous amounts of time together and even become fond of one another. The former is highly implausible, the latter rings completely false.

Also, who is paying Sunny for her time protecting Jenn? She's doing all this for Jesse? For sisterhood? For free?

The central mystery of the book -- the murder of a radio/TV personality -- captured my imagination. Especially because the killers believed the cops in Paradise, MA, are all yahoos and easy to fool. I enjoyed the scenes in the police station and when law enforcement is on the trail of the killers.

But the misogyny and complete lack of credibility with which Jenn and Sunny are treated is disturbing
