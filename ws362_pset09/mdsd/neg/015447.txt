This book the Author and the cards are entirely missing the point.
I wasted my money.
Three words boring,static,uninspired.
The cards are rediculous. The picture of the child in the Major-Arcana "Sun" card looks like the Author----Very disturbing and neurotic.
The analysis is nothing that has not been said before but more arrogant and unpersonal. Exactly what Tarot is not...
Why is this guy famous? Not for me to answer i guess
