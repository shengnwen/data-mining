I downloaded a copy of this book from Itunes for my ipod. He was hard to understand. I don't think we need to know all about History. A little background information would have been enough. It was repetitive. He was abrasive and annoying. I did agree with who marketers are ignoring but these marketers aren't listening. Mainly this just kind of repeats what he has done in the past
