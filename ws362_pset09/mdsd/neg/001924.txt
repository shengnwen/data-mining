This book should be avoided because it really lacks too many terms and thus serves no purpose.  People who want a literary terms dictionary probably only want ONE since they are specific and who in their right mind wouldn't want a COMPLETE one?!?

In the preface the author even states that he only picked the most used definitions but again I ask the question why??  Another problem Baldick has is his word selection.  Anybody with any business or need to pick this book up probably won't need to look up words such as: act, argument, character, climax, closure, content, etc..

I did use this book to study for the English CSET exams parts I and II and I can recommend it for that.  Seeing how little there is out there to study with, I can honestly say this book did help to some degree with my preparation for the test.

Bottom Line:  After perusing vairous LT dictionaries, I have come to the conclusion that going to the bookstore is the best method for choosing what you want.  You probably won't want to pick this one
