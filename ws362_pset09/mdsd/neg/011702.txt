After reading EATS SHOOTS and LEAVES, I was anxious to read these three comic novels by Lynn Truss.   She goes from being hilariously funny to going on and on like someone detached from reality.  With only the first of these "comic novels" to pass judgment upon,  I would be sure that this author is schizophrenic; or, at least schizoid.  I'm disappointed in Ms. Truss and would not recommend this "Treasury" to anyone.   Eats Shoots and Leaves  is a classic which any and all "wordsmiths" appreciate
