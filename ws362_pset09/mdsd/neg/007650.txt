After the third or fouth factual error (I teach Ethernet technologies) and the fifth or sixth typesetting error (missing or partial paragraphs) I finally tracked down the publishing house and told them of my disappointment.  They sent out another book (without the typesetting errors), but it didn't set my mind at ease about the factual errors
