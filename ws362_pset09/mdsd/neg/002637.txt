This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one.  Besides, some of it is just plain wrong.  To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:

"In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general."  

Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity.  He attributes to them, two "liberal" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with.
