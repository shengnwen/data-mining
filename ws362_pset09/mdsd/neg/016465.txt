I read this book I don't remember how many years back. I think about 15 years ago. And just remembering makes me nauseous, for the amount of time and effort it took me read it just to get to no point. I was younger, naiver and I got engaged, I confess that. Clever Author no doubt, to make a huge pile of unrelated ideas and make believe you would get somewhere following his lead. Just wandering around and playing with analogies. I had the time back then, I guess. Today I only have the time to write a review stating how surprised I am today I could finish this kind of book. I can't speak for anyone else, suffice to say I was a nerd with a lot of time in my hands
