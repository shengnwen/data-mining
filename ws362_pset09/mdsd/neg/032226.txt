I found this book for the most part to be pretty much a bore. Not without a few stories that did make me grin a bit. But, It is hard to take anyone seriously who writes in print that William Wyler directed "Patton".
I mean...that should come as news to Franklin J. Schaffner! That was just one of many. I would have red-penciled the copy I read but why bother! ...The other stories...well.... enough already! I think it's time for Ms. Streisand to pen her on story.
