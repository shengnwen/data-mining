Bell is definitely a lawyer...not a novelist. His characters are stereotypical in every essence and not very well developed. I found myself disliking each of the characters more and more as they stumbled through their own journeys of typical and unimaginative self-discovery. The twist at the end of the book was not very believable nor was the storyline well developed. Overall, I would not recommend.
