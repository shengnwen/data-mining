This book is good, but the book's content doesn't match the title. This book wasn't written for people who have never owned any piece of property. The book tells you a couple of nice loopholes and hidden fees most first time landlords will get hit hit with out the blue, but that is it! They have whole sections about owning 30 and 40 resident apartment buildings which is something 9 out of 10 people that read this book will not be doing for years. A lot of the advice that they give such as get a lawyer and someone to look at the property before you buy it is common sense. This book also doesn't go into great detail about taxes and how to set the correct rent level like I thought it would. This book is good for a general overview, but that is about it
