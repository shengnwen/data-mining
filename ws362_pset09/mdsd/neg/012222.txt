this book makes a point and drives it home over and over (and over) again.  While it was a stunning revelation that restricted communities were actually the norm during the first half of the 20th century, rather than the exception, the author pounded it home without speaking about the repercussions of such covenants: Inner cities destroyed, ghettoization, crime, and life in the burbs turned out to be a dubious gift, at best.  America is now plagued with obesity, depression, pollution, and all around stupidity, because of moving people so far apart from each other and the services they need to live.  
This author could have well spent more time looking at the bigger picture, rather than beating us with one fact
