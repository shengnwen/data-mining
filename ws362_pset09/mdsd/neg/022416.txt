I have to agree with the reviewer named jrubi02 on this novel. I too am a fan of historical mysteries, and this work, while not without promise, was disappointing. As the other reviewer noted, the catapulting of the main character from a rural servant to being at the center of Tudor intrigue in no time is just too hard to believe. I couldn't get past that basic premise. Additionally, the brazen attitude the main character uses to win the confidence of both future Tudor queens is hackneyed, as is the romantic plot thread. 

The author does a nice job of portraying the historical period and is apparently learned in the history of the time. Morevoer, his enthusiasm for his subject is obvious. However, as much as I enjoy the historical characters portrayed in the book, I lost patience with it and didn't finish it. I know the author frequents these Amazon pages, and I hope he will take my critique in the spirit in which it is offered
