This book reminds me of a false advertisement: pick it up and it sounds interesting, even those first crucial lines pull you in and then... Then we are pulled along on a tortuous journey into a writer's ego.  This book is written in the kind of style that you want to be beautiful, even lyrical - Instead it's more often confusing.  By page 17 I was skipping forward in hopes that it became more compelling.  There is a languid air to Mr. Jordan's writing, which is fine as long as we care about what happens or why.  Why the main character is killed by her childhood friend (no suprises, we know the killer's name on page one)is perhaps the clearest paragraph and half of the book. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until page 268, by then I was just glad to be done with it all.

Mr. Jordan's screenplays are wonderful, but this book is pure self-indulgence.
