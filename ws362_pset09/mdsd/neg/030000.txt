This book is a disgrace to scholarship. The author muddles the entire subject by using the Roman names for the Greek deities. This is simply unacceptable in this day and age. It is disrespectful to the cultures of the ancient societies that produced these sacred stories. It is scandalous that a reputable publisher would have allowed such a travesty into print. As a university instructor of children's literature courses for thirty years, this is the absolute worst book on this topic I have ever read. Avoid it
