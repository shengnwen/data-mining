At the same time I also ordered Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child which turned out to be much more informative and useful.  I was exhausted with my 3 month old waking up 5-6 times a night for the pacifier to be replaced in his mouth.  I would nurse him 1-2 times when he wouldn't go right back to sleep.  I couldn't bear to hear him cry and would always attend to him immediately.  Elizabeth Pantley's suggestions were really not anything different than I had been doing.  I tried not picking him up and he was fine as long as someone put the pacifier back in his mouth.  For my son's sleep problems her method really isn't feasible when you are so exhausted.  I strongly recommend Dr. Richard ferber's book " Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems".  This book made the most sense and informs you about infant sleep patterns.  Our very simple solution was to take away his pacifier.  It was hard for me to do but he was 4 months old at this point and I was desperate.  Turns out it was not anywhere near as hard as I thought it was going to be on him.  He cried for about an hour before falling asleep and I would comfort him in his crib every ten minutes.  It took him about 2 days to learn how to fall asleep alone without it and he has been much happier since.  He no longer has fragmented sleep and is much happier when he wakes up.  His book also explains how to wean them off of wanting to be rocked to sleep in your arms or nursed to sleep.  It involves some crying but not ignoring them.  As a first time mom I did not like the idea of ever letting my baby cry but after reading these books and my experience has proved that a little crying is ok and NOT harmful.  It is actually not in the best interest of your child after 3 months to always pick them up so that they never learn how to fall asleep on their own.  My son went from waking up 5 times a night to sleeping throught the night 8-12 hours over the past 8 weeks.  He is now 6 months old and sleeps really well. My experience FWIW
