I would have rated in 5 stars for the quality of the story, but now that I know the majority of it has elements of untruth, it gets one star, and only because I can't rate it any lower.  He also left out a lot of things, like at least one marriage.  How do you forget THAT?

Based on the things that came out later, he probably should have been IN Riker's Island, not running it.  He sounds like someone who gets promoted because nobody likes them and there isn't enough on them to get them fired
