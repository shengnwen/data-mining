I bought this book last fall and finally threw it away in frustration.  The recipes simply don't work.  I've spent hour after hour on these (often curiously complicated) recipes, only to throw out batch after batch.  As an accomplished home baker, I haven't had results this consistently bad since I was a kid learning to bake.  It's too bad, too, since these recipes sound so great on paper..
