I selected this book based on the awesome reviews.  It sounded like everything I needed to know about real estate investing, in a simplistic format.  Within a few chapters, I found the book to be very condescending (i.e.; Basically....if you're too stupid to understand this calculation, real estate investing is not for you).

Since I am a beginner and not a math major, I did not expect to whizz right through all of the calculations.  But I also did not expect a negative tone with no support that made me not want to read it further.  So, I bought REAL ESTATE INVESTING FOR DUMMIES.  I found it significantly more helpful.  It does point out warnings and says that if you're not comfortable with possible negative cash flow, then maybe real estate investing is not right for you at this time.  It also weighed the stability of real estate investing in comparison to stocks.  I found the Dummies book much better suited to the beginner while detailing pros and cons, instead of being a pain to read.
