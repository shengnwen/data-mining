I am a wedding planner and an instructor at the local college. I was looking for a book to use as a "textbook" for the wedding planner class and based on previous editions (I own the 2nd, 4th, and 5th editions), I chose the sixth edition for my class before actually reading it. I thought this book was the Bible of wedding planning. Beverly Clark is one of the most renowned wedding experts out there and always has written very thorough and detailed books. I must say I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with the latest edition however. The book took out several chapters, left out key information, and inserted very little new information other than references to their new website, where the reader is forced to be exposed to their annoying banner advertising.
Despite my previous enthusiasm for Beverly Clark, I must say I would NOT recommend this book. There are so many others out there to choose from. I must say, if you are a bride, you should go to a bookstore and choose one that suits you and your wedding style, rather than purchasing from a website, where you can't really tell what the book is like
