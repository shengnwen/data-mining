This book does live up to its name as a "Comprehensive Guide"  It addresses nearly every possible counseling issue.  In my opinion, however, it is as the previous reviewer noted, "too Integrationist"  Rather than build a view of the total person from the Scriptures up, as Jay Adams, Neil Anderson, and others have attempted, this book "integrates" secular pyschology with Christian ideals.  For example, one of the primary tenents of secular psychology is that you do not give advice or correct the patient (p567).  On the other hand, a Biblical view of sanctification would show that correction from others is part of the growth process. 

Overall, the author does seem to write from an evangelical perspective and as such I am not trying to say that this book has no value, or that there are not valid insights in it, however, I do think that others who have tried to build counseling from the bottom up have produced something which is ultimately more valuable to the life of the Church. I would recommend anything from the Biblical or "Nouthetic" counseling movement started by Jay Adams as a first pass at this very challenging subject.
