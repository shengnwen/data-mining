There is no curse to the Kennedy family.  It is just pure and simple the whole Kennedy clan is evil and they have been evil for the last 150 years.  

What i can't understand is why do people like JFK?  He is actually the worse one of all of 'em.  The down fall of america all started with him.  By down fall i mean the morals of the american people started to drop when JFK was president and americans for some reason love him.  I guess it's like making a pack with Satan.  I don't feel sorry for any of them, especially Ted who is just a useless drunk
