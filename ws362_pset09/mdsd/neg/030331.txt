 I thought that I would love this book because I am interested in JFK. 
	
What I found was a lousy book that spent much of it detailing Kennedy's political career and leaves out or does not go into much detail about significant events that happened to him while in Political Office. Also much of the info can be found in numerous other books about JFK or the Kennedy Family with little new information.

I was also disappointed about his discussion about the assassination. After all this time and all the information out there the author still thinks that Oswald killed JFK.

If you are interested in JFK, this might not be the book for you
