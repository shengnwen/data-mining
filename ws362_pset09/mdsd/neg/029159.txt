Maybe my lack of enjoyment in this book was my own fault.  I thought it would be a snappy narrative encouraging me to buy and read some excellent books, but I found it a bit dull.  I don't live in England and had never heard of most of the books Hornby mentioned.  Furthermore, I didn't find his random musings as fascinating as I'd expected.  Perhaps if I'd read these articles one month at a time as published I would have found them easier to digest
