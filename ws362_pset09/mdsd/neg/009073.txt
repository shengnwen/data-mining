I've always enjoyed Sara Paretsky's novels, despite the left-wing preaching. In the past this has been subordinated to character & plot. But not here. There's not much plot -- a few elements here & there -- & it never really drives the story. Far too much space is given to the standard left-wing caricature of the rich & the repetitive, boring stereotyping of 'family values' as just so much plutocratic hypocrisy. Ms Paretsky, we _know_ you hate the American rich, & they're probably as hideous as you paint them to be. But here they're just cardboard cut-out characters. And of course the book is just a long, boring wait to see just how the filthy rich committed the crime & how they'll get away with it. Plus the satisfying way in which the horrible rich are (once again) forced to cough up the money they at first (of course) refused to give. This is getting tedious.
