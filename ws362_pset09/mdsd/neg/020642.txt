This book was witty and a great reference for all things mid-century and female-oriented, but beyond that wasn't much of anything.  Homosexuality is never really covered in regards to women and doesn't really analyze or comment on things or even try to understand the why behind it: the book is just sarcastic in a rather juvenile sense.  The best part of the whole book is when Peril indicts Betty Friedan for being a part of the pink think problem.

I actually got the impression from the book that if you happen to be a contemporary female who is feminine, you're evil.  And that is sad
