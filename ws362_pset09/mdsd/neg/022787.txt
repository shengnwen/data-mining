This book is not about how to do yoga. It is not for a beginning yoga student. It is probably of interest more to the yogini who has been practicing for some time and is now pregnant. It may be of interest to Iyengar followers as the photos are all of Iyengar's daughter when she was days before delivering her boy. This is a philosphy book, not a how-to book. The prose is spaced more like poetry so there isn't a lot of content in this book
