Capitalizing on his popular Left Behind books, Mr. Lahaye and his associate give a concise summary of their view of the end times. Slight nods are given to the other two dominant viewpoints on eschology, but the only one truly covered is the premil view. Though highly biased, the final page, ironically, is rather helpful, giving sage advice and encouragement to all Christians.
