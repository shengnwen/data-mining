This book is an enjoyable read if you have nothing better to do.  I failed to be captivated by it.  The characters lack the heartwrenching dramatic intensity that you find in her other works.  Maybe it is because Alice Walker is such a phenominal author that people just expect so much from her.  Still, this book is NOT making the cut for my personal library
