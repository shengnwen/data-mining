How to read this book: 
Cut each of the 240 pages exactly in half with an exacto blade.
Read the top (or bottom) half of any page combined with the bottom (or top)half of any other page.
Write a review lauding the "originality" of this book.

Example, bottom of page 159:
     "Although one of the popes made Galileo take back every word he said, as well. 
     Meantime my period and I still remain no distance at all from each other, presumably.
     Well, or the pain in my left shoulder and I, similarly.
     Perhaps I have not mentioned the pain in my left shoulder.
     I have mentioned it."

Page 108, top:
      "Although some few happened to be of the Via Vittorio Veneto, which is almost directly below the Borghese Gallery.
     The reverse of that statement being equally true, by the way.
     Now that I think about it, I may have worn that soccer shirt all the way to Paris, even.
     Doubtless I stopped sitting on the other shirts after the rest of my own garments dried, however."

Anyone who claims to have read this book in any other fashion - sequentially from the first to the last page, for example - is lying.
