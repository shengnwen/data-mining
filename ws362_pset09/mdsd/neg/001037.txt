If your teaching a class on feminist political correctness this is the book for you.  This book provides lots of racial, ethnic, geographic and sexual identity diversity, but its pretty thin on the great book part.  The  overwhelming majority of the 500 books are from the 20th Century and yet  there is not one reference to Gina Berriault that I could find.  Perhaps  her political credentials were not good enough; all she can do is write  great fiction.  If you really want to read a great book written by a woman,  then read The Lights of Earth, or Women in Their Beds by Gina Berriault
