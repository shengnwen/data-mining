This book's "scientifically proven" findings made me think it would contain something really life-changing or unheard-of. On the contrary, the book's advice couldn't be more cliched.  Niven never says anything of real depth or quality. You don't learn. Each chapter is too short. As a result, the topics are way underdeveloped. Another problem: some chapter titles just don't relate to the content that follows. One that stands out especially is, "Turn off the TV." So turning off the television is REALLY going to make me happier?! Niven's point might be that doing so translates to quality time spent with family, friends, or simply oneself, but why target just TV? When I read the title, I anticipated reading about studies showing that TV viewing leads to increased incidence of depression, but no, that's not it at all. The chapter really has nothing to do with TV. Other chapters are similarly problematic.

A far better book--MUCH better--is "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff," by Richard Carlson, a book that truly changed my outlook and approach to everyday problems, and for me that's saying A LOT. That book makes you think and constantly presents a perspective the reader might never have considered.
