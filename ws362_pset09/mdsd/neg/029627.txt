This is basicly a book of lists--websites to visit, stuff to buy, etc.  Aside from the fact that 90% of this information is available for free, a surpising amount is, well, just plain obvious.  If you're not good at accounting, hire an accountant.  You'll do more business if you accept credit cards.  Good tips!  Its also rather out of date and BTW, my copy had no CD.  

I note that the same author has written Internet Auctions For Dummies, another vexing subject.  Now if I only had Returning Books To Amazon For Dummies....

I did find a very good book which is just as basic but takes a logical, chronological, step-by-step approach, How To Start A Home Based Mail Order Business by Georganne Fiumara.
