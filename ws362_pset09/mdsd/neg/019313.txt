Only with great difficulty could one improve upon the May 1, 2005 Amazon review of this book by W. Christie -- a thoroughly competent and even brilliant review. But some readers may not have the patience to read through it.

Therefore in this review allow me simply to summarize the gist of this book's core fallacy, a fallacy so central and deeply fundamental that it discredits the entire book.

This core, devastating error is that Braden childishly ties together (a) letters used to represent DNA coding (which originated with scientists using English, which is not related to Hebrew), (b) the Hebrew name of God, (c) the order of letters in the Hebrew alphabet, and (d) the abject nonsense of numerology, which has been repeatedly and thoroughly discredited scientifically!   My Ph.D. is in linguistics, and I have provided professional instruction in Hebrew and other semitic languages. The order of letters in any language with an alphabetic writing system is essentially arbitrary. Additionally, to choose Hebrew as the "God language" is to ignore the history of how the Torah (that Christians call Old Testament) was assembled at various times by different writers, then back-dated with the claim that it was written by Moses.

Braden's entire book, therefore, is squarely centered upon the most blatant linguistic and historical nonsense, compounded by the ridiculousness of numerological claptrap.
