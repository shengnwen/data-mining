12 case studies, into 12 paranoid people.  However, it doesn't take the most critical of thinkers to realize that Siegel may be embellishing the facts a little.

Don't take my word for it read the book, and you may find some of his stories to be a little far fetched.  Like the last story of the book (Paranoid Express) in which Siegel locks himself in a train cart, snorts cocaine, pisses in his pants, and suffers blistering heat, for three days, just to experience what Mario N. goes through in his final days before being arrested.  The unbelievable part, is that the police go along with Siegel's little experiment.  They bring him food, change audio tapes, and deliver messages in the same way they did with Mario N. for three days.  I don't think there is a federal government alive who would go to such great lengths to accommodate a professor who wanted to get coked up to prove that a murderer was paranoid at the time.

Don't get me wrong "Whispers" is an interesting read and a page turner, but they way Siegel ties his cases together like the game "six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon", is a little worrisome.   You have this little nagging feeling in the back of your brain that says "if he went to such great lengths to embellish how the 12 paranoids were connected or what he did to understand their pain", then maybe he embellished their cases as well.

If that doesn't bother you, then by all means get the book
