This book is not about "how to grow as a graphic designer." It is a group of career biographies of (mostly) graphic designers.

If you've ever picked up a free business magazine, you have read those self-serving articles about so-and-so or company X that has started small and conquered roadblocks to become a business success. The kind of article that reads as though the author has just copied most of the press release handed to them. This book is just one of these after another.

There were no tips, instructions, pointers or other form of guidance in the book, save for the headings of a list provided by a third party. Examples of those pearls of wisdom are "Keep your skills up" and "Don't get too comfortable" - with no valuable description of how one would go about doing so.

The book would still have value if the stories were especially inspirational, or showed how the subjects uniquely overcame obstacles, but it doesn't. It doesn't even show how at all.

I expected a book that would help me find artistic inspiration, show how, who, and why successful graphic artists are inspired and find their ideas, and maybe have some business tips for a fledgling artist. I would have settled for a readable book that was even marginally about "how to grow as a graphic designer." This book fails in both regards
