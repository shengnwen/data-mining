While the content of the book is fine, I find the choice of typeface and color intensity of the picture captions and descriptions very very hard to read. The picture descriptions are in a very light grey color. Even close to a very good reading light, I had to strain to read the descriptions! I find it hard to understand the choice of light grey for text from a design and clarity standpoint. Showing the book to others confirmed my criticism. While I do use reading glasses, why was such a light grey color for picture captions and descriptions chosen?
