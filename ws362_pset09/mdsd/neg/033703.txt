When I finished reading this book I really didn't know what to think of it.  While reading it I constantly felt like I was reading a trashy romance novel with all the explicitly sexual imagery and at other times I found myself wondering if the plot was going to go anywhere at all.  The book is described as being a coming of age story of two best friends, but I think it is just a teenage pornographic novel.  I probably won't read this book again and even though it was only two hundred pages long, I feel that my time was wasted on this unsatisfying book
