Maybe it was the way this book was translated, but Alex Huber comes across as a close-minded, self-worshiping fascist!  I am a 20 year Yosemite local and can recognize his thinly veiled attempt to revise history and cast himself as the hero.  If I didn't know the truth, I would assume that Huber discovered Yosemite, was the first to think about free-climbing on the big walls and was planning to have his face carved on El Capitan!  A low point in the history of climbing books!
