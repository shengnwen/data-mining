I used this text for Honors Biology as a high school sophomore and the material was presented in a complicated fashion that makes it hard for a typical reader to understand. While I am generally a good student and can grasp new ideas quickly this text was complicated and in my opinion needs a lot of teacher aid in explaining, especially for first year biology
