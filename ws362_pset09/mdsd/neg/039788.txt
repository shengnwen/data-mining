Camps and Cottages has some nice photographs of interior home furnishings. What I didn't like about the book are several things. The pictures are repeated throughout the book. For the price of this book I want to see original pictures on each page. The use of small pictures, about 1&quot; square is really difficult for the eye to see. Printing text over textured, colored pages is extremely difficult to read. Descriptions are given of various rooms with no pictures to match, causing the reader confusion. Some photographs are cut off, even though the description includes items not seen. Some of the photographs are out of focus
