I am reading the book "The Westing Game" and I say that this book absolutely awful.  The book has very little details, and the plot is oh, so boring, and I never like this before. The characters names are pointlessly appropriate such as "Crow", "Turtle', and "Uncle Sam". The scenery is bad, and I could imagine better places. The ending was also absolutely terrible in all ways ever. I would rather drink tea from a gutter then read this book again. 
The book starts as a pointless scenario and progress to a field of writing horror. I think the author had a huge writers block, and wrote down what ever she could think of first. I don't now how, but Newbery Award. I would have slapped a biohazard sticker to the book just to so how I really think of this book. My summary is that this book is extremely terrible, and should be destroyed.
