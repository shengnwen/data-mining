I don't know what is happening with authors these days, but with each book they seem to get worse and Catherine Coulter is following trend. Ms. Coulter's early works such as &quot;The Legacy Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Magic Trilogy&quot; were really good, but &quot;Pengragon&quot;  was very bad. I didn't realy care about the either of the main characters and the only reason that read the book was the fact that I spent over eight dollars for it. Maybe Ms. Coulter and others should take a break and take the time to write a book that is worth its money
