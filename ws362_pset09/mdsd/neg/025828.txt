Please have a look before you buy! Be sure to check 
out the vacuous tables that inform us, for example, 
that the "Suspend" operation"Suspends a task" and 
so on for seven other task-related operations. This 
is a quibble, but I think the lack of content in the 
tables reflects a grave shortcoming of the book as 
a whole: there's just not much there. In my opinion 
part of the problem is lack of specificity. I wish 
that the authors had focused on a single real operating 
system (e.g. VxWorks) with actual code examples rather
attempting the very difficult task of covering the 
entire real-time operating system landscape
