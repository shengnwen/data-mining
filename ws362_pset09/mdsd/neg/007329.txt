I was so impressed with the fourth Edition of the Valuation text (if you don't own it, buy it now) that I went and ordered the accompanying CD-rom thinking that it would have all the basic financial templates outlined in the book.  I specifically wanted a valuation model for Banks.  

Whilst the model on the CD is fine for valuing non-financial companies,  I HAD ALREADY DOWNLOADED IT FROM THE NET FOR FREE.  Furthermore the CD didn't include a model for valuing banks - I'm going to have to build a new one from scratch. 

In other words, I've paid a fortune for something I had already got for free.  Ironic then, that the model comes from a leading consulting company (McKinsey)...what's the saying about consultants charging a fortune to tell you things you already know (or in my case sell me things I already OWN)
