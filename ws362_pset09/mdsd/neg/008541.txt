This was a two book story that could have been written in three chapters. Along with book one ("A Time to Love") Greenberger writes a tale that bogs down to a crawl as the Star Trek: TNG Crew consistantly say and do things totally out of character.

Many of the conflicts (cliched and otherwise) could have been solved merely by tapping your comm-badge and having the ship beam you up. But no! Greenberger has to whip up flimsy drama with so many minor characters of his own creation that leaves the reader saying, "Who cares!!! Let's get back to the story!"

Another problem stems from Greenberger's writing style. He's the type who will have a question posed to a character not answered until 3 pages later. In the pages between question and answer, the character will muse and reflect about every non-essential thing that has happened in his life, come to a realization about how he has come to appreciate or respect some one (I lost track how many times that happened), or simply continue to obsess over something trivial.

I won't tell you about plot, except to say that what was included was pale, substandard, and very un-Star-Trek-like.

If it wasn't for the fact that this was the third two-book story in this 9-book series I would have shelved it early.

If you want good Star Trek writing, check out a Peter David novel. I recommend the "New Frontier" series. Avoid this one like the Rigelian Plague
