I purchased the updated, 3rd edition recently and anyone who can actually understand the contents and retain the information, my hat is off to you. I have been a personal trainer for over 7 years and thought this book would supply me with some extra knowledge. Was I wrong. Way too technical. Way too many references and studies with many times contradicting themselves. Very non user friendly. I have read paragraphs to co-workers who are more advanced than me and even they shook their heads. DO NOT BUY if you are looking to advance your personal training skills and knowledge. I have passed several certifications and consider myself fairly knowledgable, but this book left me scratching my head and saying WHAT????
