This book was mistakenly placed in my preschool classroom and read to the children by another teacher.  If you are planning to buy this book be aware that some of the themes in the book may not be appropriate for children under 6-7 years old.  This book deals with a child being taken away from home, friends and family then losing a prized possesion.  The book also includes talk about war and soldiers with guns.  My class had difficulty understanding why Emi was being taken away.  This book is more suited to children much older
