The only reason I wanted this book to see the comparison for safety of car seats, strollers, play pens, etc.  Instead, what I found was a shopping list of infinite length, and almost no ratings.  Only 5 car seats were rated, 2 of which are no longer made.  This, after at least 15 styles of car seats were discussed as "potential options" in the body of the book.  I am very disappointed, and plan on returning this book.  Don't bother with it... you can find the shopping lists that the book provides at Amazon.com's lists, and this adds no value at all
