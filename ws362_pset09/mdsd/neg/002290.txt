This is the story of Alison who gets dumped by her boyfriend just before a dinner party to go back to his ex who he's had an affair with for months. This story was so disappointing: it's like Dunn took the same ideas as Jennifer Weiner's Good In Bed, i.e. being dumped, religion, pregnancy, friends, etc, but the end result is disappointing. The heroin is a girl who goes on and on about being an Evangelical Christian (who cares?), how she slept with few men, etc. This story is not realistic, it's not that funny, and the heroin is disappointing. If you want the real thing, read Jennifer Weiner, but not Dunn, sorry
