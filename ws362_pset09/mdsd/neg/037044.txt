I am certainly agreed with &quot; a reader from San Francisco&quot;. I have almost all of Lilian Too's Feng Shui Books and a recently bought her EoFS. I have found her recent publications are nothing, but just a  repetition of her previous books. Certainly a great disappointment from a  master! Please Lilian  don't published just for the sake of publishing
