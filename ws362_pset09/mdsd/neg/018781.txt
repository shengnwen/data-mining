This book is disappointing. I don't think Broderick understands the technology or its social impact, which is a major problem considering the book is an attempt to explain the causes, and effect on our lives, of "the spike." He quotes a lot of people who are smarter than he is and basically regurgitates their ideas without interesting analysis. And it's a lazy author who quotes paragraphs and long passages from articles and lectures instead of writing his own description and citing the source. Also, the author seems strangely arrogant for someone who almost gets it. He explains that everyone else calls nanotechnology "nanotechnology or nano-tech, but I call it minting." Hunh? Maybe everyone else calls this book good or interesting, but I call it boring (which, given the subject matter, it shouldn't be) and a waste of time for anyone who has thought about this stuff for more than a nanosecond. Or a minto-second. Or what I call speck-time
