Only a short way into this book, I quickly realized General Clark wrote the book himself without the help of a ghost writer.  It appears he also lacked the help of a good editor. The story jumps around from thought to thought without solid editorial orginization.  Aside from the poor organization of the book, the content has some shortcomings as well.  It is extremely self serving and bears little objectivity.  I found it disturbing to read that Clark viewed his role as Commander of NATO more seriously than his role as a United States Army Officer.  He does not atempt to hide the fact that he entered the US into a war directly against the wishes of his civilian superior.  This book makes it clear why Secretary Cohen and General Shelton are not supporting his bid for President and question his integrity.  Due to his presidential bid this book is being removed from the Army's Command and General Staff reading list.  This is unfortunate despite its poor style because the book serves as a cautionary tale of the possibility to abuse the powers currently resting in the US military unified command structure
