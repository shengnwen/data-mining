I have little more to add to the reviewers below.  Unfortunately, Mr. McMahon (whom I loved along with Johnny and Doc and Skitch before him) has little more to say than even casual fans of the Carson annniversary shows would already know, but stretched that little out into a book.  It is a fast  and empty read.  I know there are people in the world who think Johnny Carson was not human and did not have a persona except what we saw on the tube or on stage, but surely McMahon doesn't think there were more than two or three.  Anyone who saw the last week of Carson's shows must know that this was a complicated man McMahon was dealing with as his subject, but outside of telling us Carson was a complicated man, McMahon never helps us to understand him.  Instead, from McMahon's anecdotes, they just sound like frat brothers who have never matured past the age of 21.  I was shocked to find out that McMahon admits he had not seen Carson for over a year before he died.  These hardly sound like bosom buddies, and  the lack of depth of understanding of Carson outside the show (there are a few asides in which Carson admits to anxiety but not much more) is a gaping hole in the narrative.  Aside from the photos, one other positive.  For those who, like me, were particular fans of Carnac, there are two pages of the best jokes from that series of sketches.  I was pleased to read that Ed's favorite Carnac joke was mine too.  Regrettably, I can 't recommend doing anything more with this book than looking those two pages up in your local public library in a corner where you can have a good laugh without disturbing other readers while imagining Ed and Johnny delivering those jokes as only they could.
