My main complaint with this book is that a depressed author does not write a stimulating biography.  When all instances in the time period covered by the book are downplayed, the reader loses a sense of what is important.  Graham Greene's experimentation with Russian roulette, and a flirtation with foreign espionage are told in an attitude that makes it difficult to sense its importance. Was his spy work unimportant, or was it Greene's ho-hum attitude toward spying coming through.  The tint of boredom and failure extends over every aspect of his very fortunate and privileged life.  An Oxford education, career editor on the London times, courtship, marriage and a religious convert to Catholicism all seem to be performed robotically without any passion.  It definitely is an apt title.  The book really does stop short in his career as a successful author.  I am unfamiliar with his later writings, but this book mentions the fact that he feels alive when traveling throughout the world's danger spots.  In this autobiography, Greene mentioned in later years he would cover a local insurrection in Mexico, and viewed first hand the troubled years in Vietnam, Liberia and the Mau-Mau insurrection.     I would rather have skipped this book and read his later works about his experiences.  I would recommend this book only to someone interested in the psychological background of Graham Greene
