Don't get me wrong - I am a fan of Nadine Gordimer (see my review of `The House Gun'). But sadly `The Pickup' is a let-down!

The story of an affluent white girl falling in love with a black (illegal) immigrant car-mechanic is so utterly implausible that, even as it unfolds, the reader is hit by a sense of disbelief. 

Still being a fan of Nadine, I persisted. 

However fifty grueling pages later when the girl - who apparently lacks for nothing, brings her black, slum-dweller, boy-friend to meet white, upper-crust South African society at her parents party ... I conceded to common sense and cast the book aside. 

If you haven't already bought the book, reach for another title!
