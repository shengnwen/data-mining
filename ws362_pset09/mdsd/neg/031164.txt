The night Jacqueline "Jackie" Turner makes a bad decision and cheats on her fiancé, he turns around the next day and slaps her with enough evidence and backup to prove her infidelity - thus, giving her precisely two days to get the hell out of his apartment. Without an argument or a place to go, she decides to simply leave New York City altogether and temporarily crash with her best friend in Washington, DC.

Following her move, it doesn't take Jackie long to make her mark as the smutty, scandalous, drug obsessed party girl she was back home in New York. She promptly positions herself in a job as an intern while staking out a way to get a "real", well-paying job working for some government official. Soon, she discovers that making more money simply rests in sleeping with married or involved politicians who think nothing of footing out exorbitant amounts of cash in exchange for a little company and some sexual favors.

Before long, she's involved in so many different affairs, that her friends ask her to set up a blog that will help to keep them up to date with all of Jackie's flavors of the month, and entertain the public with amusing stories of her sexual lifestyle. From there, things get quite sticky for her as she soon comes to realize that her sloppy actions and blatant disregard for reputations may be landing her into some pretty hot water.

A bit overdone and just plain trashy, THE WASHINGTONIENNE reads as a badly produced reality TV show. If you're in the mood for a scandalous over the top gossipy book, then this one's for you. Otherwise, skip it... It's simply just brain rot.
