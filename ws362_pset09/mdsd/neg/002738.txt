       Have you ever read a book that has a wildlife shelter, a boy obsessed with natural disasters, a girl that carried a 40-pound seal on her back while rock-climbing, a lost racoon and an arrogant bear? I didn't think so. Well, now here's your chance, with Jackie's Wild Seattle. While Shannon and Cody'd parents are busy in Afganistan working with Docters Without Borders for the whole summer, they have stay with their uncle Neal in Seattle. During their visit, because Uncle Neal volunteers at Jackie's Wild Seattle, a wildlife rescue organization, the two kids get to explore wildlife in a new and closer way, while they help their uncle save animals. 
       Will Hobbs writes this book in the perspective of Shannon, a 14-year old girl who loves adventures and is a bit more practical then her younger brother, Cody. Cody is 7 years old and loves animals and natural disasters. Uncle Neal is very passionate for animals, and is nice and welcoming to his niece and nephew, but Shannon has some suspicions about him. She will not stop trying to figure out why he is not being open with them.
        I really liked this book and I would recommend it to someone who liked animal and adventure novels. Since I am not much of an animal book lover, i didn't like this book as much as some of my friends did, but i enjoyed reading it
