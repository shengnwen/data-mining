I have trusted Frommer's travel guides for years, but this one was a complete disappointment.  The author recommended hotels that turned out to be really seedy.  I wondered if he had actually visited some of the places he mentioned.  The book itself was confusing in its organization, and the only useful parts were the pull-out map and the suggested itineraries
