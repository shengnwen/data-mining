This book was poorly written.  The relation between the two stories was minimal.  The story was hard to follow, 'cause I can't read when I fall asleep from boredom.  The descriptions gave me no pictures in my mind, Dr. Hamiska was a big blur, and I only got a picture of the heat, which I honestly don't CARE about.  It was a real page turner...I was eager to finish the book, and get it over with.  I wouldn't have read it if my teacher didn't assign it.  My dog refused to eat the pages I ripped out, and seemed to, much like me, think the book stunk
