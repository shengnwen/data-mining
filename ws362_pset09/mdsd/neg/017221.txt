This novel is neither a love story nor a story about Titanic. Don't be misled if that's why you want to read this story. What it is, is the tale of a 12 year old boy struggling with the confusing and conflicting feelings which the onset of puberty brings. Unfortunately, this is a poor choice of narrator for a tale of the tragic ship. Sumner Jordan, is so wrapped up in his own feelings and fantasy love story, the object of his affection is a 21 year-old suffragist, that he is neither observant about his surroundings, nor perceptive about the feelings of the famous and fictional characters he meets. Worse, he complains about everything. So much so that when he is going through his crises, instead of feeling sympathy, you just wish he'd deal with it and keep quiet. Sumner is also hard to believe as a 12 year-old boy. Especially at the beginning of the book, the voice is more that of a girl.  A major problem with the story is the lack of character development. You never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care about their fates. During the sinking, the life and death decisions are made so quickly, little suspense is generated. If you collect Titanic literature, by all means, add this to your collection. If you are looking for greater insight into the disaster, look somewhere else
