I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end.
I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better
