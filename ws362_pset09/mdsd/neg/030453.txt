I'm still trying to read this one.  It's got just enough story that I want to find out what happens, but there's so much boring detail to drag through that it's taking forever.  I try reading a paragraph, but then get distracted by a speck of dust on my desk that's tremendously more interesting than reading yet another two-page description of yet another crater.  Which, boringly enough, is exactly like the last crater, except this one's a little bit bigger.  Or maybe it's smaller.  Or has a different mineral composition.  I'm really not sure, as I'm learning to skip ahead as soon as anyone drives into or flies over a crater.

If the science part of sci-fi appeals to you more than the fiction part (far, far more), this is a great book.  But if you like the fiction aspect better, or even just want a balance, you're probably best just skipping this one
