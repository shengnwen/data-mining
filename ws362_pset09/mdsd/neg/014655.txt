Oh my...I have owned this book since before I even moved to California.  I'm glad I didn't let this book's terrible quality stop me from moving to the mineral wonderland that is California.  The problem with this book is that it is just small scale maps of california with freaking NUMBERS plopped all over some map.  Ok, thanks a LOT for the number 14 (QUARTZ =) over Quartz Hill in Palmdale...yes, it IS made out of Quartz...massive white quartz.  The ONLY way this book is of ANY use is if you were to use it in conjunction with other maps and even then, there are scores of better works to choose from on the subject.  Don't waste your time
