Kramer's latest jeremiad is available for free right on the web, so it's not necessary to spend money to read it, unless one wants to peruse the added bulk of two introductions and one afterword to pad this out as a mini-book.  Kramer's essential message is certainly true: gay men need to grow up and stop acting out - it would keep us healthier and more capable of loving. This important message is surrounded by the usual Kramer hyperbole and score-settling against the admittedly odious Ed Koch and others he doesn't like. Like a mantra Kramer tells us that gays are better than other people, whatever that means, while the title of the book certainly doesn't seem to back that up. And by gays, Kramer refers only to gay men. Lesbians already live up to the "love one another" creed he preaches, one assumes. An old testament prophet is better suited to the Evangelicals than to gay life, and while Kramer is I'm sure well-intentioned, his manner and screaming alienates. We need a better messenger
