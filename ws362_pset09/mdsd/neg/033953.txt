I found this book to be adequate in some areas and lacking in others.  The challenge that I had was when I had a question the book does not supply me with an expert to ask questions of and it tended to raise more questions for me than it answered.  

With a little bit of research, and Google, I found an expert consultant, George Knauf who was able to help me understand franchising and find the right businesses to meet my goals out of the thousands of possible franchise choices in the market.  

And, unlike the book, the advice didn't cost me anything!  

Use the book to raise questions, then find some good advice.  Don't go it alone when making this kind of decision, I didn't
