Most of the text is war stories meant to glorify the author. He has no experience at selling outside the field of real estate. Because of that this book has little of interest to those not in that field...and not that  much for those in it. If you sell real estate there are far better books  out there for you on how to build your business. If you sell something  other than real estate this book is of very little use. Mr. Hopkins primary  talent seems to be that of promoting...primarily himself. It may well be  that his blend of self promotion played well in selling real estate years  ago, but he is not a student of selling and is not in touch with the real  world as it now exists. There are much better books out there on  prospecting
