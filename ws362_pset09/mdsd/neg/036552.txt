I agree with the reviewers who found this series "stuffy, predictable and annoying" and advised, "You might as well buy a romance novel." (Or a super-heroes comic book for the action parts.) What horrified me was that one reviewer mentioned Peters in the same sentence with Jane Austen and the Brontes!!
Austen did not condone much of the absurdity and pomposity of her time, but chose to demonstrate it, rather than rant or lecture against it, as many authors and poets were doing.  In a few simple sentences she skewered inheritance laws' cruel unfairiness to women. The little girl asks, "Why do we have to move?" and her mother explains simply, matter-of-factly, that's the way it is.  As outrageous as the law itself is the docile,(seemingly) unquestioning acceptance of it.  Austen didn't go into an enraged diatribe, just assumed her readers were perceptive enough to get the message.  Peters would do well to emulate really good writers: demonstrate talents and other qualities with actions and events, rather than repetitive, tiresome descriptions
