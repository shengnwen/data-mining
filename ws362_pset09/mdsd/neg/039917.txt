basically, you are either going to love this book or hate it. personally, I'm leaning more towards the hate side of things. the books starts off ok and somewhere in the middle it takes a weird turn. halfway through i started wondering if the main character had some serious mental issues. the main character is a woman names Liv who has just been recently divorced and is now in search of something to do with her life. she ends up becoming a real estate agent and "dating" some psycho named Andrew. the whole Andrew character gives me the absolute creeps..he is a perpetual liar and violently bites her repeatedly throughout the book. sound weird? it is! the book is well written and i can see how people can adore it. it has a lot of potential with the main character and the plot. plus it really is different from most of the chick books out there. but instead of finding it edgy and raw, i thought it was raunchy, psychotic, and just disturbing. but i do recommend that people read it b/c the things that turned me off it may be the things that you like about it.
