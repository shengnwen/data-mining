I was tremendously disappointed in this book.  The cost of $35-50 is definitely a complete rip-off for what you get from the author.  All you need to do is refer to pages 227-246.  Those are the pages that represent the bibliography.  I actually was so pissed off after reading this book that I counted them.  In total the author referenced the words and work of 488 author people.  There are only 223 pages of text and 6 chapters in the book.  I am certain you can do the math but I'll do it for you.  
There are on average more than 2 references per page and over 80 per chapter.  It's as though the author has never had an original thought of his own.  If I wanted to hire somebody to go out and look up the work of other people I would have done that.  I was expecting the author to use his own first-hand knowledge and experience in order to help educate and inform others such as myself about the process.  Instead, what I got was something a high school student would do while trying to complete a report for homework.  My only question is who is less ethical:  the author or the publishing company that let this slide through the screening process.  For all of those that gave this book 5 stars I can only guess that you don't enjoy actually reading
