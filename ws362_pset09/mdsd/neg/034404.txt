I like Gwendolyn Brooks. But I like poetry that tells a story more and this book didn't have much of it.  My favorite poem was &quot;Bronzeville Woman in a Red Hat&quot; because it was more my style of poetry, a hidden story being revealed by every line.  I just wasn't feeling the poetry in this book. It seemed a little dry.  I love &quot;We Real Cool&quot; and classics like that, but I don't feel this book showcased Brooks' ability to tell a story and recite a poem at the same time
