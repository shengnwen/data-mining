I must agree with Liz's review.  Robert A. Heinlein might have enjoyed seeing his name and legacy bantered about in this novel, but this book had nothing to do about Heinlein except the use his name as a "hook" to catch unsuspecting fish (like me). 

Once again I'm reminded that you can't judge a book by it's cover and in this instance by it's title as well.
