I'd size this book up as one small step beyond a 'welcome to the wonderful world of the dining/wine business' pamphlet you'd pick up at an employment agency or something.  An inconclusive introduction at best.    

I bought this book because I have trained as a chef, and because I have a passion for food, but I don't aspire to the life of a chef.  I wanted insight into how to break into alternative divisions of the industry, such as wine, gourmet food, small business ideas, etc.  Such information is not to be found in any useful degree here.  Rather, this book rarely spends more than a half page paragraph under any one heading,  for instance, in describing the various posts within a typical restaurant kitchen, or going into possibilities beyond the restaurant kitchen.   

It strikes me that there is virtually nothing in this book that cannot be determined simply by using common sense in thinking about the industry.  So unless you literally know nothing about it, I cannot recommend this book for anyone looking for new ideas or real insight into the food/gourmet genre.
