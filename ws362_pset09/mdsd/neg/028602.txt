I've always been fond of Clive Cussler books, although his more recent ones have had me groaning a lot because he keeps appearing in them as himself, never a good thing for any author.
Nightprobe, however, is his one duff effort. The concept of Great Britain signing Canada over to the US is so implausible that I actually laughed - no British Government would have done such a thing, especially as the War was supposed to be over "by Christmas", according to popular wisdom.
And given the fact that the US entered the war three years after the fictional treaty was signed, that would kind of make it obvious that the terms had not been adhered to. So why, after 70-odd years, would the treaty still be valid?
The other thing which increasingly irritated me is the fact that Cussler seems to have had no idea as to how the Empire worked. Britain couldn't have signed Canada away because it didn't own it - the Dominion of Canada had its own Government, as did Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. And the thought of George V signing Canada away is so laughable that it's totally implausible. Cussler seems to have had the notion that what London said the Colonies followed. Well, times had changed.
Read this book if you want a lesson on a silly plotline
