I received this 'book' as a birthday present from a well-meaning relative and became increasingly annoyed when reading what is more a pamphlet [...] rather than any serious enquiry into the human condition.

The most amazing thing about this text is how poorly written it is [...]. The author trawls through history, philosophy, high culture and popular culture sampling entirely unconnected quotations with which he attempts to synthesise (or rather yoke) into a cogent body of evidence supporting the proposition that he, the author is a "prophet" and holder of secret revelatory knowledge about the human condition. The result is a specious, tedious unreconstructed 'list' which fails to make any argument at all.

Hundreds of pages repeatedly remind the reader that their entire lives will be different once they have had the paradigm-shifting revelation of this 'secret knowledge'. In best conspiracy-theory practice, opponents' criticisms are polarised and discounted as 'flawed' thinking.[...]

Pathetic
