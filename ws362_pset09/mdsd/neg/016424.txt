I bought this book and read it; simply because the author is my ex-husband's therapist.  As with many self help books it touches only the surface of the problem and does not delve deep into what is truly happening and with a persons thoughts, actions, patterns and integrity.  People are not the same, we are all different, and therefore the thought processes are all different. What drives our actions and thoughts come from the many experiences we have had through our lives.   

A formula might work for a short period of time, but the basic problem that needs to be addressed is not being addressed.  Therefore the basic problem is being ignored.  When it is ignored more often than not it will come up again and with a vengeance.  

Many things that happen in our lives need to be recognized and understood with a professional who has "our" best interest at heart.  This is not found in this book.  The formula the Hendricks have put together is a quick fix with the problems still there and not dealt with. Therefore masking the issues.  

So, I do not recommend this book.  I do recommend seeking out professionals who will actually work one on one or in a group setting directly with you, dealing with your issues.  This formula is just that a formula.  None of our lives fit into a nice neat little box.  But, it sure sells books.
