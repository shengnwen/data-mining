the book that is being shown on amazon is not the newest book. the book is now paper back, check with the buyer and check with your teacher to be sure that you are buying a hardback book, or if they will let u use a paperback book. there is some difference between the two dont get stuck..  if your using this book for a class your gonna need the study guide that goes along with it, it's really helpful explaining hard concepts that most prof. cant get across.
