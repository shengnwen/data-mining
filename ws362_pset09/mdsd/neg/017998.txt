The problem with the Supreme Court is the same problem with virtually every U.S. institution, it is being coopted by corporate interests.  The watershed decision that started this process was the 1886 case of Santa Clara Country vs. the Southern Pacific Railroad, in which corporations were granted "personhood."  Since that time, the Fourteenth Amendment, among others, has been perverted by corporate lawyers to extend additional rights to Big Business, and we the people have been losing the legal structure to control these private tyrannies.  Founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson warned of this growing menace when he said, "I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country."  And President Grover Cleveland warned in 1888 that, "As we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the existence of trusts, combinations, and monopolies, while the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel.  Corporations, which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters."
A much more interesting book on Constitutional matters is Thom Hartmann's "Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights."  Hartmann also hosts a daily radio program that inspires the most thought provoking dialogue in radio.  I can't say the same for Levin's book or his show.
In fact, I think Levin is consciously avoiding the more profound issues that people like Hartmann raise.  These more pressing issues are also raised in the award-winning documentary "The Corporation" - which is available on Amazon in DVD format.
