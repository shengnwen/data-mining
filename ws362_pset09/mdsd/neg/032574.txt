This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.

The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.

If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed
