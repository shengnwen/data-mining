The Word is spiritual, not physical. Those who hope to gain wisdom from it must approach it as spiritual, not as a literal physical object. And, that is the problem with this work. James Robinson is a renowned scholar who has gone to great pains to provide accurate translations of the Nag Hammadi scriptures. But, there is little food for the soul here.

If you are a scholar, this is the book for you. But, if you are a seeker of spiritual truth, look elsewhere. I am a seeker and have owned this book for many months. I would not miss it if it disappeared from my personal library.

Seekers are advised to look elsewhere, starting with the older writings of G.R.S. Mead.
