This book has all the right things to make it a good novel. So why does The Raven only give it a measly two stars? Three words: Excessive language use. A character like John Constantine can be expected to use colorful language. Not a problem. In the real world, people express themselves in any number of colorful or off-color ways. But when the writer begins to add the words as part of the text, not conversation, I begin to wonder about the author's imagination. Isn't there a better way to say that without resorting to "gutter language?" The Raven thinks so. It is unrealistic to think that characters should not give way to full expression, it makes the character more human; you think: "Yeah, I know a bloke like that! Sounds just like him!" But in the context of the writing, it becomes: "Can't he think of another word? I'm tired of reading the f-word all the time!"
Quoth the Raven....
