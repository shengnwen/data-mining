As an avid reader and student of leadership I read coaches books. These guys are on the leading edge of society and have much to teach. Unfortunately this guy cant communicate it. This book is so intellectual that its hard to imagine him communicating with football players. I knew when they won the super bowl it was a fluke but I had no idea his book would be this bad. Its the only book I went out and got rid of in twenty years. Save your money and buy someone elses book rather than this one folks
