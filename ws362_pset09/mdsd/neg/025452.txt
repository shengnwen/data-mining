...that Robinson's latest books have become as pedestrian as this one.  I found the plot uninspiring at best, and completely devoid of surprises.  All in all, one could skip this entry and not miss a thing.  As always, Robinson is a good writer, and he's brought Banks to an interesting -- albeit depressing -- psychological place, but one can't help but feel that he and the series are simply treading water at this point.  If only the entire book were as brilliant and incisive as the very last line.  I'll keep my fingers crossed for the next one
