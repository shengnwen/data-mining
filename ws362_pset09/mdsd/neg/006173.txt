Of all the books I read by Feist this was by far the worst.  When I read book in the genre of fantasy I expect,well, a fantasy.  This is where this book fell short in my opinion.  It was simpliy not a fantasy exept for the end with Erik.  The book is  (with the previously stated exeption) about Roo's rise to wealth and fame.  Its a few hundered pages of a man becoming rich.  No magic, battles or anything else you would expect from a fantasy. 

Also, the change in Roo is to differnet from the last book.  Roo went from being a troublemaker with a good heart to an adulterer, murderer, and a drug dealer.  If you think about it he's closer to a mob boss than a merchent.  The only things he cares for are money and women. The only reason why I didnt give it one star was due to very good ending.  My advice is to skim the book up to last 100 pages and then read thouroughly.
