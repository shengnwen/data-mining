This book, set in the Midwest in the early 70's, is unbelievable and ultimately silly.  I was a young woman during that time; I can tell all you younger readers out there that there is no authenticity to this story.  It might have worked if set in the 19th century on the Plains, or perhaps the English moors.  No, probably not because angst is not a reason to write a book, no matter how skilled the author at writing prose. 

I had the sense while reading this book that Ansay started with the premise that the world is bad, and most people are cruel, insensitive and victimized.  Then she tried to invent reasons why this is true.  The results are cardboard characters that are cutouts of cruel, victimized people with no human being attached. 

The premise that a painful past makes for a wretched person has been done wonderfully well in countless other books.  Try Elizabeth Bowen's "Death of the Heart" for a masterful treatment of this subject. If you're looking for dysfunctional families, try Joanna Trollope.  They are honest, they are believable. 

Ansay has not yet developed the heart, vision or wisdom to see people as whole beings.  If she ever does she will be a knockout of a writer because her prose style is wonderful.  Until she does, her books will be one long, depressing, unbelievable whine
