Ellen Burstyn should have considered hiring a co-writer. I found the prose so monotonous I threw the book down several times while reading. She writes in short, choppy sentences with no variety or cadence. She uses few adjectives, has absolutely no sense of writing style other than relating one event after another. I was incredibly bored, but I stuck with it to see how things turned out. 

Unfortunately, she seems rather shallow with little insight, although she seems to feel she's got the answers. Well, this is very good for her, for it's what we believe that colors our lives, and if she has figured it out for herself, well, that's wonderful. HOwever, I was hoping to find some depth of insight, something I could ponder myself, and I didn't find it in this book. 

I was very disappointed in the book. It simply related each step of her life in detail with little reflection on her part, and she made some "interesting" choices in her life, choices that showed clear lack of critical thinking skills. The book reads like this: I went here, and then he went there, and then we went there and then I did this and then I did that and then he did this and we did that. 

I found little about her becoming anything other than how she started out, and she related it in a monotonous boring tone. I don't recommend the book if you like insightful material with decent prose. If you like to hear how movie stars are made and don't care how you hear about it, this book wouldn't be that bad
