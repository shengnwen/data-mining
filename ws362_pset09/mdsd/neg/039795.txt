Uptight guy versus bringer of joy and light. Fun food against staid religion. Haven't I seen this before? Oh yes, it was a Disney Film. I like the recipes, but the story is so hackneyed it had to be made into a movie. Death is even personified in this book; what an original idea! I read to the end because I love chocolate, but otherwise, this tedious heap of cliche is exactly what's wrong with "literature" today and doesn't merit recommendation
