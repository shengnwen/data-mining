This book has inspired me. I figure that if it can become ubiquitous in airports and make the author some money, why can't I write something similar and soak some up? It is probably the worst written book I have ever read. I bought it in an airport, trusting it would be the typical counter-terrorism/spy junk novel that, though pretty banal, would be nonetheless enjoyable. 

Although I have managed to suffer through most of its pages (this morning, about 85-90% the way through I through it in the recycling bin, I just cannot take anymore of it), the storyline is not just unbelievable, but simply silly. The dialogue between characters is unreal--surely most of them need to be medicated or at least slapped back into their senses. One moment somebody will be courteous and another they will snap at little, if any provocation. I don't want to spoil it, but something the president asks to pass with congress was comical and I nearly put the book down as soon as I read it. 

I think that Brown's writing is about the quality of a well educated and precocious 14 year old, but certainly not a weathered writer. This was the first Dale Brown book I ever wrote and it goes without saying it will be the last. It's a travesty that I had to pay for this tripe.

Let me put it in perspective: I read Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, a book that was ported in theme into a video game on the XBox and it was a far better book
