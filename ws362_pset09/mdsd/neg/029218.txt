I regret buying this book. It's not a guide for young people to starting your own business unless you call part time babysitting a business or selling your goods at a flea market as having your own business. The &quot;businesses&quot; the author has in mind are are, for example, selling homemade goods to your friends or anyone else you can get to buy them. If you call having a lemonade stand  a business, then this book may pertain to you
