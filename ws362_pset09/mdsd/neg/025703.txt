I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.
