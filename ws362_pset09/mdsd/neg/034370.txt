Crying of Lot 49
Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning. 
Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness
Poor Plot
Poor Writing

Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy.
Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)
