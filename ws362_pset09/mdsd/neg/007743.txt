The Rise of the Network Society was on my reading list for school -- and I was looking forward to reading it, not only in the context of my class, but because the subject is an important one, especially regarding the  distribution of information and knowledge in our society.  Unfortunately, I  was soon disappointed to find that Castells, with all his remarkable  insight into the arts of communication, has not been able to go beyond the  oh-so cumbersome turns of phrase typical of academic writing. I find myself  turned off by the lingo, where I am truly interested in the subject; I  resent having to plow my way through his phraseology, while I certainly do  appreciate the research and energy he has invested in his work.  There  seems to be an ideal to academic writing that somewhat opposes the general  trend of having knowledge and information made accessible to everyone. Or  is it that Castells really means to restrict his writing (and being read)  to the groves of Academe? If proving himself versed in the field is more  important than getting the information out there, what does he have to  teach us about the implications of a network society? That we should better  cling to our own in-group, to only those who speak our language, whatever  that is? If that is so, what change can we expect from being related  through networks?  If Castells intends to put into practice his belief that  *observing, analyzing, and theorizing is a way of helping to build a  different, better world* (p. 4), then he might as well start with  generously offering his insights to the world he wants to see changed
