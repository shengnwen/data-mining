The title is very appropriate -- this book offers nothing.  I suppose this irony is perfect in its purity, since this book reflects what CPB is all about - the agency as the star.  Unfortunately, the author, as a willing accomplice, perpetuates this insider joke to the detriment of the reader/consumer.
