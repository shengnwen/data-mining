I thought C. heston was one of the great actors in the world, and I still like Ben-Hur and El Cid and the 10 Commnadments very much..but Heston's stands on issues such as the NRA and gay rights are fascist at the very best.

He took a turn in his life thinking he could be an intellectual..a huge mistake..he was a good actor, he knew that much about himself, that he could dsraw aude=iences in with his swagger and heroic gesturing. But when he stepped out of the screen's protective proceniums, he showed his low voltage mind.

His Altzheimer's Disease is very sad, but the latter part of his life, beyond Touch of Evil, and Will Penny is even sadder.

A tragic case
