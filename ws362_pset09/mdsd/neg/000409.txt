This book can be written by any person on the streets who only have the most basic medical knowledge. I have the feeling that this was not even written as a medical thriller as the relavance to medicine was at a minimal level. Boring and stale at most parts of the story and the ending was fairly predictable. Please, read this book only if you have too much time to spare and too much money to waste on a tasteless book
