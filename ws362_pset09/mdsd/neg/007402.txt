I disagree with the other reviews of this book.  It is even-handed only if you consider damning with faint praise to be even-handedness.  Brock's thesis is that while Bill Clinton is a sleaze bag; Hillary is a sincere committed radical--sort of a Emma Goldman with a law degree.  While he does at times acknowledge that a double standard has been applied to the Clintons, as compared for example to the Bushes, he repeatedly denigrates Hillary by resorting to guilt by association.  He trots out every associate she has ever had who has been involved in any liberal or left-wing cause and gives you their background in lurid detail.  According to Brock, Hillary's intellectual development stopped in college or law school.  I await his new book to see whether he really is ready to write an even-handed appraisal of the current political scene.  In this book, he assumes that the liberals are naive or out to destroy basic American values.  For example, he assumes that there wasn't  merit at all to the Vietnam war protests or that anyone could actually believe that the war was both immoral and not in the interests of the United States of America.--Arthur Amcha
