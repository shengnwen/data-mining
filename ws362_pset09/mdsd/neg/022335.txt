Way overrated.  L&L lacks motivation and empiricism.  Justifications behind their derivations are often specious.  If you know the subject, it's a nice perspective.  Otherwise, it's useless.  Two stars, instead of zero, for their oustanding elegance.  Based on previous raves, have read now V.1 and V.2 of their course of physics.  Doubt that i will waste time on other volumes.
