 I wanted to read this to learn more about the War in the Pacific. I found some good information regarding the Philippines, but it was hard to read and it did not lay the ground work for the big picture. I liked reading Bataan Diary by Chris Schaefer for a more well documented line of the War in the Philippines and I enjoyed Ghost Soldiers better for easier, exciting reading on the raid of Cabanatuan.
