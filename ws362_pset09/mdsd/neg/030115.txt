This book and the author are ridiculous. It's almost a fraud that Mr. Bilardillo wrote a book on corporate credit analysis - he never followed industrial companies as an analyst at Standard & Poor's. He did however, have customers such as Enron and Worldcom that he was glad to take money from. The material itself is pretty useless - but what can you expect from a marketing person who attempts to comment on credit theory
