I had to read this book for an Intro to Geology course, and although I find geology to be fascinating, I had a very difficult time following this book.  The author uses a lot of technical vocabulary and is rather repetitious.  Although I understood what McPhee was talking about most of the time, I think it would have made a better film documentary than a book.  The author constantly went off on tangents and the overal organization of the book did not appeal to me at all. . .it would be more readable if written as a field journal because I could not even figure out when one day turned into another.  But the book did a decent job of presenting the bigger picture
