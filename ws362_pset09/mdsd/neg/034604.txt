I took the bait and bought this book.  It's jammed packed with information that can be obtained from most any phone book.  The oddest book I've ever bought and I have quite a collection.  If you need a big book for a child to sit on or to prop a door open, go ahead.  If you're looking for useful information, call your county extension agency or local groups.  This one's a waste of paper and ink.
