While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way
