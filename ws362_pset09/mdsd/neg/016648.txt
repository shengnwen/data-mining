I have read a lot of books on real estate investing. There are a few good ones out there that give real detailed, REAListic advice. This is not one of them.  It is not very specific and I did not find it to live up to it's title of being a "step-by-step guide".  There is not much substance to the book and can't say I learned anything by reading it. I'm a beginning investor with only a few years of experience, and the book was below my knowledge level.  The author may be experienced and successful, but not everyone is an expert at conveying a message. I do not recommend this book
