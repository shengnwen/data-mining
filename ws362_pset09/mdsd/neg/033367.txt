Myself, my peers, and my teaching assistant for my math class equally agree that this book isn't that great.  Topics have few examples, if none at all, and can be hard to follow. It only has one color ink, black; and with all the text so close together with nearly the same font and size it's hard to find key equations from previous chapters.  This may be the best book out there for advanced calculus, but it desperately needs to be revised and reorganized
