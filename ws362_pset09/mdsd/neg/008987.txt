I normally thoroughly enjoy reading travelogues.  I was looking forward to this book for a week before I found time to read it.  I didn't feel it was worth my time.  I was looking for more information about and feel about the places, and less self-exploration of the authors.  Not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
