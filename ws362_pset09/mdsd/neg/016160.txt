I enjoyed Key Lime Murder more than the last installment.  Ms. Fluke seemed to be less condescending to her readers' intelligence. And we were spared the precociousness of Tracy.  I still was unsatisfied at the very end.  The love triangle between Hannah, Norman and Mike has gone on long enough.  I think I've just grown tired of Lake Eden and the characters and the style in which they are written.  When you find the recipes more interesting than the plot, it is time for me to move on.  There are just too many other better written and interesting books for me to read.  I would recommend this for die hard fans only
