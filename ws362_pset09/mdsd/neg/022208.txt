I was hoping for a book that would present some new slant on Aristotle's thought.  I didn't get it.  This is just another attempt by Heidegger to set out his own philosophy, with all of the tortured grammatical constructions and neologisms that one might expect. I think that Heidegger is most interesting when he's actually engaging other philosophers, and less so when setting out his own bizarre and flakey ideas.  So if you're expecting to get some new insight into Aristotle, look elsewhere
