Well I grant it that the title is what drew me in. After all who does not want to see if anyone they know has the hand of a criminal!  So I read  it...and then i tossed it in the recycling bin. Now dont get me wrong I am  very much into esoteric subjects. However I am also into what is known as  intelligence and logic. Yes esoterics and logics can go hand in hand....the  trick is not to go overboard in esoteric (think Shirley McClaine) and not  to go overboard in logic (think egghead). Moderation, a balance is what is  needed.  So every book I read follows the key of balance. This book failed.  Now we cannot abandon DNA, because DNA and genetics plays a huge role in  our physical embodiment. To say that you can tell a criminal by their hand  shape and the way their thumb looks is intriguing...but soon turns to  ridiculous when you have taken any biology course. Look at your family and  compare your hands...if one of you has a certain nail shape...chances are  other family members if not all will have similar hands...thats called  genetic. So I am VERY wary of those that claim the physical body tells us  more then we realize. If you want an excellent book on palmistry, dont  waste your money on this one.
