For many years I assumed birth order maters - and that this is my unique idea. Ha! And Ha! - respectfully, now I know. But at the time I heard Sulloway's lecture to the Skeptic Society - I was still sympathetic to the idea. Finally someone got it! I thought. However, listening to him, I knew he got it all wrong. I could explain how he is wrong, and yet, he did all that research, he had all those numbers... maybe he is right after all...

Later I found out. See for yourself. And consider buying that issue of JPS. I have it, it is a worthy reading.
