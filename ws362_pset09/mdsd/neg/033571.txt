The book does not go indepth into a lot of physics problems. It will solve one question on one topic and then give the student a bunch of other questions at the end of the chapter that are different and harder than the solved example problems. Everyone who has taken college physics knows that there are a lot of variations to different questions, and there are conditions and exceptions that must be taken into account before a problem is solved. If you have a crappy physics professor, like I had, this book will make physics a nightmare for you
