An entertaining, though frustrating look at the Victorian era. Wilson's habit of using 5 words where 1 will do and never writing an unequivical sentence grows old quickly, and it is hard to keep track of where each chapter is going. Paragraphs and chapters do not segue neatly into one another. While the book does discuss a lot of interesting ideas and people I can't help but think other books on the era must do so as well and in a more pleasing style of writing
