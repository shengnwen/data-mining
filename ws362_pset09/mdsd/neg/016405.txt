Lilly has always been the self-proclaimed feminist, but her influence on Mia definitely showed in this latest addition to the Princess Diaries series. Problem: Mia wants to attend the senior prom, but her boyfriend Michael doesn't want to, and it's only through him that she can go. Instead of considering what he wants, she whines and tries to subtly coerce him into going to the dance. She convinces her classmates to hire Michael's band to perform at the dance, further showing her true colors as it goes against even the band members' own wishes. The value she places on herself and her own desires, above the desires of others, is utterly selfish and disgusting. I strongly recommend NOT reading this book, it really made me dislike Mia as a character.

Why is the prom more important than respecting someone else's wishes? If Mia and Michael were so compatible, they wouldn't be split on this issue. From her insistence on the prom (which also seems uncharacteristic for her to want so badly), to the feminist view that men are oppressors and women shouldn't take their husbands' last names after marriage, Lilly's cold disregard for Boris' feelings and later hypocrisy over him and Tina, to the hateful quote that women need men like a fish needs a bicycle, and Mia's goal to "mold" her little brother into the perfect (read: pussified) boyfriend...shame on you, Ms. Cabot. You make masculinity something to be suppressed and ashamed of, when it should be revered.

Also, as some reviewers have said, 15 is a bit young to be exploring sexually, and it's illogical for Mia and Lilly to join in on such behavior. Since when does turning 15 equate with 'becoming a woman'? Kind of an odd thing to say
