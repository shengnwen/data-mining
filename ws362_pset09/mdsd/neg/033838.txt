As someone who's interested in the Amazon, its people, culture, geography, fauna, flora and other subjects, I read this book for its fascinating topic.  However, this is a very mixed bag.  There are moving sections, as when she describes the genocide perpetrated against the native peoples by Europeans (you would not believe the atrocities and torture they visited the Indians, whom they considered lower than animals - much worse in its ferocity than the Holocaust of WWII).  The writing can be quite bad at times (at one point, her powers of description comes up with a fruit she tried, "bitter as semen").  But the worse is, she seems to be a very bad science writer and researcher.  Who edited this book?  Certainly not people versed in science or Portuguese.  She gets everything in Portuguese wrong.  The scientific names and terms are often misspelled.  Proceed with caution
