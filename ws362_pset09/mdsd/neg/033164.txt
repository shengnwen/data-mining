Last year for Calc AB, I relied mostly on my notes nd managed to get a 4. This year my teacher was horrible nd I actually tried to use this book to review BC material nd I could not understand it. I think I got a 3 or 4. The questions are way too difficult. Also, you can tell this book wont help you when you look to the explanation to understand a question and it gives a one sentence answer which means nothing. I used barrons for my SAT I math and got a 790. Most of its books are good, but this one surely isnt. You're better off with the Arco, CliffsAP, or even Princeton review. anything but Barrons
