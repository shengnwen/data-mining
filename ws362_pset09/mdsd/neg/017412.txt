This is the text book that was assigned to my class, and I am taking an at-home course.  I don't know if these guys are covering everything or not, but I can tell you this: they sure don't know how to write clearly.  Sentences are long-winded and convoluted. I read each sentence over and over just trying to figure it out. I am taking notes by re-writing every paragraph. Appraisal school is difficult enough without having to decipher and translate the textbook into plain English.  Today's example:

"The amount of the expected annual 'effective gross income' from the property, estimated by subtracting aniticipated vacancy and collection losses from potential gross income".  

I translated that to: 

"Effective Gross income equals potential gross income minus (anticipated vacancy + collection losses)."

It makes for very tedious studying.
