I got this book at the library (interloan) and I have to say this is dead last in financial self help books.

If you have the time and inclination, by all means go ahead and read it...but I would recommend many books before this; Millionaire Next Door, Richest Man in Babylon,  Think & Grow Rich, How to Win Friends and Influence People, anything by William Nickerson or John T. Reed...or Stephen King for that matter.

Honestly, after reading 50+ books on financial freedom, this book has the dubious distinction of a singular 'a-ha' moment; I realized that if this guy can write a book like this - anyone can.

In short, don't bother...the 3 hours it takes from your life would be better off with your kids, your pets, or your dentist (come on - you know you need it).

Alternatively, buy it yourself.  If for no other reason that encouraging the author in you (but please don't take my word for it)
