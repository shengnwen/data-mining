This book is so boring that I fell asleep several times while reading it. The author dumped too many incidents, dates and personalities into each chapter. Is there really a need to go to such a level of details? The reader can easily get overwhelmed and lose sight of the big picture. In intelligence jargon, there is too much "noise". The contents also appear disorganised and disjointed. Much can be done to make this piece of work more readable
