While Getz makes a number of important and valid points, he intermingles these with conjecture and unsupported insights that distort the book's conclusions. For example, Getz suggests that sometimes "brothers" refers to church leaders rather than all members (p. 50), yet nowhere does he support this insight. (Perusing 200+ NT refs to "brothers" yields no that support that I can see.) And Getz says things like "Jesus stated that the apostles would have a primarly role in teaching [the spiritual truths the Spirit would remind of]" (p. 113), yet nowhere does he tell where Jesus says such a thing. In trying to make a case for the need for a primary leader in every church, Getz cites Luke 22:31-32 where Peter is to "strengthen and lead" his brothers (p. 220), yet Luke 22 mentions only strengthing and says nothing about Peter leading the other apostles. In talking about restoring someone in sin (Gal 6:1), though elders are not mentioned, Getz conjectures that "they certainly must have been uppermost in Paul's mind." (p. 196) Such conjecture, absent evidence, distortion, and misquotation--some subtle, some not--is sprinkled throughout the book. The result is some good reflection intermingled with ideas that are read into the Scriptures rather than drawn out: Getz shifts duties from everyone to leaders, he distortes the role of elders, and he fabricates support for the primacy of the "senior pastor." Such elements, based on my reading, miss the Biblical mark fairly significantly. While I value some of Getz's insights, these concerns leave me unable to recommend the book to anyone who has not already studied the text and early church history extensively enough to catch where the "insights" aren't based on the text. Strauch's Biblical Eldership is a better, more biblical approach to the subject
