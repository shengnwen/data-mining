This book provides a very basic overview of blogging for someone who has very little knowledge. It does not really tell you how to do it and provides very little information about how to use the any of the available software. On the other hand, it gives a lot of information about relatively esoteric functions such as RSS syndication, trackback links, audioblogging, etc. It does not offer a consistent approach to the subject but seems to go where the author's interests take him
