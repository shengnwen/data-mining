The paperback edition of the book has a most attractive cover, but an entirely misleading one. Across a lovely curl of orange peel, looking like it might have come out of a Dutch still life of the 17th century, the title of the book is printed in Poetica, a script deriving from an even earlier period. The same script is used for chapter headings and page numbers, and there are similar decorative features in the book itself. It would be an ideal presentation for one of the art-historical novels of Tracy Chevalier, for example, but it bears no relationship whatsoever to a tale of sexual awakening, betrayal, revenge, and death set in Nazi-occupied France and in the late twentieth century.

Why do I go on about such an apparently trivial matter? Because the element of spurious charm, somewhere between a travelogue and a gourmet magazine, though clearly an ingredient that readers of Joanne Harris' other books such as CHOCOLAT have found attractive, is at odds with what could have been a very powerful story. Even as it is, once the action moves out of the kitchen and the portraits of the canny provincial French villagers have been gotten out of the way, the tale of a nine-year-old girl growing up in wartime France and of her return years later as a widow in her sixties does manage to hold the interest. But the construction is just that much too obvious and that darned charm too liberally applied for the book really to do justice to its subject. Ultimately, the terrible trauma of the time is presented as little more than a plot device, and one is invited to see these people as quaintly folkloric rather than painfully real
