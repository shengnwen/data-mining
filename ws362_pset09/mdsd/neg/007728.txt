I think this is a pretty terribly written and overrated book.  I didn't like English Patient to begin with, but I thought I had read it when I was too young, so I gave In the Skin of a Lion a try.  What bothered me most was the dialogue--it felt so contrived.  And I couldn't care about the characters.  In fact, the whole novel seemed vaporous--that is, superficially lovely but lacking any substance
