I hated this book!It was like a big lie. Nothing of what she mentioned really happened. I am Lebanese and I know all about Arab culture. This lousy book gives a very wrong impression about Arab culture, it is infact  nothing of what she mentioned.Even in war time, when Lebanon was devided  into Sharkiyyeh(Eastern part where all the Christians lived) and  Gharbiyyeh( Western part where all the Muslims lived)it was never like what  she wrote about. Even if it were to happen, it would happen to one in a  million. I wonder why she got so much attention over a lame book. To me it  was more like a lousy re-write of an American novel. Western people who  read this book PLEASE don't beleive it! Elle doit faire attention a ce  qu'elle ecrit
