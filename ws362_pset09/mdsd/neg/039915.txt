Although other reviews were favorable for this book, maybe it's just not what I was looking for.  On a spiritual journey, I'm looking for credible existence of some type of "afterlife."  I was hoping to read about varying individuals' experiences, near-death or otherwise, but it seems the author just has some kind of freakishly remarkable family who all have tons of their own experiences with the great beyond.  Interesting?  Yes.  Credible?  No
