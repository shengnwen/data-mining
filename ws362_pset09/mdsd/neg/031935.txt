Beware of Spoilers: The story started good and went continually downhill. I don't need a happily ever after, but this ending was too much of a dramatic stretch and the Author seemed to enjoy to punish Jennifer Parker for falling in love with the wrong guy. Some plot points were utterly unbelievable, incl. killing off her son, taking away her friends, killing off her lover and Jennifer's true love Adam, who does nothing much than whining how he loves her, but sadly, his wife just got pregnant....same old, same old. I reckon the story is too outdated to be plausible any more. It was the first book I read from Sidney Sheldon and I am not going to read another novel from him.
