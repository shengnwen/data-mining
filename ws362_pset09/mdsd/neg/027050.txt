If there were actually a god, which you'd have to be a fool to believe so, he would promote goodwill, love, and peace. this is the most contradictory book EVER. its f***ing stupid. being conservative goes against everything jesus said, and a large number of liberal ideals go against what jesus said. the truth of the matter is that conservatives are against god. god would say repay the african americans, give the women at least close to an equal pay, choose the lesser evil and don't allow a poor pregnant fifteen year old girl to be forced to raise her son fatherless in a broken home that will promote crime, let her abort 500 cells that can hardly be considered human. he would say let those who have the most pay for our government, not those who have the least. he would say if a man is going to be gay and not care whether i say right or wrong, then let him get married by government, but not by me in my church. he would say don't promote an ideology of hate as a foreign policy and probably most importantly, don't lie. this last one is probably the biggest problem for conservatives. think i'm wrong? [...]. have at it
