I made the mistake in buying this book. I thought it was about Filipino Martial Arts....it's about how a supposedly avid practitioner of the FMA keeps refering to Japanese and Indonesian arts trying to lump everything and anything under FMA.  It's really sad because these so called 10th degree grandmasters let these guys crap all over Filipino Martial Arts and get away with it.  It's not Japanese or Indonesian..it's Filipino....The author wrote a book with nothing but his own opinion...he probably never been to the Philippines.  
    Sorry but Sarongs and Kerambits are not Filipino...Guys need a reality check.  Stop bastardizing the art!  I'm sorry I bought this book and I'm sad that this is how some Filipinos are teaching the art just to make everybody happy and to fatten their wallets
