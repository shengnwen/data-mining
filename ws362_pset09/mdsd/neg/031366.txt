I've read every Midnight Louis book to date, but I probably won't finish this one. For starters, it meanders in and out of the characters' brains, probing, ad nauseum, their unresolved doubts and fears. If you haven't read the other books in the series, I have no idea how you'll catch on to what is happening in this one. What's more, why would you care? None of these people are appealing, as they were in earlier books. The first few chapters are maudlin and the mystery is boring. I get the impression the author is treading water with the book's plot in order to keep the series' plot alive. At this point they both look half-drowned to me. Add to that the incessant similes and metaphors that are becoming extremely annoying and you have a book that is hard to pick up and easy to put down.  I loved the Irene Adler series and I enjoyed the early Midnight Louis books, but Cat in a Leopard Spot is too irritating for words
