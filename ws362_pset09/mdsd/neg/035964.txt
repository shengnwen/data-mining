No stars should be an option!  I picked this out of someone's trash bag on the sidewalk.  Which should have told me something about it, but I needed something to read on the bus.  Reading this was like settling for a candy bar you "kind of" like - you eat it, but it's not what you really want and it doesn't satisfy you.  I found it stupid, boring and pointless.  I threw it back into a trash bag when I finished it (yes, I finished it - once I start a book, I have to finish it).  I am not inclined to read anything else by her - I refuse to call her an author, because she can't write.
