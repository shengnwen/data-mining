Set in Cold Ridge, New Hampshire, Carine Winters is 33, a photographer.  Her parents died when she was three and she, her brother and sister were raised by their uncle.

Carine has known Tyler North all her life.  Ty's single mom was eccentric and not close with anyone.  After her death Ty inherited her land and trust fund.  He's an Air Force pararescuer.

When Carine unknowingly interrupts a smuggling operation, Ty helps save her.  They fell for each other and planned to marry.  A week before the wedding Ty backed out.

Meanwhile, one of the smugglers plans revenge on Carine and just about everybody she knows.  One of Ty's pararescuer pals is suspected of murder, the pal's son is threatened, the pal's wife is a crybaby breakdown-waiting-to-happen, Carine's sister's husband is a senator, Uncle Gus has a lazy dog . . . this story was a disjointed, convoluted mess.  The characters were not likeable and didn't make sense.

I didn't know it was a sequel; just picked it up and started reading.  Maybe reading the first book would have made a difference.  I read as much as I could and skimmed the rest.
