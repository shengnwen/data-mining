The author created a masterpiece with this book, combining his vast experience of producing humanure with scientific insight, and great humor which made the book fun to read.  I'm convinced that composting manure is the safest way to safely deal with our own excrement.  Our society has got to be crazy to be flushing this immensely valuable resource to be dealt with later as it ends up polluting our rivers, oceans, and drinking water.  I highly recommend this book to any concious reader who would like to greatly reduce their impact upon this earth
