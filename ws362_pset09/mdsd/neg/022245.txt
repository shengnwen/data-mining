If the purpose for purchasing this book is to wean you child in the least troumatic way, for whatever reason, do not bother. You will only learn how not to wean. But if you don't really have to wean, you might feel stronger about continueing nursing. After 25 months of nursing I have so many reasons to wean I can't even beging to list them. I don't think La Leche Legue will ever help anyone wean. It would be like a catholic preaching buddism.  I read much more practical suggestions in &quot;What to expect the toddler years&quot
