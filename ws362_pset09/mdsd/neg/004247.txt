The concept of this book was great! Unfortunately the delivery left a lot to be desired. I actually had to force myself to finish the last third of it. All of the magical elements were left exceptionally vague, just a lot of mist and nausea. Now "the Grey" ,a spririt world between worlds, may be a confusing place but it is the authors duty to explain and visually describe in order to pull the reader in, make us understand. The Grey just sounded like a foggy night with a bad burrito in your belly.

The lack of description just continued over into the characters, none of which you'll be pining for at the end. The main character never gave a reason why you should really be rooting for her and care what happens to her personnally.Plus I was just past the middle of the book and thinking, when is the actual plot going to start.

Sorry this wasn't a book for me and I'll pretty much read anything in the fantasy/romance genre
