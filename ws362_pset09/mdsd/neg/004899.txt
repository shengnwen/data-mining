Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.
