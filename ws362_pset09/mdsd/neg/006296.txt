     Set in the soot covered trash strewn workaday streets of 1980s Istanbul, a man adrift without any depth of his own personality is abandoned by his wife, which rouses him to a realization about himself and a personal search that ends with him adopting someone else's identity.  
     This book was written for a Turkish readership; the references to the Ottomans, Muslims, the West, Turkish politics, the Turkish police and legal system, and the lost feeling of the current Turkish culture, are from a native Turk's viepoint woven tightly into the story.  It starts as a disappearance mystery only to quickly bog down into a saga of self-doubt, self-examination and despair.  It becomes progressively harder to read and requires an effort to wade through to the finish.
    If you haven't read Pamuk start with I Am Red; if you have read that read Snow before The Black Book.  If you have read Snow, rate this 1.5 to 2 stars below Snow as it is so hard to get through (for example towards the end there is a rant by a character regarding a complex aspect of Turkish culture contained in one paragraph that is six pages long).  A thick, dark, heavy soup made of culture, history, loneliness, religion and escapism; if you are Turkish you may find it savory and reminiscent of home
