You have to be truly annoying to write a book so bad that I keep reading despite myself, until I finish it. You have to be transcendently annoying for the book to be so bad that I feel compelled to spend four minutes of my life giving it a bad review. Chuck Klosterman, take a bow. You are truly annoying.

The quickest, surest, easiest way to be so annoying is to be shrill and self-justifying while expressing a series of opinions that are not merely idiotic, but willfully ignorant. Congratulations, Chuck Klosterman. You took the easy route to getting on my nerves, and the nerves of anybody who knows anything about real heavy metal music. 

I shall summarize: he thinks Poison and Guns and Roses and the like are better than Priest or Danzig. Poison. Better than Priest. GNR. Better than Danzig. Or Metallica. 

I kid you not. 

Uh, let's see if I can come up with a metaphor, for those not familiar with the bands in question. Here goes: This is like saying, uh, that Stephen King is better than Shakespeare. Or that Andy Warhol is better than Michelangelo.

Get it? It's just stupid, and almost intentionally so. You can't argue with somebody like this. They're not worth it.

What is most annoying, of course, is that a lot of people agree with him and also make their annoying noises and write their annoying words until one just can't help but swat at these mosquitoes...

Okay, time's up. If I prevented one intelligent heavy metal fan from wasting time on this tar-baby of a book, it was worth it
