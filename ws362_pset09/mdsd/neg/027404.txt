  This was my first reading of anything by Franzen.I picked this book up at the same time as I got "Corrections".I decided to read this book first to get a feel for his work,but must admit was very disappointed.
  I found that trying to get anything out of these essays was like looking for a white dove in a snowstorm.Obviously,he believes he has what it takes to be a good novelist.Maybe he is well versed in the techniques of writing,but he doesnt seem to know what he wants to say to the reader.His essays seem to be an attempt at observation,but he can't seem to pull his thoughts together and present a conclusion to the reader.
  His concern about the literary novel going the way of the vinyl disc or the rotary phone,reminds me that it is the message not the medium that is important.
  Maybe he has found his calling as a teacher of literary mechanics and should just leave the writing of novels to the gifted who know what they want to say and have the fire in their belly to pursue that path.
  In his last essay ,it appears he drifts somewhere between being liberal or socialist minded;and maybe that is the problem.He is not happy with the way things are,doesn't know what would satisfy him and can't suggest any solution.Maybe he should start searching out some people who are positive,satisfied and successful.
  Oh well,I guess I'll still give "Corrections" a try.Let's hope I like it better than this one
