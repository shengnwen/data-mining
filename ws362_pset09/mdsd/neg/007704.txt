This book and the great mass of the photos relate not to the garage, ie, a covered space where cars are stored or where a hobbyist workshop is located, but converted space or living space above a garage.  If you're interested in creative garage layout, workshop arrangement, automobile-related storage, etc., this is not the book.  If your desire is to turn a hardworking garage into a granny flat, this is for you
