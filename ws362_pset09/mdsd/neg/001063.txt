This book took me three months to read. It was so dry and boring it put me to sleep. The book contains no charts, no photos, nothing but text. It was part of an assignment for a college lesson. I'm embrassed  to admit I chose  this book because it was thin, yet the subject was over the topic I wanted.  After I read it, I didn't find the deepth it promised. Its view was off in  left field. If I was going to point out any one thing I learned for this  book I'd say, size doesn't always make a book easy.&quot;
