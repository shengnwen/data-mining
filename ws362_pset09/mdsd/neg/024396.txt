Poor, good and brave General Francis Marion. A true american hero. What a hack job this book is.  This book is actually about General Peter Horry, who served with Marion during our American Revolution and uses poor Marion as a backdrop to blow his (Horry's) egotistic horn.  Some may accept the author Weems, use of flowery language as &quot;the style of the times,&quot; but it is no more than silly platitudes towards Marion, that quickly become offensive as one realizes the real purpose was/is to build up Horry through association with the great Marion. Horry just isn't up to the compairson. This is not a book worthy of it's proported subject
