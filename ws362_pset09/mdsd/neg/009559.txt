I bought this book thinking that it would be a good starting point to get some new words into my vocabulary for the general GRE. I don't have an extensive vocabulary by any means, and even I knew at LEAST 85% of the words in this book. If you're looking to prep for a standardized exam, don't bother wasting your money or time on this book.
