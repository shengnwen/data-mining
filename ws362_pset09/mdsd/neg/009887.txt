Unfortunately, the book does not deliver what it promises. The author indicates a new method of interpreting the quatrains, i.e. the Green Language. As with most writers about Nostradamus, however, he spends a great deal of time with a posteriori predictions (&quot;postdictions&quot;). If he has truly found a new way of accurately interpreting the quatrains, then why is he not able to provide predictions? The author makes a lame argument that Nostradamus, himself, specifically wrote in a manner to make predictions impossible. Additionally, the author writes in the first person plural, which I found incredibly pompous and annoying. Save your money
