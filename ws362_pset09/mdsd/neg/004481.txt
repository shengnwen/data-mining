Don't buy this book. Many of the example essays are hilariously bad. I especially enjoyed the one by the caretaker of a disabled woman who "is the only person standing between her and a nursing home." Yeah, and now she'll be in a nursing home while you pursue a law degree. Good job, there! 

I'm convinced that half the 5-star reviews here were written by Montauk himself. I have been through the law school admissions process. The advice in this book is generic at best. Save your money
