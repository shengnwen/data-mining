"Knits From a Painter's Palette: Modular Masterpieces in Hand Painted Yarn" is what I expected from the title of the book, pictures I had seen of it and the reviews I read.  I am not one bit sorry I bought it.  But I wish it was so much more than it is.  Having knit with Painter's Palette, I can attest that the yarn is close to magical, a magic the book does not get across at all.

Charlotte's Web, for example, why would anybody photograph this beauty with the light behind it, focusing on the pattern which is not what the shawl is about at all? I suggest that anyone who wants to understand Charlotte's Web in Painter's Palette google it to see what it really looks like.

Probably the photos of the Butterfly Poncho best convey the beauty of the yarn, but in general, neither the photography nor the modular knitted items do Painter's Palette justice.  I realize Maie Landra is an artist and expert knitter, but modular knitting is not new and the results  actually appear more restricted than innovative so it's puzzling that she would find it particularly interesting.  

Koigu is wonderful, I am grateful to Landra for it, I would never not have bought this book, but can't we have a second one with a few more garments ordinary knitters like me could dream about making or maybe even actually make? And please, please, different art directors, photographers, etc.--in fact, how about a different publisher altogether as this one clearly wasn't up to the job
