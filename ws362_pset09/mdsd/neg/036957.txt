While this book brought up some very good issues about how terrible overweight people are treated, I found it preachy and many times got irritated with Lara's whining.  

I can understand that she's feeling sorry for herself because she used to be a beauty queen and now she's one hundred pounds overweight.  But I don't want to read that same thing a zillion times, right up to the end of the book.  It made me lose sympathy for Lara, and by the end of the book I thought she was a stuck up brat.  I also had difficulty with her disease, Axell-Crowne Syndrome.  It isn't real - the author made it up.  And because of this disease, Lara felt superior to other overweight people because gaining weight wasn't her fault.  Stuck up brat strikes again.  To top it off, she gets mad at other people for assuming she was overweight from eating too much, yet she assumed that exact thing with other overweight people.  How does she know the person she's looking down on isn't also suffering from Axell-Crowne Syndrome?  It's hard to relate to a hypocrite, especially one who never seems to learn her lesson and grow from it.  I didn't like other messages in the book either, such as Suzanne's gorgeous boyfriend, Tristan, hating that Suzanne is overweight.  If the point of the book is to say not everyone can be thin and that's okay, then why doesn't Tristan love Suzanne for who she is, regardless of her weight?  
 
Anyway, I could list all the things I didn't like about this book, but it would take too long and I've got other things I'd rather do
