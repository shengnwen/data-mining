Don't know what it is about this book, but it just didn't do anything for me. The plot is original and intriguing, but something just didn't work for me. It wasn't the characters, some of whom were likeable. It wasn't the villians, whom were quite cool--who doesn't like aliens, giant scorpion/crab/spider monsters, and derranged ape-people?
I think it was the books predictability that made it a tedious read. Lumley never truly generates any real suspense or a sense of urgency, so as creative as some of the foes are, they're not terrible effective.
I understand there is a sequel. Maybe I'll read that some day. If you're really into sci-fi, give it a read. It just didn't click for me.
Real rating: 2-and-a-half stars
