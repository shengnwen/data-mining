There are some very thorough and well know WW II historians who use all the documents and interviews they can get their hands on, such as John Tolland.  It is laughable that this work of anti-American fiction created by the careful trimming of contradictory evidence should occupy the same section as works by Tolland and others.  The key to unravelling the problems with the thesis:  who did Japan send to look at the results of Hiroshima?  Dr. Nishina.  And who was Dr. Nishina?  Head of the Japanese atomic weapons project.  Were we the only ones in this race?  Certainly not.  Both Germany and Japan were hot on our heels and the Soviets not much further back than that.  The only reason we dropped it first was because we won the race, in the short term.  So there is no moral low ground for using the weapon.  

This book also ignores Okinawa, the battle right next to the home islands only two months prior where the US endured horrendous losses.  It was on the basis of that battle that the figure of 1 million casualties was projected.  The basis of actual combat experience with the same kind of troops and local support we could only expect to get stiffer once the homeland was attacked on the ground.

This book does not examine the military situation involved at all while criticiizing what was essentially a military decision.  Do yourself a favor and read a real history book by a real historian, not a left wing diatribe by an anti-American trying to blame us for all the world's woes
