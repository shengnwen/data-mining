I've seen several mentions of grainy photos, and they are grainy, however that is the least of the problems with this book.

First of all many of the figures have been traced out from the background the photo was taken with and pasted onto a plain white background, causing multiple problems, like persepctive and flat or squished body surfaces where the models were originally sitting or lying on something.  The "cutting and pasting" is sloppily done, and in many of the photos the tips of toes and fingers have been cut off, very annoying.

Secondly, there are several photographs that take up two pages...but this is a bound book, so the entire center of the body is not visible, and because a portion is in the binding even the countour is not usable.  In additon to the two page layouts, there are multiple other figures that fall directly in the center of the book, and are rendered unusable by the binding.  The only thing I can figure is that this was originally a spiral bound book, or had pull out pages, like a magazine centerfold.  I can't imagine someone would intentionally publish a book with such an awful layout.

Lastly, some of the "motion" figures are cheats.  One in particular is clearly a man laying on something propped up on a pillow, but he has been cut and pasted as though it were an upright pose...maybe that explains why so many found the poses "unatural".  That wouldn't be a big deal if the book wasn't called "The Figure In Motion", and was maybe titled "Some Figures In Motion, and Some Sedentary But Turned To Appear As Though They Were In Motion."

Couldn't give it no stars, as I will use some of the photos, but my money could most certainly have been better spent
