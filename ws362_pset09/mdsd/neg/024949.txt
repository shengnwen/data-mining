Alice in Wonderland meets Stephen King. When a mysterious blue light enters the souls of a variety of people, good and bad, they receive powers and knowledge beyond this world--whatever gifts they have are made even stronger. But then...strange things start to happen. 

The colorful characters, deep symbolism and surreal scenarios make this book a unique thriller with a conclusion that leaves you wondering where fantasy began and reality ended. 

Some of the details were a little gory for me and generally overall it was disappointing--maybe because of his venture into Sci-Fi. The info on the back cover enticed me to read it, but alas, I really fought hard to get through this book and decide what I felt about it. 

Overall his characters were thinly developed and the story ended abruptly--and I felt, with a bit more effort, could have improved the total results. Maybe I had different expectations because of who the author is--and his reputation with the mystery genre and his Easy Rawlins stories. 

Armchair Interviews says: This writer changed genre, and seemed to miss the mark for many SciFi fans.
