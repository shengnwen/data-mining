This books reads like an 800 page tabloid about Mao.  It is filled with trivia and innuendo.  While it can be amusing reading, it has little historical or scholarly value.  

Mao was not the cartoon villain that this author portrays him as.  While there is no question that millions (tens of millions?) of Chinese citizens suffered or died from his policies, one must also consider his accomplishments and the circumstances of the times.  

Prior to 1949, China was a destitute nation subjugated and divided by foreign powers.  Her people died routinely of starvation in the streets of her largest cities.  They lived in an opium-soaked feudal society where women were considered property or worse.  

During Mao's reign, those things changed.  Women were given equal rights as men.  The corrupt nationalist government was driven out and entire country united for the first time since the decline of the last dynasty in the early 1800s.  Transportation and industrial infrastructure were rapidly constructed.  And China developed nuclear weapons and ICBM's by the mid 1960s.
