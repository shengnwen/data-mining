Have we really come to this?

John Lennon was murdered by a clearly-deranged fan in 1980.  Anyone who believes that Lennon was a grave enough threat to the USA and the world obviously has a bizarrely inflated opinion of the former Beatle.

John was practically in hiding for the five years before his death and had distanced himself from the hippie peace movement which had faded away during the disco era.  Upon releasing his return album, "Double Fantasy," he and Yoko gave many interviews about how they'd settled into private life and made a fortune off real estate and such.  Come on, people, one of the main reasons his killer struck was because John had become such a sell-out.

Even back then, the "bed-ins" for peace and all the anti-war posturing came off as more silly and mischevious than dangerous and anti-American.  
He loved America, he loved New York.  We'd been out of Vietnam for five years.  

Documenting all the movements and rantings of John's crazy killer doesn't make his horrible crime a CIA conspiracy.

Wherever John is, he's probably laughing
