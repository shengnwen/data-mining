I bought "Inner" with the expectation it would provide me with insights into how my personality impacts my investing decisions.  I found the book to completely devoid of any useful insights.

To give you an idea, "Inner" divides the human race into 4 or 5 "types".  It then offers to categorize you and me and everybody in China by the simple expedient of answering 5 questions, one of which usually has to do with whether you are the oldest of youngest child.  Suffice it to say that I have seen more rigorous persoality testing methodology in Readers Digest magazine.  Having set up the categories, the advice offered was worthy of a horoscope column in the daily paper, i.e. vague enought to apply to anyone.

"Inner" was the most useless book I have read in quite a while
