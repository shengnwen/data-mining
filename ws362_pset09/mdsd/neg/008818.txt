 This book was selected for an introductory statistics course at my university and ALL of the students absolutely LOATHE it. Unfortunately John Rice and/or Duxbury publishing have failed to realize that when it comes to mathematics, a textbook is only as good as the solutions to the exercises that it provides. With this book, THERE IS NO DETAILED SOLUTIONS MANUAL- only 'numbers' at the back that will in many cases leave even the strongest student absolutely clueless as to how the answer was obtained. Take for example, question 21 from chapter 1, which is one of the easier questions in the textbook. It asks a very standard probability question: 'What is the probability of being dealt a straight in poker?' When solving this problem, even an avid poker player might not think to subtract the number of straight flushes from the numerator (which is reasonable because it technically IS a different hand). So the student will flip to the back and see a 'minus forty' in the answer, and have no idea why it's there. And I must emphasize, THIS IS ONE OF THE EASIER QUESTIONS IN THE BOOK. With the proof questions (some of which are quite challenging) there are no answers whatsoever. 

If you have a choice, you would be far better off purchasing 'An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications' by Richard Larsen and Morris Marx. It is deals with the topic at the same level as the Rice textbook, but is far superior in its presentation, examples, practice questions, and solutions. Many students in the course that I'm taking actually went out and bought this textbook (it was used to teach the course in previous years) because the Rice textbook is so bad.
