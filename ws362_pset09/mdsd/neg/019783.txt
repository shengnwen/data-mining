The ending really disappoints, particularly for a play so revered. 

Tartuffe results in a marriage that restores the status quo to power that existed at the beginning of the play, while at the same time hanging Tartuffe out to dry.  Moliere makes use of a "deus rex machina," a "king from the machine," as Louis XIV appears and rectifies the deception of Tartuffe: "The King, by royal order, invalidates / The deed which gave this rascal your estates" (162).  

Unfortunately, for the same reason readers decry the usage of divine intervention, the deus ex machina, this ending does not satisfy.  Shakespeare cleans up with sophistication and, for the most part, plausible reasons, but Tartuffe builds up a situation that puts the hero against the wall, and by no action of his own, his situation gets resolved.  The comedy at the end relies entirely on the delivery of the actor playing Tartuffe when he says: "Who? I, sir?" and "To prison? This can't be true" (161).  When his usurped world falls apart, a rapid denouement brings us to the ending. The falling action of Shakespeare takes a long time and raises many questions to entertain the audience.  An effective ending arrives at the last line gracefully.  It felt unsatisfying.  

Also, for better religious hypocrite characters, read Boccaccio and Chaucer.
