While there are a few good tips, I found the book lacking in enough detail to actually use (especially in the makeup section).  Some of the tips on natural solutions for menopause were actually counter to scientific evidence.  Complete waste of my money.  I find myself at a loss for what to do with the book - I don't want to pass it along to anyone else . .
