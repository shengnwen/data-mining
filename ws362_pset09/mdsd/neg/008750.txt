I really liked the book from the begging I got hooked and could not stop reading. I loved the part with the missinaries and there triels and tribulations. We see how the missionaries tried tyo change Hawaii's customs on the people and we sew the down fall of the missionaries. But after that the book draged on and lost it's touch. It went on and on and on and only a few other things I enjoyed. i laos enjoyed the leaper partsd and the trials and tribulations of the chinese and Japense people. the problem here is that the auther gose on and on about pointless stuff we will soon forget. This novle could easly of been 500 pages but it's over 1000. I was dissapointed but it wasent entirley a bad book it was enjoyanle at times
