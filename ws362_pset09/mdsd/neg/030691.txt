I can't stress enough how much I despise this book. The problem for me was the dialogue. As I was reading there was never a time when I didn't scratch my head and said, "Who talks like this?" Because of that it was impossible for me to like any of the characters. Not even the plot was that great. From one book reader to another, I strongly suggest you avoid this book at all costs
