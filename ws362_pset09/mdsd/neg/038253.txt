If you are looking for a colonial history book, move on.  This book has no maps, few dates and is told from the POV of individuals with little or inconsistent details or context from chapter to chapter.  Occasionally the writing is good, more often the author seems to be enamored of his own attempts at being clever or cute.  Repeatedly editorializes about what a historical figure would have thought or done.  If you are very familiar with colonial history and can deal with the authors writing style you might enjoy this book.  If you are serious about your history this is most certainly not the book for you
