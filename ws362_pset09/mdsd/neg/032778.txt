I admit that my ignorance caused my disappointment in this book. I feel that the title is misleading. To me, "home" recording has reference to merely transferring one recording to a different medium. This book is a bit too technical for me, and deals with aspects of recording that I consider more "professional" and not so amateurish as I understand "home" recording. My rating is based on the feeling that the book is inappropriate for me, although others may find it to cover exactly what they are looking for
