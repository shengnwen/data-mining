Speaking as an American living in New Zealand (indeed, a Berkeleyite, just like Masson), this book really got under my skin, and not in a good way. Masson arrives in New Zealand with all his Berkeleyan world-explaining ideas (The Despoiling White Man, The Noble Savage, The Oppressed Native Peoples ) intact, needing only a smattering of experience to trot them out and apply them to his adopted country. There is next to no learning in this book, remarkably little writing of charm, insight or wit--just an endless litany of "I did...", "I felt...", "I was affected by..." paragraphs, interspersed with the kind of factual material that a high-school student might include. As journalism it is far too slapdash. As memoir, its self-regard and -indulgence far outweighs its meager helping of resonance. In short, I can't believe that this book had an editor.

This is clearly a book that was written on his veranda, for people who already take him for an intellectual/empathetic figure of note. Not having ever read anything else of his, I found nothing here to justify that standing, which makes it only the more irritating that he is so "up himself", as the Kiwis would say.

New Zealand is indeed a wonderful, wonderful places, for some of the reasons Masson describes, and for many others as well that he never notices. Even when he says something I sort of agree with, I start mentally arguing with him. GAHH
