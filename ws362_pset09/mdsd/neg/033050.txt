Reading this book , one might conclude that only five things mattered to Paul Hornung: football, alcohol, women (perhaps sex with women is more accurate), gambling and nightclubs (and the entertainers and hoods who inhabited them).  As a window into the personality of a rather shallow and non-reflective human being, this book might be worthwhile.  On any other level, it is a failure.  It offers little insight into the game of football, it's evolution over the 50's and 60's, or the people who played it for Notre Dame or the Green Bay Packers.  (Instant Reply or Distant Replay are both far superior).  What kind of school was Notre Dame?  I can't remember any class even being mentioned?  Did Hornung appreciate the unique environment of professional football in a small town like Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Again, not a word. 
	The book reads like a quickie done for pocket change.  Some of the factual errors are quite remarkable: Hornung states that Fred Williamson played for the Raiders and got "hammered" in Super Bowl II.  Wrong: he played for the Chiefs in Super Bowl I.  He states that Frank Gifford was on the original broadcast team for Monday Night Football.  Wrong: Gifford joined in the second season, replacing Keith Jackson.  One wonders if Hornung actually read the ghostwriter's script.
