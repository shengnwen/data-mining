If you've read Kroeger and Thusen's other books, like &quot;Type Talk At Work&quot; or &quot;Type Talk&quot;, you'll recognize most of that material in this book.  &quot;16 Ways To Lover Your Lover&quot; doesn't add much to  the two works mentioned above, and if you are well read on the MBTI this  book won't add much to what you already know.  However, if Type is new to  you, and you're looking for some fun ways to explore your relationship with  a significant other, this book is worth a shot
