There is much to say about this book, and none of it is good.

I am not well-versed in Aboriginal culture.  However, I can tell when someone is fabricating information.  Marlo Morgan has a fine time making up all kinds of rediculous details about Aboriginal life and culture.  She even seems to frequently confuse Aboriginal culture with North American Native American practices.

In addition, her writing style is clunky and laughably bad in places.  She didn't even take the time to ensure that the "important message" that she was making up was cohesive or followed any internal logic.  She just rambles on about various New Age concepts, presneting a hackneyed and confusing message about the evils of Western Civilization.

The really funny part is that Morgan doesn't seem to be able to shake her ingrained ethnocentrism, as she makes rediculous claims about Aboriginee feet being "hoof like," and claims with a straight face that up until the 1990's, Australians didn't have window screens.

It's just bad all around.
