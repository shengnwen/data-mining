This is the least of Miller's "Sin City" comics. The story is weak in that the relationships, the plot lines and detours, and the sex and violence are all very clumbsy and unfinished: reads like a painfully long pulp novel or a piece of art made to fulfill a contract. The illustrations are equally uninspired, very careless character designs and shoddy linework in general compared to other razor-sharp "Sin City" strips. The hallucination sequence near the end is for me the only memorable part of this whole thing
