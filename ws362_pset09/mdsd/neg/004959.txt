MOON CALLED is no relation to Norton's Yiktor series; this is an "after the fall of civilization" novel more along the lines of NO NIGHT WITHOUT STARS or STAR MAN'S SON, though evidently not in the same setting as either. As in those stories, the protagonist of MOON CALLED was an apprentice being trained in relatively arcane, specialized knowledge - in this case, a priestess - who was cast adrift from her people before the story opens. Unlike the protagonists of several other Norton stories in this vein, Thora was not exiled; her native village was destroyed by pirates, leaving her to make her way in the world alone.

Stumbling across an alien, injured stranger by chance, Thora is drawn into contact with Malkin's native society, wherein Malkin is familiar - lifelong companion, if you like - to a man of power in that society, wherein the gender roles are not quite reversed from those in Thora's own culture (down to serial polyandry in Makil's society, as opposed to polygamy in Thora's). Thora goes through some culture shock, but not much - Makil's society is only peripherally explored, mostly concerning those aspects that a hunter and sentry without strong family ties would see.

With very little tweaking, the story could've been dropped onto either continent of the Witch World during the Kolder War; the new universe introduced here isn't very memorable, and the post-apocalyptic aspects aren't utilized beyond setting up a "cache of very dangerous stuff" that could've been almost any McGuffin without loss of originality. (Thora and Makil's people have to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands, with some disagreement among Makil's people about whether it might be useful for *them* to exploit.) No suggestion that I noticed of how the now-dominant religions, magic use, and so on happened to develop; throwing "Set" in as the name of the deity worshipped by the forces of evil is a little jarring for that reason, because none of the other religious elements seem to have such a clear connection to present-day mythology (generic moon goddess, Lord of Light, that sort of thing for the other religions).

While this book has its moments - I'll grant any of Norton's books that, though it doesn't quite make the three-star cut for me - I would recommend DARKNESS AND DAWN or SPELL OF THE WITCH WORLD over it for similar material given better handling. Elys' story in SPELL OF THE WITCH WORLD has some similarity to Thora's, but has a much more fleshed-out setting (though a more standard resolution of her relationship with Jervon than Thora has with Makil).

Nitpicks:
- It doesn't ring true that other survivors of Thora's native village scattered without trying to regroup, or that Thora abandoned them without more backstory and effects on her character. (Thora doesn't seem to know if there were other survivors, or care.) Norton offers some explanation for Thora's detachment, but it seems thin. She was being trained as a priestess and a major figure in the community, but feels no apparent responsibility apart from her duty to protect various religious artifacts. For her, being a priestess seems to be about her special Chosen status, not at all about her relationship with/responsibilities to other people. (While this is certainly one way to develop a society, Thora lost her home and everything she ever knew except her dog, and doesn't seem to have been affected at all as the story opens a few months down the line.)
- Thora doesn't quite seem to have the responses of a trained fighter - on poking into a strange, darkened room, she remains silhouetted in the doorway, and generally doesn't seem to be as prone to moving cautiously (or not at all) as one might expect a lone wanderer to need to be.
- Granted that this is a setting without efficient mass communication, it still seems that travellers' tales would've at least made Thora acquainted with Makil's people by rumour before she encountered them, since they're within a few months' journey at walking pace (a lot less, possibly) from her native village.

The back cover blurb for the first edition is poor, by the by
