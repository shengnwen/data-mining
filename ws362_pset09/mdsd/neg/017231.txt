I'd read good reviews about this book, but I found it very
disappointing.  I didn't find the black and white particularly
advantageous to the book or the story.  Dull is the word that comes 
to mind for the story itself.  The cover is the best part of the book--the cat is cute.

I purchased this for a gift but now I'm sorry that I relied on reviews before the purchase.  If I'd seen the actual book and read the story, I would never have bought it
