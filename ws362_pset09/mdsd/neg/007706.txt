I expected to agree with this book. The idea of the media and educational establishment deliberately corrupting America is entirely plausible to me, so I was looking forward to hearing Kupelian's case.

The first two chapters were full of factual errors, some of which are outright lies. I've read most of the books he referred to and know about the subjects he was discussing, so I could see the way he twisted or glossed over facts to suit his purposes. After the second chapter of slapdash research and shoddy arguments, I gave up.

To give just one example from those first two chapters of his dishonesty, according to the book jacket, "the 'gay rights' movement -- which transformed America's former view of homosexuals as self-destructive human beings into their current status as victims and cultural heroes -- faithfully followed an in-depth, phased plan laid out by professional Harvard-trained marketers." I was wondering who these Ivy League masterminds were who laid out their plans in the 60's to orchestrate the Stonewall Riots along with the numerous other pivotal events at that time that inaugurated the change in attitudes towards homosexuals. It turns out he's referring to the book "After the Ball", which was written in 1989, over 20 years after the gay rights movement began. Aside from the unreasonability of blaming a movement on a book that was published decades after the movement began, there's no reason to think that more than a handful of people have paid much attention to that book. Its authors are hardly masterminding a conspiracy to promote homosexuality, though I'll admit their wish to take advantage of compassion for AIDS victims is cynical.

In short, the basic thesis, that our media, schools and other cultural guardians are promoting immorality, is correct, but Kupelian is an inept defender of it
