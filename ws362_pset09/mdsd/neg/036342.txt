I can't beleive how utterly desgusted i was. this story was awful. The plot of course is nice like always because it Pirates of th Carribean but the book is so easy to read and not written very well. 

 I'de just stick to the movie.  Nothing against the Pirates of the Carribean in general. It was the perfect thing to read if you missed the movie and was just catching up to find out what's going on but the book just deffinitly wasnt worth it at all otherwise
