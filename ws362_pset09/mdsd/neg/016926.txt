I enjoyed the first hundred pages of this book, as Daisy, a 20 year old English girl, tries to find her way in the world.  But after she marries and moves to Ireland, the book starts to drag.  The characters she meets there are never fully fleshed out, so their eccentricities seem incomprehensible.
I skimmed the second half.
I recommend The Dower House, also by Annabel David Goff, instead of this book
