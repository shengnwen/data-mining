I have been a huge fan of the original "Mad Scientist's Club" since I was a kid.  I continued to re-read it as I grew up and read it to my children.  Needless to say, when I found out that another Mad Scientist's book was coming out, I could hardly wait to get my hands on it.  Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.  None - and I mean none - of the stories reached the level of any in the original.  As an example, The Flying Sorcerer was nothing more than The Strange Sea Monster of Strawberry Lake "gone airborne" or The Unidentified Flying Man of Mammoth Falls "light".  My advise is to stick with the original, save your money and skip this one
