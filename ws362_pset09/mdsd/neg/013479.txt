I am very disappointed with this book. I suppose my expectations were raised after seeing that the book was recommended by Dr. Christiane Northrup, M.D., one of my favorite authors, the sole reason I purchased Awakening Intuition. 

"Awakening Intution" contains VERY little information concerning how one can develop or awaken his/her intuition. Indeed, the title is misleading and inappropriate. The book is mostly filled with case studies and examples (many tragic) of people who did not deal with emotional issues/thought patterns that subsequently caused disease/illness in their bodies. Mona Lisa focuses on illness  NOT the development of intuition. 

I also dislike the author's writing style. While Mona Lisa Schulz does seem to have a healthy sense of humor, I think her writing is nonetheless terribly dry. Mona Lisa Schulz repeats herself throughout the book, which was poorly edited (it should be half as long). The book reads like one long chapter.

Again, rather than discussing intuition and how one can develop this quality, she focuses on her life as a medical student/neuropsychiatrist/neuroscientist and the patient/clients with whom she interacted. After 150 pages I felt sick.

I realize we each have our own tastes and many readers may actually enjoy the book. I, however, would most definitely not recommend this book.
