The title of the book is completely misleading. Actually the book vacillates between a mechanic description of kabbalah tree, an interpretation of a painting, Jewish alphabet and various religious points of view. At the end, the reader is left with some information which by no means will lead him/her to an inner balance. This is a purely theoretic book and has nothing to do with spiritual growth
