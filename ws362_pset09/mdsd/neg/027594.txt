I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid....I also read the book first and thought it was one of the best reads of my life....I recently bought a new copy of the book and still liked it very much....however I also recently purchased the movie version and it was TOTALLY laughable.....one of the worst movies I have ever seen.....so bad I suppose it could be a CULT CLASSIC in the same vein as ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES or REEFER MADNESS.....don't waste the money if you expect anything otherwise
