I read a lot on cartography, particularly cartographic history, and I was excited to get this book. Unfortunately it was very disappointing. It has masses of carto-bibliographical detail, not put to much use in supporting a broader argument. And it is very short on any insight or analysis beyond the most superficial and obvious. Historical maps reflect the concerns and attitudes of the times and cultures in which they were produced - I didn't need to wade through this book to know that.  This book could be useful for reference, but it won't deepen your understanding
