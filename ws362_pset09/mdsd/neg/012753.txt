I read this book hoping that the glib one-liners and poor in-jokes would give way to something substantial but they never did. It's written in such a trivial and superficial style that makes one think all the time whilst reading it "where's the beef?" It's full of cliches and what the authors obviously thinks is funny but it really is an unsatisfactory read.

The publishers should have worked on the text more as it is obvious that the author cannot write in other than soundbytes in what I would call a type of division four Saganesque. The author obviously thinks he is an authority on the subject of life in space but only displays a superficial and incomplete grasp of the field.

My advice is to get anything by Sagan instead. It's obvious that Shostak regards himself as a kind of successor to Sagan however I have news for him...
