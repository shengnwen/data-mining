l love reading Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder novels and many of the author's other works. But this particular effort is, in my opinion, pure out-and-out trash.
Now, the premise is excellent: a man going over the edge because of the trauma and losses from the 9-11 WTC bombings. And, initially, someone else accused of the first murder.
And then begins the trash, much of it totally unnecessary - in particular, the often-depraved and carefully described sexual needs and actions of a female character who manages to become quite unsympathetic and near-lunatic in her acting out of every possible sexual want - not 'need', want!.
Then, there are several just plain hokey and/or unclear aspects: first, the clearing of the first murder suspect (very poorly explained), and second, determining who the murderer is/was, a "yeah, right" reader's reaction. And, a few of the sub-plots just become plain boring.
l find it difficult to believe that the author actually wrote this trashy novel; the only suspicion l can come up with is that his agent or editor took too many liberties in an effort to spice up this l-o-n-g novel
