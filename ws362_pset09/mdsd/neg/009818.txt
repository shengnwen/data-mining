The author of this book had a clear agenda, and made it very clear what her opinions were. I for one am tired of having liberal agenda's crammed down our throats no matter what school I attend. As for the material in the book, well she did a good job if putting every case in the world into one book, but there was no substance in between, just opinion, which I for one do not care for, expecially this politically correct one
