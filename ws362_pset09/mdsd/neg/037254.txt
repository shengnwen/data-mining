This book illustrates basic exercises with very little real information. Arnold shows his bodybuilding routine which consists of training each bodypart three times per week twice a day, which would be extreme overtraining for anyone who  is not taking steroids. His dietary recommendations are outdated and primitive. This book is satisfactory for learning basic exercises so long as you disregard the training advice
