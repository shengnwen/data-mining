S.E. Frost is either highly misinformed on Christian matters, or a liar. He states that we have never been able to answer the problem of evil and sin, which we have. He declares that we do not know who created the devil, and we do. He does have a couple of gems in the book, but if you are a Christian, or atleast open to truths, even the ones you don't like. I believe they would be better found elsewhere
