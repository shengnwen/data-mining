This once promising and enjoyable series (and I have read every book) has just become too much like an overblown TV soap opera. Every time one problem or mystery seems to be cleared up, it either evolves into something else or another situation takes it's place and we have to wait a year or more for the next episode. Temple appears to have finally made a choice between the two M's but we all know that's only a deception. The one bright spot in the story (and earlier books had a whole lot more of them) is on page 297 and involves the wonderful Fontana Brothers doing a James Bond imitation. It took me forever to read this book and made me think it would be my last Midnight Louie story until the end. And I must say it's a shocker and I will have to read the next installment but get a headache thinking things will drag out til the author reaches "Z"
