I enjoy most all books on Autism. Everyone has a wonderful story to tell, and I love to hear what they do for their children to help them thrive. Susan seems like a wonderful mom full of courage and gusto. I did not like how the book jumps around from one point in Nats life to the next and back again. I appreciate progressing time lines. I apreciate how she accepts her son as he is. That is lovely. But knowing what I do about autism, I wish she would have done more in the way of biomedical treatments to find someunderlying causes to some of his symptoms. Some things CAN be cured with these kids-you don't just treat the symptoms-you are missing the big piture. Other things CAUSE syptoms-they are the result of something. Not everything is just chalked up to being the way the autistic brain works and that is that and there is nothing you can do but "train the child" how to act. You are cheating your child if you do not try to figure out what makes him tick from his head to his toes. maybe the Senators did this on some levels, but they did not talk about it much. They seemed to just like to medicate the problems away whenever possible. medication can be a wonderful life saving thing, but sometime you lose the real person when doing so. I know first hand-I was medicated for depression when there was an underlying phyical condition that caused it and was cured when that was addressed and taken care of. I never got the sense that they did a whole lot of digging that way-just accepting that Nat was Nat. I was left wondering what might have been for him. Maybe something a little different. Maybe not. God bless them for being so caring and accepting and strong.
