I enjoyed the first book, but by the fourth book I was not willing to spend the money to complete the series.  This five book series should have been done in 3 books at the most.  It takes a very good author to make a series longer than two or three books, unfortunately this is not the case. One of the things that turned me off on this series was that amount of ships, planes, equipment being used up during these battles started to be so enormous that it was difficult to believe that these loses would not have effected each side's ability to continue.  In short read this at the library before you spend your money
