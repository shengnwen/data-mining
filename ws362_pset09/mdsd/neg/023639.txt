So I'm flipping through the book and thinking "Did I actually pay money for this?".  So many of the activities were things that I (and many other parents) are already doing with our babies.  Like playing with rattles, talking to your baby while looking in the mirror, kicking at toys, pointing to objects and saying the sounds they make, peek-a-boo, waving bye-bye... you get the idea. But the moment I knew I wanted to get my refund was when in the 0-3 months section, the author suggested going to the hardware store to buy a blank set of keys to put on a strong ring to "make great noise and be cool teethers".  The thought of my infant's delicate gums knawing away at the sharp edges of metal keys--YIKES!
