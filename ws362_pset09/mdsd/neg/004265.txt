The only reason I gave this book one star is because there is no zero level, as far as I can tell.

I was disappointed. I was annoyed. I was bored. I was irritated. Then I was impressed because if this could get published, ANYbody can get published. 

There are, theoretically, two plots in this book. Neither plot ties in with the other. The second plot is so secondary that it is forgotten for chapters at a time by the author. I only wish we could have forgotten the main plot, and I use the word "plot" only as a point of reference. 

ESP, mysticism, ghosts, real magic; a protagonist who could be a woman, or who could be a woman who can magically - yes, magically - turn into a man. Or really, we aren't sure. It's like at the end of the book, Coulter looked up, realized "gosh darn, end of the book already? I'd better slap together an ending!" and that's what we have. I actually wondered if my book had lost some pages, I was that confused and bewildered. 

Also, we meet a character in this book who will return in another book in this series, a cousin of the serial killers Tammy and Tommy Tuttle (Tammy, of course, maybe being Tammy or possibly Tommy or Timmy or magically changing into Tommy or Timmy; we aren't sure and trust me, eventually you won't care). In the later book, this cousin is nice and we are empathetic with her. In this book, I didn't care if she got killed or drowned on her way to Bermuda. In fact, I wouldn't have cared if the whole cast of characters had drowned on the way to Bermuda or been killed by the weird ghosts that the Tuttle siblings feed with blood from victims. 

That's "ghosts" as in real ghosts, by the way.

My complaint is that the rest of the books in this series are mostly based in factual, believable actions. This book - I have no idea what happened with this book. Probably one of the worst plotted books I've ever tried to read. And that's sad, because a good Coulter FBI series book is a page-turner and a joy to read.
