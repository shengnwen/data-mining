Functional is the Word in my opinion. I did not think the selection of bracelets in this book equals the other 500 items books. The book publishing, the physical part and the photographs are fabulous. The editors selections leave some doubt in my mind as to their abilities in selecting items. I think a bracelet is to be worn as an accessory or an adornment not to be a dangerous object such as a bracelet of lighted birthday candles- A big paper wheel you can stick your arm through  also stretches the boundaries.  I cannot stretch my imagination enough to consider some of the selections in this book as a bracelet
