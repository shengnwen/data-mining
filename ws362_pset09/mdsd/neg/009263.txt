Wow. Good thing I didn't buy this book.  Looking at all these reviews there seems to be two catagories of people who rate this book.  The normal people catagory and the bling bling people who cash in on this book only to recommend their own books. And when you look at their profiles and see what books they have reviewed it's very little. It's obvious people want to cash in the name of the books ("Men are from Mars....)  One reviewer talks about his sex drive being improved then recommends his own book.  Seriously, shut up.  We live in a society where sex sells and the idea of if you want to be beautiful you have to get this book.  Don't be fooled. This book is BS and you will feel bad because another diet didn't work. 
There are better diet books out there. John Gray is just trying to cash in in the weight loss craze just like Dr. Phil.  AND if you truly want to lose weight and need discipline weight watchers is great. If you are reading this you are a smart consumer don't invest in this poser, wanna be diet book.
