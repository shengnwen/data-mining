I like Patagonia and admire the company's philosophies, but this book felt like one big, long self-aggrandizing advertisement for the company.  The title of the book really says it all if you're looking for good business management practices.  No need to read any further.  But the history of the company is quite interesting, and their efforts to be environmentally responsible are inspiring
