I don't know if everyone's standards have changed so much because of text messaging "shorthand" or what, but I found this book to be nearly unreadable.  

There are spelling and grammatical errors on what seems like every miserable page.  Apparently synonyms (like "steel" and "steal") are a concept Mr. Bourne never mastered - that and the compound sentence. The text is stilting, truncated and abrupt - absolutely no "flow" in the writing style.  I feel like grading this book like my high school english teacher used to do and sending it back to him; maybe he could learn something.  Do me a favor, Mr. Bourne, and use a spell checker.

Lastly, this reads more like an outline for a book than a book itself.  It doesn't even read like a journal or diary.  There is no character development, no dramatic tension, no identification with the characters.  It's more like reading a police blotter or a duty officer's log.

This book is horrendous.  Give it a miss
