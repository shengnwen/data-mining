This was our only reference guide to 6 weeks in Spain. We tried to use it for Hotels and buses and trains and all of the things a traveller would need to know. Instead of useful information, we were assaulted with so many adjectives and adverbs that bordered on stupidity, we almost threw the book away. It does contain some information of value if you can get passed all of the pompous verbiage. We did use the book for some things, but important information could be a great substitution for many adverbs and adjectives.
