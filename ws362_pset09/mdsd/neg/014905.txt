If you're made to buy this book you have every right to hate the professor that makes you do so. This book is a punishment! Not only is it very expensive, but it also offers information that it is not relevant to the real world at all.

There are some positive sides in this book after all. There are quick references on almost every page to make it easier to follow the chapter; there are good graphs the explanations to the graphs as well as the general argument do fit (more or less). There are also case studies, a fairly solid web page, and self-assessment questions that are helpful to get through with this material.

However, the style is unnecessarily pompous, filled with theories that make no or only very little sense; the information presented is way to shallow to really understand what the authors are getting at, yet miraculously they manage to fill the book with more than 500 pages with endless waffle. In some places, the author's even contradict themselves, which is the most impressive thing about this book.

Generally only two stars are awarded for this book, as it really is a waste of money and time, however if you have to read this insult for any intellectual mind, you will find some help to make nonsense into a science. Good luck to you!
