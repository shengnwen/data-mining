As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one
