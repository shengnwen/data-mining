For many years I have been working in real estate and I found this book to be very brief and basic. I cannot see how a home owner would benefit from the basic advice talked about in this book. Perhaps a book on home contstruction would be far more helpful to you. My customers ask me for advice about books to read when they buy a house and this is not one of the titles I would give them. This is not an expensive book but my main concern is reading a good book that I can learn from, not just getting a low price on it
