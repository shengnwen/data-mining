I have to say I am a huge PKD fan, and have read just about all of his books.  And before you dismiss this review, know that I read and enjoyed Valis and The Divine Invasion, precursors to this book, the third in the series.  But, sadly, this book just was not the vintage Dick classic that Ubik, or A Scanner Darkly was.  In fact, I was disgusted with this book, and to date, I have loved every one of Dick's books, even the more obscure ones (Galactic Pot Healer).  Though Ubik and my personal favorite Now Wait For Last Year had a strong, cohesive plot littered with welcome digressions and departures, I can't help thinking that Transmigration was just one long digression lacking any sort of structure, and without the strong and interesting characters in Dick's other books.  With a slew of obscure references to various operas, epic poems, and other pieces of the impotent intellectual vangaurd, it seemed Dick was trying to prove to us his cultural superiority and sophistication.  And that is not the Philip K. Dick I know and admire.  I suppose if you feel compelled to read everything that Dick has written, then read this, but do yourself a favor and borrow it because it is not a book that you will want to re-read
