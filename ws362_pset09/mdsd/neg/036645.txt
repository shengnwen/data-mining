....if it wasn't for Chancellor Williams' "herrenvolk" mentality, and his obvious distorting of African/Middle Eastern history to make it seem as if all African history was nothing more than a protracted struggle between black and white. This is what ultimately damns what, on the surface, appears to be a brilliant and well-researched book on African history. 

One glaring example of shoddy reasoning is Professor Williams' supposition that "white power centers" existed in Northern Egypt about 2800 B.C. This alone is highly improbable, given that virtually all of Egypt at that time, and most of the Levant(ie, Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, etc.) was either black or brown. Another thing Williams blindly overlooked was that many of the Ancient Egyptian sculuptures were later altered by insecure white anthropologists who could not accept the mere idea of Egypt being an African civilization--something which continues to this very day. 

Finally, Chancellor Williams can't bring himself to admit the simple truth as to why ancient African civilizations collapsed: they collapsed for the same reason all the others did--they overextended themselves, grew decadent, and left themselves wide open for invaders. Williams insists that the blacks were too trusting of outside forces. But the same could be said about the Romans trusting the barbarians(whom they allowed into their armies)who eventually destroyed Rome. At bottom, he really seems to believe that Africans are too childlike to build great empires and institutions--in other words, he is projecting his anxieties as an Afro-American onto African issues, and in this he fails miserably
