Enjoyed reading this manuscript but I wondered if the author had himself  read such works as Wallace's own &quot;Malay Achipelago.&quot;  The  dedication of this latter book reads: &quot;To Charles Darwin, author of  the &quot;Origin of Species,&quot; I dedicate this book, not only as a  token of personal esteem and friendship, but also to experss my deep  admiration for his genius and his works.&quot; In light of this, one feels  that &quot;Spice Island's&quot; fairly dismissive treatment of Darwin is  rather unfair. In sum the point of view of Stevens is interesting but in  the end not particularly satisfying
