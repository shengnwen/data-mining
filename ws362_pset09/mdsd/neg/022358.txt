I really wanted to learn about this fascinating story: the dynamic personalities, the diametrically opposite companies, and their highly publicized $170b(?) merger. And I am willing to overlook a prejudiced author delivering a biased tome as long at he puts forth a good story. But this guy simply cannot write. The book is, at best, boring. Klein gives us inessential speculations on the characters' childhoods while never developing any of the real players. I like to be able to glean some insight as a result of reading a book like this but the author serves up absolutely nothing. Of course there are many lessons to be learned from this dot-com merger folly -- just not any from THIS book. Whatever positive reviews this book has received must have come from other `reporters' who mistakenly think that they too can cash in on their own utterly worthless 3-400 page book. In fact, read all the 5-star reviews and ask yourself if they were written by the author's friends.

If you enjoy well-written books of this type try: "Taken For a Ride" by Bill Vlasic & Bradley Stertz, "The One Best Way" by Robert Kanigel, "Goldman Sachs" by Lisa Endlich, "Inside Intel" by Tim Jackson, "When Money is King" by Richard Hack, "Consulting Demons" by Lewis Pinault, "Wireless Nation" by James B Murray, "Oil & Honor" by Thomas Petzinger, "Dark Genius of Wall Street" by Edward J Renehan, or "Steve Jobs & the Next Big Thing" by Randall Stross
