I learned more in a upper class area San Francisco Drunk Holding Tank about prison life as a teenager, than I did reading this BORING BOOK!! To be honest I only got half way through....I read the other reader's thumbs down review of this book and I still bought it!!!   Not to mention, its a really odd size book! Its almost a flat bible size book! Bizzare!!  Pass on it is my recommendation... Davi
