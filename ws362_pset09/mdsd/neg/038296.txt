I couldn't figure out if this was a novel or a liberal political op-ed piece.  Which is it Mr. Woods?  

Two Dollar Bill pretty much follows Woods' imagination of the normal Stone Barrington agenda, with the inclusion of several underwritten and hidden political personal opinions.  Installing political opionions in his books have been common practice for Mr. Woods, I would know because I have read EVERY SINGLE ONE of his novels prior to Two Dollar Bill.  

Political opinions are all fair and well...when incorporated into a politically focused novel, which this isn't by any means, but it would be hard to know it by the shear number of snide, unrelated, and personal attacks Woods makes concerning Bush Administation policies and general Conservatives in America.

To his credit, Woods did respond to an e-mail I sent him inquiring as to why he did this, but couldn't provide ANY justification for it.  Merely that it was his right to do so.  And you are correct Mr. Woods, it is your right to do so...just like it was my right to make the conscience decision not to read any more of your books, which I am happy to say that I haven't.  And coming from a person (me) who has ALL of your novels (with the exception of one) in hard back, most of which are signed, is quite a statement to make.  I've been a fan of yours since the early 90's, but cannon continue to be with your recent, and quite obvious, politically motivated agenda.

Good day to you
