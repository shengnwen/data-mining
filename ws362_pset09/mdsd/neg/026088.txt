Based on her own definition in this book, Ms. Coulter is liberal to the core. "If you cannot articulate your opponent's position, you are not an adult; you are a liberal." 

Ms. Coulter is an articulate author with an admirable command of language. Her twists of the literary knife  are a pleasure to read, even when you realize that she has severed your necktie. Or your intestine. She has a penchant for making the same point three or five or six times using eight or twelve or twenty examples, which is about as pleasant as watching a pile driver hammer a steel rod into granite.

Her thesis is that the political opinions of mainstream American media are more liberal than those of mainstream America, affecting both the choice and treatment of news topics. She raises some cogent and disturbing points. Her opening  line, "Political debate in this country is insufferable," makes clear that she can and does address fundamental problems that transcend the issues of the moment.  She also identifies the cause of these problems in her first paragraph: "It's all liberal's fault." She judges the value of any action entirely by the political stance of the actor, regardless of the action itself. Liberals who characterize conservatives as "dumb" (i.e. every liberal, everywhere) are attacking their opponents personal traits because they are unable to create or express any meaningful arguments. She does not apply the same logic to her own statement such as "All liberals hate America," or "Liberals love pedophiles." She is certainly skilled in logic, as revealed in a hair-splitting analysis of why it is reprehensible for liberals to describe right wing ideas as "Nazi" in nature, but Rush Limbaugh's term "femin-Nazi" is a discerning and accurate characterization.
