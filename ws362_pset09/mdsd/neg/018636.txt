I first encounterd EE as a young disciple of Christ.  I thought it would be an excellent class to attend on how to share my faith and make disciples.  However, I was soon greatly dissappointed as I saw the shallowness of the method and the unbiblical gospel that it presents.

The book is designed to help Christians communicate the gospel to non-Christians.  The book encourages the Christian to ask a series of questions such as, "If you were to die today and stand before God and He should ask you why He should let you into His heaven what would you say?"  The questions are to get the non-Christian thinking about death and judgement to come (Hebrews 9:27-28).  

The problems with EE are too many to explain in this short review.  First, the gospel message presented lacks power (Romans 1:16) and says little to nothing about repentance and baptism which are both biblical parts of the gospel (Luke 13:5; 24:47; Acts 2:38; Romans 2:4; 6:1-4; 1 Peter 3:21-22).  It says nothing about discipleship (Matt. 28:19-20; John 8:31-32).

Second, EE never deals with the very heart of man.  It never uses the Law to show man their sinfulness before a holy God (Psalm 19:7; Romans 7:7; 1 Timothy 1:8-10).  The Law, writes Paul in Galatians 3:19-27, is out school master to bring us to Christ.  

Third, EE never speaks about the need to perservere in the faith (Luke 8:15; Acts 14:22-23; Romans 11:20-22; 1 Cor. 9:24-10:21; Gal. 3:1-4; 5:1-4; 6:7-9; Php. 2:12-15; Col. 1:21-23; Hebrews 2:1-4; 3:6-19; 4:1-12; 5:8-9; 6:1-20; 10:19-39; 11:13-16; 12:1-39; 1 John 2:3-6; 3:6-9; Rev. 21:7-8). Even the Reformed movement believes that one must perservere until the end to be saved (Matt. 24:12). This is not clerely shown in EE.

I would recommend instead of EE using the books of Ray Comfort or Douglas Jacoby
