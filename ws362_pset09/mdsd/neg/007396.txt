This has got to be one of the worst travel books I have ever come across. It does not cover anything that would not already be obvious if you went to one of the places listed here - like not to miss the Empire State Bldg if you are in NYC or the Eiffel Tower in Paris. On the Swedish section it has the area referred to as all of Southern Sweden mixed up with an island of its east coast. Anyone looking for experiencing something special on their trips should stay far away from this book. I only give it one star because the system does not allow me to put none
