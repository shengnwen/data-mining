I thought the story of polar bear cubs finding their way would be cute, but I was appalled at this story.  When the mother bear says to her cubs about their father, "He would probably give you a hit in the head and tell you to get lost" - I about fell out of my chair.  Then she says, "One day, I will give you a hit in the head myself, and send you off to take care of yourselves."  What a terrible message to give to our children!  Do you want your kids to think this is what is in store for them?!?  And later: "The day finally came when Larry and Roy's mother called them to her, and hit each of them in the head.  'Get lost,' she said.  'Go and fend for yourselves.'"  That is terrible!  I don't want my kids thinking that is an acceptable way to treat others.  Wouldn't you rather provide positive images of compassionate parenting and loving behavior to your children?  Maybe the author has serious abandonment issues, I don't know.  But he should not be writing children's books
