I'm a big fan of Red Thunder, the prequel to this book, in which the author ressurects the golden age juvenile feel of classic SF stories like "Rocket Ship Galileo" by Heinlein. Red Thunder updated and improved upon that particular work while maintaining the sense of wonder and can-do attitude of young patriotic men who have the opportunity to do what no one has ever done before, in the spirit of the USofA. There's even a perfectly good reason why characters use "swear" words like "dad-gum" instead of the more common street language we hear everywhere today. In short, I loved it and was perfectly fine with tolerating the convenient fantasy of the "Squeeze" drive that drives the plot and characters.

Red Lightning opens a generation later and seemed promising, possibly an update to Red Planet by Heinlein, about growing up on Mars. Unfortunately, the book quickly becomes bogged-down in a rescue mission after a terrorist attack on Earth. By the time this wraps up, the book is half over and though the characters are all well-developed, the plot is not. There's no longer the feel-good spirit of "Beating the Reds to Mars", instead, America is essentially destroyed, has become a police state, and fascism has taken its place as an army invades our hero's home on Mars and it takes a bunch of magic`from the creator of the "Squeeze" drive to make some really implausible stuff happen. The ending is not feel-good, like the last one, and instead of being inspired by classic SF adventure novels, the book seemed to be more inspired by 9/11 and the Indonesian Tsunami, which are real downers
