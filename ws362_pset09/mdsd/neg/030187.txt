Jim has been in the business for a long time, but has the particular knack of using plain language, logical reasoning, and clear warnings to explain the methods and pitfalls of an esoteric art - boat building. He has that in common with Philip Bolger, Harold Payson, Thomas Jones, Parker Ruel, and Karl Stambaugh.(and others, including "Mister" Chapelle.) A generation bent on making things not simple, but straight forward and practical. You can really build a good serviceable boat straight from the book without either agonizing for months nor busting the bank. You will not end up with a statuesque ocean racer, but you will obtain a useable, user-friendly, nautically sound, so cheap to use that you will use it often, that you "made it me-self !" and even looks good
