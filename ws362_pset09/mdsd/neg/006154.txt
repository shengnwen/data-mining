I very highly recommend this book for those who are interested
not only in the public but private sides of A,B,B, and A. I was especially interested in tracing the paths each member took to
finally arrive at their music we love. 
I also learned what a difficult business selling music was and is,
as well as something about Sweden and her people. Very enjoyable
reading.
