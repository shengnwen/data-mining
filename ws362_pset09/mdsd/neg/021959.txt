I got this book as a gift from my sister, so I read it out of deference to her. But let me tell you it was a mighty painful process, and not from what you think. It wasn't from the painful realities I was hit with but the blathering wimpy self-deprecating loathing that guy exudes. When you stop whining and worrying and apologizing and agonizing about women, then you've arrived my son.....no need to waste your money on this book, better to spend it on a John Ford/John Wayne movie. That'll give you yer fill of manliness.....
