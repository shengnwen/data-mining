I am a long time beer brewer, who suddenly decided to switch to cider.
This book starts with planting trees. I didnt want to wait that long.
I wanted recipes! The section on yeast was a real disapointment, it listed one yeast not to use. Elsewhere I have read of the debate over English Ale yeasts or Champagne yeasts. This was the info I wanted.
If you have NEVER brewed this is your book. If you have ever brewed and want to make a batch skip this one, get Paul Correnty's "Art of Cidermaking". Yes its out of print and runs nearly $50.00, but its worth it
