Horrible book.
Islamic literature is distinct in that information can be classified into 'authentic','fabricated', 'weak', as well as many other categories by rigourously analyzing the chains of narration.
The author did not bother with that and, it seems, assumed that whatever he quoted from some book of history (say, Tarikh Tabari) was authentic.
Save your $$$, and buy something more credible and scholarly (e.g. Al-Bidaya wal-Nihaya)
