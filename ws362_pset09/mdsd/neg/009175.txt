Pox Americana offers an exhaustive study of Small Pox in general; however, the title leads one to believe that the focus of the book is going to be centered from 1775-1782.  Elizabeth Fenn spends the first three chapters discussing the American Revolution, but only in sparatic terms.  The first chapter is a brief history of "Variola."  Washington and the troops are mentioned only after countless anecdotes of many other people from many different time periods are written.  After chapter three, the book becomes more confusing.  Plains Indians are discussed, and I am still oblivious as to how homosexuality relates to this epidemic.  Later, the Russians are discussed as well as fur traders.  The virus spread across the entire continent, I understand this, but the book was suppose to focus on the American Revolution period, and only three chapters of the book were devoted to the main topic.  Honestly, the book should have been 134 pages because after that, the book becomes too confusing and repetitive.  Lastly, not to nit-pick, but Fenn refers to Small Pox as "Variola" throughout the entire book.  The scientific and proper form to write the name for a virus is the first (genus) initial and the second (species) written out, i.e. V. major.  The fact that Fenn repeats this rudimentary mistake so often takes some of the scholarly value away from this otherwise potentially useful study
