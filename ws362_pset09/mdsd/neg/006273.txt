The success of this book might be chalked up to the old axiom how no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people.

I was drawn to this book by it's title and central premise.  TOo bad Ben Sherwood can't write worth a lick.

I'm not sure which is more upsetting:  how poorly Ben Sherwood writes, or how low our expectations have fallen as readers, given the number of positive reviews this book has received.
