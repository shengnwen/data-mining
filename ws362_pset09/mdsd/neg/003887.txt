I have the third edition as published in 1997, at a much higher price than the current book. This book was useless even in 1997. 

The author believes in accreting, not revising. So chapter 13 was entitled "New Developments 1995", and chapter 31 entitled "New Developments: 1996 and Early 1997". In between is a disorganized hodgepdge of articles about software, medical devices, foreign filings, and so on. The style of writing is discursive, with almost no diagrams (only one chapter out of 31 has any diagrams at all) and no summaries or bullet point lists to help a busy patent practitioner. 

The material itself generally is (i) outdated, (ii) well-known to patent attorneys, and/or (iii) too disorganized and episodic to give a layperson any useful understanding of patent strategy.

I strongly suspect that the glowing reviews elsewhere on this page are written by the author's friends and family, if not the author himself. When I move to a new office a few weeks from now, this book will be heading off my bookshelf and deep into my garage -- if it's lucky.
