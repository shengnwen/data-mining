Another book that I felt had very little to offer that was not already out there. For the past fifteen years, I coughed every morning and night with disrupted sleeping and resulting fatigue. It was a breathing method called Buteyko that changed this.

That is whre this book falls - it does not explore overbreathing which is a significant part of asthma.If you have allergies or asthma- look at Buteyko. Many books exist that offer self help. These are the only ones I feel will help asthma.

My point is unless a book addresses breathing volume, it will never solve asthma. 

Do your own research.
