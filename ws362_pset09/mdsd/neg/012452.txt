This book, like the one by Deborrah Aaron, is at first promising, but ends up as mere fluff.  One such author spoke at my law school.  Her advice was a joke and a waste of my time and money.  These authors are all making money doing what?  Selling these books and helping the rest of us "find our passion" in life.  The law books are no different than any "resume builder book" you can find for 1/10 of the price.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! These law books all have one thing in common -- they take you through endless ridiculous skills assessments and other "exercises" designed to "identify your passions," "explore your skills," and have you making stupid charts listing all your best and worst qualities, etc., etc.  What every lawyer who wants out of the legal profession wants to know is this:  What are the viable jobs where having legal experience or a law degree are going to put me above the rest of the applicants?  How do I find those jobs?  What are the obstacles I am going to face in trying to get my name in front of the key hiring person?  What are the ups and downs of each career?  And most importantly, how do I go about getting my foot in the right door?  I realize knowing your skills is important, but I can do that with a standard resume builder book for much less time and money
