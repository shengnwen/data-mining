I am not sure that I will use Amazon.com again.

I am an instructor at a local college. I ordered books two & half weeks prior to my class beginning. a couple of days prior to class beginning, I wrote to Amazon asking where the books were. I received no answer. I wrote again on the day class began. I received no answer. The books arrived after the class began and I had no choice but to drive around town hand delivering the books to students who had not found the books on their own. I returned the remainder.

Correspondence is either non existant or slow at best. I found Amazon a internet site with a lot to offer, but service and communication is not one of them.
