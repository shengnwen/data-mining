I am a full-figured woman at 5'10.  I am always searching for books that will optimize my wardrobe and give me the best look possible in my clothes.  I recevied this book today and it is the WORST book I have read in this subject.  The 3 body types are very vague, not clear of what type of person fits each category (a silhouette picture would have been very helpful here). A Tankini, what is that? The same points are repeated throughout the book.  Finally, this book is written for women who see themselves as fat and need to learn how to put on clothes just to walk out of the house, not with any style or sense of self.  I will not even give this book away, it is horrible to give to someone else.
