This book contains some of the most inaccurate route descriptions in the history of guide books. The milage makes no sense by any known system of measurement. I might go so far as to say this book could get you killed, especially in the Grand Canyon. It's as if the whole thing were written using only lo-resolution maps, with no accounting for topography. I find it hard to believe the author actually took any of these hikes. If anybody does ever see him on a trail, though, kick him square in the nuts for me and my friends who had to suffer for his incompetence
