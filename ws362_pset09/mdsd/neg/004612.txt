I don't really know what to say about this book. It's shocking and sad. It has summaries of horrible pogroms and covert ops gone really bad. I think the presentation just wasn't as good as I expected. The book even seems a little emotional. Granted, the author is talking about issues that are sensitive and morally significant. It just appears frustration gets the best of him sometimes in the book and that makes his &quot;objectivity&quot; suspect
