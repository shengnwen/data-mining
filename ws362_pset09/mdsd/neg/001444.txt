I know that David Crowder is a popular musician and a fairly decent one at that.  Yet who was it that thought this man could write?  Honestly, after the first ten sentence fragments I gave up.  Am I the only one who finds this book entirely unreadable?  Does this man have an editor?  Or are the numerous grammatical errors supposed to make this 'post-modern'?  I have a thousand more questions like these, but I will spare you.  While I have respect for the music of the author I just cannot believe that a book this poorly written could have been published by any respectable publishing company.  I can't even speak for the content as I was so put off by the lack of basic writing skills of that author that I was unable to finish any of the chapters I started.  Do yourself a favor.  Go read some Thomas Merton or Kathleen Norris instead.
