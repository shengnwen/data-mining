I was notified that a new book was avalible, so like with all the other books, I preordered this. Imagine my disapointment when I opened it and it was a BLANK JOURNAL! 
I was sorry to pay so much for this. I thought it would have more info on each book. I was not expecting a blank journal to write my own thoughts in, and was upset that was not in the review that it was nothing more then a blank journal. Dissapointed. Wanted more from the book then what it actually was. will be returning it.
