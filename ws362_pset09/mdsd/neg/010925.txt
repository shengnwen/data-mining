I think Wienberg must be spamming these reviews with a multitude of user names.  That is the only explanation that can explain the four star average rating for this steaming pile of refuse.  This is a book from an era when there must have been very low standards for 'popular' technical books.  Weinberg is no psychologist, his observations are amateurish and ill informed.  This book reads more like a 'best practices' work for the mainframe era.  The most telling thing I can relate is my experience; after finishing a chapter I would read the chapter summary and not recognize a single thing from the chapter I had just read.  The most laughable part was the coverage of programming languages.  Wienberg is so completely ignorant of programming language research, even for that era, it's stunning.  AND the man had (has) the gall to write on the subject as if he knows something.  The most distasteful part of the book are the Anniversary Edition comments.  They basically consist of Weinberg telling us that, he may not have been completely correct, but wasn't he amazingly prescient for the times?  Gag.  I'll never read another book by this author
