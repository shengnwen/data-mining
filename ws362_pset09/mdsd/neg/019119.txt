It looks pretty, and has shiny pictures, but if you want to learn something new about no limit holdem, this is not the book for you.  This book is filled with Barry's opinion on appropriate ettiquette at a game, money management (nothing specific, just him saying don't blow it - seriously) and is basically his autobiography.  I play online professionally for a living (small stakes) but am developing into a pro.  I would recommend The Theory of Poker - David Sklansky.  Tournament Poker for Advanced Players - David Sklansky.  And of course Super System - 1 or 2 is the same for the NL Holdem section.  I mean no book is going to turn you into a pro, it takes a combination of things, and alot alot of play.  This book will not make you a better poker player, simple as that
