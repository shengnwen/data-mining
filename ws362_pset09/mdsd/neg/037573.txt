I was never more disappointed in a book as I was with "dream boy" by Jim Grimsley. I guess I just didn't get it. The violence was not believable and there was a bigger issue that needed to be addressed. The first 109 pages were a good start to a coming of age novel but, then it was almost as if someone told him to hurry and finish so he could turn in his paper. I mean with chapters being one and two pages long? What's that about? The book turned from the real issue at hand when Roy, Nathan, Burke and Randy set off to go camping. The camping trip and violence was the last half (86 pages) of the book. It should have only been Roy and Nathan on the trip and Nathan should have been able to tell Roy the problem between him and his Father and Roy should have been aloud to help him get the issue resolved. Like the book "Uncle Sean", "Lance" and "All Over Him" by Ronald L. Donaghe or "Desert Sons" and "Into This World We're Thrown" by Mark Kendrick. These books are good coming of age books with love and violence which is most often the case with gay and straight youths trying to co-exist in the world filled with hatred for things not understood. - Joe - TX
