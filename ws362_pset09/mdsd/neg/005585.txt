I don't recommend this book. As with most books by survial author &quot;Ragnar Benson&quot; it is full of innaccuracies and half truths. There is some basic information on setting bones, stitching wounds, and  other simple topics, but it is not very well addressed -- It's almost as if  the author has no idea what he's talking about and is simply repeating  urban knowledge thirdhand. As far as his information of how to aquire the  various supplies, there are far better, easier, and more legal ways than he  describes here. The misinformation presented here is likely to get you in  trouble. &quot;DITCH MEDICINE&quot; is a far better book
