This book should be entitled "The Obsessive-compulsive's Guide to Keeping House".  The lists of tasks to do daily, weekly and monthly were more than a little overwhelming. If you did all the things this book says you need to do to keep a clean, orderly home then you will have little time for anything else.  There are some good ideas in here, but they are overshadowed by the to-do checklists.  Also the pictures in this book are of rooms with a very sterile, minimalist look to them.  Boring.  The rooms are indeed clutter free and spotlessly clean, but lack character and warmth.  A little like living in a hospital.
I was very disappointed with this book
