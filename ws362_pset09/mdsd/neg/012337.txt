This book was not really what I was looking for.  I wanted to think about negotiation generally, and how I as a woman am approaching it, and how I can be more effective.  Although the book has some limited general advice at the beginning, almost all of the book focuses on specific situations (buying a car, getting a divorce, etc.)  Since all of the situations presented were inapplicable to me, the book was of limited value.  Readers interested in this title should check the table of contents and excerpt on this page.  I would not have picked this book if those features had been available when I bought it
