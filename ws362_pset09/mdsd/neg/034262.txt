The 365 Cats Page-A-Day Calendar for 2004 was a favorite of my family: large format excellent photographs in a sturdy holder. Everything about the 2005 version says cheap and minimal production cost: small low quality photos in a flimsy holder with text instead of cativating photos. Who wants to read a lot of useless text on a cat calendar? Where are the charming photos?
