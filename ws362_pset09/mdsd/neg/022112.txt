I put this book on my Christmas wish list, and was very happy to find it under the tree.  My excitement soon faded when I saw how lacking in basic instruction it is.  The coverage of the basics is okay, and there are some nice looking projects, but, while some of the simpler elements are explained (though not well), the reader is left to figure out other major elements on their own.  Drawings are poor and don't relate well to the actual piece  -- as if graphic interest was more important than accurately detailing what the element should look like.  I found the "WOTWS (Working Off The Wire Supply)" abbreviation used on many of the projects to be silly and slightly annoying.  In every case, there was plenty of room to spell out those five words, and if I don't pick this book up for a month or two, I've got to go hunting again (page 12) for the meaning of the acronym.  I would recommend Sharilyn Miller's "Bead on a Wire" over this one
