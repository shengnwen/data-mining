I don't know what the editor's at Aspen were thinking when they let this one fly.  Every other Aspen book I read was excellent.  This book is horrible.  It does not explain the black letter law well at all.  It offers vague examples to back up concepts that are never fleshed out in a way to make any sense.  Often the Examples questions are too vague to figure exactly what they are trying to test you on and the explanations will refer to ideas you have never discussed or to opinions in cases that as a beginner you would never have read.  There were some questions that the author assumes you will figure out from reading the actual cases but HE NEVER TELLS YOU TO READ THE ACTUAL CASES and since you dont have the cases you don't know to look into their opinions anyway.  Regardless, a beginner's book like this is supposed to help you understand the letter of the law in a straightforward way, not force you into wrangling with old American (and sometimes English) common law cases to divine what a rule is that you don't know yet.

Also, and this is what really burns me, the authors, of all the people in America who could probably write this book, have the most unclear, obstruse, and indirect writing style.  Anyone who knows how to edit would have noticed this from the start, but Aspen didn't and let it fly.  I have read 5 chapters and I can't recall anything I have learned so far (unlike all the other E&Es I have read.  Aspen, what is wrong with you people?  I am so disgusted right now I can't see myself ever paying for anything from you again.  $40 is bad enough of a rip off for poor students as it is
