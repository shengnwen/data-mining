Robert Kennedy says that President Bush is responsible for Hurricane Katrina to hit New Orleans because of global warming.  Not the aftermath, mind you, but the ACTUAL HURRICANE!  Wow, didn't know Bush was a wizard and had the ability to create hurricanes.  But apparently Kennedy thinks so.  Maybe Robert Kennedy is a crime against nature, eh
