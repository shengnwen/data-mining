If you are familiar with the usual &quot;messie&quot; terms, I would say Ms. Barnes is &quot;born organized&quot;. She talks about how she helped her mother from early on keeping up the house and a business. She  apparently was never at a &quot;total mess&quot;. If you are completely  disorganized and don't know where to start, this book probably will not  help you. There are some sections on closets and the kitchen that give you  directions on organization
