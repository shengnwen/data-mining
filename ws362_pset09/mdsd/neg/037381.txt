I've read all of the books in the Susan Conant dog series and the first cat one as well. This one has similar good traits to the earlier books -- fun malamute facts, quirky characters, etc. -- but I have to say that the person revealed to be the killer had the stupidest motivation for murder that I think I've ever read! Also, one of the characters continually sprinkles Yiddish in his conversation and as someone who grew up in Miami Beach when it was a very Jewish area, I have to say that although the words were not used incorrectly, no one but a stage comedian like Jackie Mason would use them so incessantly in conversation, especially to non-Jews or complete strangers
