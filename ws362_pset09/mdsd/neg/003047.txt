I agree with the first review (one star...). However, the book could be  useful for someone who is starting to make his way in learning in strategic  games. I would also mention that 3'5 floppy comes with the book (C code for  DOS platform) so the fact that 80% of the book is a source listing is  annoying. Begginers would find first couple of chapters interesting though
