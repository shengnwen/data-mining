I am afraid this is a far cry from the previous 3 books. Definitely not a gay romance though it does feature a gay couple who sadly does not take center stage though they are interesting characters. Eh..I can count the no. of pages really focusing on their story, 20 pages more or less towards the end. "Someone like you" resembles a day time TV soap opera, focusing on straights finding the loves of their lives, a gay man befriending straights, 1 bad guy and 1 cranky lady trying to add spice to a story which seem all over the place and of course let's not forget the characters' working lives! If this is the trend TJB's future books are going, they have just lost one fan.
