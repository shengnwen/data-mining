It was not the biggest, nonetheless, a mistake in buying this book. 
I am sending it back not bacause of 8 bucks, but to make a point.

It is a very trivial and quite hostile writing ;seems like it is aimed to put down other women (or frogs, as a female co-author calls them).  In a view that co-author is "e-mail bride" herself, it is very strange to see such aggression towards her Russian female compatriots. 
Besides, the insights into the Russian culture are quite shallow and trite. 
  
In summery, this book was a waist of time and money.
