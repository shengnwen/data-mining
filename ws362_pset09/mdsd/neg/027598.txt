Ugh!
Worst narrator ever. Strange forced affectation and laughable accents and voices. As far as the book is concerned,I read the book a long time ago and enjoyed it for what it was--a mystery/thriller--not a piece of art. I enjoyed the whole trilogy in fact. This narrator is killing it for me though. I wouldn't be able to stand another Ellroy or any author for that matter, with this guy. He might be good in a different genre but this just sounds forced and odd.
I wonder how Ellroy feels about this recording.
