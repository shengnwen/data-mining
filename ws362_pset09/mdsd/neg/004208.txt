I'm sorry, but Chicken Soup for the Soul annoys me to no end.  The stories are not original-I've seen most of them in various forms in chain letters and Ann Landers and Dear Abby.  Most of them are VERY poorly written, cliched, and dumbed down.  When I'm depressed, they make me feel even WORSE.  I'd rather read a cynical, sarcastic very nasty story that makes me laugh-and realize I'm MUCH better off!   Sorry to say, but these books are nothing but dollars for the creators.  You're better off rereading childhood classics for a pick-me-up
