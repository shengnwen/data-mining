I have always enjoyed Johansen's books but they are getting
pretty predictable with the female protagonist and the male protagonist at odds with each other, building into an
obsession and her finally succumbing to his charms. Its the same story with her other female protagonists as well. Other than a little different type of killer, these stories are as redundant as a Victoria Holt gothic novel and I gave those up many years ago for the same reason
