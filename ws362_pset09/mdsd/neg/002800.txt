This may be the biggest joke to college sports writing in history.  The fact the book was published leaves me wondering about the whole industry.  I know this guy personally from my years in college football and the problem with the book or any autobiography is the stories are told through the eyes of the writer.  With Jay's case, as with most of us, he sees things COMPLETELY different than the rest of the world.  He is so self indulged and disillusioned with his &quot;football career&quot; (I use that term loosely) he must write a book telling the lies he sees in his head.  Jay Smith doesn't know the first thing about true college or team sports, so what qualifies him to write a book to influence others about his lies.  If this book is read by a true Sooner fan, or someone who knows Jay, or even someone has the slightest clue about football, they will laugh at the audacity of his arrogance.  In fact, save your money, save your time, and don't contribute to his or the publishing company that produced this disgrace of a book.  If he truely wanted a book about the dark years of Sooner football, why didn't he acquire and use quotes from the various coaches, strength and conditioning staff, and athletic department?  I will tell you why, they would not have anything to do with Jay, because his impact in the Sooner nation was less than the Watergirls.  Yet another embarrasment to Oklahoma Football
