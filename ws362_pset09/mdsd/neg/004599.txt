An astoundingly shallow piece of work from a great historian.  The work of bitterness wrapped in the guise of a pragmatic.  Conquest's careful dissection of other societies can be quite convincing and penetrating.  He, unfortunately, never manages to apply the same precision to his own thinking.  The crux of every argument, and of the book as a whole, is &quot;all great, megalithic ideals are bad except my great, megalithic idea.&quot;  He attacks with an imbalance that undermines his points.  The book is a strange combination of intelligence and ideological bullying, which, unfortunately, makes the book almost pointless.  A good example of how attacking theory with theory nets next to nothing
