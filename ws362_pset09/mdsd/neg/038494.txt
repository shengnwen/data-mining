This book seems perfect for a light read.  It has catchy characters and an okay plot.

Actually, don't read this even as a light read unless you enjoy the "guilty pleasure" of reading novels with way too many adverbs.  Monstrous Regiment is completely formulaic, and seems to be written by a machine and not a person.  It is so shallow and badly thought out that it's nauseating.

I liked Pratchett's the Wee Free Men better.  That was easily funny, whereas Monstrous Regiment is trying too hard.  Don't read it unless you're a diehard Terry Pratchett fan.  Or a masochist, that too.

SPOILER:
By the end of the book, it's revealed that everyone is a woman.  This annoys me no end- it's predictable and yet so stupid that you have to wonder whether Pratchett was conscious when he wrote it.
