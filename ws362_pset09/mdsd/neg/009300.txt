I admire Vollman's ambition in this novel.  He is a thinker who seems to be attempting to tie together aspects of religion (Buddhism, Christianity, and Paganism . . . ); commentary on the differences / similarities of love, lust, and addiction; Capitalism versus Marxism; racism between all colors of all people; classicism; reality and fantasy; misogyny; unions; child-love or child-molestation depending how you look at it . . . the list goes on.  And this is exactly the problem with it.  The connections are vague--not subtle.  Fragments connected by tiny threads that fray as the book continues leave us suspended in a kind of weird sickness--ready to fall.  If I were Vollman, I would have let this book sit for a while and then returned to it in an attempt to clarify and condense . . . maybe map out this Royal Family to make it worth his while and worth our while as readers.  His characterizations and insight about human fraily are immaculate.  I don't advise giving up on him yet.  He has potential.  But I don't think spending days reading this will get you anywhere but depressed and tired
