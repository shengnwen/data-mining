when i accidentally picked up THE TIN COLLECTORS and found myself unable to put it down, i had high hopes for its follower THE VIKING FUNERAL.

i'm a lover of serial thrillers and was excited to suddenly begin to start a new one.

but my serial stops at Book 2.

THE VIKING FUNERAL is filled with so much of the same ol' threats and "who cares?" betrayal that it reads as if desperate to fill pages.  The beginning and the previous book's excerpt was enough to hold a reader and encourage him to continue, but somewhere on page 200 i threw my hands in the air and tossed the book across the room.

well, not so dramatically speaking but u get the idea.  if u've read TIN COLLECTORS, keep the good impression of the series u have by NOT picking up it's follower.  

THE VIKING FUNERAL could be called THE SERIES FUNERAL
