I recently attended the Ashes and Snow exhibition in New York. The show was good,if a bit reptative. Its location, The Noamadic Museum is an engineering marvel and seems more like a gothic cathedral  than shipping containers (Frankly seeing the photos in the building is a truly awesome esperience). After the show I went to book store to pick up the catalog and found it was selling on site for $130. This is way way too much money for what you're getting. Like all of the materials for sale connected to the exhibit you're paying for the presentation rather than the pictures themselves, all of which are reproduced in a much too small size. What you're paying for is the binding and while the binding might, with some better interior material, be worth $130 or more, here its simply a major rip off. Gregory Colbert has those of us who like his work over a barrel and he's going to squeeze every last penny from us. While I do like the images, I can not recommend anyone buying the catalog, or any other material connected with the show, at the wildly inflated prices they are asking.

Go see the show instead, its only twelve bucks and you get to see the glorious space they've built to house it
