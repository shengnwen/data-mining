Very, very disappointing.  I actually was happy to finish.
I would have preferred some character background as most true crime books extensively cover the character.  This had NONE!
Horrible, scattered writing.  I was having to flip back pages to see who was who.  Very disappointing, especially since I was truly intrigued by this story.  Pass on this book..
