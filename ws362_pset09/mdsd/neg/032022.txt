If you have no idea how to play craps then i will say as all other books it explains the basic bets etc.  The problem this book had, along with many other craps books i have bought is that 70% of the book is basic craps primer, 10% are about stories of big rolls, 10% is about comps and casino management and about 5 pages are about actual strategy to use while playing the game.

Drumroll please, the big strategy that will make you tons of money can be summarized in 3 sentences.

bet the pass line with double odds.  After each Pass win without a loss, press the bet up.  At the end it has you betting something like $500 on the pass and 1000 on the odds bet.  here is the problem:  

In order to get to that level the shooter, get this, has to make something liek 11 points.   I have seen some shooters make 5 or 6 points but 11 is very very rare.  

This book in a sentence:

After each pass with double odds win press your pass and odds bet.  if you lose on 3 shooters go home.
