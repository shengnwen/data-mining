I felt rather disappointed reading this book. I seems to me that the author failed in giving a convincing picture. His comparisons of the Vietmam experience and classical or Homeric Greece are either superficial or forced. I suppose that the book may attract persons more involved in the Vietnam affair than I but I am convinced that this is caused by the Vietnam experience and not by the comparisons with classical Greece
