OK - so I don't like mushrooms and the majority of recipes in this book call for them.  I can leave them out but frankly I was disappointed that many of the recipes looked to be difficult to fix.  There were not enough 'easy' ones and very many used strange parts of the deer/elk, such as brains, tongue, etc.  Since we have our venison processed and don't ask for these bits to be saved we mainly need recipes using steak or hamburger.  In this book these were in short supply
