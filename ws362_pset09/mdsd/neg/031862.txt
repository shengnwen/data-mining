I totally agree with the couple of reviews where the book was sent back to Amazon. Some of the reviews are positively glowing and just why is beyond my comprehension, The book offers (as do most watercolor instruction books)considerable  sound advice about supplies and composition etc etc etc but the pictures SUCK! It is difficult for me to believe this is a professional artist (presuming  making a living on this humdrum output.) She has a vey limited palette mostly autumnal browns and golds and mostly very small (8x8 and 12x12) pictures that are a hash and rehash of weeds leaves and branches,,sometimes a watercolor book is so astoundingly beautiful it is worth having just to admire the pics,,,well,,,not this one! Totally ripped off is the feeling given,
