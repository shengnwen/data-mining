This book is mostly hype and little delivery. The "inside" information can largely be found on the net and/or in better-written books by screenwriters of prominence. The agent and producer listings are vague and of little help. The book tells you almost nothing about "what they want" and virtually nothing about "how to win them over." All in all, it's poorly written and verbose and could have been cut down to a third of its length. Some of it is shockingly inappropriate, such as recommending to African-American writers where they can get good fried chicken in LA. In sum, it's yet another add-water-and-stir screenwriting book by somebody long on self-aggrandizement and short on Hollywood experience. I also find it quite suspicious that twelve five-star reviews here on ... were posted within a three-day period. Yeah, right
