Judging by the author's credentials and the book cover I was certain this would be a good read.  I was definitely mistaken as the author constantly rants about meaningless things completely unrelated to Hugo Chavez or Venezuela.  For example, in Chapter 4 he goes on and on in the first person about his email campaign with an anarchist in London to organize a Seattle style WTO protest in Europe.  This, like most of his pointless rants, have no purpose and must be some method to add pages for the publisher.  Save your money and just read the latest Foreign Affairs article on Chavez, you'll get more substance than this entire book offers
