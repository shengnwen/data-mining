The introduction was the only part of this book that I found worth reading.  In it, Shaheen gives an overview of racist stereotyping of Arabs in Hollywood films.  The introduction was interesting and left me wanting more details and more in-depth discussion, but the rest of the book completely fails to follow up on the expectations raised by the introduction.  

The bulk of this thick book's 600 pages is devoted to an alphabetical list of films, each with a capsule summary (usually less than a full page) of the how Arabs are portrayed in that film.  There is no detailed discussion of the content of any of the films.  So this is a reference book, rather than a book of film history or scholarship.

But, a reference work is only as good as its indexes, and the indexes to Reel Bad Arabs are woefully inadequate.  There is an index of least and most racist films and of key films, an index of alternate titles, and an index of all films by name. And that's all. There is no index of films by date, by genre, by director, writer, or producer, or by the categories of stereotypes that Shaneen discusses all too briefly in his introduction. Unless you already know the title of the film you wish to refer to, the lack of detailed indexes make this book all-but useless.
