As a Frank Miller fan I was looking forward to this book.  I already had the original hardcover the movie was based on.  I expected to see more than art from it repeated again.  The movie was excellent and visuals were incredible.  I am familiar with the original stand and was aware of the liberties taken in the film from actual history.  However, I was expecting something more informative along the lines of the books from Lord of the Rings series of artwork used.  Disappointing.
