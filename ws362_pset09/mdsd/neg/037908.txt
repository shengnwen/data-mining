We used a previous version of this book when my first child was applying to colleges in 2003, and found it helpful. The current edition was a disappointment because of obvious errors. In addition to the Stanford error, the Northwestern evaluation was completely illogical. After stating that Northwestern is "one of the most academically rigorous (schools)in the country,"with an "applicant pool that is easily among the best in the country," the book gives an academic rating of 77. That is the same rating given, for example, to St. Bonaventure University, which ranks high on the "lots of hard liquor" and "students almost never study" lists.  It is interesting to note that three years ago, Northwestern topped the "best overall academic experience for undergraduates list" with an academic rating in the high 90's.  It is now ranked more than 20 points lower. Since both reviews cannot possibly be correct, one is forced to conclude that the authors are either biased or careless. I was left feeling that I could not trust the data presented, and will be using a different book for reference when my second child applies to college
