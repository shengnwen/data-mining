This is the eleventh or twelvth Pratchett book I've read, and it is by far the worst.  That's somewhat misleading, though, because it's the only bad Pratchett book I've read at all.  

I'm not australian, but I did catch on to many of the australian references.  The problem was that most of them weren't funny.  Pratchett's humor has always lain with the insight and subtlety with which he makes his cultural references and satire tie into the situation at hand.  However, in The Last Continent, there is no "situation at hand".  The story rambles on and on, seemingly without point.  People and things come and go without notice or reason, often simply to fit the motif of australian references.  The story of the wizards and the story of Rincewind don't converge until the very last pages of the book, and the convergence is not even explained (how rincewind knows to find the cave and then to draw in it).  The reason for Rincewind's problem is not explained at any stage (why the librarian changes shape, why the wizards' presence in the past is causing the present to shift at random, why it doesn't rain, etc).

The humor that does exist in the book is shallow in nearly every case.  Often it's just inane bickering between the wizards, which elicits cheap laughs, but doesn't grab one's attention.  The humor isn't structured at all, which is Pratchett's normal approach.  In his other books, the humor develops around some reference.  Here they are mostly just one liners.  In The Last Continent, the only time this kind of humor develops is on the topic the wizards' sexual repression, which is entirely unrelated to the story's problem.

I strongly recommend other Pratchett books such as Jingo, Small Gods, or Reaper Man for a much more sophisticated example of fantasy satire
