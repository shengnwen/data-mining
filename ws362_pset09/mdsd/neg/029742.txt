Decidedly, I do NOT like Rose in Bloom.  I love all of Louisa May Alcott's other books, but I don't like romances, and I could tell in the first few chapters what was going to happen in the end of the book.  I love Eight Cousins, but I have no fancy whatsoever to Rose in Bloom.  I think that anyone who likes romance and the older Rose Campbell will like this book, and I think anyone who does not will share my opinon
