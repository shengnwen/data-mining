When she is good she is very, very good, but when she is bad she is horrid. And this time Ms. Shreve is indeed horrid. I have read most of her books and they are extremely uneven in quality. I have noted that Ms. Shreve is at her best in her period novels such as "Fortune's Rocks" and "All He Ever Wanted" and I found the story within a story of the Halifax explosion much superior to the main story of "A Wedding in December". This novel is unbearably trite as it has been done so many times before. A group of boarding school friends who have not seen each other in 27 years gather at an inn in the Berkshires owned by one of the friends to celebrate the mid-life marriage of two of their number. All the cliches are present - one of the friends turns out to be gay, another is suffering from breast cancer, there is a deep dark secret surrounding the death of one of their friends back in their boarding school days. The novel revolves around a series of revelations and discussions of the road not taken. All of this is very ho hum. Depite what others have said in their reviews for me the truly interesting part is the parallel story of a young doctor who witnesses and participates in helping those injured during the explosion in Halifax when two ships collide in the harbor during WW 1. I hope that one day Ms. Shreve will develop this much more interesting story into a novel
