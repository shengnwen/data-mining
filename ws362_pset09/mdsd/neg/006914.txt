If you want real logos and business sign designs, forget it! If you want 'upscale chic modernistic' european disco artwork-then probably that's what this is! Nothing from North America-very limited in color usage, etc. Bulk of what we looked through was no different than the unused CD's of 'artwork' we got with an old 100,000 clipart design set!
I would NOT recommend this to anyone thinking this will give them good layout and design ideas to show USA customers...unless they are opening a modernistic computer age boutique..
