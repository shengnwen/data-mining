I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent.  This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading.  The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful.  I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed.  I ask you  how many women do you know that use a term like "skirt hound" for a man who chases women?  I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me!  It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue.  Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one
