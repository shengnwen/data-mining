I hate this book. I wanted the apocylipse, i wanted world war watever the people in that book had gotten to. I wanted the Phalanx Nations to reign death and destruction upon the unsuspecting populous of Yonwood. Instaed, i got a crazy old lady, and even crazier old lady who should be arrested, and a whole town full of otherwise crazy people, acceptign a few people of course.
