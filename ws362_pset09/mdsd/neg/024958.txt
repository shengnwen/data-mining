Word of Honor was so poorly written that I found it hard to finish the book.  Instead of telling the story through one character, the author jumped from one character to another not allowing the reader to identify with any of the characters.  Reading Word of Honor was more like watching TV instead of reading a book.  The conversations between the characters were corny.  I felt like I was watching a poorly written TV soap opera.  The Christian message was dominant and preachy instead of being informative.  The Christian message seemed forced instead of a natural part of the story line.  If I wanted a book that preaches along with a good story line, there are many good books out there that are much better written, ie the BIBLE
