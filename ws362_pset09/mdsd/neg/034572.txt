Very elementary, could have been written by anyone; including a priest. No &quot;blow you away&quot; secrets here. All common sense, with a couple of stupid tips to make sure you get arrested, such as approaching police in other countries and bribing them to find cocaine sources. Thought it would be an interesting read of an experienced trafficker, instead it was a short, &quot;thrown together&quot; book of common sense. Almost unreadable, don't buy it. All the 5 star reviews here are most definitely friends, or the author himself
