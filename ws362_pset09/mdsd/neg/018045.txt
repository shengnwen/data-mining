I'm a big fan of Gibson from Burning Chrome forward. But this one was dreck. Gibson explains it clearly enough in a note at the end of the book when he attributes the book (or a chapter--it's not clear) to fans in Mexico City. The story has the feeling of fan fiction--take the parts from previous works and mix them together. The story is flat; the characters are flat; the novel reads like a story proposal for the publisher. sigh
