If you want to read one book on a Christian response to the post-modern cultural phenomenon, I don't think this is the one.  They survey a number of theorists on post-modernity, but they do little to convert jargon into English.  They offer a modest contribution by suggesting the obligation to acknowledge a &quot;call&quot; to be stewards of creation in response to God's &quot;gift&quot; of creation, but I'd suggest you read Walter Truett Anderson's &quot;Reality Isn't What It Used To Be&quot; for a first-hand account by a thoroughly post-modernist and then pick up Dietrich Bonhoffer's &quot;Cost of Discipleship&quot; for the Christian response part of the equation
