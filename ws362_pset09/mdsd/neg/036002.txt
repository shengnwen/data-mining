I can't believe that the original price of this book is $60! I got this book for $24 when amazon had a 70% discount on it. And I still regret paying that much for this book. Even if the discount on this book was 90%, it still won't be worth it! 
The explanations in this book are very complicated. (I probably shouldn't call them "explanations" - "complications" would make alot more sense!) You would read the paragraph over and over again to just get a hint on what Mr. Gollmann wants to say. If Mr. Gollmann's intention was to sound vague and ambiguous as much as possible, he succeeded! 
The book doesn't draw clear boundaries between the different terms - for example, you won't get a clear idea about the relation and interaction between "security policy", "security mechanism", "security system", "security model", "reference model", "access operations", "access permissions", ... etc. It's as if Mr. Gollmann's objective was actually to confuse the reader rather than guide the reader towards clear understanding. 
Many ideas could have been presented in a much simpler way, but the author chose otherwise! Plus the book doesn't include enough examples to clear the fog. Mr. Gollman just slams the reader with dry unreadable material. At the end of day, you are left confused, having many unanswered questions, feeling that you got very little out of the much you've read, and wishing you never bought this book
