Okay, the title is a bit harsh, but I expect a little more from a travel guide of this region.  This book is a little campy and its fair to say that travelers over a certain age group will revel in its tales of highway adventure.  I'm of a tougher crowd and think the book fell short in its attempt to convey the true glory of coastal California and the desert byways. I read the book feeling like my dad was with me on a trip, driving us to places to see, but not experience. Two and a half stars would be most fair.  
Review every book you read- authors deserve your opinions, not just elitist critics.
