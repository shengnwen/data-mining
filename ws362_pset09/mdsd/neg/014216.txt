Supposedly well-researched book about liberals and their negative affects on america. Lots of emphasis on black peoples's problems in the 1900's in the good USofA. The writer claims actor Danny Glover is sweet looking. Huh? Glover is one of the harshest looking peiople in cinema. Also, the author gives his ridiculous anger at not being able to hail a cab in NYC full credence. Sure since Glover made movies he owns the whole world (or at least all america right?). She also claims America increased the use of lawyers mostly to help black ameriacns in legal trouble. Clarence Gideon, who got everyone US-arrested to have a free attorney if so desired, was white. 

The author has a lot of facts to support her case of what a catch 22 racial situations in the USA are but biased statements like those above wreck her entire book. If blacks in america in the early 1900's had it so rough why didn't so many of them just move to Haiti? Ever think of that, Mona?
