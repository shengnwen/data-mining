From the moment I picked up a copy of GUILTY PLEASURES and started reading it, I was hooked on Anita Blake and pretty much devoured the succeeding books. Anita became like a friend and I simply had to know what the author had in store for her, hence I used to pick up the next book as soon as I get to the last page of the previous one. Sadly, this series also proves that all good things must come to an end as we see in the decline of the quality of Hamilton's writing after OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY. 

When I write reviews, I do like to summarize the plot. However after reading INCUBUS DREAMS, I was stuck trying to figure out how to begin my review. The problem is that this book has no plot, even though the back cover may suggest otherwise. This is so far the lengthiest book in the series, but there was hardly any of the kick-as* action that I have come to love in the other books, especially the first few. Ask me what I liked about the other books and I can go on about it. Ask me what INCUBUS DREAMS is about and all I can remember is that Anita spent more time feeding the ardeur, which meant getting down and dirty with any man that was available several times a day, whether in private or in front of her numerous male friends. I am certainly no prude but the sex scenes in this book were simply gratuitous and boring. Anita has spent more time on her back and knees than killing those monsters. I miss the old Anita whose sarcasm and no-nonsense attitude I found entertaining and actually endearing. Will someone please tell Ms Hamilton to bring her back?

I will not ramble on much further, but I can tell you now that MICAH is actually worse than this one. I still have DANSE MACABRE to go, but I am leaving that for much much later since I am not sure I can handle any more of Anita's sexual antics at the moment
