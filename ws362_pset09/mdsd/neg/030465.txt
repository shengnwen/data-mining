I recently went on vacation and chose this book to be the one that I read while sipping margarita's by the pool and wondering how my fantasy team was doing. The title and back cover intrigued me since I figured that it was a response to Moneyball. Although I lean more towards that side of the argument, I was curious to read a well-written counterpoint. Not a great choice. 

The book is basically made up of chapters that select several Braves and looks at how they were drafted and how their progression through the minors went. In between thoughts or at the end of chapters, the author would throw in a line about how stats didn't mean anything when looking at Player X, it was all scouting. Well, maybe. But HOW? The author writes at length about Chipper Jones before he was drafted and shows how the Braves were trying to make a last ditch effort to convince Todd Van Poppel to sign. When they coudn't convince him they went for Chipper because he showed "toughness". Hellooo, he was the concensus #2 and the Braves still preferred Van Poppel. The Braves lucked into Chipper.

Chapter after chapter about each player was the same. Player X had skills, player wanted to play for Braves since he was a kid, Braves steal him in the draft, player makes the team or is used as trade bait. Nothing about the loads of players that every team drafts who amount to nothing. The secret, evidently, is to draft players who want to play for you. That's the one and only scouting tip that the book serves up over and over. 

In the end, whether you agree with Moneyball or not, it was insightful into the "why" Beane et al think they way they do. Nothing here was explanatory, it was simply put out by someone upset at Moneyball who wanted to say "Me too!"

It gets two stars because all things baseball related deserve a read
