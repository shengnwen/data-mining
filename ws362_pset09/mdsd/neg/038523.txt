I have 2 small businesses. I own rental property and work freelance. I'm also a professor, so I receive a pay check.

This book slides over some important and expensive details. For instance, it barely mentions that a home office must be used exclusively for you business. According to the tax man, it cannot be the guest room, too. And the author suggests setting up a trust to protect assests, without discussing the cost (not small) of that. These are just examples. Since there are problems with the information I have experience with, I wonder if the information I'm ignorant about is correct
