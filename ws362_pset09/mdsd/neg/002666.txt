Being a professional (10+ Years Experience) I am constantly looking at new Photoshop books. The software is so extensive that one may never really master it completely.
This very thin book, translated from French, presents eight (8) projects from start to finish. Unfortunately, there's a lot of overlap among them, primarily compositing images and retouching. Only a couple of the projects are interesting. Even more unfortunately, not all of the projects even make sense. (One project corrects intentional mistakes so severe that "a professional photographer would never get away with such grave errors." Why learn how to correct garbage that you'd re-shoot?) One project manually creates a panorama and includes an editor's note saying that you could more easily use the Photomerge option within Photoshop. Also, since this is a French translation it isn't very accurate and the American and European versions of PS aren't necessarily the same. The only positive note is that the design and layouts are nice to look at
