The writer is great with dialog and funny prose but she really missed them mark by casting a newf as the demon.  As if that wasn't bad enough the newf does not even have newf characteristics, which could have been inserted...really bad premise.  If you do buy the book start reading around page 88 for enjoyment the first 88 pages are dry and unnecessary waste of time. Really disappointing
