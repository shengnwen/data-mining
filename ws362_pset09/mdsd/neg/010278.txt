quindlen's advice here is certainly pretty sensible stuff, though i think any reasonably intelligent person could have come up with something just as good.

my real beef is with the price of the book in comparison to what you get.  the book is only 64 pages long and half of those pages are pictures with no text anywhere on the page.

so, being charged $12.95 for a 32 page book, and a pretty small one at that, strikes me as beyond ludicrous, even if the content is pretty good.

i'm just glad i checked it out from the library instead of buying it
