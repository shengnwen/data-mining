When I saw a book covering the exploits of Navy SEALs in Iraqi I thought it was far too soon for anything interesting to be declassified.  I was very right.  Mr Couch's book probably does the best job possible without offending Navy censors, but that still makes for a boring book.  Less than 10 operations are covered, and even then many of the details were left out.  The rest of the book is filler with information about training and command structures.  Maybe in 10+ years Mr Couch will be able to write a more interesting book about Mid East SEAL operations when the information is released to the public
