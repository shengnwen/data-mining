I can't quibble with Mann's choices for great one-hit wonders, and the book is fun to flip through; it brings back some good musical memories and he does unearth an occasional interesting fact.  But there are problems.  First, the writing style is poor; phrases like "By the way," "Incidentally," and "Ironically" are sprinkled liberally on virtually every page.  I'm guessing the publisher didn't want to spring for an editor.  Second, the author's idea of research seems to have been to park himself in front of his computer and surf the web, hoping to come up with enough details to fill a book.  Too often, he relies on padding (like telling us what was on the chart at the same time as the song--which gets old and repetitious really fast considering how many of these songs came from the late 80's and early 90's) instead of concentrating on the song or the artist.  For example, he repeats the common claim that "99 Red Balloons" has an anti-nuclear message, but spends absolutely no time discussing the lyrics.  He tells us that songs like "Life in a Northern Town" and "Tubthumping" have quirky and interesting lyrics, but they get virtually no analysis at all.  Finally, and worst of all, he gives no criteria for his ranking.  Clearly, it's not based on statistics like chart life or sales, since "Macerena" and "You Light Up My Life," probably the biggest one-hit songs of all time, are absent from his list.  It would be nice if we had some idea of how he came up with his list.  Like my review title states, this would have been a fun web page, but as a book, it is eminently disposable
