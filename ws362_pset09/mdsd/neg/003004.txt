I bought this book interested in reading about how people would react in a post-apocalyptic world.  Instead I read a soap opera.  As one reviewer wrote, the first 200 pages are spent introducing the characters and what a boring 200 pages they are.  Unfortunately, it doesn't get much better from there.  Instead of outlining how resourceful some of the characters are in order to survive, the authors are preoccupied with race and sex (more characters than you can believe are more worried about sex than where they are going to get their next meal).  If you would like to read a good post-apocalypse book take a look at Alas, Babylon.  A little dated (cold war) but a much better read than this
