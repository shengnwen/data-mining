Wood is unnecessarily hostile to Franklin, strugling to dispel the images created in the Autobiography rather than understanding their impact and relationship to history.  it is a useful book for raw information, but when it comes to analysis of that information, I put far more stock in H.W. Brands' The First American.  Brands better undertsands Franklin's gradual coming to a democratic consciousness while Wood only finds contradiction in Franklin's change of mind
