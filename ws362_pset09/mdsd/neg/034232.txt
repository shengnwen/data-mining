THE BOOK WAS VERY SHORT AND DID NOT EXPAND VERY MUCH IN A LOT OF IMPORTANT AREA'S...THIS COULD OF ALMOST BEEN A START UP BOOK FOR ANY TYPE OF SMALL SERVICE BUSINESS.  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE FACT THAT SEVERAL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LISTED WERE EITHER NO LONGER FUNCTIONING OR NEVER DID.  THE CONTACT NUMBERS AND WEB ADDRESSES ARE ALL DEAD ENDS.  THE BOOK DID HOWEVER HAVE GOOD POINTS ON OUTLINING THE START OF YOUR BUSINESS (HOWEVER GEARED FOR SOMEONE WITH A LOT OF MONEY TO START).  I ALSO THINK THE BOOK BARELY TOUCHED UPON THE AREA'S OF HOW TO ATTAIN LICENSE'S AND PERMIT'S.  OVERALL I WAS DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS NOT A TOTAL LOSS, I LEARNED A FEW THINGS THAT I WILL PROBABLY USE IN THE START UP OF MY BUSINESS
