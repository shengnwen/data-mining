Early on in the introduction pages the author blows off Gelato, "I'll leave it to the Italians".  She mostly ignores custdard based ice creams to concentrate on "American Ice Cream", spell that Philadelphia style ice cream.  Well, okay. to each their own.  Then she includes recipies for cookies, cakes, etc., which have nothing to do with my ice cream maker.

I think ice cream lovers are better off buying the Williams-Sonoma book.  If you want a reprise on the old Cooks Ilustrated ice cream book look into the latest Cooks Illustrated Best Recipies book.  It has a great synopsis of their original book, it is far less expensive than the $99 used book sellers are asking for the original on Amazon and offers some great food recipies as well.
