This book is well edited and the articles she's chosen are fine, it's just that I was expecting the content of the articles to be suggestions and guidelines as to putting a garden together and not the thoughtful philosophies that Valerie shares.  If you are looking for more of a gardener's journal with some beautiful pictures this book is perfect for you.  If you want help in planning and planting a garden, look somewhere else
