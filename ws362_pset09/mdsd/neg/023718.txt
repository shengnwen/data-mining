Perhaps my expectations were too high?  Martha produces a beautiful magazine and her new Best of Weddings book is superb so I thought that this book, although older, would be a nice addition.  I was disappointed.  Although the book was published in 1999, it seemed even more outdated than that.  The flowers used seemed repeated over and over again and the book was centered completely around the varieties in Martha's garden. For a more thorough view, I'd like to recommend 2 books in place of this one.  Jane Packer's Fast Flower Arranging is fantastic and shows beautiful arrangements that can be made quickly even by a novice.  For actual, technical &quot;how to&quot; steps and design theory, I'd recommend Judith Blacklock's &quot;Flower Arranging&quot; (might be called Teach Yourself Flower Arranging in some indexes).  Once you know proper floral design techniques, you can use any kind of flowers (NOT just those from Martha's garden) to create beautiful arrangements
