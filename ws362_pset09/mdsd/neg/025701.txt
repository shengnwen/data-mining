This book was a disappointment... Yes of course McCartney is talking about travel photography and gives a few -good- advices but the book is a real pain to read. She keeps talking about herself and how great she is and how many countries she traveled and another couples of very useless stories. Also some points are very discutable.... p23 "You don't have to be handsome or beautiful to be a successful photographer, but you should strive to be as physically attractive and well-groomed as you can be."
To conclude, there are very few photographies, B/W, outdated and some of them not very interesting at all.
