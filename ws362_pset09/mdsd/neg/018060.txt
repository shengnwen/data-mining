This book is barely bigger than your thumb.  It doesn't even look like the picture on Amazon's page. If you are over 30 buy a microscope - you'll need it to try to read it.  It won't lay flat to use a reference.  The author should sue the publisher for incompetent packaging of what most others describe as a good book.  I wouldn't know; I can't read it
