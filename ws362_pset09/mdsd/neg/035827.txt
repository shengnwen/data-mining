I purchased this book for my sons who LOVE the Backyardigans show.  This book has these tabs that you pull out and slide back in to change the pictures.  It is difficult for even an adult to do, let alone a child.  Even me and my 5-yr-old had a hard time with it.  The first book we purchased was defective and we did send it back and got another one.  (Amazon handled the return fantastically!!!)  The second book is destroyed after less than a week from the boys trying to slide the tabs to change the pictures.  The tabs are flimsy, and again, you have to READ THE DIRECTIONS to figure it out!!!  If you don't pull the tabs out to the "stop sign", it gets all jammed up between these cardboard pages.  
I would definitley NOT purchase this book!!!  Even the story line was boring.  My 5-yr-old was like, Mom, that's it.  Get the book, 'Here Come the Backyardigands' instead.  This book has colorful pictures with raised surfaces for little ones to touch and feel
