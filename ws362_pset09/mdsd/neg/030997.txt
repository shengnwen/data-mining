The list of issues regarding quantum mechanics is of great use. However this is one of the worst books ever written for presenting clear explanations of those issues. Since it is written for no other purpose than to grind an ax it presents a rather skewed point of view and uses the explanations of such issues as Bell Theorem, the two-slit experiment and Schrodingers Cat, to ignore inconvenient arguments and to muddle the discourse. Primarily Wick wants to discredit Bohr by stating that both he and his followers did not understand their own arguments in the debate with the naive realists as represented by Einstein. This is devolves into a mere matter of censoring the discourse by presenting only one side and is of little interest in the actual debate. This trick very neatly allows him to even present opposing views that are actually germane. He also attempts to discredit the Copenhagen interpretation by assigning it a metaphysical status and then attempts to replace it with metaphysical arguments that favor realism by such ideas as the not much lamented pilot wave. He rather glibly denies credibility to the many-worlds theory, another bit of metaphysics on the par with concept of Jehova. How he picks and chooses his metaphysical explanations to replace other metaphysical explanations is entirely a metaphysical mystery. He gives very short shift to possible counter arguments, especially the most persuasive issues such as Godels Theorem. The value of the entire book rests solely on its list of issues, but at no point does it rise above propaganda, statement by fiat and censorship into the arena of actual discourse. As such, any real use of the book strictly depends on how critical an eye it is read with. It is entirely up to the capability of the reader to supply the missing elements of the issues in question, to supply better or more clear explanations, and to supply a more balanced view
