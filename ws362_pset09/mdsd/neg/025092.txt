I found this book to be offensive.  On page 2, the author acknowledges the language differences of the process (toilet training vs. toilet learning).  As a reader, I understood her position and was comfortable to progress onto further pages.  As I continued reading, I was content with the author's writing until I accessed Chapter 4, where she discusses the positions of experts and references some of their works.  On page 47, she references the controversial book of "Toilet Training in Less Than a Day," by Nathan Azrin, Ph.D. and Richard Foxx, Ph.D. and that their "program was devised not for speed, but to help the retarded learn this difficult skill."  I think the term "mentally challenged" or "developmentally challenged" would have been more appropriate.  In spite of my shock that someone would write a book and refer to those with special needs as "retarded", I continued on until I accessed Chapter 6, "How Can I Train My Child Under Special Circumstances?"  Under the section "Using Public Restrooms Alone", the author discusses what she considers "supervised" use of facilities.  She states that a parent can stand outside the door while the child uses the facilities alone.  She states that a parent can "ask an appropriate-looking man to take the boy into the restroom while you wait outside the door. (Same for situations with girls, Dad.)" and to "only let a child alone to one that is in shouting distance or in view."  In a world where pedophiles are lurking in such areas and seize those moments when a child is alone to harm them, I find that advice to be completely irresponsible.  At that point, I could no longer continue reading this book and take advice from someone who would make such irresponsible suggestions.  I would rather have my child in diapers for the rest of her life!  Over 275,000 copies sold -- I wonder how many of those were returned, as mine was
