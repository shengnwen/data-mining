Whilst Alexander story is certainly impressive, this book is certainly far below my expectations.  It lacks style,  good dialogues,  an intelligent subplot (his life was interesting enough not to make the novel a bore) a  good description of the other protagonists.  One thing is certain: a good  (and expensive) marketing campaign (such as the ones that Stephen King has)  can sell a lot of books, and make its author famous,  but will not  transform him into a good on
