I was very disappointed in this volume.  There is little real data here or in-depth illustrations.  You are much better off getting some of the books indicated in the bibliography, though I'm surprised it does not mention 'Sunburst' by Mark Peattie, the Japanese Naval Air Arm companion to 'Kaigun' by Evans and Peattie.  You would be much better off just going to the combinedfleet.com website and printing up the unit histories and operational descriptions.  A number of Japanese sources that are readily available have much more detail.  Perhaps it would have been better to just translate them into English.  Unfortunately, a poor effort
