When I first read the synopsis of this book, I thought that it would be an interesting read.  After the first 20 or so pages I was not sure what I had gotten myself into.  The writing style seemed awkward and the phrase "I'd like to know" came up so often it became extremely annoying and at times out of place.
Writing style aside, the premise of this book was very similar to the movie and series "Stargate" but less interesting and more confusing.  The book itself seemed to be a mishmash of different stories and ideas.  The book never seemed to flow.  Sometimes the story went quickly and the reader was left trying to figure out what was going on.  The author created situations without any explanation and many times I was left to wonder "how did that happen?" 
In other sections of the book, the author seemed to drag on forever.  The longest subplot in the book seemed to be an odd take on Slavery in American and Colonial History.  It seemed out of place and more of a rant on black and white culture and relations.  
This book was so odd that I never could figure out what the author was trying to accomplish in writing this book.  Of course, Williamson did leave an open ended ending which leads me to believe he was thinking of writing other books about the different subplots he created.  In the end, who knows?  All I know is that after reading this story I am not inclined to purchase another book from this author.
