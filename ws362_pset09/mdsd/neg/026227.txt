I was so excited to get this book. As a movie lover, I was hoping to find some really good chick-flicks within these pages. However, this book was not what I thought or hoped it to be. Most of the movies were fairly common and not all of them were the classic "chick flick". Actually, there were a lot of movies that were wonderful that were not even included in this list.
