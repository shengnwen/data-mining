The main goal in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is not to actually complete the game, but to get 100 percent in the process, and that is a difficult thing to do without a guide. Problem is, this guide isn't perfect and there really aren't many out there that are perfect, so this is the best there is.

Basically, it's a run-down of mission after mission as they become available, with a few sections along the way detailing side missions, the weapons and vehicles, and plenty of maps. The problems, however, come with the actual layout of the book. Instead of having appendixes, each section kind of runs into each other, and the Odd Jobs section sits directly in the middle of the book. It makes it very difficult to reference. Another problem, and this one is huge to me, is that there is one huge typo of a map in the "Las Venturas" section. None of the horseshoes in that section are right and are actually about a half-inch to the right of where the strategy guide indicates them to be on the map. It was a frustrating thing to discover and one I'm happy to share here. And finally, this book is filled with spoilers.

The sad thing is, like I said before, there aren't many options. This is the only real in-depth strategy guide that can be found for San Andreas, and one I think is absolutely needed in order to make an attempt at 100 percent. So, if you have the game and want to attempt this, then I would recommend this guide. Just be prepared to be disappointed along the way, as at times this guide just isn't helpful at all.

Pros and Cons:
+ A big book with no introductory chapter; it gets right into the game
+ Does well to lead you through the story in proper order
- One major typo in the middle of the book
- Poorly constructed
- Has lots of spoiler
