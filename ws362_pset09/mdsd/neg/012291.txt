First off, you should by the Pedaller's Paradise instead of Lonely Planet.  It can be found for about 12 NZD in New Zealand (but is also available through Amazon for a bit more if you can't wait).

Dangerous - The profiles (ie. graphical descriptions of hills) shown in the Lonely Planet Guide are drastically over-simplified.  On a good day, this is only just very annoying.  On a bad day, it could mean being out in the cold wondering just how many more hills are before the next stop.  It is obvious that the writers did not use bicycles to research the routes.  Nor did they use GPS or any other precise means of measuring elevation.  They were very lazy about how they threw this guide together, and it will get you into trouble.  Avoid it!  

Buy the Pedallar's Paradise instead - it is a fraction the size, half the cost, and packed with useful information
