   Zlata's Diary was very disappointing because she kept saying the same thing over and over and over again. The ending was the same as the beginning. All Zlata basically said was, "Oh no the first day there was no water or electricity!" Then the next day she would say "Yay it's back on!"
   Again, I think that there could have been a little bit more variety of things that happened. I think that if there was it would have been a much better book.
