I thought this book was about real horseplayers. You know, the 5% winners that we all here about. I was really looking forward to learn what the big time players do. NOT ! This book was more about which race track has the worst hot dogs and sleaziest people.The new book, "SIX SECRETS OF SUCCESSFUL BETTORS" is much more of what I was looking for. "Horseplayers" is not for serious players. Can't recommend.
