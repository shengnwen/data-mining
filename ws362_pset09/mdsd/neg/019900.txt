I read Himmelfarb's book hoping to gain some insight as to the "moral decay" that so many talk about...what I found was:
a) simplistic values and generalities overstated,
b) many "moral deficiencies" undiscussed, and
c) no solutions.

Her book reads like a long-winded essay that hopes to impress because it uses big words and has lots of footnotes to show she "did her homework."  Unfortunately, she uses statistics selectively and only when they help her point (using the phrase "But statistics don't tell the entire story..." far too often).  She also cuts references' contexts, so that her point is made (even if the reference is not quite on the same line of thinking).

After completing the book, I must admit that it's a wonderful thing to always be right.  Had a black, single mother written this same book, it would never have been published.  Connections help!
