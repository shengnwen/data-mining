Adults would never choose to read this garbage. It would be seen as masochistic [...] and too depressing to bother with. Raise an animal, get attached to it, but the reality of farm life is that if it can't successfully breed, you personally will have to butcher it. Heck, why should your dad do it for you, when we can reinforce that valuable childhood lesson of "Life sucks and then you die"?

What is the real point of this book? Do teachers everywhere get a vicarious thrill at the horror kids must experience when reading this stuff? My kid asked me to read it aloud to him when he couldn't take it anymore, and I got to the point where I hurled it across the room. Between this and all the other depressing books we make kids read, are we surprised when they are cynical goths?

AVOID THIS BOOK, if you love your kids
