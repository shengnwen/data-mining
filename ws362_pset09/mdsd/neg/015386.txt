Racism is just common sense. Some races are superior to others in certain areas. Blacks are intellectually inferior to whites and Asians. This was so obvious as to be non controversial in the time of early America, even to those who opposed slavery as this book makes clear. This truth is no longer important however. How people feel about themselves is more important than anything now. Truth can NEVER be suppressed for long however. Egalitarian dreamers should know that and know that the time when a book like this can be taken seriously will not last long I'm afraid
