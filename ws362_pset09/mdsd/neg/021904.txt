Much of what Col Hunt has to say is quite interesting and I agree with his views and arguments, however, the book is more like a +200 page rant and rave than a well written book.  I felt like he was just complaining most of the time about what's wrong with politicians and he offers "simple" solutions to all of our problems which are entirely unrealistic.  It's a good example of why are our government is not run by the military and why we need civilians ultimately in control.  A great man, who has served his country with great honor, but in my view is not a very good author.  Ultimately, I did not enjoy this book, and struggled to force myself to finish it
