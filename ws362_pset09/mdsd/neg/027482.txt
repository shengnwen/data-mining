We got this for our kids who are big Pirates fans. This toy should never have been released, it's a piece of junk to make a quick buck from the movie.  It's a junky non-functional ripoff of the classic Viewmaster concept, and while my kids (3 & 6) can work Viewmaster, this telescope in no way works--there are several MAJOR design flaws.  The disks holding the picture don't center so the pic won't show up, the disk pops out when you try to turn to the next picture and won't stay in if you so much as move the telescope, you can't even see the picture unless the telescope is totally collapsed (which is tough, since the wobbly piece of junk won't stay shut).  And IF your kid can get all this stuff right, you are rewarded with... A BLURRY barely visible image. I've bought a lot of toys and don't always expect perfection, but this is seriously the junkiest hunk of *$#* I have ever purchased.  Whoever churned this out in time for the P.o.t.C. marketing blitz has surely never met any kids or any quality control personnel.  I wish I could give less than one star.  Thank God the designer of this is only making children's toys and not airplanes or cars
