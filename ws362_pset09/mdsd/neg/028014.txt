I'll be the first to admit that the Carlyle Group seems to "work" the system...perhaps even abuse it to profit from their "connections" to goverment.  And yes, they've done a few thing most people would find to be inappropriate.  However the author's case would have been much more compelling had he simply stated the facts and not editorialized so much.  The result makes you feel like it's a crackpot conspiracy theory.  His liberal use of adjectives and obvious melodrama to make us think something horribly sinister is afoot made me bitter toward journalists, rather than his intended target, the Carlyle Group.   Typical of the news media today: he couldn't just report the facts...he had to color it with his political (or paranoid) biases
