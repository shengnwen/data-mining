Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.

I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.  

I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness. 

This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?  

With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.
