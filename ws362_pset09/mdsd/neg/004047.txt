This book reads like it was written by a first grader.  I know it's a children's book, but the text lacks any sort of originality or imagination.  The first two paragraphs are repeated throughout the entire book, with only a couple words changed.  It seems like these days, you don't have to be a good writer to write a children's book, you just need a cute gimmick
