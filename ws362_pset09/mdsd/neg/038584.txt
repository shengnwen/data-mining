I have both books this one and the U.S. Army Survival book.  The military book is so much better even if it is 14.95.  I read the reviews on the military book but I got this book first because it was cheaper and I wasted my money.  They say you get what you pay for and they are right.  Buy this book if you just need to spend money.  Buy the military version if you really want to know about survival.  Think about it who better than the Army.
The title of the book may confuse you but check out the "real miliary book for 14.95!" Much Much better
