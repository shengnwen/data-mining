One thing that is missing from these reviews - and indeed from the book itself, for the most part - is the acknowledgement that his father, Stephen Levine, is actually a well known Buddhist author in his own right and not merely some irresponsible Hippy, an unkind judgment that another reviewer here has made. This has much to do with why he was able to go on exotic pilgrimages, meet the Dalai Lama and get this book published. Noah and I moved in the same circles almost a decade ago, during a period of time that he writes about in this book. At that time he seemed to me very sweet and sincere. He was well thought of by people that I respected, at least one of whom appears in this book. I knew that he had been down a difficult road and thought it admirable that he seemed to have pulled himself together. In light of all this, I was somewhat surprised by the tone of self-cherishing that pervades this book, tales of service and selflessness aside. I'm sure Noah means well but, in truth, should probably have waited until he was a bit further down his path (read: Mature) to tell his story. If you want to read about Buddhism from a Punk perspective, read Brad Warner's Hardcore Zen instead
