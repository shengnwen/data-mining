But ... maybe this book is required after all.  I mean, the last 3 books were written as if Stephen King threw in whatever ridiculous thought popped into his mind, so maybe we do need this to explain what the hell he was thinking!  One reviewer wrote in his review that this book is NEEDED, not something that you just want, so I guess I may be on the right track after all.  Now that I look closer, I see that this lofty Concordance was published in 2003, which means that it only focuses on the 1st 4 books.  Ah, the good old days, when the Dark Tower series seemed so good and before King's creativity was knocked out of his head when he was hit by a van.  It's true, you know - just compare the 1st four books to the last three and you'll se what I mean
