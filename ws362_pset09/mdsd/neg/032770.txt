I honestly can't believe that the other two glowing reviews are for this book. They would more likely describe Jefferson's War which I recently read and enjoyed a good deal. 

This book seems to be written by an academic elite who doesn't clearly describe the events of the time in overview. Instead he gives a cloudy and partial image of what was going on through a bunch of obscure, minor, news clippings and plays from the time. Worse, it's chopped up into several dis-joint chapters, each of which read like an essay by his grad students who are tyring too hard for an A, making up for a lack of research with a plethora of rambling analysis. If I hadn't read Jefferson's War which chronologically goes through the events I would have been completely lost reading this book. 

If you want to learn the history of this time, with romance, action, adventure, exotic lands, swashbuckling, amazing and interesting facts thrown in, etc. read Jefferson's War. If you want to listen to an academic make convoluted pointless arguments -all the while passing modern judgement on the views and values of the time- then this is your book. The irony is that the author was audacious enough to put the word obscured in the title of his own book . . .
