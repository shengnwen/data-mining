From a male/air sign perspective, let's just save some time and cut to the recurring themes:

Male = Air sign/Fire sign = selfish = Bad
Female = Water sign/Earth sign = caring = Good (Except too much = weak)

Thinking = Bad
Feelings = Good

Mixing the terms Venusian and Martian when talking about the zodiac and male/female is confusing though.  Venus rules both Libra (masculine) and Taurus (feminine)
