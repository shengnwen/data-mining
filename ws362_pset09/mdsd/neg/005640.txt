First in a series, BENEATH A BLOOD RED MOON by Shannon Drake is a paranormal romance that's a cross between vampire melodrama and a police murder-mystery.  Spanning 200 years, it follows the lives of the mysterious Montgomery heiresses, rumored to be vampires, contrasted with the modern-day love affair between a cop named Sean and the latest Montgomery heiress, Maggie.  Sean is also the lead cop on a series of gruesome murders committed by a serial killer imitating Jack the Ripper - and who somehow is connected to Maggie.

I didn't particularly care for the story ... and my list of complaints is long.  The book is actually a quick read and keeps your attention, but I felt it was too melodramatic (and cheesy), especially the prologue.  I also didn't like the author's writing style; she wasted a lot of time on unnecessary "fluff" details and dialogue, none of which pertained to the plot or romance.  The plot line itself was interesting, but I was rolling my eyes way too often to enjoy it and had figured out the major secrets long before they were finally revealed.  The happily-ever-after ending was also wrapped up too nicely, with no explanation as to how "the miracle" happened.  All in all, it was an unsatisfying reading experience.

FYI: Erotica writer Angela Knight's THE FOREVER KISS or JANE'S WARLORD both handle these themes much better, the former being about vampires, the latter having a time-traveling Jack the Ripper.
