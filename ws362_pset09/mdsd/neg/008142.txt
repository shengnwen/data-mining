This book is hardly the ideal "mad scientist in suburbia" tale. It was read in one sitting...literally. I did not move from underneath the covers of my bed, but my wanton lethargy was not the result of an example of riveting literature. The book didn't need to go atilt on the BSA. Wasn't a rant--WAS a distraction. The tale just wasn't very interesting. Pragmatism must acquiesce to the rapture of dark allegory, and morbid chuckles were my anticipation. Look at the title; how could I reasonably anticipate anything else?? BLAH
