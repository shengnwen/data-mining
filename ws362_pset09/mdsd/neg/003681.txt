This book on the black market makes a case for going back to views popular in the 1960s.  In the 1960s, the black market was populated with cold-war spies and gun running free-booters.  Since then, the popular press has painted the black market as a drug running paradise.  Naylor tries to convince us this image is a lie.  The real black market criminals are capitalist executives in the military-industrial complex.  Defined in this manner, 'Wages of Crime' becomes a traditional left wing vehicle for brow beating those unwilling to genuflect before Marxist-Leninist dogma.   This critique is not limited to attacks on the US political establishment.  At one point Naylor laments that Gorbachev's generation 'forgot its ideological roots'.  On another page, Naylor describes the proletarian interests in South East Asia.

The reader won't find the standard pulp crime stories here, which is a blessing.  Unfortunately, the book relies on rhetorical flourish rather than statistics. Thus, it simply substitutes one stereotype with a second.  

The text was pulled from independent articles, so the flow is sometimes uneven.  For example, a chapter seeking to debunk the political might of heroin/cocaine dealers tries to convince the reader that drugs are of marginal economic importance.  He complains that the published estimates of drug dealer wealth are too high by perhaps a factor of 100.  In another chapter, rich drug dealers engage in crimes with military-industrial complex.
