I was misled by the title of this book am disappointed.  This book is NOT for individuals who want to take their investing to the next level and start trading options on the open market, as I had expected -- rather, it is for people who are offered stock options through their employer.

If anyone knows of a good beginner's book for trading stock options, please clue me in
