This information is extremely important and mostly unknown except to historians. The problem is that the author jumps around across time, continents and topics. If one were to stick to the atrocities committed by colonial Germany in Namibia alone, it would have been enough to fill a book . Unfortunately, the author rather chose to cover this topic as well as: 1) The fate of Black citizens in Nazi Germany, 2)The  Black experience in Nazi death camps, 3) The treatment of Black GI's in World War II and 4) The Tuskegee Airmen !   He might have been able to cover all of this if these topics were organized into chapters or even time periods but alas they are not. As such the book is very difficult to follow and digest. One can feel the enthusiasm of the author as he tries to convey important facts but it is much too much to assimilate. It deserves a re-write with more facts, less emotion and a more organized approach.  All of these stories must be told but not in one book
