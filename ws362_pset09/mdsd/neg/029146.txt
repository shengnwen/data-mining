First of all, Merlin is supposed to be a "good" wizard, but for some reason he's evil in this book. The books prologue was stupid as well, the author talks badly of books and how she can't believe she wrote one or something like that...i lost interest in this book by the time i read the first two pages, but I read on until the end just the same. I nearly always finish a book. I love fantasy books and stuff about magic and all, but this book is more about dark witchcraft kind of stuff that is just completely satanic and stupid. It's a book for pagan wiccans and people like that.
