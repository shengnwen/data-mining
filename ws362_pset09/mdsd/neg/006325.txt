After the first 20 pages of the book you will already have heard everything the author has to say, it's all about racism and sexism.

It's good to see someone exposing on the fact that anti-sexist, anti-classist and anti-racist thinking is shaping the way many things are handled, some good points are made in this book but the truth is that once you have read 20 pages you have read the whole book, all it does is blame the same factors on everything and I found myself skimming thru the 3 later chapters trying to find something new to read about, but it just keeps on going on the same thing.

This book may be novel and insightful, but the author lacks the writing skills to put it together into a coherent and readable essay on the subject.

not worth buying, not by a long sho
