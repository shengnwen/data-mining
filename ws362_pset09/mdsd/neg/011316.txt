My daughter brought this book home from the school library and started to read it aloud. I was appalled at the first sentence. "Jim's dog got killed by the garbage truck". Of course, that immediately caught my attention. I wasn't sure she was making up the sentence! I thought WOW. I didn't think it was at all appropriate for a first grader in general. This book should be used for a very specific purpose. Perhaps maybe if the first grader was in a situation where their pet died but not for leisure reading at all. The book's characters display isolation and aggression; verbal and physical. I considered the entire content of the book very inappropriate
