Others have already said it better, but good God this book was awful. Predictable plot, stilted conversation, forced attempts to show knowledge of pop culture. What's with the random Demi Moore bashing? I bought it for 50 cents at a garage sale and overpaid. There's 6 hours of my life I'll never get back
