I wasn't sure if I was reading a new novel, or just re-reading one of several of the last Catherine Coulter novels I've waded through.  I think that I am truly sick of the big, strong man caring for sick, injured woman bit.  The story was dumb; there was no real mystery.  I love the &quot;Song&quot; series and most of the Sherbrooke Brides series.  This was plain disappointing
