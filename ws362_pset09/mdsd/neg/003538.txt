i haven't read the book because in the table of contents there is no track?

Major ommission.  Sprinting is a major sport.  It also causes numerous injuries - hamstring and hip tears and pulls.  

I was going to buy this book for my nieces (15 and 16 yrs) - track stars.  I was also interested as i am a sprinter as well.
