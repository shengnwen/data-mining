I am a Disney fan. From my other reviews, you can see that I generally praise the various Disney products highly. However this book is a disappointment.

The book is basically poor quality for the price. A list price of $50, even a little over $30 on Amazon, should give you a book with high standard printing and packaging.

The main problem I have with the book is the low grade, basic printing. The "dust cover" is cheap plastic, black with a clear area to see the front cover art of the cover.

The front and back covers of the book look cheap - basic art with cross-hatching. I've always disliked that type of cross-hatching and associate it with a cheaply made book.

While the binding looks sturdy, it still has a basic "book club-ish" look to it.

The paper of the pages inside are lesser quality. The thickness of the paper is OK, but the color of the paper is off-white, brownish. I don't know if Disney Editions was trying to make the pages look like an old comic book, but - for me - the pages should have been a pure white, considering the price of the book.

The pages are amateurishly bound - the left edges of the pages are cut off or are very close to the book. This is especially noticable on the comic cover pages where part of the cover art is missing. The borders of the pages vary, especially on the inside where you almost have to break the binding of the book to see all the art of the inside panels.

I do not have the original comic books to compare this book to, but the art and coloring is not as sharp as I remember. I've seen the Snow White comic pages reprinted in other books with much nicer sharpness in the coloring and the art.

I used to collect the Disney comic books, so I am glad to have these stories in reprint form. But I'll always be disappointed in the quality for the price. If Disney Editions attempted to publish a quality product, they failed miserably.

My opinion is DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE THESE REPRINTED STORIES!
