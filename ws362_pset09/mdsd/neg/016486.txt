Utter nonsense. How else does one describe this? 

A few erudite critics have already pointed out that with which I concur and on which will elaborate slightly: The "math" that's used is set up to find the answer the author desires. The elaboration: You could also find a similar "code" in anything, including, say, the US Constitution, or--hence my title--"Winnie."

This is a classic example of we humans trying desperately to find a pattern where none exist. Don't waste your time with this foolishness
