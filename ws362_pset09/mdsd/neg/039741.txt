The best thing I found in this book is the picture on the cover. Well, actually the uncropped version in chapter 5. Beyond that, I found everything else to be non-practical from a design perspective. A photo of a filthy dust collector area when discussing the advantages of central collection or electrical wiring that would never pass inspection is typical. I'd rather see plan views of real shops that work with reasons for the decisions made
