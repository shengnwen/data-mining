i've been reading the reviews for this book, and I wanted to offer up my own opinion.  I first read this book as part of my high school 11th grade english cirriculum.  And as a warning to others, I just wanted to say that reading this book was like watching paint dry.  There is no structure, and after a while it seems like your just reading page after page but are retaining nothing.  Though there are some very interesting funny parts in the books, the overall dullness of it all overpowers the good.  At some points, I wanted to claw my eyes out in despair.  
I admit, I do love Mark Tawin, but this is in Noo sense, his best work.  
Ones again, this is just my opinion.  Read it and see for yourself
