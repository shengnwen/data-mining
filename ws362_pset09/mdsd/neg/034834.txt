We received a set of 3 Junie B Jones as a gift.  We read Toothless wonder together.  I was really SHOCKED that a former teacher would use such horrible grammar in a children's book.  "we ran real quick to the window" , using "me" instead of "I", using words such as 'worser' and 'worstest' and "ain't".  This is NOT what you want your children learning.  It really is a shame because the story was kind of cute with a recycling theme and that the tooth fairy recycled teeth into baby brothers.  A much better series is the Magic Tree House series of books-adventure and history/geography, proper English!  If you are looking for humor, even the captain underpants books differentiate between the comic books that the boy characters are writing with incorrect spelling and the real narrative that has correct spelling.  The Junie B. series presents the narrative as if it was correct.  I had to use a highlighter and correct all the grammar--EVERY page of my son's book has corrections on it.  Really sad that a teacher would write this
