As a licensed private pilot I have often dreamed of doing just what the author did, i.e. rent a vintage airplane, take a whole summer off and fly around the entire United States. So, when I saw this book I bought it immediately and settled in for a vicarious thrill. 
 Unfortunaely, the author describes almost no contact with the local people and only passing mention of the scenery he flies over. His mission apperars to be simply to touch down in every State and then fly on to the next airport; mission accomplished. He lands, goes to a nearby restuarant, has a hamburger (&quot;it was good&quot;) and flies on.
 There are many writers out there who have traveled the USA by motorcycle, car or boat (see William Heat-Moon's &quot;River Horse&quot;)and have managed to write a fascinating account of their adventures. This book is very cut and dry and left me wanting more. Maybe someone will take the same trip some summer and write a book worth reading
