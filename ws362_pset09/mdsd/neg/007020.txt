This is by far the worst business book I have read in recent years.  It is hard to believe that Andy Grove actually thought that this material was worth putting into a book.  As other reviews have said, this book at most should have been a short article in Business Week...but even then it would require some actual content to make it worth reading.  The best part of the book is the quotes on the cover from Steve Jobs et al.  It makes me wonder if they even read the book
