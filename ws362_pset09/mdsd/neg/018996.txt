I found the information in this book extensive, but for experienced Internet investigative P.I.'s this book is redundant.

Just for a test I sampled some items in the book and they were on the Interent, and easily found with keyword searches.  It was also lacking good information on computer forensics investigator contacts, and how they support general practice PI's.  "Digital Evidence" IS THE problem for the PI in the 21st Century.
