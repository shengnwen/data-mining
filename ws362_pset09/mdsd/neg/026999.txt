I'm sick of all the snobs going on and on about what a great, classic epic this is.  If this book were written today, it would never sell.  The fact that it's old and now an esoteric topic makes people feel like they're a more astute reader for being able to talk about it.  I wrote this kind of stuff when I was in 5th grade!  The characters have very little depth, nothing is explained, and the view of character's nobility changes.  In addition, this story was copied down by christian monks and therefore has a christian tilt to it, which further clouds the morals of the story.  In summary, it's not good; it's just old.  Want to read some really good fantasy?  Read George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones.  You won't be dissappointed
