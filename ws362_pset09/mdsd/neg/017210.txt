I first became interested in bell hooks, with her impressive way of outing hypocrisy among her contemporaries of academia. Then I realized she is much like them, but much louder. Of all the sanctimonious darlings of academic  priviledge who are publishing books like this nowadays, hooks is perhaps  the least talented author. As a feminist I am pleased to note that she  really has had a beneficial influence upon contemporary feminism on  campuses, pointing to the mixed blessings of white feminists from  priviledged backgrounds who must also combat patriarchy. However, hooks is  so full of herself that I don't think she realizes what a sloppy and  predictable writer she is, echoing other people's opinions without noticing  that she can do nothing except assume or reject their opinions of her. None  too talented, but a live wire, at least within academic communities
