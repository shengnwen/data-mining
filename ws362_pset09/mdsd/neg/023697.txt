This book falls short in the presentation. It does not include any information on topologies for SMPS over 500 watts and its only reference design of any high current bulk power supply is a current mode controlled 280 watt Half-Bridge converter which can be scaled but it does include a lot of information on basic converter design. If you are looking for information to assist in the design of high power smps then look else where, this book will not help you. A better choice is Switching Power Design by Abraham Pressman.
