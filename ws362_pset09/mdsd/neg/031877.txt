This book seems to have a wealth of information and includes a CD with numerous forms, the Word documents are very useful.  The PDF forms are not.  The problem is none of them are editable.  Why even include them?  Why not creat them in Word format?  This is unsatisfactory and a complete waste of time.  Why even provide the forms electronically if you can't customize them, you might as well buy a book with the paper forms and photo copy them
