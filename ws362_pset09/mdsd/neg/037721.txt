I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that Dave Marsh's preachiness and know-it-all attitude really is a detriment to this book.  Before I Get Old is well researched and thorough, the only problem is that it takes all the life out of what is one of the most exciting and dangerous rock groups of all time.  Marsh really fails to capture the early days of the Who, because he seems to judge everything as the elitist American reviewer he is.  In other words, he has no sense of humour and doesn't capture the essence of what made the Who what they were.  Pete Townshend is quoted at length, and he can be a real bore, he does his best communicating with a guitar in his hand and writing great songs of angst, rebellion and rage.  Marsh has done some good work here and there, but he is totally out in left field with this one, he really captured nothing of The Who
