Though this book reads like a series of feature articles in Seventeen magazine, no theories are explored or conclusions drawn, and the author makes a few gag-inducing statements in the beginning--In an attempt to distinguish herself from the typically silly girls in the sorority rush piece, she compares the surfboard-swinging boys of L.A. to the intellectual Manhattan boys she'd chatted with the night before who &quot;jousted over interpretations of Joyce. &quot;-- it does have some merit. It is often informative and brings awareness to some rites of passage that are not widely experienced. The pieces about the debutante ball and Burning Man festival were particularly enlightening to this somewhat typical, Midwestern, working class girl.
 
 I can't recommend this book as anything more than a light afternoon-at-the-pool read or as filler for a bathroom magazine rack, but I do still recommend the author. Don't let this lackluster effort scare you away from reading anything else by her. I'm halfway through her novel, &quot;And Now You Can Go&quot; and it is wonderful..
