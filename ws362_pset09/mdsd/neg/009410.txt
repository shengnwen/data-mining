The layout and content of this book is perfect for the individual who basically understands project management but wants to forego a more massive text to pass the IT Project+ exam. The frustrating thing is there are way too many errors in this guide.  I found a number of individual questions where the answer key was just plain wrong.  Not to mention that there are a few whole sections where every answer in the answer key is wrong.  I guess someone changed around the sections but forgot to change the answer key.  Since this is the main point of this concise guide, I cannot recommend it
