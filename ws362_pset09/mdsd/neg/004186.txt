This was rather dry reading. It didn't go into much of the character of the players or much indepth reporting that marks many such books. It was little more than one could find with a few online searches.

But for those unfamiliar with the Astors it would be a decent place to begin. Perhaps the fact that the Astors themselves were rather dull and didn't do a great deal made it hard to write about them. As a writer myself, I can appreciate this.

Unlike many wealthy people, the Astors were not really a productive lot but were, in fact, simply greedy and not too bright. About all they produced were some hotels and slum dwellings. And the famous "Mrs. Astor" gave lavish parties and determined who was on the four hundred. By today's standards they were not exciting or important players. They were simply old line snobs.

At least such people as Carnegie made for an interesting story.

Having read this book I doubt I'll read any more about these wretched people --- the Astors
