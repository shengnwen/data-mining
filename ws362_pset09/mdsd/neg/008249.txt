An appalling book.
Boring, poorly written, poorly edited.

Try Algorithm design manual by  Steven S. Skiena or  Thomas H. Cormen's Introduction to Algorithms or Kleinberg and  Tardos'
Algorithm Design or the excellent Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms by Anany V. Levitin  instead of this mish-mash
