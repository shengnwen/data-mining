I am shocked to read the reviews on this cookbook.  It's terrible. The pictures are beautiful, and the food looks wonderful, but the cookbook doesn't hold up.  The recipes will call for ingredients that are not in the ingredient lists, and you have to know how to cook to use it...for instance, it will tell you to use 3 slices of ginger, but won't tell you to peel the ginger first.  Elsewhere, it says to "bring to a simmer and simmer" when it means bring to a boil and simmer.  We tried 3 recipes, all of which bombed--2 of them were too spicy to eat, and I love spicy food.  This is a horrible cookbook.  I can't figure out why Donna Hay is such a popular cookbook author.  The only cookbook I ever threw away was her Fast Food cookbook for similar reasons, and this one is just as bad, although I did hear the Sticky Chicken and Parmesan Chicken recipes were good.  Try them first
