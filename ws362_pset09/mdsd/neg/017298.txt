Soothing bedtime stories - what a great idea!  I was looking forward to listening to this CD, especially considering all the great reviews.  Unfortunately, I found most of the tracks are Dr. Estes *talking about* stories rather than telling stories.  There are 10 tracks on this CD.  I did not expect the 38-second introduction to be a story.  However, of the other nine tracks only four, in my opinion, are actually Dr. Estes telling stories.  Those four are "The Sleeping Beauty", "The Lion and the Mouse Fable", "The Jumping Mouse Tale", and "Winken, Blinken and Nod".  Also, listening to these stories, or at least the style in which she tells them, did not help me relax or fall asleep.  For me, when I go to bed I basically want to relax and "turn off" my mind.  These stories did not help me do that.

If you really want a CD that will help you relax and fall asleep, I recommend "Your Present: A Half Hour of Peace" by Susie Mantell, or "Journey into Deep Relaxation" by Doreen Blumenfeld.  Those two worked for me
