This books seemed to be based on two assumptions about history writing that are outdated and superficial.  The two problems come up right at the begining with Farber's description of new year's eve in 1959 and what the  three famous people (Ike, head of catholic church in USA, and MLK) were  doing that evening.  This book falls into the trap of looking at the  sixties independent of its context as well as taking a top down perspective  that ignores the local political movements that really move history.  He  redeems himself slightly with a nod to the fifties and the local activists  in the 60's that really led the way to social change but it is too little  too late.   I have not seen a synthetic view of the 60's that is able to  adequately show this overall context as well as give due credit to the  underlying social movements.
