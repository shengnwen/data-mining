The book offers good introduction to Flex 2 and includes many tips as well.  But the big problem for this books is the writing style.  The examples are usually modified/enhanced examples from previous chapters.  But the authors relentlessly go through each line changes with a huge paragraph; it often looks something like "remove this line, add this component, and save".  A usual half page worth of content is bloated to 3, 4 pages of tedious step-by-step instructions.  I personally would prefer to see the code changes between 2 versions directly, something like a side-by-side code snippet comparison would do the trick
