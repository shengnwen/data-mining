Let's start with being the nephew of Sigmund Freud.  Mr. Bernays witnessed the coming of the industrial revolution in full and his ideas were thus shaped believing that even men operate only as mindless automatons in the larger machinery of society.  The author believes that people are incapable of forming their own opinions due to the complexity of modern life.  Heck, these hickams from Topeka just came off the farm. Surely we in the elite must help them make their choices.

This is the tone of Propaganda.  Keep in mind that also during this time other similar misinformed ideologies were being incubated by Bernays contemporaries like Hitler and Stalin.  There is in truth much commonality between all three of these mens views.  All ideologies are dangerous and there seemed to have been a great number of squirrely ones developed at the beginning of the 20th century.  Bernays does have some karma to pay as this book was used by Hitler and the Third Reich as a kind of manual on how to deceive the masses.  And the Third Reich is not the last homeland to use Bernays ideas
