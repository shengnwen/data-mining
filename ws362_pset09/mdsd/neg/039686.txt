I'm astounded at all of the positive reviews for this book.  I bought it primarily because it came highly recommended in a pamphlet by Norman Vincent Peale (a noted Christian pastor) that I ran across entitled "There's Success Magic in You".  It speaks about setting specific goals in life in order to succeed. 

With this recommendation, I immediately order the book and couldn't wait to read it.  Red flags started going up immediately upon reading the first few chapters.  There are endless examples about our thoughts having the power to change the actions of people and things. A few examples are:

1) Being able to determine the roll of dice just by concentrating on the appearance of certain numbers.
2) People causing warts on their body to disappear just my thinking about it.
3) A fisherman catching fish when no one else could because he "mentally got down where they were and told them to hook the bait".

This is not the bedrock Christian attribute of faith.  It's something else....magic....mysticism....who knows.

Another annoying thing is the braggadocios manner in which Mr. Bristol repeatedly tells us how successful he became and how much money he managed to accumulate.  As a Christian, I believe in a sovereign God that doesn't necessarily desire that all people be wildly successful in business or be filthy rich.  I can think about quadrupling my salary all day long, but it doesn't mean it's going to happen.  God may have a much more humble will for your life.  Am I saying that prayer and an all-powerful God can't change things in life? Certainly not.

As a previous reviewer noted, this book has been subject to some weird revisionist editing.  References to 747 jumbo jets are a little suspicious considering that the maiden flight was in 1969, some 20-30 years after this book was written.

In summary, "The Magic of Believing" smacks of the fallible "Name It and Claim It" philosophy plus some other mystical beliefs.  Think hard about avoiding it and maybe you will
