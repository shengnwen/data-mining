I bought this book because it advertised that examples and code were on the included CD. Wiley (current publisher)has apparently removed the content without removing the promise of content in the book, on the cover, or in the advertising. I tried to contact Wiley and the author, but got no response from either. Lack of promised content makes this book useless as a weekend crash course
