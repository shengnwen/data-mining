I was intrigued by all the reviews here and I am generally pretty open to any kind of mind-trick / soul-searching experience, even if it comes packaged in a box or a book. But I should have known better -- anything that needs this much hyperbolic mystery raised around it should be approached with caution. Clearly this thing worked for the people who praised it in reviews here, but it did not work for me or my companion and, frankly, we found the psychological explanations to be lacking in depth, profundity or any insight beyond the grasp of any remotely self-aware person. For the most part, we felt that much of the text was filler to make the book lognger and thicker. A good chunk of this book, for instance, is dedicated to testimonials by random celebrities discussing their Cube experiences. Some people might be interested, but it was not for us.

Judging by all the good reviews, this thing is actually doing someting fun for someone, but if you are the type of person who has low tolerance for fluff, you will find this amusing -- to a point, but, ultimately disappointing.

P.S. The book does not actually provide you with any decent instructions as to how to play, which, I think, is another hit against it. You will be asked four questions -- make sure to either write down answers -- or have a very clear mental picture of all the details it is asking about
