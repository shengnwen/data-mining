but it ain't no great shakes either. OK, Homes doesn't like LA, and for the same reasons many don't. But she's the novelist, and she's the one who got asked to write the book, OK? That's no reason not to like it. What's far more revealing, though, is that Homes apparently had no idea of where to go in this book or how to organize it, so she just kind of jumps all over the place, even going to a first-person interview format in places, which is pretty disjointing to the reader. The other thing is that, upon reading this, you understand that Homes is nearly as neurotic (some would merely say nuts) as a lot of the characters in her books. Her abberations and just plain weirdness are right out there, and, unfortunately, they're nothing to be boastful of.
She talks about the hotel as if it's a sacred place, when all it is is another exorbitantly overpriced LA hotel that has a tad more charm than some others.
AM, stick to fiction. And maybe some therapy
