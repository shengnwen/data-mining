The content of the book is fine, but I am puzzled by the authors' decision to publish yet another book on this topic while they have covered most of the topics in the book "Foundations of Financial Market." I ordered both, only to be disappointed to find this out the hard way. I call on, or even strongly demand, the authors to do the right thing to pull one of the books out of circulation, to avoid confusing the readers.

In school, we learned of academic honesty, don't so-called professors or acamdecians follow the same code
