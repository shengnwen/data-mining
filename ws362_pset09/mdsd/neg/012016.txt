I am a person responsible for creating several orginal books, created out of nothing, adding to the public good, inspiring many, creating all kinds of jobs. I COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE with this Professor, another communist loosing himself and his ideas on our society. Why should my creation be at some point given away free to who, other publishers who can then publish it and make ALL the money. THERE is no such thing as FREE in this world, expect apparantly to overly idealistic Professors who do not live in the real world. Instead of only lengthening the term of Copyright for twenty years and then giving my creation away, they should let me and my family own it forever. Of course if this Prof actually created something that really connected with society and sold for decades I wonder who he would want to keep any earnings it might make. When is the BIG SCHOOL MONOPOLY with all their pie in the sky professors going to stop blaming BIG BUSINESS for all societies evils when in this case my copyright is all I have to support my family. I suppose the next book this nitwit will write will be about how all property owners and home owners should not own their homes and property but they should be open and useable and `owned' by all.
