An awful lot of people are making an awful lot of money dishing out what amounts to either common sense or drivel. Here the author requires almost 300 pages to state what could have been said in 5 to 10.  If this is an example of what passes for substantive executive training than heaven help us.  Borrow the book from a library if you must, skim a couple of the pages and you'll have all of it.  Don't waste your money
