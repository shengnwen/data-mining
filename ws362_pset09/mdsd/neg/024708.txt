For the right audience, I'm sure this is a fine work.  I was not the right audience.  I wanted a book that presented the cartoons, with perhaps minimal commentary, and let me decide for myself.  Instead, this provides pages of commentary and, actually, very few cartoons (94 in its 282 pages - I counted).  If you're looking for a treatise on the myth of freedom of the press, using a few cartoons as case studies, then by all means look at this book.  Just know what it is you are buying, and know that less than a third of the pages in the book actually show the "Killed Cartoons" that the title promises
