I bought this book not knowing what I was getting myself into. I wanted to throw this book away. Maybe it just wasn't my type of book, but it just was NOT enjoyable to me.
Some of the descriptions went on FOREVER when the author was describing something that could've been done in one or two words in my opinion.  
Don't get me wrong, there were some enjoyable moments in the book, but overall, I was thoroughly UNimpressed.
I think what drew me to the book was the title.
I also was going to get one of his other books, but decided to try one, then see how it goes from there.  Now I'm skeptical about trying another one.  It took me forever to get through this book, and I was not satisfied at all
