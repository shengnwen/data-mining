The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring
