I am terribly sorry to have to write this, but the author of the book is obviously not orthodox. Most of the recipes use matzoh meal and one even had FLOUR!!  Orthodox jews don't use matzoh meal, or any vegetables that cannot be peeled. We don't use spinach, strawberries,etc.,  or matzoh for cooking or baking.  We use potato  starch for baking. It can't be used in the same quantity of flour because it's much thicker.  There wasn't one single recipe using potato starch! For me, this cookbook is useless
