Native Son is a book that I was required to read for school. I had high hopes for the book , but they were dashed as I read on. The writing style is extremely sub-par. Wright struggles to get his point across succinctly. The book is characterized by muddled and repetitive narrative. I kept trying to like the character of Bigger throughout the novel, but I was unable to do so. His apparent lack of remorse for his actions is apalling. The argument that his fear and society is the cause of his murders can only apply to his murder of Mary Dalton. His willingness to profit from the murder and sense of pride about it afterword is sick. I see no literary value in this book. We read it because in public schools today we are forced to read literature about how America is racist towards blacks every year. Schools try to jam the theme of racism against blacks down our throats every year in an effort to "emotionally move us" and make us feel guilty for something that occurred long before we were born. I assure you that this book would not have achieved the title "classic" if the author was white. In America we ignore the plight of other ethnic groups and focus solely on the cause of the African American. I get the point we studied it enough already.
