It's unfortunate that Ms. Rinfret doesn't write as well as she designs.  The photos of her work (and her work) are excellent, but the text is sophomoric at best.  The number of self-aggrandizing "I" statements led me to abandon reading midway through the second chapter and just peruse the photos - which is the only reason to buy this book
