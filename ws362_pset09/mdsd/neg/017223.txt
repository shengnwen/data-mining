The only reason this gets one star is because zero stars is not an option.  I will concede that the content is good, but the delivery is so bad that the tapes are almost useless.  My problem is that he simply speaks SO fast it is impossible to follow him.  Then, the breathing is too much.  He is talking throughout, and is completely out of time with the breathing.  Even if he was in time, the breathing is just not right.  In a few places I got the impression he was just providing filler to stretch it out to six tapes.  Your money is much better spent on any of Richard Sutphen's materials. This is garbage by comparison
