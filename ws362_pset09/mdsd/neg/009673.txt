I'm a little baffled by the previous reviews because I don't see how this book rates 5 stars.  As a climber, I think Lynn Hill is a role model to look up to but as a reader, I could barely get through the pages.  Also, this may seem like nit-picking but for the record, dinosaurs were never caught in the La Brea tar pits since the fossils recovered here are only roughly 30,000 years old
