In my opinion Ms. Mayes is doing for the literary world what Thomas Kincaid has done for art.  

I was absolutely entranced with Italy after reading UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN.........and equally so with BELLA TUSCANY.  I must admit that while I truly enjoyed the photographs contained in IN TUSCANY I was less than satisfied with the written content.  I feel that the passion Ms. Mayes felt with her first book, and so openly shared with the readers, has wained with each successive book and she is nothing but commerical at this point.  

I feel she has allowed celebrity and money to corrupt her art ..... much the same as Mr. Kincaid.  So, when will we see the Bramasole tea towels or the Cortona coasters??
