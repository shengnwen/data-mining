I have serious misgivings about the facts presented in this book.  The original French text was written in the 20's.  I was given this book as I am working on a masterwork on the cultural history of Olives and Olive oil.  In this respect she often jumps to the wrong conculsion, and makes broad judgements that have been discounted by anthropology since the 1960's. For instance she lists oil stores in ancient Babylonia as being olive oil.  We know from further scholership that this would have been sesame oil, and that olive oil was a fuel and not a consumptive in that culture at the time.  This causes me to question the entire book.  This may be an interesting read, but at least with respect to Olives and Olive oil, there is much better out there
