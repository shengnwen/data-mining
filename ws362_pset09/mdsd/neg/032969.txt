This book reads as if it was a term paper for a high school sophomore.  After reading Adams by McCullough and Jefferson by Ellis, this book was so bad that I ended up pulling my bookmark and leaving in on my return flight from Vegas.  Skip this poorly wirtten book and get the Washington biography by Ellis
