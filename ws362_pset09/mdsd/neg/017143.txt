This book is not anywhere near the level of Bruce Bawer's While Europe Slept and Melanie Phillips' Londonistan, on the same general topic, the Islamization of Europe. Berlinski's writing is really a series of intermittently readable would-be magazine articles that, alas, were bound between book covers. In contrast to Bawer's book which skillfully ties each chapter to the Moslem problem in Europe, Berlinski fails to communicate with a unified voice and point of view. When she insisted at one point that she is definitely not saying most Moslems are disloyal, she lost me. Phillips wrote, on the contrary, that the evidence suggests most British Moslems support the terrorists. In the chapter on interfaith efforts by the mayor of Marseilles, Berlinski actually asks the mayor if his exclusion of an extremist imam from membership in the council is at odds with the spirit of the interfaith program. The mayor naturally took umbrage, and Berlinski failed to realize why her question was impertinent. She doesn't seem to know what she stands for, and neither does the reader.
