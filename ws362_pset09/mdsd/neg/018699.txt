The advice he gives is totally absurd!  If a guy came to where I was working and greeted me with "Hey Good Lookin!" and handed me a cheap teddy bear, I'd think he was a sexual predator! 

 Maybe this stuff works in some places, but in the Midwest, you'd really creep people out.  I mean..."hey Good Lookin'"?  Ewww
