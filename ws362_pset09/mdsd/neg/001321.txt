Koontz is one of the best writers of fiction today, but Cold Fire and Hidaway are two of his worst books in my opinion.  Not much there.  Readable but I would check these out from the Library before you add them to your collection.  Ironically I own Hard Cover copies of both of these books.  I made the mistake of buying them when they first came out because I was a big fan of his other works.  I don't own  much fiction in my library and I would gladly swap these two books for Hard Copies of Dragon Tears or The Bad Place.  I will trade both for a Hard copy of Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon
