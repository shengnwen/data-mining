This book is written by an avowed Marxist, and as such, neglects to mention the horrors of Soviet Russia.  Not only that, Ol' Eric discusses how horrible capitalism is, even though it was only because of capitalism that he was able to publish this waste of paper.  He does not spend much time at all on World War II, and has the gall to called Richard Nixon a horrible president (which he was) without heaping abuse upon Stalin or any other Communists.  The book also glosses over most historical events and goes for the "Big Picture" of history.  I hated this book.  Until I read it, I actually enjoyed learning about history.  Now I am not so sure
