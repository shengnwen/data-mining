I've read 2 other Walter Mosley's and that's it for me. He's too sloooow and most of all  empty. He's character are not very interesting and the stories always lag, drag and fizzz out. I don't see how the reviewers see  Walter Mosley as a black writer with something  powerful to say about the  black condition/experience etc. He hasn't said anything, let  alone  anything profound. In fact he doesn't even scratch the service.  He should  be  writing kids books because that is where his composing skills have  remained. Snails  think faster than Walter Mosley
