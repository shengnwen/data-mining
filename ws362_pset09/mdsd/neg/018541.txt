When I first read this book, I could not help but wonder why the author  sounded so angry! The entire text could have been written in 20 pages, but  tends to drag on monotonously, repeating statements many times in the same  aggressive tone.  The tone and repetition of the text tends to lead you  away from the few morsels of interesting and useful information, such as  the wonderfully concise overview of basic chinese medicine that even a lay  person could understand.  It is such a shame that this book was so horribly  written with it's truly advanced use of the English language, that it is  difficult to follow, understand, and even pick up again to finish.  This is  no light reading, folks
