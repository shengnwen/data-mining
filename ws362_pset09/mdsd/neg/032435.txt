In this instance the author peppers the book with snide asides about Christianity and Catholicism,politics,the Communists were "never a threat," and, of course, Ronald Reagan made bad deals for his Screen Actors Guild.  If they were so bad, why was he elected president of the SAG twice? Overall the book is well written, but there are enough errors I am aware of to make me wonder about the validity of the purported facts outside of my limited knowledge of Jimmy Stewart.  Politics is fine except when it is unsubstantiated conjecture
