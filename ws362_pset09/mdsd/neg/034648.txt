Shannon Drake's first 3 Vampire books were awesome, but this book is so boring it takes a lot of effort to keep reading it. The Awakening isn't a very good title for this particular book, it should be called The Sleeping. That's just what you want to do while reading it. She brings back her characters from her first 4 books which is a good thing. The book does tend to get OK toward the end, but mostly your just glad that you finally finished it and can now put it away someplace where you won't have to look at it and be reminded of the time you wasted reading it
