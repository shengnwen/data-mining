I am a retired individual who has read just about every book written about Hawaii. Some have been classics; others rubbish. I'm afraid "Aloha Kauai: A Childhood" is close to the bottom of the range because it is just another run-of-the-mill autobiography written in the style of a high school dropout. It is a colorful little reminiscence about an island lifestyle in the middle of the last century but it was a struggle trying to continue reading from page to page. I give it a one star rating now with a plan to try to finish reading it some day.
