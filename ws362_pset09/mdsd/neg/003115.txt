Most of this book consists of Vincent relaying very short and sweet stories about small incidents and moments in time. Particularly, he pays very much attention to retired players he met and coming to terms with the differences in public personas and actual personalities.

I expected a far heavier treatment given the first half of the title. However, the opinions and issues are very skant throughout the book. There moments he gives opinions are often not substantiated and the depth of material is actually suited best for younger readers.I expected the opportunity to be taken to rationalize the role of the commissioner and outline a concrete argument about Vincent's experiences and how things could improve. Instead, the minor essays give a taste of the subject that most hardcore baseball fans would already know before reading.
