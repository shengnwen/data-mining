The author has her heart in the right place.  She even starts out trying to go step-by-step, but it does not last.  Somewhere into the 3rd or 4th page she starts utilizing advanced jargon to explain her elementary concepts.  She never makes any reference to the 'advanced jargon' before this.  That means that she does not build brick-by-brick.  

Also, her references to various charts is confusing and mixed up.  In one chapter where she introduces charting a stock on the monthly, weekly and quarterly charts, she makes conflicting points and ...well...let me not waste more time.  Her language use is not good, therefore, her communication methods leave a person hanging. 

Just DO NOT buy this book.  There are other better books out there.  Such as Toni Turner's books.

However, let me just say that she does explain some other overlying economic concepts and global mechanics of wealth building warriors, sitting around the world, very well
