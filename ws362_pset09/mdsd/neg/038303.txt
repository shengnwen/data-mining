I found that the book, Becoming A Master Manager, to not be very helpful in an Introduction to Management course.  Although the idea behind this book is good and for the most part helpful, it is not adequate for the type of course I am currently taking.  The idea of having each chapter focus on the different managerial roles is one that could potentially be very helpful.  Since each section contains various compentencies that focus on different aspects of these roles, this book could be helpful for a course that was structured differently.  However, since our class is structured toward the basic fundamentals of management, this book is somewhat useless.  To be honest, I did not really look at this book extensively because I had another book that worked better for this class.  I just felt it was not worth my time to continue with this book, since it did not help me in my studies
