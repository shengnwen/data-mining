I finally opened this book after many years on my shelf to help me in my quest to tell my adopted kids that I have made contact with their birthmother. What I read was a lot of anger, stories of unsuccessful reunions, and a feeling that an adopted child can never reach peace with either family. I refuse to believe that is true, but that is how the book comes across. Some points in the book are excellent, but the negative was just so prevelant.
