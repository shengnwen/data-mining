I gave this the first star simply because it is a book about football.  The second star is because it does have interesting history about the NFL Draft and you do get a close look at how an NFL team evaluates a draft class.  Over a hundred pages of this book are absolutey WASTED on SCUMBAG AGENTS!!!  I do not, nor does any person with a conscience or decency, want to read anything that profiles and glorifies these money hungry crooked wastes of life that help to ruin professional sports.  If you do decide to get this book, skip chapters 4-8 as they deal mainly with agents.  The rest of the book is interesting and for that matter deserves a look
