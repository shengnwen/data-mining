I have tried. I really have. And I admire the writer but other than brief flashes in the hundred or so pages I read, the book is stultifyingly boring. There is a wonderful story here that gets so bogged down in continuous reportage and research; makes me wonder, what is the writer trying to hide, because what is so important about this story gets lost; obscured by the maddening overexplanation and baroque rendering of items,details,people and events. Is all this necessary? What do you leave in and what do you leave out? I would say, from what I read, leave out half of it. Talese, maybe it's his father's fault, wants to spend half a year, in reality it took him something like thirteen years to produce this book, making a custom made suit that he spends countless hours tearing out and restiching, redesigning, etc. What he ends up with is no better than something store bought. I think what is mainly missing from this work is an essentiall passion. Let me explain. I think Talese has it, or how else could he devote so much time and effort to this project, but he has successfully killed it. He gets so lost in his own brilliance that he fails to tell a good story. This is a dead book, kind'a like a beautiful flower preserved; the color faded,with no scent. The book doesn't live and I could'nt read it, and as any kind of example of creative non-fiction, or literary journalism, I have to go against most of the reviews of the book. I wouldn't call it a waste of time but I want something where the author hasn't killed the drama of the story with mortifying detail and unnecessary sidebars
