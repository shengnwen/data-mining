I had read that Dave Eggers is friends with Sarah Vowell and David Sedaris and had hoped that like company meant like creativity.  Unfortunately I found Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius to be extremely lacking in the creative department.  I will not give up on Eggers just yet, however I'm just confused as to how A Heartbreaking was a Pulitzer finalist.  The story lacked continuity and Eggers' attempts to wrap himself in the tragic balcony accident suffered by his friend were tacky at best, pathetic at worst.  A Heartbreaking is worth reading, but I caution the reader that it is a definitely underwhelming experience.
