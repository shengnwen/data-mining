Do not misunderstand me: this book is fun. Problem is, it is only fun while it could have been really good and I hate to see good ideas wasted.

The writing itself is no more than straightforward: there are several clumsy turns of phrase, many repetitions, some shabbyness here and there.

The main problem is the plot we have no real mistery or thriller or whatever, just an excuse of a plot to introduce the main character, Ms Anita Blake, 24 y.o. -is she not just a little too young?- necromancer and ***-kicker.
She is thrown with us into a bulging heap of violence and/or bodice ripping situations, facing countless (and I mean COUNTLESS) characters, none of which satisfyingly rounded: Anita spends all of her time ***-kicking, deciding how to dress to hide her guns or whether she is ready to die horribly.
I am not saying she is not a nice character because she is, she even has a depth -but once again, can someone so young have such clear sighted symptathetic cynism?- though she tends to repeat the same puns too often.

A pity, there are some breathtaking paragraphs, others are excellent, the author seems to be able to move her pawns when she wants to: Phillip, for example, one of Anita's companions in her adventure is outright lovely and could have been perfect with just a little more concentration.

Let us see whether this first volume is just a warm up for better things to come
