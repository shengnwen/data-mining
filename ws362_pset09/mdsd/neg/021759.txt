This book and its author's audacious writing style are so intriguing it draws one in despite three warning signs: 1) it's billed as 'post-modernist' which too often means a poor work which is defended on the basis of its detractors being too dull and simple to understand it in all its glory 2) it's historical fiction, which too often means the author is neither creative enough to make up his own story nor skilled enough to make accuracy rewarding and 3) it was recognized by the national book award which too often lately means the public is right for once, the reason only 200 people have read this book is that it's not good.  These telltales notwithstanding the book has the power to fascinate, and readers who hate to give up, or love a challenge, or whose curiosity is powerful will likely press on to see where this careening narrative is headed and be unable to stop - for a while.  Vollmann writes long, confusing, and through varied narrators but in the end this is not Dostoyevsky, Pynchon, or Faulkner.  Vollmann DOES have ability.  It's been pointed out by (just about all) reviewers that the book desperately needed aggressive editing, but reading it makes one think this author's ego would never permit that, so there's probably little hope of him realizing his true potential as a writer.  He certainly didn't with this one. Behind the awards and condescension of its champions this is just a mediocre book that's so so sooooooo long even a sucker for clumsily sprinkled erotica such as myself simply can't stand it
