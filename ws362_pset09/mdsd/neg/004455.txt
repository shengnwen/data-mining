Is it me or did the author of the book in question most likely write that last review? The writer ran out and bought 5 copies to give to his friends? You have got to be kidding me.
 I haven't read the book, it may very well be good, but I highly doubt that last review was by someone that is not connected somehow to profiting by this books sales. 
I have read Giuliano's books before and have enjoyed them, but he is seen with such skepticism by most who know anything about the Beatles that I find it hard to believe that anyone not connected to the book would dish out such over the top praise as the last review.
