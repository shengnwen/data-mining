I do not know whether this was Suttons first book, but it reads like it is. The information would be far more effective arranged quite differently. Even the publisher did not correct either the authors style or his arrangement of the material.

Over all, I was disappointed. The style is sloppy, redundant at times and overly general when it needs to be specific. Linkages are may times vague and not born out by actual material, causation is then implied. A lot of the book is more "guilt by association" then guilt by actual evidence. This book could have been researched and written to be much more precise, clear and organized. 

Many other books do a better job bringing out the hidden side of history. Unfortunately Sutton is not one of those books. For the price asked for it, I could not recommend him as a valuable source. 

If a paper back version selling for $6.95 ever comes out, then and only then could I recommend spending any money on it
