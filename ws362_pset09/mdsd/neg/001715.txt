I read another book by this author, Friendship Cake, which I really enjoyed and passed around to several friends. So I picked this one up thinking it would be worth a read. Luckily, it only took me about an hour and a half to read it, since that's about as long as I'll remember it.

I guess I never really cared about the characters too much. It's not a thick enough book that there's a lot of room for exploring and exposing the characters, which is too bad, because they could be interesting. And I know Hinton's capable of it from her last book. I also read that the author thinks race relations is so important to this story ... I never got the whole emphasis on race relations thing. The story happens to characters who happen to be interracial friends/lovers, but I never get that it's important to the plot.

Not to mention that the "big secret" is telegraphed so blatantly it's hard not to know what it is almost immediately. 

In spite of its faults, I think it would be OK for a quick beach read or if you just don't care for much depth at the moment
