The best thing about this book is the title. It's a beautiful sentiment and one that was expressed well in one little vignette. Otherwise this book was so mediocre...OMG. It was bad. Simplistic. Saccharine. It was like reading the work of someone still in the first year grad writing program, as the main character reflects. Not only could you see the plot wrap-up a mile away, I sort of felt like I needed to take a shower afterwards lest I get attacked by a swarm of bees coming for the sticky sweetness.This book is a major pass unless you typically enjoy the recommendations of USA Today
