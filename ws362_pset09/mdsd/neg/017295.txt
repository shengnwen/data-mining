I thought this book was terrible, an endless stream of one misdeed after another perpetrated by characters I could have cared less about. 

The Point of View character, Nancy, tries several times to shape up, though her efforts are half-hearted at best. Just five pages from the end of the book she's as bad off as she ever was, even though she tells herself "Even after screwing up at Amy's party, I knew I would be okay in the long run." (150) I would have wanted to see about 80% less screwing around and 100% more insight and introspection.

I think the author was trying mask a rather "been-there, done-that" kind of book under the sensationalism and newness that was cutting in the early 1990s-when this book came out. It was her first novel-she wrote it while still in college-and her immaturity as a writer shows. 
  	My biggest problem with this book is that when you look at it in the context of a critical review of the issue-cutting-you quickly realize that the cutting added nothing to the book. The book would have been just the same without any reference to cutting at all. 

For the life of me I can't figure out why it won a Delacorte honor citation for Best First Young Adult Novel. But many reviewers praised the book when it came out, and readers still praise it today. 

As one of the other readers on amazon.com said, if you spend the whole time being disgusted with their behavior, you will not like this book.
