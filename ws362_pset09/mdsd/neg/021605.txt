Erskine Caldwell while apparently wrote during a different time, apparently did nothing to promote anything other than stereotypes of the rural south.  I myself am from a small rural town in Arkansas and grew up with stories my grandparents told of their experiences during the great depression.  They were poor and lived by subsistence farming but they were proud and spoke with a sense of accomplishment of their home life.  While their education and opportunities may have been limited it seemed to make them appreciate what they did have later.  I was surprised to find out that Caldwell had actually lived in the South following my reading the book because he didn't seem to have anything pleasant to say about it at all.  All regions of the country do have impoverished persons who have no ambition to improve themselves nor realize the situation that they're in but this I felt was an unfair take on what was not an easy time for anyone in America.  

If you like southern literature, I would much more highly recommend a Willie Morris book, Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Ann Burns, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, maybe one of Shelby Foote's works of fiction, or Eudora Welty amongst others.  In those stories, poverty and racism which are issues in the south are evident but portrayed in a more fair and consistent light.  I will admit in closing that I was interested in the story and finished the book fairly quickly but I felt the content was not all that impressive and only served to deepen stereotypes and preordained views that wrongly exist about the South
