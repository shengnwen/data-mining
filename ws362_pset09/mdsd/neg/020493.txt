I am a fan of the great Dan Jenkins and his exemplary sports writing over the years. But I have to give this book a thumbs down.
The story is not much more than a Nora Roberts-type potboiler, with a lot of historical and cultural references thrown in. Did I say "a lot"? Jenkins, a life-long Texan, packs in an unbelievable amount of name-dropping, and allusions to long-ago people, places, and things, that at times it's hard to find the plot among all those references. A little nostalgia for days gone by can be a good thing, but I'm afraid it was way overdone here
