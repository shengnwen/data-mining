Tom Robbins writes self-consciously quirky drivel.  I tried to read "Still Life with Woodpecker," for the sole purpose of tallying every time he points out the fact that the two protagonists are redheads (at least once every five pages), but I'm just not enough of a masochist for it.  Don't read Tom Robbins.  Read "Catch-22", "One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest", or "Breakfast of Champions" instead
