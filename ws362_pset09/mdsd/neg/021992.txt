"Blow Out" is, without a doubt, the worst murder mystery I've ever read.

I genuinely thought it was the work product of a non-"in-group" 16 year old girl trying unsuccessfully to seem hip.

Two separate, distinct & out-of-balance plots: (1) 60 page plot where ghost of murdered young mother appears to Savich & induces him to investigate her 30 year old murder, which is solved when culprit is tricked into confessing, not realizing he is being recorded [stale plot, zero believeability]; and (2) 295 page plot involving murder of current Supreme Court Justice & subsequent murder of 2 court clerks; the hands-on murderer has no credible motive, and we never know for sure whether some woman friend of the widow put him up to it to punish the Justice & his lover for their affair.  Zero connection between the 2 plots (except that Savich is working on both of them).  Author shows almost no understanding of how the courts and FBI actually operate.  The dialog is so trite & junior-high-schoolish that it's embarassing ("I'll tell you I love you if you'll say it at the same time.")

Yuck!  Get me outta here
