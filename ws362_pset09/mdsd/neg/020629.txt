I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement
