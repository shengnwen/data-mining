Sen. Rick Santorum would not endorse this review, but I am voting against this book since there surely cannot be enough material in L&C's journals for a full book on this subject.  I recommend instead the book "Disease and History" (1972) by Frederick F. Cartwright, which explains how various diseases helped change or form history. Also I will point out that some have said there's people relating to this book "suffering from delusions of grandeur fed by sycophants".  I don't know, I'm just repeating this slander here.  BTW I have not read this book
