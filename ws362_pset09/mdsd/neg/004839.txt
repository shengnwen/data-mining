This book looked very promising; the format and premise of a history book  written from the year 2025. Unfortunately, the book is so superficial in  its treatment of the subjects that I found myself falling asleep whenever I  attempted to read it. The book reads like a collection of facts or  sidebars; there are no stories, fiction or non, to pull you through the  chapters. Read Probable Tomorrows instead
