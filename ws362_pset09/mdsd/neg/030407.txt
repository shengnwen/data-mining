While I found the book to be J.M. Barrie's style, for the most part, I thought it lacked his spirit. The original Peter Pan was full of fun, adventure, laughter. It was uplifting and made me wish I was a child again so I could join Peter and the others. This story could have done so much more with the characters. I found the story somewhat depressing. There was no fun. I missed the characters of the first story. Where was Smee? How can there be a Peter Pan without Smee and the crocodile? This story was dark. Peter was angry, depressed, greedy and full of negativity. Why would I want my child to read this? He almost wasn't the main character. Ravello was. A sequel to a famous story such as Peter Pan should continue with the positivity and joy of the first and this book certainly didn't do that.
