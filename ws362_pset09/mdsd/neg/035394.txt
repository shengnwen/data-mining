This book's purpose is to argue that Wal-mart is an evil empire.  Fishman throws in some positive facts to try and seem neutral, but throughout the book he shows his socialist stripes and lack of understanding of basic economic principals.

The sections of the book that I most enjoyed and found most interesting were the great in-depth anecdotes about companies that have a relationship with Wal-Mart.

I had trouble finishing this book because his diatribe against Wal-Mart becomes more intense near the end, but at the same time his arguments have so many gaping holes.  Those who understand basic economic principles will shake their head in disagreement many times as they turn the pages of this book.

Overall, I feel quite dismayed because I think he will be successful in convincing many uninformed readers that Wal-Mart's impact is more harmful than beneficial.
