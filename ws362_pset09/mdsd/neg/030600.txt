as with anything the so-called "john wray" (not his real name) writes, "canaan's tongue" is bristling with brilliant ideas. unfortunately, wray overthinks and then overwrites so that the end result is something akin to a literary collision of clunks, to put it in an overwrought, overthought way. indeed, if today's budding hipsterism movement--everything from interpol to gawkerists--were anything other than over-hyped pseudo-thought, john wray would be the poet terrible of the moment. as is, he's the blathering idiot off to the side at the party your cousin takes you to because he wants to show you what's "cool" in town. here's hoping wray's next outing will in fact be readable. if not enjoyable
