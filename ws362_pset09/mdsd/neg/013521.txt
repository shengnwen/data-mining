This book just didn't really say that much. I don't know how else to put it. I guess that means that my review won't really say much. :-) It feels like it was written as an executive summary for executives who want to know the buzzwords and acronyms so they can sound like they know what Digital Asset Management is. It was really odd when the author went into a little bit of detail about the technology, of course it didn't really say anything, but it was just enough to make one sound like an idiot
