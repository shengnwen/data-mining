A thousand blood-thirsty Trollocks are on the way to kill you and your friends.  At your disposal you have the following choices of weapon:  1. The Troll-Kill 2000 which can kill 50 to 100 Trollocks at a time, has unlimited power, never misses, and never needs to be recharged.  2.  A machine gun which is not as effective as the Troll-Kill 2000, but still pretty good, or 3.  A pocket knife, which is great for cleaning your fingernails, but not very effective in stopping a Trollock.  If you are Rand you pick the pocket knife of course, but then either forget to take it with you, or vow not to use it unless you are absolutely sure the Trollocks are not female.  

So Jordan has created a superhero with super powers.  He gave the superhero super weapons.  Then he realized that if the superhero uses his power or his weapons there will be no way to stretch this series from 6 books (what it should have been) to 12 books.  Solution:  make the superhero too stupid to use his powers or weapons, and fill the rest of the pages with useless drivel.  

The books are filled with darkfriends, and other servants of the Dark Lord, that never seem to do anything, but watch from the sidelines.  They don't really need to do anything, since the good guys seem to pretty much muck everything up on their own.  

The problem with creating 1000s of characters in gory detail is that you expect them to actually do something.  The other problem with so many characters is that you loose track of them and lose focus of the main characters.  When Jordan finally comes back to a particular character, they seem to have been placed in suspended animation for the past 1000 pages.

I dare you to try to read this one without a heavy dose of caffeine in your system.
