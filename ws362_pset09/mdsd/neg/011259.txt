The writing style leads me to believe that this book is written for older elementary school age to middle school age children, so thankfully it was a quick read. The entire book is just a piecing together of interviews. Marc Shapiro has never interviewed J.K. Rowling himself. So there wasn't anything new or all that interesting in the book if you've read the interviews JKR has given over the years. 

Shapiro also does a very lazy job of updating the book by just tacking on new material every couple of years to the end.

Overall, it was a disappointment
