I only read this book because it was required by a management professor.   The book contains enough eco-trash logic to make you wince in pain.  The  authors would have you believe that business owners will succumb to the  temptation of giving up their profits for the good of the community.  Not  only do the authors repeatedly promote an organization called the NIEO,  they use words that soften their political philosphy.  They say the second  wave of business ownership is &quot;Stockholders&quot;, the third is  &quot;Worker Ownership&quot; and the fourth &quot;Communitarian&quot;.   &quot;Communitarian&quot;? What is that?  Sounds like you know what.  They  base their analyses on exactly zero facts, or at least questionable  conclusions.  Reading this book was torture.  A better read about business  and how it should and will operate is &quot;Reframing Organizations&quot;  by Bolman and Deal.  In case you haven't guessed, I'm a  &quot;Capitalitarian&quot;
