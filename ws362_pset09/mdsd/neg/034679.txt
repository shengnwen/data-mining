It was really good at first and I was enjoying it at first. Dee Henderson didn't waist any time in getting the story going but there is just so much in between when the story starts and when the climax starts. I wasn't able to finish the book because I got kind of sick of it. After a while, it's just like, alright, we get. She's falling in love with Adam and he's falling in love with her and praying for her. Thats basically all that happens for the majority of the book. There are so many pointless things going on before even ONE suspence stuff starts. There is a little bit of suspence in it, but you really have to read to get there. I think I might just skip to the end of the book to find out what happens.

So if your looking for a good love story, then this is what you should read, but not if your looking for a thriller that hooks you and makes you want to sleep with the light on
