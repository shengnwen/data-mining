This book is written by a Christian layman, and is full of references to God and Jesus throughout the book. In my opinion, working with oneself with regards to any issue, should never be based on any religion of any kind. It should be independent of any religious belief.

The book talks a lot about love as the key to build friendships, like Jesus did. "love and be loved again". His rules to achieve deeper relationships are:

1. Assign top priority to your relationships
2. Cultivate transparency (be open and honest)
3. Dare to talk about your affection
4. Learn the gesture of love
5. Create space in your relationships

The book has a naive and unprofessional approach to the topic. While the author is aware of the fact that too much emotion, care, interest, help, kindness and so on could challenge the relationship, he does not give it much attention, and he even says that too much is better than too little, which is not always true.

It does not provide a way to get closer to the people you care for. There is nothing in this book, which is not already common knowlegde. Everything in the book is basic. It could go as a sweet and funny Christian book about friendships in general. But it is not a professional book about how to go from a regular friendship to a deep and close friendship
