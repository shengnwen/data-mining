I was disappointed in this text because it offers more about the lives of those researching the flood as myth and science than it does about the myth, history, archaeology, and science of the flood itself.  It's digressions, mini-bios, anecdote, and superficial analyses were tedious obfuscations.  This could have been a facinating work but turned into another waste of time.  This reader was very dissatisfied with this work.
