This book is drivel. The author teaches you to approach men, chase after them, research their lives and backrounds, etc. I thought it would be an interesting book, but she actually fills the pages with advice like: give  hints to let him know you'd marry him if asked, men don't like white shoes  after labor day, and she even has recipes and word lists!  The fact that  she herself has not managed to snare a millionaire and her mother is  divorced because her own father was cheating tells you just how effective  her advice is in getting a rich husband and happy marriage. If you must  read it, get it at the library, but don't pay for it. I wish I hadn't
