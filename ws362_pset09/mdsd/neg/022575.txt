This book was written in 1993. While reviewing it, I noticed just how wrong the details are. Compare the details in this book to some of the brand name products. MANY are lower in fat, or calories, etc. 

Foods change over the years. Believe me when I say, you want the most current and comprehensive reference when it comes to a food almanac. 

Do not bother with this. It is now a paper weight, nothing more. There are better choices. Go to a local book store, peruse the many selections and select a CURRENT and comprehensive guide. Do not go for the CARB hype books. You need to know all the basics at the very least...protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sodium, and a guide that breaks down the types of fat would be the best...as long as it is current!!
