I figured if Oprah wanted America to read this book that it couldn't be too bad. I had held out on reading Faulkner, and now I know why. I read alot and love reading but this book, and "As I Lay Dying" makes me question why oh why Faulkner is a classic. My hypothesis is that its so unapproachable therefore people think it must be brilliant. This is a good book for english class when you can sit around and discuss the meanings of it all and read sparknotes together. This is not a book for sitting at home and reading for yourself. If you want to know the story just go read the sparknotes version. The book itself is too hard to figure out and there is little plot. its just a long headache really.
