This was a book that was better not written, or at least not published. As Woody Allen once coined a phrase, the book is, "a miasma of asinine cliches unrivaled in Western Literature." Why should any self-respecting individual want to read yet another paltry story of excusess as to why a drug addict became a drug addict ( and who seems to have a somewhat sardonic pride in his past addiction.)Being a Kennedy is not worth a plug nickle--and as this Kennedy shows--it sure dosen't make you smart.
