I tried for years to stick up for Acker, but her concepts are always infinitely more interesting than her execution. The truth is she had no natural feel for language -- there's no music to her prose, none at all, and all of the novels sound better when just the titles are read. But the idea of her as the female punk &quot;underground&quot; &quot;subversive&quot; and &quot;transgressive&quot; priestess is very tempting. I say this kind of in sorrow. &quot;Kathy Goes to Haiti&quot; is funny once in a while though. This one is a dreary bore
