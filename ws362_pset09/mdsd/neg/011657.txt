I ordered this book as a resource for a paper I wrote in school, and I found a number of glaring problems with it. I admire Patrick Drazen in his effort to create an informative book on the subject of anime, but I cannot laud him for it.

1. Much of the information on individual series seems to be incorrect. Perhaps Drazen is offering his interpretation of the events in those series, but overall, it seems that he watched some of them from the corner of his eye while writing the book. 

2. There are some major grammatical errors in this book. While not everyone's perfect, it is a seemingly professional publication, and these errors lead me to believe that the author didn't have anyone read over his material to check for errors or inconsistencies, at least not anyone who cared about his book being accurate in any respect. 

3. Drazen offers a lot of material, but very rigidly from his own point of view. The book is obviously from a male perspective (which may attribute to his inconsistencies in the descriptions of some of the more girly shoujo titles of anime, but still doesn't account for his errors in the rest); Drazen also sticks to what he likes, giving a sort of authorial sneer to any series mentioned that wasn't in his immediate favorites.

Overall this book is very poor for accurate, unbiased information on the subject of anime. I hate to say so because I don't know of any book that isn't. I think Drazen would have done much better to have collaborated, and certainly to have passed the manuscript around to some of his informed buddies. Did no one catch on to the outstanding errors before this was published? 

Better luck next time, authors on anime
