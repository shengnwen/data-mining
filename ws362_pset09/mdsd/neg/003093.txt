I thought this book would bring joy as I opened it. I was abruptly mistaken. This author, in my opinion, trashes Jimmie and makes some bold hurtful comments that sent me into anger rages. Anyone who loves the "Brothers" had best leave this book alone. Unless, you need something to start your backyard firepit with. Obviously, the author has many "issues" not the least of which has to do with Jimmie Vaughan. I beg you not to buy such trash!! May the blues always be a safe haven for those who appreciate it
