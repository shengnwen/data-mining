The prefatory note states: " Mr. Murray wishes to point out that this book is written in English by a native of Japan."
It definitely shows.  This book is indigestible. Here is an example:  "Imitation, whether of nature, of the old masters, or above all of self, is suicidal to the realisation of individuality, which rejoices always to play an original part, be it of tragedy or comedy, in the grand drama of life, of man, and of nature."
Another example:  "But, alas!  In a world so worldly, no such dreamland could long persist!"
If you can get past the style, you find this book is just an accumulation of historical facts about India, China and Japan.
The last sentence:  "Victory from within, or a mighty death without" tells you all you want to know about this book:  Don't buy it
