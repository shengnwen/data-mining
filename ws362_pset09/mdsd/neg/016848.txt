I can't say I liked this book.  I found it was incredibly boring with no writing style whatso ever.  And the plot could have been taken from a 'typical science fiction' receipe book.  Honestly.  I barely managed to  finish it.  Thora had potential.  Nothing else did.  She didn't even change  in the course of the book.  Leave this one in the bookshelf.  Its not worth  the time
