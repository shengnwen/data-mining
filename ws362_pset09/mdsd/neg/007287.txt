Prep was quite a good novel. The follow-up, The Man of My Dreams, is ... well, it's simply not nearly as good. 

The main character has real self-esteem issues. And while I might expect them in a young woman, the length of time it takes her to deal with them is excruciating. Even when people genuinely like her, she has a very  hard time believing it. All that negativity is hard to take; a character needs to grow or there is no point in reading about them.

She does finally get a backbone, but you have to read through a whole lot of nothing to get there. And I'm not quite sure the journey was worth it
