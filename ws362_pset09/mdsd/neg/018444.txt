I understand the attraction to Anne Carson.  I like experimental poetry, too.  I like scholarship.  But this book is pointless.  The poems are so terrible that by the time I got to the essay at the end about hot &amp; cold symbolism for the writers of antiquity I was so upset with the book that I just couldn't care about anything in it.  These poems don't sound good.  If nothing else, there should at least be the sound.  &amp; in any other respects, the experiments are to no end in themselves.  I recommend forgetting this book &amp; going for such progressive, ambitious younger poets as Karen Volkman &amp; Brenda Shaughnessy
