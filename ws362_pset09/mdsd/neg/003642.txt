First off, I'll begin by proclamating myself as a halo junkwad. Now that is out of the way, let's get to the review. I was completely fascinated with the rich textural world that Eric Nylund had developed in the first Halo novel, The Fall of Reach. It was quite creative and really helped you understand how the Master Chief ended up on Halo. The work was a near masterpiece, seriously. Then as my excitemnet leaped for the next installment, The Flood, I was slowly letdown, as page after page flipped. Don't get me wrong, the writer is talented and some parts like the introduction of the elite assasin Zammamee is very intriguing, along with his cohort, Yayap. Their stories and a few creative gems do pop up. However, the book reads as if you were narrating to yourself while playing the game. Seriously, this is how it goes for 90% of the book: The Master Chief flies his jumbled Banshee through another cavernous valley. He quickly sets down the craft and pulls his shotgun on two unsuspecting grunt workers who were sleeping on watch duty. The Chief quickly cocks his gun and splatters both of the imbeciles into mush meat. 
Now imagine reading that over and over (with varying adjectives such as incinerates instead of splatters) for 300 of the 340 pages of the book. That's The Flood novel. I don't even blame Dietz for the monotony of the work. I just wish they stayed away from the game and filled in the niches, more background, and inbetween stories instead
