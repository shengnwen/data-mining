I have attempted this book several times, it is abysmal. There are many other horrible books I have read and finished (not by Anne Rice), desperately hoping for something redeeming to occur at the end, which rarely ever happens. With Violin, I couldn't force myself to complete it, it was that bad. The most sustained effort I have made got me roughly 150 pages in before I had to put it down and move on. The character rambles and rambles and goes nowhere except to rehash her previous ramblings. I am a huge Anne Rice fan, not just of her vampire books. I have read everything she has published under her own name and loved it. When her descriptions become verbose and poetic, I'm in heaven, I love her ability to paint mundane things in a beautiful light. Her accounting of the family history in The Witching Hour is amazing, especially considering there is no action, just exquisite description. This book had none of that, it was painful to read in the worst way. Shortly after this book was published, I read in the news about how Ms. Rice was a diabetic and had been unaware of this for some time. Her untreated diabetes had caused massive depression and I believe this book is a reflection on the mental anguish she was going through. It is not beautiful, not poetic, and worst of all, not interesting. If you are browsing for a good Anne Rice novel, I beg you, pick anything she has written other than this one.
