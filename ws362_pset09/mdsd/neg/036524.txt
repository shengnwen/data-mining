Well, there are numerous reasons you wouldn't want to buy this book.  Number one it's shakespear which is literally a different language.  If you're not familiar with it, you will hate this book.  The author did put a page in every other page giving meanings of different texts and terms, though.  The good thing is it reads fast.  And for anyone who thinks comedy.  Not what you're thinkin.  In drama terms a comedy is a play with a happy ending.  A funny play wold be a farse.  Soo it's not really even the least bit funny if that's what ur thinkin.  The book as a whole is pretty short if you take out the definition pages and explanations of different things.  Maybe about a 100.  Really though, unless you have to for school don't waste any time on this book
