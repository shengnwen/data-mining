Harry Bosch has retired from the LAPD and obtained his private investigator's license just to cover his bases.  But it is his old work that has the strongest draw for him.  A homicide case that he worked four years prior to his retirement remains unsolved and haunts his dreams.  But as he starts to open old files and uncover old secrets, he finds that there are many different people that do not want Harry prying into their pasts.  But old habits die hard and the detective in Harry follows the trail of clues despite the strong warnings against doing just that.  What he finds is a complicated web of crimes and cover-ups that are destined to lead Harry to nothing but danger.

It has been a while since I have read any of the Harry Bosch novels and I do not think I'll be back.  Unfortunately, watching the movie of Blood Work and seeing Clint Eastwood play Harry ruined the character for me and I could not help but picture Clint as the star of this book - which is not a positive as I am not a fan of Clint.  On top of that, the story was convoluted and contrived and at the end, magically wrapped up over night by the fantastic Harry Bosch.  I don't know if this book was simply a weak note for Michael Connelly or if it just did not resonate with me, but it was disappointing enough to end the series for me
