After feverishly finishing Shadowmancer, I instantly went out and bought this novel. Boy, what a disappointment! This book is so lame. Lamer than Attack of the Clones and ewoks combined- and, from me, that is a HUGE insult. It was so bad I hardly forced myself to finish it. I loved Shadowmancer because it so vibarantly expressed Biblical truth in a way that unbelieving readers- Harry Potter exuberants, especially- might not exactly realize what they were reading, but would still get some basic and beautiful truths about Christ into their heads. That was all erased from this novel. NOTHING! Nothing whatsoever. I could almost say that the Buddhist and New Age-swamped Star Wars saga is more spiritually inline than this novel. What happened to good theology? What happened to the grace of Christ? What happened to His love? His protection? How He crushes evil under His heel? What happened to Deutoronomy's harsh veiw on magic that causes me to avoid Harry Potter? 

And besides that, it was just not well written at all. Just as bad as Eragon, and GP Taylor is HOW much older than Christopher Paolini?! Tolkien probably wrote this bad when he was FIVE! 

Terrible book. Stay away.

But does anybody want my copy?
