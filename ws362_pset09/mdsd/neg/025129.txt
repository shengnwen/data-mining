I cook constantly for my family; I find this book not very helpful.  It is supposed to be tailor-made for someone like me, I suppose, who could use some easy, quick recipes for those uninspired evenings when dinner looms.  But I find that these recipes call for ingredients I would not have on hand, and the shortcuts are off-putting.  You need so much grocery-store-prepared food to pull these recipes off, it seems.  I'd rather cook simply from a few scratch ingredients.  Besides quality control issues, grocery-store-made foods are expensive.  And usually pretty bad health-wise (salty & sugary.)
I was given this book as a gift and I have enjoyed reading it, but I find it wordy and overwhelming. I don't find it practical, or very enticing.  I made the angel hair pasta with roasted red pepper sauce (p. 272) and it sorely needed salt, more moisture (I used chicken stock) and Parmesan cheese to bring it to life.
I'm sorry, but I think this book will be in my next give-away pile
