A brave title with "ALL Types of Clocks" and it disappointed as it did not include many (if any) small Boudoir Clocks. Few 20th Century clocks only 1 electric clock. Few mentions of swiss clocks of note. NO INDEX - what sort of book dose not have an index.

Like many American authors - if it does not happen in the USA it does not happen.

I would not recommend this book to those who collect clocks from "the world" as the world is greater than the USA
