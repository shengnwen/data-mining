I admit I didn't finish reading this book, as I was so confused after a few chapters that I gave up.
1. It is unclear what exactly Ladoux means by emotion. Sometimes it seems that he is only talking about emotions that result in an action. (Reasonable as that's what you can test) But there are passages when he talks about "liking" somebody as an emotion. I love my husband and I don't like Tom Cruise but I would hardly equate those feelings as equal emotions. If I read a recipe and think I'd like to taste it, is that the same as the rage I feel against people who have hurt me? They certainly have different origins in my brain (I think)
2. I got totally lost in his review of the psychological studies of emotion. Yes, the development of theories is an important part of the study but when I still can't tell what you are theorizing about, the various diagrams and referrals to studies didn't help. I also lost the logical steps in the argument, perhaps because the summary was brief; I didn't see how B logically followed A in some of his review of the theories.
Perhaps the rest of the book redeems it, but if this book is written for the layperson, more care is needed in explaining the boundaries and definitions
