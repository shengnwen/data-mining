I've read this book twice through.  It is  a dreadful piece of hack work.  The stories Franklin presents as exemplary (his!) are awful.  And the last chapter, "The Nature of Art and Artists" is frankly bizarre.

Avoid this one like the plague.  Pick up Zinsser, Tarsis, Joseph Williams, or any of a number of others
