A letdown.  I've enjoyed Calvin Trillin's writing over the years and looked forward to reading his latest book. Unfortunately, Family Man reminded me of one of those multi-page Christmas letters that we receive,  with a cringe, from our better relatives.  This series of anecdotes comes  across as one long euphemism for family life.  The writing is unrevealing  and self-amused, containing the kind of witty, but shallow, stories you  might expect to hear at a light social gathering.  His wife, Alice, comes  across as a dour, controlling presence; his children are anonymous to the  point of being interchangeable.  I have a tremendous respect for Trillin as  a writer, but this book seemed empty, as if Trillin were unable or  unwilling to really share meaningful revelations about his family life
