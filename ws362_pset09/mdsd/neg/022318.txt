I read this book years ago...or, rather, tried to. I'm sure there are better examples of the truism, &quot;When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,&quot; but not many.
 
 If you're another 12-step 'bot who peppers your conversation and decals your bumper with slogans like &quot;One Day at a Time,&quot; you'll probably really, really like _When Society Becomes an Addict_. I myself found it to be one of the worst self-help books I've ever seen ... and in a genre glutted with self-indulgence, pseudo-science, and hidden agendas, that's saying a lot.
 
 If there is anything we emphatically do *not* need more of in politics, it's therapy. Lift your head out of your 12-step cocoon and look around you: We've got people using various and often spurious diagnoses to shirk responsibility for everything from proper child-rearing to murder. We've been bringing back censorship with a vengeance in the last few decades because of a misguided belief that the world must cater to the delicate psyches of the traumatized, the easily offended, the &quot;oppressed,&quot; and, most of all, &quot;da chyldrun.&quot; And no politician dares run for any major office without drawing lots of attention to his or her &quot;sensitive side,&quot; often with short, sappy, pseudo-heartwarming &quot;personal interest&quot; films.
 
 Schaef may indeed have claimed that men are no longer the problem, but obviously she still claims that we need to feminize American society more. Uh, when little boys are widely and heavily medicated just for acting like little boys, I think we've feminized society quite enough. And I'm a woman with a good many feminist sympathies.
 
 Too bad it had to take September 11th to wake so many people up to the fact that we need more than consensus-seekers, empathizers, and nurturers -- we need leaders, individuals with the courage to make unpopular moral judgments, and warriors and heroes. Of both sexes
