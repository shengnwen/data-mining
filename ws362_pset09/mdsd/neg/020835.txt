I settled down for a nice read on what I expected to be a good, thoughtful expository writing on the sermon on the mount.  The book dove right in, beginning with the Beatitudes (great), but the waters seemed to be muddied by references to "metaphysics", "scientific Christian thinking", and focus on miraculous healing through some "special" prayer skills (I personally agree that God heals in response to prayer).  By page 30, with references to "reading rooms", I finally (duh) figured out that I was reading a book promoting the denomination and agenda of Christian Science.  I even skipped ahead to familiar but troublesome passages in the Sermon, looking for some insight from Fox.  I found nothing useful or especially insightful.  Now, of course Mr.Fox certainly has every right to publish what he wants, but I felt that his Christian Science message was in this case hidden in the Trojan Horse of a book on the Sermon on the Mount.  It seemed to not be the forthright way to present his position.  Fox is certainly on to something in refuting the dumb old western Christian religious systems, but still misses the mark in my calulation.  Theologcally, I belong to no denomination and am open-minded in the extreme, TO THE EXTENT, that propositions are within the bounds of the canon of Scripture.  I think that what I read in a few dozen pages of Fox does not nearly meet that test.
