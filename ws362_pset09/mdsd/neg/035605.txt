As an Ironworker who was at ground zero, I can attest to this man's  uninsightful look at the Ironworkers role at the site. First of all a couple of hundred Ironworkers were at that site within hours of it's fall, my brother included. I got there by the third day and got paid to be there. My brother didn't, he was there when it fell. He volunteered and worked in incredibly harsh and dangerous conditions. He slept on the floor of one of the financial buildings across the street, (does the author know those building)? My brother as well as most Ironworkers at that time were working very steadily and usually getting overtime at dangerous yet safer than Ground Zero jobs but still volunteered to clean up for free. After 3 days then they were paid but not for the first three days, for the rest of the job. My brother does very well as the main guy in his company but stayed there til the end. What was in it for him? Nothing except ironworkers, including our Father and Uncle built them towers. Those two towers were a monument to our hard work that makes so many people money. There were unsavory things going on down there but not with the Ironworkers but, hey, I guess to sell books to the unknowing you need to manipulate the truth huh
