It may seem incredible, but this book actually gave me the encouragement needed to experiment with the drug.  Heck, I didn't know you can sniff it.  And, according to the author, it's not very dangerous. Quitting entails little more than the equivalent of a really bad case of the flu.  

I tried it.  It's not as she describes. Not at all.  It's been a while since I read it, and I must admit, I remember very little about it.  Which speaks more to its content than to my memory. Very little humanity, heart, all the good stuff we're looking for in books, art, and life.  I actually do feel sorry for the author.  In any event, readers she be aware that her portrayal of heroine use is quite inaccurate and misleading.  I speak from experience
