This book was not quite up to my expectations.  It was interesting but I felt the writer wasn't being totally honest about his rate of recovery since it conflicted heavily with his wife's view.  I actually liked his wifes diaries, they were very helpful in what the actual recovery process was.  I wouldn't highly recommend paying the money for this book
