Read this book first, and then read "For your own good:  Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the Roots of Violence" by Alice Miller.  In it she describes what happens when you follow the advice described in "The Strong-Willed Child".  She describes the child-rearing methods in place in Germany at the turn of the last century.  

The similarities of those methods with the ones described in this book (focus on absolute obedience by use of force) are chilling.

I know from my German background the fruits of child-rearing methods that use violent methods to ensure obedience to authority.  Especially when coupled with an available scape-goated minority already disliked by a majority of the population.

Yes, pain and humiliation will create a child submissive to your authority in the here and now.  But do you want that for your child, or for your society?  

And most importantly, for the Christian parent, get a red-letter Bible and read the words of Jesus.  Read Matthew chapters 5 - 7.
