I hate to leave any type of negative book review, because I respect authors and their hard work so much. On the other hand, I have to honest. I would not recommend this book to friends.  I really had a hard time with it. I found it incredibly boring.  I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters and they just bored me to tears.  I kept reading hoping that something would happen, but nothing did! I was suprised to see so many reviewers exclaiming how humorous this book was, but I just didn't get it. I did not laugh or even crack a smile once.  This one just didn't do it for me
