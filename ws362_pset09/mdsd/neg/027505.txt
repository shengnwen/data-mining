I'd been meaning to read this book for a long time, and I realize that it's considered a "classic", so I was surprised and disappointed when I finally got around to reading it. Basically, Holt describes various situations where children are playing and learning. If I hadn't already observed the same kinds of things with my own children, maybe this would have been enlightening. If you're someone who's spent time with young children, I don't think you'd get much out of this book. Perhaps if you haven't, then it might be interesting.
