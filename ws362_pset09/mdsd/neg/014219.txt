Good if you have lots of time to kill, because it has some pages devoted to useless information such as the stupid poem on page 1022 that has  nothing to do with accounting. It appears the authors placed lots of  &quot;real world&quot; trivia that is boring and useless. Entire page of  964 talks about the reason why Coca-Cola will not do business with Lakers  because they signed Pepsi spokeman Shaq O'Neill, it has nothing to do with  the subject but  the extra pages makes you think you got something for the  high priced book. If you absolutely need this book, go borrow it from your  public library and save your money.The book manuscript was NEVER approved  by a CPA or business owner but a long list of college instructors. It does  cover all the basics
