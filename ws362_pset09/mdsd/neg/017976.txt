This is by far one of the worst books on programming or game design that I have ever read.  The book is written out of order, incomplete, ambiguous, and shallow in the explanations of code.  To give an excellent example, chapter 5 has you code several modules for client and server based actions but the game won't run with just the files the book tells you to create.  The end of chapter 5 even mentions the AI beast running around; what AI beasts I never typed in a module to control AI?  I even checked the code on the CD against the book and there were inconsistencies, I am not going to debug the script to see what the difference is but I can tell you just by glancing through it there were a few problems.
Also the fact that we are jumping around in the book concerns me too since each chapter builds on the one before it except it seems GUIs are not till chapter 10 but are used in the game in chapter 5 and that the book stops creating the game at chapter 7, starts focusing on integrating other programs, and picks up at chapter 18 with weather.
