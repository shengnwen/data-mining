I really thought I was going to like this book as I am easy to please when it comes to chic lit novels.  This was pretty bad and it had like 4 or 5 sex scenes that literally went on for a whole chapter for each of them.  Its like the author couldn't think of a plot or good dialogue and just decided to fill the pages with rauchy sex scenes.  I like romance and all but this was overkill - I found myself skipping pages by the third one.  It was weak, totally unrealistic and predictable
