This book is very sad since this strange little man doesn't know much astral travelling.He tells that the astral world is made up of your thoughts and fantasies and the higher realms are made up of humans elavated  thoughts about heaven.Thus,implicated the thought in your head that your  astral travels are ILLUSORY.In fact they are of seperate creation and is an  insult to fearies/nature spirits/angels/God by saying they are not  real.This book is bad.This goldberg man reduces the spiritual art to  nothing but a form of childrens dream.This book won't help you to leave  your body either,it has methods that he expects you to simply master.Also  he does not tell how to find you guides or friends but tells you instead  when you do find them.I would have refund this book if I didn't leave in my  salon floor for a month
