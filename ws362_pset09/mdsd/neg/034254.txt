Two stars for chutzpah.  Liddy has put one over on the reading public; and the reading public has gobbled it up.  I read the thing because so many liberals (friends and radio talk folks) were impressed by the sheer power of the man, his force of 'Will'.

Does Will rhyme with Bull?  Men in the armed services have been telling many of these same 'biographical vignettes' since at least World War II.  Anyone who has spent over six months in the service has heard several of these tales of personal bravura told in the first person from several different sources.  The one about the gay redneck peeking under the table is a favorite of military police types, the caliber of the gun being the only variable - it went from .38 to .44 when `Dirty Harry' was released.  And he's about the fifth guy I've heard claim he got over his fear of lightning by standing high in a tree or on top of a barn or house during a thunderstorm.

And if you're looking for a scoop on Watergate, forget it.  Nothing in here you haven't heard:  Liddy feels betrayed, is loyal to Nixon's memory, and hates Dean.  There, now you don't need to read the book.

Will!  Indeed.  I prefer Chutzpah.  I dare say Mr. Liddy's editors and literary critics lack much life experience (male macho type at least) and got themselves fooled.  G. Gordon has manufactured a lot of old baloney, and it has been received as filet mignon.
