When I heard of this book, I could not believe that there are so many gullible people out there. Quantum healing is another example of so-called healers that hijack scientific ideas to bolster their money making deceptions. As a physicist, I know about quantum theory and it is one of  the most successful scientific theories to describe the world on a microscopic scale. At the quantum level, atomic particles behave in ways that are strange and unfamiliar to people's everyday experience. For example, it is impossible to determine the exact position and velocity of an electron simultaneously. Particles possess both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on the how the particle is observed. We are forced to accept this uncertainty and we must use statistics and probability to assess the likely-hood of an outcome. Quantum mechanics is a process that is highly mathematical and there are only a few examples of simple problems in quantum mechanics which can be solved exactly, for example a simple harmonic oscillator or an electron trapped in an infinite quantum well. Even for the simplest atom, Hydrogen, which contains a single proton and one electron,  we are forced into adopting highly advanced mathematical techniques and for the next element, Helium we use approximation techniques. Imagine, that for the simplest amino-acid, how complex the calculations become. A further extrapolation to a living person, the idea of understanding how a persons mind and body behaves from quantum theory is laughable. You might as well fix your car by using its registration date and finding out it star sign. [...
