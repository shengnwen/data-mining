The book is ok.  Its well written, and raises some valid points, however the issue is presented almost totally in an 'America-vs-Islam' context.  The main conflicts Qureshi deals with involve post 9-11 America v certain parts of the Middle East and Israel-Palestine.

Qureshi has missed a major oppertunity to investigate other conflicts which involve Islam.  Why does he not discuss Kashmir, Chechnya, Southern Thailand, Timor, Ughur/Western China?  All of these conflicts have a religous dimension to them, and all of them are often talked about by Radical Jihadists, yet none of them really involve the US or Israel.  His lack of attention to this means his book has just become another generic study which simplifies the whole issue.

Overall it is an ok book, and from an academic point of view it does provide an alternative to Huntingdon's theory.  But sadly it has a narrow scope and leaves too many crucial questions unanswered
