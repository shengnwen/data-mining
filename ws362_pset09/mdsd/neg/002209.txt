I wrote an Amazon review of "A Brother's Journey" in which I called the book emotionally accurate and even a "shining achievement". It was.
This book on the other hand is by far the most poorly written of all the Pelzer brothers books.
Richard wrote this book using diaries he kept during the years he was a drug addict. Did he copy passages verbatim from his drug diaries?
I'm guessing he did because he was under pressure from Time-Warner to get this money maker on the road.
I hate to say anything bad about one of these boys and I do believe their story but this book is horrifically overpriced for under 200 pages. It costs more than a paper back copy of My Story that contains all three of David's books.
The reason I suggest he copied passages verbatim from the drug diaries is that this is truly one of the most poorly written books I've ever read and this is surprising because I thought "A Brother's Jorney" was well written. This book on the other hand is just incredibly rambling, vague, repetitious and disjointed.
There is really not much to it.
R.Pelzer gets involved with drugs. His mother can't bash him cause he's six foot tall but she continues her emotional abuse. Pelzer befriends some nice people and hides his drug abuse from them.
The rest of the 200 pages is endless vauge agonised rambling about how bad he felt about hiding drug abuse from the nice people. There is really not much more to the book than that.
Two stars instead of one for one evocative description of a drug trip and because I feel bad for him. First he was exploited by his mother and now it's his editor and publishers.
A Brother's Journey showed he had potential as a writer. Then he got forced in to tossing out this garbage.
No one bothered to edit this book. They knew people would rush out to buy it and so will you, despite this review.
But you'd be better off spending your money on "The Priviledge of Youth.
The only truly uplifting Pelzer book is "A Man Named Dave.
