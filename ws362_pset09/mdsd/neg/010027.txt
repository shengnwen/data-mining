 The Secret Garden had a slow start and gave too much detail, but
it got better when Mary starts to be nicer to everyone. Then it got slow again. I would not recomend this book because it is too long, gives too much detail, and the author uses too many  unfamiliar words for younger readers. This is why I gave this book 2 stars out of five
