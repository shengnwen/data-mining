what we are left with is another middle-aged male who had to leave his wife (who stayed through all the s**t)and children in order to "find himself".  Not suprisingly in  the arms of a YOUNG blonde "angel".  Kudos to him for getting sober--a rasberry to him for what he has done with his soberity and to the immediate family who loved him through to it
