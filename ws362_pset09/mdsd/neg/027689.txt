I got this book because it was titled the Rise of Darth Vader. Instead what I got was The Flee of the Remaining Jedi. Darth Vader is in this book but a handfull of times. Since this book is entitled the Rise of Darth Vader one would expect the book to be about Darth vader and his Rise to power as the second in command in the whole galexy. But unfortunately it's not. Over all I was very disappointed in this book. The darth vader character has been my favorite character in the whole Star Wars saga. I hope that books about his life to follow have more to do with him than other characters. If you are interested in Reading this book, you won't learn anything about him that you don't already know. You get no new information about who he has become and what is now driving him. If you noticed in the second starwars movie how much of a baby Anikin is, nothing has changed. Save yourself the few hours of reading time and pick something else
