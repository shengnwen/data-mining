Lewis was an eloquent and thoughtful explorer of his own experience. Several biographers have written biographies that honor Lewis while filling in some of the details of his life Lewis was more reticent about revealing.

This book is a shoddily written and seemingly unedited canonization of Lewis that reminds us on virtually every page how superior in intellect, work habits and character he is to everyone else in his orbit. Given his private and respectful nature, it's not hard to imagine that Lewis would have found this book disgusting for the way in which Gresham pillories his beloved brother, adopted family and some colleagues, all to set off Lewis in a better light. Yet there are contradictory moments such as when Gresham mentions that due to his age, depression over Joy's death, health problems and work away from home, Lewis was an absent and indifferent step-parent.

This book adds nothing to Lewis biography, no insight into his writings, and it contains no reference or notes. Though the book convinces one of Gresham's admiration for Lewis, its fulsomeness reminds one of nothing so much as blatant exploitation
