This book was very short and is mostly a book of lists.  For instance, there are chapters titled "Some of the fine Asian traits", "Things Asians are good at", and "30 ways to impress Asians".  The author then provides the list with a very short and sometimes no explanation of each point.  Then the chapter is over.  Obviously from the title, I expected the book to be somewhat racist since it generalizes about all Asians.  That being said, I found much of the advice to be almost common sense or not particular about Asians at all.  For example, some ways to impress Asians are "Having a good sense of humor, being highly educated and knowledgeable, being rich and famous, successful, being clean and neat, being tall, being a good lover," etc.  I'm not a woman, but I would think these traits are not particular to attracting Asian women but all women.  There is another chapter titled "Where to meet Asians".  Some of the places are "Asian supermarkets, Asian restaurants, Asian grocery stores, bookstores, department stores, libraries, museums", etc.  In other words, you can meet Asians any place that is Asian or any place there are people.  Hmmmm (sarcasticly).  I wonder if there are any Asians in China?  The only reason I did not give this 1 star is because I found the chapter about cultural things, which was in total 5 pages, mildly informative.  I found the author put very little effort into writing this book and wouldn't be surprised if it were written in a weekend
