It's ironic (and perhaps moronic) that Hinton should choose none other than Joni Mitchell as a subject for a biography.  Not only is Mitchell one of the most gifted and literate songwriters of the 20th Century, she is  also one of the most iconoclastic, as well...shunning publicity that most  'rock stars' consume with a spoon.  And its these circumstances which point  out the failings in this dismal read: Hinton can't write and what he has  written are quotes of Mitchell herself when she has deigned to submit to  personal interviews.  It's appalling that the publisher went ahead with  such a shoddy and thoroughly uninformative book about one of the great pop  icons of our century
