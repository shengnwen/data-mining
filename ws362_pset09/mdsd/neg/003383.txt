I really hope people will read the real Koran and not this politically correct white wash!


The real Koran is FILLED with threats, cursings, and just plain hatred towards disbelievers (= non muslims).  In fact, that is a majority of Koranic contents!   The  Surahs of violent threats and curses (against disbelievers) are written out in every chapter of the Koran.  Repeatedly!!
Any fair minded reader would conclude that the Koran is a book of hatred towards Jews, Christians, or non muslims in general.  The Koran TEACHES people to kill non muslims.  That is not hatred?? 

How can this 'dummy' book ignore all that??  I am usually a fan of 'Dummies' book.  But unfortunately this is not an accurate overview of the Koran.
