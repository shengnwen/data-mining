This is an entirely pretentious and immature attempt at intelligent fiction that manages to be cloying at all possible levels. The writing and metaphorical content is constant in its reaching for cliche--is it any wonder that Smith's main trick is to use rhetorical questions? ugh. For a sophisticated realization of the multiple point of view novel, see Julie Otsuka's When the Emperor was Divine.
