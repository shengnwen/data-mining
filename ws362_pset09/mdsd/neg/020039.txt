to like this book, I did!  However, being a big fan of this genre, this book sounded cute and I was anxious to read it.......well, after about 50 pages I gave up.  As the previous reviewer noted, the main charachter is so whiny and complaining and unlikeable, if she sighed or groaned or grumbled one more time I was going to puke!  Seriously, she is like one of those friends who is always negative and gets you down and drains the life out of you - aghghggh!  Stay away!  I think this could have been an enjoyable book, but unfortunately, reading it felt more like a chore.  I recommend Rachel's Holiday by Marian Keyes - wonderful book
