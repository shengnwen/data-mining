Overall the book contains good information. However... at times the definitions are ridiculously and unnessisarily long-winded... most of the content is common sense-- wait...so you are telling me I should be ethical?... wait...people of different cultures are...different? Wha?! no way!!

Maybe I'm a tad cynical but give me a break... I give the book two stars for the little bit of useful content.

It's not worth the money to buy the 11th edition however if you need the book for class and the professor tests extensively on book content rather than general ideas... you'll probably need the 11t
