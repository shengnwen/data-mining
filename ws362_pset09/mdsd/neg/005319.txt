Nothing new in this book and CD does not add to the value of this purchase. I purchased the book and CD combination in hopes of having experiential exercises. Exercises are provided, yet the author merely explains these on the CD versus guiding one through a meditation. It feels as if he is merely reading the directions for the exercises and the exercises are not new or imaginative. If one is new to self help books on healing trauma or anxiety, this may be the book for you. I've read and heard authors and psychologists talk about the flight and fight response over 20 years ago. I, personally, have found more healing/success in spiritual books, guided meditations or intense physical exercise where my heart rate increases or in strength training.
