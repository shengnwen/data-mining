I was willing to ignore glaring errors in this book such as Voodoo not being capitalized as with any religion, the statement that Marie Laveau the second was the famous Voodoo queen (when it was actually the first, her mother), calling a sno-ball a snow-cone... so many details. I was willing to ignore all of these pretty huge mistakes until I read what he had to say about my former employer and place of employment on pages 80 and 140. 
If he'd bother to ask a few questions, he may have discovered that these highschool band kids often run into "cheesy clubs" such as the Tropical Isle and steal money off the bar. He may have discovered that the "fat white man" who ran out of the bar to "shoo" (trust me when I say Mr. Earl does not shoo anyone) these poor unfortunates away is a champion of local music and culture. That when he found out that the Chicken Man's (local character who used to sell incense to the bartenders and tourists and who earned his moniker by biting the heads off live chickens in a 1950's nightclub act) ashes were sitting on a shelf in a local funeral home because his daughter couldn't afford to pay for the cremation, he paid not only for the ashes, but a full funeral complete with a second line that had Bourbon street immobilized for the entire day. That the Handgrenade man is usually someone that he's rescued from homelessness by giving him a job that pays well, the opportunity for promotion and often an apartment. That his employees stay with him for years and not only because of the high pay, medical, dental, 401k and life insurance he pays a great deal of money for. That the Tropical Isle has hosted as regular performers the likes of Timothea, Jon Gros and Al Miller.
Instead, he chose to imagine a sterotypical greedy white Southern man victimizing the downtrodden youth of color.
Oh and the Handgrenade is not "an icky concoction of rum and sweet syrups." It is quite tasty and hasn't a drop of rum in it.
