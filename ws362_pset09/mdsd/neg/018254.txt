I won't critize the author for writing this book, as his heart is clearly in it and he definitely knows a lot about what he's writing.  But I don't think many Star Wars fans will find this book terribly interesting.  It's like reading a book written about visiting a webpage... kinda pointless.

Anyone who's in the target demo for this book (hardcore SW fans and the fan fiction community) will probably already know everything in this book.  And anyone else (casual SW fans, non-Sw fans) should go nowhere near this.

If you like reading copy and paste jobs of e-mails and posts sent to the author by SW fans, than you'll like the book.  But then again, you can save your money and just do that for free on the Internet, can't you
