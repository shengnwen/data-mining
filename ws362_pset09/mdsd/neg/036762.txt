I really didn't enjoy this book. It was very basic, informal, and short. It didn't teach me anything that you or I couldn't of came up with. Basically, all the author tells you to do is do your homework, go to class, and pick a major that isn't Economics. The book didn't have any "secrets" about getting As in college
