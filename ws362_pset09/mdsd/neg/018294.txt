This is the only Robert Crais novel I ever read that I didn't like.  I had to push myself to finish it.  It features all the minutia about bank robbing --it's like the author read a book on the subject--  and the least likeable characters he's ever created.  

Spare yourself the annoyance of reading this and read "The Watchman" instead.
