I hope Cornwell gets professional help for whatever motivated him to author this.

Rychlak's book "Hitler, the War, and the Pope" needs to be read if you choose to read this one.

Law professor historian Ron Rychlak(nonCatholic) has shown proof author Cornwell was biased and telling lies, starting from the front cover of "Hitler's Pope".  

That cover picture story is interesting and demonstrative of Cornwell's penchant for manipulative tactics to get the result he wanted.  The building in the cover photo is the office of both the Weimar government and later Hitler.  Go to the UK Amazon site and notice that the cover photo for the same book is different than the cover on the American Amazon site.  They both naturally were the same(they both were the UK cover) when the book was originally published, but the surprise phone call by Rychlak to an American radio show Cornwell was on, not only forced Cornwell to then alter the photo, but change the inset text that described the photo.  But Cornwell still apparently couldn't help himself, he still was manipulative, so instead of eliminating the photo he carefully eliminated the parts of the photo and blurred the other parts that proved it was not a visit to Hitler, but to the Weimar government - Hitler's rivals before he took power.  Cornwell was further forced to reprint the book and change the text inside the book falsely claiming that the picture was taken after Hitler gained power.  

Some of Cornwell's misrepresentations and falsifications were exposed after Rychlak published his analysis of Cornwell's facts, so I suggest reading what Rychlak has published on the web in addition to reading Rychlak's book.
