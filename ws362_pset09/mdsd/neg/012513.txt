Well despite an appealing title, it remains an overview. The 
author is only giving a small extract of the programming code
which would be hard for someone to pick up without being more 
familiar with DirectX structure. Not very useful unless you
know some DirectX but then, does not give a lot more info ....
especially for $49 ! Don't waste your money.
