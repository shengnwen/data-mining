I have read a lot of books on value investing.  This book is really thinly recycled gruel.   It presents the value basics, but in a way that would not be terribly useful to a person who has never heard of value investing.

For example, one technique he recommends is to calculate the price people might pay to buy a company in a leveraged buyout (LBO), and then buy at a discount to that.   Now, if you are person who can accurately make that calculation--no easy thing for the man on the street--do you need a book that tells you that market timing is bad and you should buy stocks when they are 'on sale' and 'here is what a P/E ratio is'?

On the other hand, in a way the book is not detailed enough.  Browne has for years put out a little booklet called "What Has Worked in Investing" or something like that ... and it's quite nice.  You can get it for free on his company's website.   It is full of all the evidence that value investing works--lots of numbers, lots of tables.   Well, he has a chapter in the book called "Don't Take My Word for It", where he recycles that pamphlet--only taking out all the numbers and tables.   So we're left with a lot of text that rattles on with "blah blah blah" where a simple little half page table would have told the story in a way anyone could understand (again, see his free booklet which is well laid out and easy to read).

Get the free booklet on his company's website but if you want to learn about how to become a value investor, this book will not carry you far.  And if you already are an old time value investor, it's a yawn
