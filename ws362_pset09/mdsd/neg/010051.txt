Just to let anybody who comes here from anywhere other than the somethingawful forums know, ALL the reviews below were done by members of the SA forums ("Goons"). I bought this book, because I fell for the crap, but it is poorly written, not funny, not interesting, and could have been done so much better that I'm almost angry at myself for buying it. Just a really mediocre effort, from a really mediocre writer.
If you're really interested in this stuff, look it up on the net. This book is just a lame attempt by Parsons to get himself published, by any gimmick neccessary
