I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.

At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.

A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.

I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that.
