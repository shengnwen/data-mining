Well, the book does have some nice photos. My copy is in english. However, it really falls short of what was promised. First, there is virtualy nothing in it about architecture. Very few photos of buildings, houses, etc. at all. It's just a collection of photos of the interiors of homes designed by famous people. I was very disappointed.  For example, it goes on and on about european homes in mexico -- what does that have to do with mexican styles?  If you are looking for a book that is basically a Home &amp; Garden magazine with 270 pages then buy it. Like i said earlier - some nice photos.  If you wanted somethign else, then search on. Cause this may leave you unsatisfied
