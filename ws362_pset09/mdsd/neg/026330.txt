For those interested in the sorcery of medieval Europe, this book may look interesting - don't be fooled. It is a farrago of half-understood and often misrepresented material,  lifted from both actual grimoires, and from the anti-magical works of the church. The author pretends that there are medieval 'black books' of diabolism - there are none. He presents material lifted from Gardnerian Witchcraft as part of 'satanic' ritual, and in general lies freely to his readers. Those interested in the real magic of the middle ages, including demon-summoning, will do much better to read Waite
