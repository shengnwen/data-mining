But not quite. While I wouldn't say this was a terrible novel, I also wouldn't say that it was in any way memorable. Because of the wonderful dramatization on the audio cassette, I passed an afternoon at work more  pleasantly, being entertained by the acting skills of the readers. However,  if I'd been merely reading a text version of this story, I wouldn't have  finished it because the plot did not interest me enough to deserve my full  attention. The characters are too typical of a mystery novel, the prose  style unremarkable, and the ending not too exciting
