Yes, it IS rubbish.

And some people need to ACTUALLY... yes, I know this is a revolutionary concept for some lefties... need to ACTUALLY check out the facts before writing a review or criticizing someone else's review.

This author REALLY IS a TERRORIST.  LITERALLY.  It is a matter of PUBLIC RECORD.  He was a leader of the Weather Underground terrorist group in the sixties.  His group planted several bombs and blew things up.  To this day HE BRAGS ABOUT IT.  He says he wishes he could have planted even more bombs.  If you don't believe me, READ THE BOOK HE HIMSELF WROTE ABOUT IT.  It's available here on Amazon.

Freakin' morons..
