Don't be misled by the cunning title. This book is of use only to the most vapid and self-absorbed therapists or social workers.

I resented almost each of the 184 pages that I read in excruciating agony. Don't get me wrong, I was enthusiastic at first, then I started reading it. Her writing is less than inspiring. "Why?", a reader might ask, is an assessment important? Ms. Lukas is quick to respond that without an assessment, we wouldn't know what the problem is. It's insight like this that earns her a far, far down in the Amazon bestseller list.

I was watching this episode of "American Idol" last night, and saw this kid singing. I thought to myself, Wow!, this kid is good! I hope he wasn't abused! This is exactly the kind of caring that Ms. Lukas calls for in making assessments. I seem to have all the right attributes. Time for the next chapter, although it's going to be hard to top this one!

In her best moments, Ms. Lukas almost overcomes her powerful sense of self-importance to convey something useful, but never quite makes it happen. It's a shame that this book ends up as just another pointless slaughter of perfectly good trees. This wasted paper and wasted my time. Ms. Lukas again attempts to use her innovative "Powerpoint Bullet-point" style of writing to convey a sense of urgency, but comes up dry, like the Sahara on a hot California Friday afternoon in Summer, when there hasn't been any rain in a long, long time. I am reminded of the review on the back cover of the book, where Mr. Strean lauds the book as "highly readable." I would have to, like, totally agree with him. My initial analysis suggests that this book is composed of largely english vocabulary loosely organized into a framework of sentences and paragraphs. I didn't have the time to get much further than this, however, because it all seemed so schizophrenic. She hops from one half-finished thought to the next with the frequency of a cheap portable radio.

Why is there no zero star rating
