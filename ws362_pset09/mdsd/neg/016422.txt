This book is a prime example of how an able Bible expositor can sometimes rework a scripture text in order to make it say what he wants it to say. Swindoll does this throughout his book LAUGH AGAIN, which is a loose exposition of the book of Philippians. He substitutes the word `laughter' for `joy' and transforms the book of Philippians into a message that helps us to laugh about life. His application of the first eleven verses of Phillipians 1 is that we begin to laugh again when we place our full confidence in God (p. 44, large print edition).  Moreover, his title for the chapter on Philippians 2:12-18 is "While Laughing, Keep your Balance."  When Swindoll is determined to teach something that isn't in the text, his exposition tends to go awry, and that is exactly what happens in this book. 

Dr. Swindoll would have been farther ahead to write a book about experiencing more joy in your life and letting Philippians speak for itself. Not only would joy have been a relevant topic of discussion, but this approach would have modeled for his readers how to handle scripture. I do not recommend this book, but Swindoll has written other books that I do recommend heartily, including his GROWING DEEP IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE and his book PAUL from the stories of great lives series
