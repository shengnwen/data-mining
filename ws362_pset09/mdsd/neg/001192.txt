I wasn't too impressed about this book as many other reviewers were. The only positive thing I can say about this book is for its style. Obviously, Leo Tolstoy is well-known for his novel epics, WAR AND PEACE, and ANNA KARENINA, and also for his short stories (some which I've read and enjoyed). But from reading this book I didn't really see that brilliant storyteller. The book is more like a biography about a fictional character and his death than an actual story. Of course we as the reader get the universal ideas of death (such as "better him than me" attitude, "Why do i deserve to die this way God?" etc.), and as someone who has recently overcome the lost of a family member, I can relate. But to me I found this book boring and pointless to read (thank goodness it was a NOVELLA!). I don't really see how other reviewers gave this book 5 stars. I mean it was a well-written book and all, but nothing worth bragging about, and it's definitely NOT Tolstoy's best work.
