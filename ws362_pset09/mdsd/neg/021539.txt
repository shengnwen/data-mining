Ahh, so the illustrious Robert Jordan has graced us with a prequel.  Great.  More Wheel of Time to digest.  So how was it?  Honestly, it wasn't that bad of a book.  Much shorter than his usual efforts, the pace moved along faster than his later WOT installments (for the most part), and some interesting stuff in there about the end of the Aiel War, Lan's part in that conflict, and his eventual meeting with Moraine.

Sadly, those storylines mentioned above occupy only the beggining and ending of the novel.  Pretty much the entire middle is filled with the same dredging, monotonous crap that ruined books 8-11: namely, women bitching at each other.  I clung to the hope that the female characters in the prequel would not be subject to the same plague of whiny, insecure, petty bickering than has infected every single woman in the later WOT books.  I was violently disabused of that notion.  Young Morainne and Suian are sad dissapointments.  They are not the young and inexperienced, yet determined and formidable women you would expect.  They are carbon copies of Elayne and Egwene - stupid, jealous, unbelievably fickle characters that make you want to scream.  And a good 1/2 of the novel regards their day to day activities in the Tower: fetching tea, worrying about the Mistress of Novices, staging sorority girl pranks, and all that other crap we've already been through with Egwene, Nyneave, and Elayne!  Get to the point!

Did the book really need to be written?  No, especially with the end of the actual series looming, and so many loose threads still to tie up.  All in all New Spring was not terrible, but I really wish RJ would focus his effort on producing a few good books to wrap up Wheel of Time.  Then maybe he can start screwing around with prequels - if anyone is still interested at that point, and the way it's going now, I would say very few would. Count me out
