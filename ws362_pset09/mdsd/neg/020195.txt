I picked up this book because I was interested in future life progressions.  As one fairly conversant with the doctrines of reincarnation and recognizing this book was written over 20 years ago, my concerns are as fresh as they would have been when the book was first available:  (1) a total lack of objectivity. Dr. Goldberg has his own spiritual beliefs about reincarnation and things surrounding reincarnation, and he teaches and preaches from that viewpoint. Unfortunately, he fails to make it clear that he is teaching his personal dogma. (2)He is quick to condemn.  I was particularly struck by his blanket condemnation of all witchcraft, all covens, and by extension, all magical practices.  This bespeaks ignorance of the subject and comes from a fairly narrow view, much as if I were to give a blanket condemnation of Christianity.  Personally, I believe Christianity to be far more dangerous, but I recognize that this is opinion, and don't preach it as fact.  (3) Overall, I found his research and techniques very disorganized.  To me, this is rather sad for an accomplished hypnotist, because it diminishes his effectiveness.  Both in his writing and reporting, and in his interviews, I felt he 
could greatly improve both interview and writing style by having a better idea of where he is going and the cues given by subjects.
     Personally, Dr. Goldberg is not a practitioner I would select to help me with regression or progression, based on my experience with this book. There are other authors dealing with the subject.  I would direct the interested reader to a more solid author, such as Brian Weiss.
