Though it is a nice book, and maybe YOU don't care whether they get the details right, the book is factually incorrect on one topic: it states that the phases of the moon are caused by the earth's shadow falling on the moon. I couldn't believe such a huge mistake would make it through the editorial process, through the printers, and all the way to bookstores, so I looked it up to double-check myself. If you don't believe me look at the wikipedia article on "phases of the moon". 
While I don't expect my 5.5-year-old to understand all of the intricacies of planetary orbits, this is a basic fact that is WRONG. I tried to find the publisher online but so far have not (i.e. could not find "Cartwheel Books" and could not find Cartwheel's own section on Scholastic's site).
