I purchased this book because it was recommeneded to me. I started the book and quickly stopped because it was tough to read. I then went on to read other books such as "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers that involved world travel on the ground. When I came back to this book, I discovered what the problems were. Perhaps it's best if I quote other reviewer's here: Kaplan is "very well-grounded in historical and contextual reading" and "he is well-read". That's the problem. Kaplan spends most of his time telling us what other people think. He goes off on tangents and leaves me wondering what it is that Kaplan himself thinks. Another reviewer wrote "sometimes it is not quite the easiest read". It is tough reading even if you are familar with the places Kaplan is talking about. And finally, "IT IS NOT HIS BEST. THE MEANDERING, STOP AND GO, RABBIT TRAIL PROGRESS OF THE BOOK WAS A BIT DISTRACTING AND FRUSTRATING FOR ME" sums it up for me. So, if you found the fact that I quoted other people distracting then you'll understand what it is that I didn't like about Kaplan's book. I suggest "Adventure Capitalist" as an alternative
