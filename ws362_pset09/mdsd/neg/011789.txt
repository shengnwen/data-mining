This isn't a stereotypical biography. This is Teri Hatcher wallowing in self pity. Big time. It's nothing but saying how it's "tough" being a single mother, not getting many jobs until Desperate Housewives came along, how she didn't have any nookie with her husband on her honeymoon, how her husband doesn't love her, how's she divorced and over 40. Whoopee. 

Don't buy this book. There's no juicy gossip about Lois & Clark (like, my favourite show ever!!!), and she's full of it. Blah, what a waste of time
