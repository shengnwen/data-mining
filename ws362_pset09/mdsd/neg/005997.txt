Although Ms. Weir does a marvelous job of asking provoking questions and painting a vivid version of the medieval world, her editor should do a better job checking her facts.  Her conclusions about the number of images of Eleanor that exist are incorrect, and overall she relies on archeology and art history to prove her case - without actually bothering to check on the facts that these two important disciplines can provide.  Although charming as a story, Ms. Weir's work is lax by scholarly standards, and should be carefully considered as such.  A marvelous writer, but perhaps a less than thorough researcher, Ms. Weir is great fun - but I would quibble greatly with anyone who would responsibly try to use her work as a factual guide or textbook to the time and persons presented
