Does anybody out there need a book to tell them that CEO's, CFO's etc. are greedy?  If you do then this book is for you.  For the other 99% let me save you some money.  I purchased this book knowing Arianna Huffington to be an ecomomist as the cover points out, however the tone of this book is one of a socialist rather than that of a free market capitalist.  She continually gives us news accounts (secondhand none the less) of executives who greedily abuse their power for profit, without any solution other than government regulation.  I bought this book hoping to find some insight as to what can be done, and found nothing but news, with the exception of her continued demand for goverment regulation in this arena.  It seems that her solution to corporate corruption is to have government regulation to "fix" it. Not somthing an American economist would write, well Mrs. Huffington, went to Cambridge.  Perhaps she feels we should model ourselves after the stagnant European economy we passed 25+ years ago as a 200 year old country.
