"Checken Soup for the Soul" contains a series of short stories where horrible and depressing things happen. And then the story ends.  Each story contains an act of kindness, but the main focus is a sad, depressing, or horrible situation.  For example, a crippled boy chooses a crippled puppy to be his pet; and a young boy dies of cancer surrounded by friends.

Look, if you love watching Dramas on TV, you'll adore this book.  Ditto if you like crying.  For myself, I just don't understand how this is supposed to be uplifting
