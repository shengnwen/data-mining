At least if you only watch the movie you will save yourself a lot of time, I on the other hand was not so lucky. It is often said that the book is much better than the movie but not in this case. I often found myself saying "Why am I still reading this!" I thought the book would never end. Don't waste your time if you really need to read a novel by the author then pick "A day late a Dollar Short."
