I purchased this book as a reference for my office where we assist drivers with their vision related concerns. I believe the title is misleading. This is a good general guide to adult eye care. It is not &quot;a complete guide  to eye disorders&quot;. Missing are any mention of RP, amblyopia or any of  the other genetic disorders we see in our customers. There is no  consideration of any of the pediatric conditions which lead to adult vision  problems. The book has a thorough description of exam,contact lense and  eyeglass procedures which many readers may find helpful. We were very  disappointed and will need to purchase another book
