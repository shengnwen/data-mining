I thought that this book was a realy slow pase. I liked how they tied the beginning to the end and how everyone thought he was crazy. It is sad about the death that goes on durring the storie. The one thing that bugged me  about this book was that you never finf out the boys name who is the one  telling about the book. It is hard to write about someone when you don't  know his name. oh well, it was an ok book, my class thought that it was  slow too
