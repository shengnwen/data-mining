I loved the original book &quot;The Sherbrooke Bride&quot;.  I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse.  The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters.  Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time.  If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass.  Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so.  I would then read Sinjun's search for love.  It is very funny and captivating.  Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books.  She should have quit while she was ahead
