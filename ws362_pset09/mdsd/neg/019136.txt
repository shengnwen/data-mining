i will start off saying that this was a really interesting book and a must for people that like bananas or fruit history in general.  she clearly loves the topic she was writing about and has done extenseive research.  i found the book, a prodigy in the fruit book arena, very informative and interesting.  black and white photos and pictures of advertisements  and banana songs in the back enhance the book greatly and add a more fun feeling.  now, with that said, there really needed to be more work done on this book.  Jenkins is very repetetive throught the book and certain topics (like banana shipping) are found scattered throughout the book even though there is a banana shipping chapter.  some new facts and information were brought up in chapters after their designated chapter and that made note taking fairly unorganized.  this book needed to pass through several editors before it was released.  better orginization would have made it much better.  Very interesting, but certain parts of the book drove me crazy because of the lack of organization and reading the same lines (banana has gone from a luxury fruit to a poor mans fruit in such a short time) over and over throughout the book.  i would give it  2.5 stars, but since i cant, i'll just make it 2
