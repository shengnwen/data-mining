I spent many years as a manager and business consultant.  I am now doing a little consulting in my retirement years.  I bought this BPM book when it first became available.  I read about 50 pages and was unimpressed.  Recently, thinking I should spend more time "keeping up," I picked it up again.  

My reaction today remains the same: for me not worth reading.  After reading recent reviews here by YingAsReader and "slimeddy" I better understand why it is not worth my time.  "Proselytizing" as "slimeddy" writes, says a lot of the story.  This book reminds me of the hard selling "you've got to get with the quality revolution" books that were so popular in the 1970's.  They told why American management is "backward" and broadly described the potential of TQM and other formulas.  They also told nothing of the "how." As YingAsReader writes "the 'why' and the 'how' are missed."

If you've somehow missed the points:

	Business, life and the universe are moving (process).   There are no safe, static havens.  In management the old functional "silos" (production, systems, finance, etc.) are gone.  We finally understand business as process rather than 
a world of feudal domains.     

	Digitalization has made offer, acceptance, and contract execution "lickety split" fast, world-wide. Therefore we must 
grasp, integrate and innovate quicker than ever.  

  	Like the troops on the high ground, the business person who has the highest, and broadest view of what is going on has 	the advantage.

 	"Taking the high ground" in business today requires that you speak the latest "biztech" language, reflecting your clear understanding of the concepts involved, so that you may 
adapt them intelligently to your specific business.    

	And while your doing all this be sure to keep in touch with the customer.

This is all good advice but not exactly new.
