I study mythology and legends in Ancient Greece and so I got this book in the hopes it could lead me in new directions.  The fact is, that I easily have more sources on the legends I work with than this book does.  As a result I am deeply disappointed in this book and its claims to be a great resource.  My advice is to check with the nearest university library near you and the read some of the principle source books in the field you are interested in; they'll have more references and moreinformation than this collection but you may need to read French or German to benefit from them. Can't read French or German?  Then this book may be your best starting point to begin your own investigations into classical mythology
