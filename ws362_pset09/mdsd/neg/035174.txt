I'd love to be able to give this book a five star rating, since conceptually it is just what so many parents need to fortify their children's education.  

But anyone who would call Elizabeth I "England's Greatest Queen" has a decidedly Protestant, "Whig" view of history.  Christian readers should know that "Good Queen Bess" formalized her father Henry VIII's violent separation of England from its historic ties to Christianity and made martyrs and outlaws of the realm's leading intellectual lights, e.g., Edmund Campion, William Allen, etc.

It kills me to give a project with such a noble ambition a paltry two stars, but the last thing we need is another set of history books lionizing one of history's great despots
