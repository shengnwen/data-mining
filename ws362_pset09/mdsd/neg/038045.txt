The basic idea of this book is that problems in marital relationships are caused by childhood psychological wounds.  Those wounds are unconscious, but, according to the author, we all had them.  Many of the exercises (e.g., listening exercises) would be helpful, but they are basic, and many of them are not really based on the theory.  The author says repeatedly that we were "whole" humans in the womb, but we were damaged as children, and we need a healthy marriage to make us whole again.  Some of the examples in the book reveal a patriarchal mindset.  For example, in the section about "rewriting scripts" for arguments that a couple has repeatedly, the author suggests two alternatives that give the man what he wants, but no options for giving the woman what she wants.  But if I object to that, I suppose that it must be because I was wounded as a child
