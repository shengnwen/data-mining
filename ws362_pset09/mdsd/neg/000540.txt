This book (5th edition) provided a few good, new tips and explainations, but my overall impression is one of incredibly technical detail on the practical aspects of equipment and processes.  I feel like it's important enough to have a general understanding of &quot;how things work&quot; to stick with this book, but it does not give much advice on how to think about or approach photography.  My eyes often glaze as they pass over how to read manufacturers' charts and graphs, how calculate focal length and color balance, etc., but if you're into that kind of information, you might be interested
