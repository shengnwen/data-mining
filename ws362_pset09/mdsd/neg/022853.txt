I had this professor for a history of economics class and she writes just as she teaches; listlessly.  She meanders all over the place and will often throw in what she perceives as relevant information, but isn't about her trip to the Great Wall of China in the middle of discussing the pyshiocrats.  This book is bombastic in language, excessive in wordiness, and it will make you fall asleep by mid paragraph. Seriously, skip this book.  It is by far the worst economics book I've ever read
