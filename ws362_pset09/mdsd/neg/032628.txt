I remember my teacher reading this book to me in the first grade.  I thought it was the most racist book I had ever seen or heard & could not understand why someone would write something like that & think it was okay or to read it & think there's nothing wrong with it.  I am a 32 yr old african american woman now & I wouldn't dream of reading this to my children because it does not depict true african or african american children.  It's only a stereotype of how some people, who may have some racism in them, view us.  Now if you want to read a better version of this story, then you should read Sam & The Tigers.  A retold version of Little Black Sambo, written by Julius Lester.
