Fans of the Dan Jenkins of old will be disappointed in "Money-Whipped Steer Job....." and its sequel, "Slim and None". The old Dan Jenkins poked politically incorrect fun at everybody and everything. The new Dan Jenkins has sacred cows. Unless you, too, think very highly of Fort Worth, TX, you'll find little to connect you to these books.
