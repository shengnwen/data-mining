Mr. Scahill obviously has an axe to grind. A better subtitle would be: "I've Got My Mind Made Up, Don't Confuse Me With Any Facts." I was highly disappointed in the lack of research he conducted prior to going to print. Perhaps this is why the allegations he makes cannot be attributed to any credible source. Michael Moore, move over. This guy writes fantasy better than you do. I'm looking forward to the expose' on Jeremy Scahill
