 This story was about a boy named Robin who could not move his legs at all. His mom went to go see the Queen and his father was fighting the Scots in the North. While they were gone he stayed with a lady named Dame Ellen. One day she left and did not come back so a monk took him to a hospice. He wrote a letter to his father to meet him at Castle Lindsey. They met each other and soon his mom came home, by then it was Christmas time. They lived happily ever after. 
  I would give this book 2 stars because it did not hold my attenttion at all.

 I did not like this book at all it did not hold my attention.
