Ok, perhaps I'm being too harsh - parts of it are KINDA interesting for thse of us that are political junkies. Unfortunately, the Fenno book is also extremely dry to an unforgivable degree - but, thankfully, relatively short. 

He evalutates four of congress's "cohort pioneers" from the black community: starting with Louis Stokes, then Barbara Jordan, Chaka Fattah, then another chapter about Stokes' retirement in the 90s and his replacement by Stephanie Tubbs Jones. His evaluation entails the contextualization of their homestyles, and his analysis of the various driving forces providing impetus to their particular leadership styles and oreintations. The chapters about Stokes were interesting, as you get to see the evolution of his leadership style, which was pretty cool. The chapter about Chaka Fatah was absolute drivel, and only sightly better than literally eating my own brain (but perhaps more painful).

Overall, the book isn't the most horrible thing I've had to read (although it's certainly up there). More than anything, the book was an excruciating read because of Fenno's writing style, and the undue time spent on trite, unconsequential matters. But that's 100% personal preference - I spoke with a classmate that, to the contrary, thought the book was great
