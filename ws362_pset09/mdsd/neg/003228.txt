This is the favorite book of a friend of mine, she rereads it every year. She chose it for our bookclub, and the rest of us hated it! I think this is the best example I know of a book that either really connects with you, or doesn't at all. I have a degree in Eng. Lit. and certainly have encountered a number of books written in an unique or poetic style that I loved, but this one was for me rambling, full of tedious detail that lead nowhere and, since I didn't like a single character, I never felt invested in anything that happened to them. For others what was tedium for me, was poetry. I made myself read the whole book for the sake of the bookclub, but it was like taking medicine--still I can see that every word was a joy for my friend. This isn't a matter of being good or bad, its obviously a masterpiece for some, but if it isn't your kind of writing, you will find it more than a chore to get through
