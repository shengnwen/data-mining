The only benefit to this guide is that absolutely everything is in chronological order. Unfortunately, some of it is rather vague, and a lot of the little additives are completely unnessary, such as the "Missing Links" blurbs. Virtually all of that is irrelevent and useless. The "Author's Note" sections are just as ridiculous as well, if not more so. These inserts do virtually nothing to aid the player, but only make the authors look like tremendous fools who can't figure out the obvious. Also, there are no separate lists of the poe's souls, pieces of heart, or golden bugs that tell one the page numbers these can be found. This makes locating any of these items a not so pleasant experience, if one is simply trying to find one or two of any of these that one may have missed. Often I find the fortune teller in town to be more helpful when trying to find any pieces of heart that I forgot about. Overall, this guide was poorly written
