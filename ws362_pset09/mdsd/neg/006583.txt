 I am writing this review 10 minutes after finishing the book. Rakoff has a great writing style, impeccable  vocabulary and attention to details. At the beginning the book carries you away deep inside Rakoff's life events enriched with spicy humor as tasty as the "sea minerals from the crispy cubes of salt on the hot potato." As one continues with the second half of the book the humor is fainting and the content gets monotonously populated with details. Undoubtedly, it is one of the better best sellers available at the time if you can rank any of them as best sellers. I liked the identity of the book, the Canadian spirit in it. It is straight forward, no police involved, no secret codes, or promiscuous humans involved in wild orgy -all famous American themes - I still wander how it became a best seller.
