I am an avid reader and I am not sure what to make of the other individuals' assessments of this novel.  I gave it 2 stars because the writing wasn't horible, but I did not see any development in the characters or any compelling reason to become engaged in the story.  

Written almost entirely from Lorna's perspective (with the exception of about 5 pages), readers are unable to see any internal dimensions to the other characters.  Even when written from Lorna's perspective, there are no clear dimensions to her character either.  There were attempts to provide depth to personalities, but, in my opinion, ultimately failed.  Instead, I found myself unable to really care what happened to the members of the story. Most people want characters who maintain a level of complexity, whose stories evoke some sort of emotional response.  These characters provided none of these things.

If you want to read a romantic suspense with no romance or suspense in it, then this is a perfect choice.  Even knowing this, I wouldn't get my hopes up. Try a Nora Roberts, Suzanne Brockmann or a Tami Hoag for characters with depth and a story that compells you to not put the book down.  This book just wasn't it
