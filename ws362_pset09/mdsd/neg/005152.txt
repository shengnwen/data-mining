THIS BOOK IS ALMOST ALL PHOTOS OF GOBLETS, VERY FEW PHOTOS OF ANYTHING ELSE,THE PHOTOS ARE POOR IN MANY EXAMPLES, THE PRICES SEEM VERY UNREAL. RUTH WEBB LEES HANDBOOK OF EARLY AMERICAN PRESSED GLASS PATTERNS IS MUCH  MORE INFORMATIVE AND HAS BETTER PHOTOS IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE  THIRTIES. THE BEST NEW BOOK IVE FOUND ON PATTERN GLASS IS  THE COLLECTORS  ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PATTERN GLASS. BY MOLLIE HELEN MCCAIN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  YOU BUY MOLLIES BOOK, YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED WITH IT, AS I WAS WITH THIS  ONE
