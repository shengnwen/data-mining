I was really disappointed with this book for two reasons: 1) Carolyn praised Donald Trump throughout the entire book (I understand that she is very grateful for working for Mr. Trump but she comes off more like a starry-eyed love sick puppy.  2) She really did not provide any real business tips beside those that are pretty much common sense. 

This book was not worth the money if she writes another book I will make sure I check it out from the library first before spending anymore money.
