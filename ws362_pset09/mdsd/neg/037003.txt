If you're looking for a clear, concise guide to delving into the world of the occult, you've found it. Like most of the books in the "Idiot's Guide" series, it's easy to follow and practical. So why do I rate it one star? Because in this case, clear and concise instructions are a negative. It's like a book that gives great instructions on how to become a drug addict. I strongly suggest taking time to consider the dangers of communicating with demonic spirits before taking this leap. It's actually very EASY to communicate with demonic spirits, even without instructions. They WANT to communicate with you, but you can bet it's not to help you in any way! No one dabbles in the occult and comes out of it for the better. I have to assume that most readers interested in this type of book are open-minded. Why not try communicating with a much higher power to get true enlightenment and direction
