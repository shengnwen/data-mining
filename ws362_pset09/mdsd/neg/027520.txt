The organization of this book is very confusing.  After chapters giving a pep talk, the author discusses riding in general, then gives just one basic chapter on Western and then English riding.  I never knew quite where I was.  The author brings up terms without defining them, and finally, some sentences are almost incomprehensible, requiring several readings.  For example try to figure out &quot;posting.&quot;  And I still don't know what this sentence means:  &quot;In other words, if you are riding around the arean to the left, with rail on your right side and the middle of the arena on your left side, your horse should take the left lead, so that it can canter comfortably to the left while curved, or 'bent' slightly to the left.&quot
