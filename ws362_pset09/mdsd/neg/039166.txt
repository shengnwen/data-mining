I was disappointed with &quot;Missing Men.&quot; I was expecting to find bits of insight, perhaps a pearl of wisdom here and there, something to connect with and relate to, being an artist, having been a single mother, having loved intensely, surely these were things that connections are made of....and yet I am left with the sensation of this being a fairly dry and remote recital of Johnson's family &amp; relationship history.  I felt she was more of an impersonal narrator rather than intimately and emotionally involved with her story.  I finished the book wondering why Johnson had written it, what was her point, what did she want to convey to me with her memoirs?  What did I gain by reading it?  Nothing, I'm afraid.  I compare this with &quot;Too Close to the Falls&quot; by Catherine Gildiner... both set in New York, both describing their childhoods (well, I guess that's a prerequiste of a memoir, isn't it)... Johnson's book left me dutifully turning the pages to finish it, to get it over with... just the opposite of Gildiner's book, I hated to see it end.  Why did one bore me and another interest me?  I have no answer for that, perhaps it's entirely due to my psyche and has nothing to do with the authors.  But this is not something I'm adding to my recommended reading list
