I cannot believe this book was written by a woman.  Each page is insult after insult.  This author greatly offends me.  I am a stay at home mother and wife. But I am in no mean subservient to my husband, or any man. I am glad this woman could speak her mind and ramble with insanity.  But she is stuck in an era that has long since past.  She needs to get over it and move on. If this is what a "conservative" women sounds like, I just turned liberal real quick
