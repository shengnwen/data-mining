I can't argue with the fact that the author knows his research material.  The problem is that the book is so full of examples, that it makes for a very difficult and painful read.  There is no flow, no voice, just examples.  And I mean multiple examples in one paragraph.  No real analysis, just a compression of facts and other information. This would have been better off as a bibliography and not an attempt at an actual book
