As a person who researches war memoirs, I have to say that this particular book doesn't ring true.  The author seems to have had far more experiences that most veterans who write memoirs. From what I have gleaned, war consists of long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of abject terror.  The author goes from one incident to another, many of which don't seem quite right.  The incident of shooting the two German prisoners seems to me like a story the author heard and he simply injected himself into it.  The  triumph he feels because he shoots both prisoners with one bullet seems overdrawn to me though I suspect that this was a rumor that made the rounds of forces in Europe. Rumors and tall tales were rife then, as other memoirs make clear.  However, if you are looking for a good yarn, this is full of incident though the trained scholar will probably note some problems with verisimilitude.
