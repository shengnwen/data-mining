This book could have been titled "The Best of Bill James" instead of "The Mind of Bill James."  About 70% of the book is just excerpts from old publications of James', often inserted without any real context or additional insight.  Gray, when he appears, is a decent writer but not a great one, and I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that his writing style often seems derivative of James himself.

Fun in parts, but poorly edited, disorganized, and ultimately a very sparse book
