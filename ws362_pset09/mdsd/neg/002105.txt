Dr. Diehl would have you believe that all military accident investigators are corrupt, while operators are innocent victims of ignorance and subterfuge.  Having had some experience with the USAF mishap investigation system, I would agree that their are many problems.  I would not agreed that the system is as corrupt as Dr. Diehl would have you believe.  I have read many reports that have probed the depths of human factors.  I have read none that simply label accidents as "pilot error" without probing into details on why error was made.  I believe Dr. Diehl has done a great "disservice" to those many investigators who did their very best to find the true cause of accidents and to prevent their recurrence.  He has written this book to appeal to the emotion of the reader... if you were to remove the adjectives and superlatives, the book would make a very thin paperback
