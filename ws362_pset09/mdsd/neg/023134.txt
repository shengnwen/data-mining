Well, this is one of the more inventive books I've ever read.  It was difficult to plod through, however, I continued with the hope of a great reward at the end.  The reward was small.  

For awhile I was being pulled along by curiosity.  After a few chapters I grew tired of the "game" and just had to try to keep myself from getting distracted so I could finish the book.  I'm glad I actually reached the end, but I'm not sure it was worth the effort.

I realize that more scholarly types think this book is spectacular.  I'm just an ordinary reader and I found it unenjoyable
