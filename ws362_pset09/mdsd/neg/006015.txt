I'm using this book for an undergraduate thermo class.  It is one of the worst textbooks I have used.  It may be large and comprehensive, but the organization is horrible.  The book is extremely unclear, and when you start to do the problems at the end of the chapter, you really see how little got through to you.  The problems are often vague and hard to understand, which adds to the problem.  You can read it over and over and still get neither the math of thermodynamics, nor the physics behind it
