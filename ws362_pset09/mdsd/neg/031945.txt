There are lots to like about this book. As the back cover says, it "captures the heat, the fury, and the intense human drama" of the Southern conflict. But I don't trust what the author presents as "facts."

That is, some of his research relies on books that relied on dubious 19th century writers. Which means that Lt. Colonel Banastre Tarleton is painted as pure evil, from the first page we meet him. Example: a couple of his men attacked some women at a plantation. Edgar writes, "Although several of the dragoons involved were disciplined, their commander was not." This gives the wrong impression of Tarleton's actions, or inactions, regarding this matter. Surely Edgar knows that Tarleton, when told of what had happened, sent a surgeon and 12 men to guard the women, and recommended hanging for these men. All in all, I'm left with the impression that the book sacrifices detail to paint a picture that isn't entirely accurate. Simply put, I'm unable to trust what I read.
