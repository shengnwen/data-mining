    This book encourages purity and respect in a relationship and that's great.  It discourages casual dating and takes getting to know each other seriously.  Good.  It also encourages not rushing into marriage and benefits of waiting (but, uh, disregard that Mrs. Ludy was only 18 when the couple married).

    But beyond that, there's a lot of problems.  This book is the view of ONE COUPLE.  If you're looking for a perfect formula for a relationship, there isn't one.  Different people will have different "love stories," and the book is mostly personal example from the Ludys--very subjective stuff!

    Serious warning for those who don't like gooey romance:  this book will give you sugar shock with its cotton-candy fluff speech.  If you want to read about being a "princess of purity" as you "give God the pen of your life" (um, God is in control of the universe, He already HAS the "pen") this cutesy, fluffy book will be a treat for you.  If you're a little less into that sort of thing, as I am, you'll be raising a brow.

    The Ludys' personal, subjective account is not an "ultimate approach" that can apply to anyone.  Even in godly relationships there will still be problems and hurts.  The ultimate approach to your personal life is going to be unique.  Study God's Word and walk with Him.
