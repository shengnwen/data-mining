Although this book is touted on several Anusara web sites as a book about Anusara, I found it to be more about self-loathing and a poor body image.  From cover to cover, the author rehashed her, and other's, disfunctions and  poor self-esteem related to a poor body image and eating disorders.
Now, if you fall into any of the afore mentioned catagories, you may find this book for you.  If not, it's a waste of time. (I too have looked in the mirror during a yoga session and thought, jeez, I'm going to have to not eat for the next month...., but I didn't dwell on it.  And I don't consider a new pedicure when gazing at my feet in down dog.)
My truly, heart felt advice to those of you whom this book will speak to is, spend less time on the mat and more in meditation, until you get your mind under control.  I am saddened for anyone who is their own worst enemy.  Life is too short.
Yoga, and all it's attendant traditions, are so much more.  Let it be so for you
