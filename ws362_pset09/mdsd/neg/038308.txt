The line is very thin in this book. It is a very short read. For those of us actually in the Air Force, the references to Security Forces are hard to get past being that the author researched nothing into the USAF at all. None of the facts about the Air Force  or SF are accurate. That being said, we are on to the story. 
Like I said, it may be horror, it may be porn. Hard to tell. The author has a particular afinity for rape scenes. 
All in all, it is a very dumb and unsatisfying book. It seemed a good effort for a teenage author in need of release for violent and sexual frustrations, but for a thinking audience, this is hardly worth the time to glance over the back cover.
