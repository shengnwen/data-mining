I would not recommend this book...OK...Maybe you will call me picky but I am looking for the original...the gutsy portrat of human feelings and souls...true conflicts and passions when I pick a book....well written and intense captivating stories...the same old, same old doesn't do it for me anymore...so If I don't find that "it" factor that screams these characters have skin and blood and their guts are clearly portrayed through pages filed with a narative that flows ...I just won't say I liked what I read...There is a lot to the romance style and it will never be what it can be if we always settle for the same old cliche....SO far, the only writter that has fully accomplished that... in my opinion... is Diana Gabaldon...that my friends is a good writter...but I'll kep on searching...keep on siping from all authors and books that fall on my lap...I want to find more amazing romance writters and novels....I a sure I will....but Kiss and Tell was not one of those...sorr
