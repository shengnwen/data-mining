Is there anything worse

than meringue-y verse

whose rhythm goes all sprung

while it's being sung?

Now, if your ear doesn't detect any problem in the above quatrain, you will probably like this book for its inventive and colorful artwork and its agreeably silly text.

If you have any kind of ear for poetry, you will instantly hear the extra beat in the third line. It jars you and spoils the poem. Almost every poem in this book has at least one broken rhythm like that -- often, several -- and it is maddening. If you want to enjoy light verse with grotesque art, read Edward Gorey and stay miles away from SCIENCE VERSE. Whatever you do, do NOT get yourself trapped into having to read this doggerel aloud--it will be torture! Scieszka has cute ideas but he's got a tin ear, and his poetic license should be revoked forthwith.

Oh, and -- don't look for any actual teaching of science or the love of nature. The book gets its humor from playing word games with the vocabulary of science textbooks, or by poking snarky fun at how boring it all is. But of any tone or attitude that would suggest fondness for the wonder of the world or the joy of finding out how things work, there is none. Just because a book is funny and plays with the words of science does not make it a science book
