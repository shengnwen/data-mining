The reader who said this book is challenging hit the nail right on the head. It is indeed very challenging to read this book and realize that it is written under non-fiction. Like Michael Moore's "documentary" which was more fiction than fact, American Dynasty should be listed under fiction not non-fiction. Of course the left wing liberals will like this book as much as they like all of the  other mindless, factless, feelgood garbage that permeated book store shelves up untill 13 months ago and were proven to be baseless nonsense. Some people want to believe which is to say, they probably want to believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and The Tooth Fairy too.
