This book is nothing but a load of propaganda and quotes from a bible written solely by men.  This is not the type of book for an independent, freethinking woman.  This is a great book for a mindless person looking for inspiration on how to be married to a man and give him control over you.  I would suggest reading Sue Monk Kidd's, Dance of the Dissident Daughter.  It will give you far more insight on how being an empowered woman can enhance all parts of your life, including being a wife.
