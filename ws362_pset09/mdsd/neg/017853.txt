Being a student of William O'Neil's CANSLIM method of stock selection I found this book tiresome to read mainly because I know the subject matter so well.  Dr. Sethna was certainly long winded and rambling in his writing style and could have said what he did in a third of the space he used.  If you desire to learn about William O'Neil's methods purchase his book, &quot;How to Make Money In Stocks.&quot;  Lastly, Investor's Business Daily has added many new features since Dr. Sethna wrote this book so some of the information he shares about the paper is dated
