I'm giving this book such a low rating because of the ridiculous price. I bought it and read it a few years ago and I never feel the need to make reference to it. I question the actual value of the exercises. Recently when I was doing basic military training, I was doing some small knee circles before morning pt. One of the medical officers in my platoon walked over to me and said "stop that, that won't do a thing for you". For what I paid to read about this technique, that should have been the last thing on the mind of a medical professional.
