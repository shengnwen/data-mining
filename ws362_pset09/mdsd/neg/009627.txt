This is not a book I can recommend.  There was no depth of character, or plot.  I expected some twists and turns, but it was all predictable.  The characters are indelibly flat.  Of greatest dissapointment were the heresies, for the author just seems to pass by them as unimportant.  There are some major Pelagian defects in the thoughts of one of the protagonists, and the magnitude of the defects is swept aside by the characters we are meant to bond with, who decide in favor of the heresy through simple platitudes!  The primary character, Cadfael, seems to contribute but little to the book or the mystery, and I found great difficulty in caring for any of these characters at all
