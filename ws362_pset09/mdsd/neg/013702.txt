I first read Clavell's Shogun when I was twelve years and it sparked within me a life long interest in East-Asian culture. In many ways he helped bring me to Japan, where I have lived for a total of eight years. However after reading his works for many years, I was quite bored with Gaijin, which I never finished. I perused through the book looking for interesting points but found little. His messages in his other works were repetitive in this one. Amongst them are his criticisms of western culture through an Asian perspective. I grew tired of hearing how sexually repressed white-anglo-saxon-protestants are when compared to their Asian counter-parts, and thought my reading time was too precious to sit through another lengthy reading of how East meets West. Some of my friends in Japan have read Gaijin and liked it; but after owing so much to this writer, I am sorry that I could not say more of this work.
