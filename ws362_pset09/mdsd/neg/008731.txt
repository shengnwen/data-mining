Having read this book, as well as Ravi Batra's &quot;Crash of the Millenium&quot; and James Dale Davidson's &quot;The Sovereign Individual&quot;, I can't help but point out that these are the same people that were telling us to expect a U.S.economic/financial market collapse throughout the '90s(see: &quot;Blood in the Streets&quot; and &quot;The Great Reckoning&quot; by Davidson/Rees-Mogg, &quot;The Great Depression of 1990&quot; by Batra, and Prechter's newsletters/special reports from that period). Obviously, they turned out to be just a tad off the mark. After a peruse of this material, have a look at one of Harry Dent's books for a look at the baby boom spending wave that continues through the latter half of this decade (Dent points out on his website that the current economic dip we are in is similar to the one that took place between 1920-1922, before the Roaring 20's market took off). The only way that the kind of boom the Spending Wave projects can ever take place would be if the majority are looking in the wrong direction. Material such as this book from Prechter, as well as Batra and Davidson, will do very nicely
