I, for one, am not a fan of inspirational stories. I honestly thought that this is one of the most stupid books I ever read. I had to read this for summer reading and I really did not enjoy it. At all. Yay, so three boys from the ghetto became doctors. Incredible. Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. Don't waste your time. It's stupid.
