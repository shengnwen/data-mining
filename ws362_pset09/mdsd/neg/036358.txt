Only one-third of the book covers what a typical Rich Dad Poor Dad reader would expect: how to use corporations to protect one's assets.  The information in this section is really helpful and interesting, especially for beginners.  The author provided great examples to illustrate key points.  The writing overall, however, could be improved by having better summaries of each chapter and by defining every new legal term used in the book (for example, the book never defined "indemnification" but it used it frequently).  

Another one-third of the book covers how to start a company and take it public (have it listed as a public stock).  I don't think any typical Rick Dad Poor Dad reader has this purpose in mind for their businesses or real estate purchases, so this second part of the book is utterly useless and irrelevant to most readers.  The last one-third of the book basically lists the laws for incorporation for each state, which is useful, but I'm sure the author could have provided a webpage to list all this information.  

Another thing to consider is that this book might be outdated.  It was published in 2001, and laws may have changed by now (this review is written in early 2006).  For example, the double-taxation policy of dividends was changed after the publication of this book.  I think the author might have overcome this by providing updates to important relevant laws through a website or something similar.  

For all these reasons, I'd recommend the interested reader to explore other sources first.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend other books yet.  If there doesn't seem to be any other good sources, then consider reading this book only if you can buy it used or borrow it from the library.
