It does not surprize me that this book has dropped over 200% in retail price. It wouldn't even get a passing grade in a beginning creative writing class - it's that poorly written. The fact that it's being promoted as "non-fiction" is an insult to the intelligence of consumers. I can only hope that we've seen the last of James Frey.
