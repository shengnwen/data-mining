I got Front Page at a discount (quote unquote) - no expensive packaging AND no booklet.  I have some experience with the programming world but was lost and knew I needed help.  This was the first (and worst) place to turn.  Like another reviewer, my wife thought this was just what I wanted...and at first I did too.  But the presentation was jumpy and worse, it seemed as if the author were addressing a room of Microsoft business folks. Many of the explanations were of the obvious, particularly the review of all the menus.  Why not put these in an appendix for later perusal?  I was not looking for the dumbed-down Idiots series but I did need something that this did not fulfill.  After much searching I found just the one and now am ready to go "on line" with my new site
