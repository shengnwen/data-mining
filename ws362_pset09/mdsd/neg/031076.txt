I don't even know where to start with this, and I have to admit that despite several attempts, I only made it through 110 pages and couldn't stomach any more. Based on the first 110 pages, one of the main characters, Augusta, is so snide and rude and intolerant of anyone who believes or thinks differently than she does, that she seems more like a 13-year-old brat than an adult woman. The author clearly has issues with religion and makes every religious person in the book a caricature and portrays the people who are basing their lives on the occult as the "wise" ones. And even given that conservative-bashing and Christian-bashing is what all the "popular kids" are doing in our society, I will say that even the author's characterization of Augusta is extreme. This novel just didn't appeal to me at all
