I am an organizational psychologist, and I have been reviewing a lot of bibliography about positive thinking, optimism, depression and related concepts. The very apealing title of Ventrella's book moved me to read it, but I dindn't find what I expected to find. From my point of view, this book by Scott Ventrella has three importantan weaknesses and one strength. First, it adds nothing new or different from the original book by Norman Vincent Peale &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot;; second, during the reading I felt, many times, like I was hearing a preacher and not a man from bussines administration arena; third, in spite of the etimologic analisys of key words used to nominate the 10 traits, Ventrella has a very low conceptual precision. He makes some reference to some cognitive psychologists, like Ellis and Seligman, but the book is far from having a suond psychological foundation. The only strength I found in this book is the style to write: Ventrella has a light, entertaining way of writing. The stories and anecdotes he tells in his book make it easy and nice to read it. Books like this, that attempt to show the efficacy of an approach only based in some &quot;succesfull&quot; cases, without empirical support are not very usefull for changing nothing. From the time of the first edition of the Vincent Peale's book, a lot of literature has been published in the same line. If the subject (to be positive)was so simply and easy as this books say, we couldn't explain why depression continues growing up in the world. I think we need instead a better diffussion of more scientific solid demonstrated concepts and technics to really help people
