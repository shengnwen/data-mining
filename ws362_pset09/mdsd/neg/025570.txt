I like self-reference jokes. I enjoy them quite a bit, actually. But this book beats you over the head with it. I wanted to read the whole thing, just so I could feel like I had a more informed opinion than I would otherwise, but I got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better. I see a lot of reviews full of praise here, but for me reading this was incredibly tedious. He lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on The Real World. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because I didn't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we're shown how arrogant the main character is. But I don't really care, I hated it.
