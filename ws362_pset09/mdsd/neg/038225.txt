A poorly layed out book with extremley poor quality printing and very little informative information. The coupons are completely useless and not to mention hardly worth it, when you could pick up cuopons at travel info  booths along the way. However, the book has potential if colour is  introduced and some useful information is written. Might I suggest a  wonderful book instead &quot;Along the I-75: a unique driving guide for the  I-75&quot; in it's 7th edition. Now this is definitely a book for the  Interstate traveller using I-75.  The authour of that book is Dave Hunter
