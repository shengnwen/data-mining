I read the first few paragraphs, and quickly realized Mr. Baigent likes to makes outlandish claims.  

Napoleon died in 1821.  60 to 100 years after that is 1921 not 2000.  But yet he makes the claim that we can compare the date of the writing of the scriptures to the date Napoleon lived and the present day.  

This is patently absurd.  I decided to stop reading such a book.  If his first argument is so ridiculous, what should we expect from the rest of his book?  

I returned this book of fabrications.
