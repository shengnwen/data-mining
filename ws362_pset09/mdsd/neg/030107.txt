This book looks to be an in-depth expose of the lives of presidents since Kennedy.  However, it quickly turns into a anti-Democrat and Clinton-bashing book.  Johnson is portrayed as a compulsive liar and serial adulterer and Carter is described as a disingenuous hypoctite.  Reagan, on the other hand, is portrayed as a nice man who was a wonderful human being.  While this may be true, it is worth noting that this is the same man who lied to the American people about his knowledge of the Iran-Contra scandal and who left office with the worst budget deficit and highest unemployment rate in American history.  This man also declared war on the world power that is Granada and bombed that country back to the Stone Age.  The auther seems enthralled by Reagan and repeatedly describes him as a great communicator (which he was) and a man who could make you feel good.  Of course Reagan could do these things...he was an ACTOR!  That is what actors do!  The worst part of the book is the end.  Kessler wrote this piece in 1995, just over 3 years into the Clinton presidenc.  Yet, criticism of Clinton dominates the book and is almost 2.5 times as long as the chapters on Reagan, Johnson, and Nixon who each served over 4 years.  Kessler condemns the press for not investigating Clinton's lies about his philandering and makes the case that since Clinton can't keep his Billy in his pants he is unfit to be president.  If that were the ultimate judge of a man's ability to govern a country, most of the world's countries would be left without a leader.  Also, U.S. presidents throughout history have had mistresses: Jefferson, Cleveland, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Roosevelt among others.  The fact is this book does not reveal any bombshells about president's secret lives; all it reveals is Clinton's healthy extramarital sexcapades.  Clinton-haters should love this book, though there are better books available on the subject
