I have read other books by Gabriel COusens (Conscious Eating and Depression-Free for Life).
This book disappointed me very much. It is full of traps and actually does more harm than any good;
The worst thing about it is the utopian-perfectionist-idealistic lookout this book sets out. Basically what he is saying is, "Live like me otherwise you're on your way to enthropy". His advice is sometime in place, but at times it is about either using HIS tree of life products or simply going to the tree of life centre. Where else would you have live-food panchakarma, rebounding while breathing 100% oxygen etc?
On one hand the author talks about the destruction of self, ego etc. but on the other he boasts about his abilities as to fast, stay off anesthetics or do push ups.  The author is ANYTHING but humble and I find that disturbing.
Also the terminology he uses is very confusing. His use of Indian words seems to be in place, as he explains their meaning, but the use of Hebrew words seems to be useless. It seems he likes to use exotic-sounding words just to make his teachings exotic. It is not straight to the point.
Another frustrating part is the frequent reference to his other books. Instead of putting a chart from his other books, he just says to go and look it up, yet goes on discussing the implication of what's in the chart. This is highly unprofessional. 
The authors poetry is of questionable quality but that's to each one's taste. It seems he tries hard to be artistic, tries too hard.
His concepts of IAM and I AM THAT are very foreign to me. To be honest from reading his text I did not understand what he is on about. AGain it seems that instead of talking to the point, he goes on to ramble half-thoughts in the air. His frequent mention of himself as a model of the perfection he speaks about is nothing short of disgusting.
Not recommended - a trap for those who are blinded by idealism
