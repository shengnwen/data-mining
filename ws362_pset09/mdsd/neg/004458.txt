I found this book to be too much of a &quot;cookbook&quot;. Information is good, but not enough at all. The section about the divisionals is bad..why tell you how to construct a navamsa or hora chart if she doesn't tell you  how to use it during interpretation? It's an okay introductory text..but I  strictly mean &quot;just okay&quot;. Light on Life by Hart DeFouw is *MUCH*  better, although you must be more of an intellectual to grasp the  information. Dreyers book was written for attention spanned challenged  Americans, I think. It was one of the first jyotish books I bought, but I  don't refer back to it when I have a question. I couldn't recommend this  book
