Shahak was a chemistry professor better known for his racist, anti-Jewish diatribes. His allegations range from the outright distorted to the flat out fictional. One example is the often used slander that the Talmud allows relations with minors. Actually, it is a sin and a crime under Jewish law. It is rape. There IS a discussion that does NOT ask whether it is allowed but whether the victim of this rape is considered a "non-virgin" when they grow up and seek to marry. In a culture where virginity is considered important for marriage, the victim may become a double victim, victimized by the rapist and again by society, being labelled a "non-virgin." The final answer is that they are considered a virgin when it comes time to get married. However, this discussion that "it is as nothing" is taken out of context as if it allowed rape. Shahak also makes many bizarre and patently false allegations such as his claim that Jews and Israelis dont' use "+" signs in addition because they are "little crosses" and that observant Jewish ritual involves desecrating Christian graves. If many readers who don't know much about Judaism find it an "eye opener," there is good reason. Shahak is making this stuff up.   If you want to know what Judaism REALLY says or Jewish Law, the Talmud really says, find out for yourself. Go to your local orthodox synagogue and ask for lessons or go to a free class. Heck, pretend you're Jewish and see what we "really" think and say. And you can also check out: http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Cyprus/8815/
