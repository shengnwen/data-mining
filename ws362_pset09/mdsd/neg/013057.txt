I was looking forward to reading this book but was disappointed when finished with it especially since it's written by Zaha's right-hand design partner and office director. I expected it to be a description of Zaha Hadid's design process, the move from manual to digital design and the techniques used to create form and design buildings. One rather gets long empty characterizations of the poetics of form and Zaha's move from deconstructive to organic shapes.
It's full of many nice images though if that's what you're looking for. To sum up, this book is good only as a brochure.
