It's hard for some to believe, but it is what it is. Christianity is not what it was 50 years ago, which is not what it was 150, and so on. It is not the same religion it was during the crusades, nor the inquisitions. It changes with the times. It is a creation of man and controlled by man. Christianity itself is an evolution of judaism.
People should be content with people who are kind and caring and good hearted, despite any religion or lack there of they may have.
