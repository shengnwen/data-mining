I will first admit that I have not yet finished the book. And I will also admit that I am reading it because of The Da Vinci Code. Very intriguing tale. I must say that Dan Brown lays out the case far better than Ms. Picknett. I couldn't help but wonder, "When is she going to get to the point?" So when do we actually hear about Mary Magdalene? So far all I have read about is her obvious distaste for "The Church." As if the Roman Catholic church is the only church involved with the "shaky" Christian religion. And as if all Catholics or indeed all Christians are sanctimonious sexual predators. Well, dear, my faith has not been shaken, not in Jesus and not in my church. Even if Mary Magdalene was in fact Jesus's wife, concubine, illicit or blatant lover. And I do consider myself a student of science and well educated, as well as one who views the world with a skeptical eye as I will soon graduate from medical school. And still my faith isn't shaken. It's as if in this book she is trying to justify her dislike for the church by massive leaps of logic and an unholy obsession with Leonardo Da Vinci. So tell me, by the end of the book, will I find the point
