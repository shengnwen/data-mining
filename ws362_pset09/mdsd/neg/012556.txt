This is not a good book. I was tempted to stop reading it. On the positive side:
+ N & P do know how to tell a story.
+ There are some interesting elements in this fantasy world, like the social organization of the city and the magic system.
On the negative side:
- The plot is too disconnected to grab your interest.
- The characters are rather shallow.
The ending is part ingenious (fighting the elemental), part nonsensical (burning the contract)
