Like other people have said, this book is pretty short.  To make matters worse, it repeats itself a lot and wastes a lot of pages with boring code such as using 3 pages to show a POJO (plain old java object) with nothing but getters and setters.  Did they really need to show that?  This book is an ok introduction to hibernate, but definately isn't worth the price.  A lot of the same information can be found online, and this book doesn't really present the information in a new or useful way
