I read this years ago for a class I was taking. It was awful, but required.  At the same time I was working the night shift in a psychiatric hospital.  The book bears absolutely no resemblence to the real world of mental illness. 

If you have to read this book for a course, hopefully you will then move on to a more interesting and useful class. 

If you want realism, try Ken Kesey's "One flew over the Cookoo's nest".  Everyone I was working with at the state hospital read this book, then the local college produced it. A lot of the patients were taken to see the play and they loved it. (This was before "patients" became "clients").  The movie gave me nightmares; I saw it after I left the hospital and it was too real.  The mental health field has of course changed considerably since the 70's and a lot of those people are now out on the streets talking to themselves.

Unfortunately Szasz is a classic theorist and this book will still continue to be read
