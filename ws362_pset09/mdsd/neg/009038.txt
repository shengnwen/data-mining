This is not a useful book for the eastern Backpacker, who has been carrying 55-60 lb. on the AT and wants to reduce his pack to a  20-25 lb. pack load, without going to the poor house in the process. The book lacks personality and feelings about why we backpack.

This is a highly analytical book on the technical aspects of Lightweight Backpacking in the west. Be less clinical and enjoy the experience a little more.This book is for those who mainly buy  at the high end and at a few select sources. It is also assumes that most backpackers live or pack near or west of the continental divide. It does not mention our many fine supply houses in the east, nor the different environments we encounter in the east
