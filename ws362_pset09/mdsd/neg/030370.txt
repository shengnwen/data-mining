This book is alright if youd like to hear about what scientist rushed into the other ones office screaming. Or the life of Dr. Planck, and three hours later find out what the planck length is and what it,s used for. i personally want the facts and the information about the interesting subject that they use as their title. Not the history of why a world class scientist killed himself. To sum up it's a great book if you want a biography with the interesting stuff strewn about in many places so you have to search. although if you like a historical book then you may find it interesting
