This Nick Tosches book focuses primarily upon, (1) Nick Tosches, and (2) organized crime, rather than upon Sonny Liston. Tosches' writing is overwrought and self-indulgent; the history he provides is thin and unrevealing; and the portrait he draws of Liston - a truly fascinating, troubled, and battered figure - is cartoonish. Tosches skips over the two Liston-Clay (Ali) fights in a couple pages, despite their importance to the Liston career and the national mood at the time.  He instead embraces Chuck Wepner, who may be a nice guy but lacks any significance in the fight-game.  In sum, the Tosches misses the story almost entirely, and his narcissistic writing style ends up wasting the reader's time
