This whole series of books is so misleading!! There is nothing "fringe science" or remotely dangerous or interesting in most of these "evil genius" books. NOTHING EVIL and NOTHING CLOSE TO GENIUS. This book is so cluttered, disoragnized and juvenile that i felt like going to petting zoo and standing in the fence and talk to furry beasts instead of read book. There should have only ever been ONE book titled "Evil Genius" and that award goes to Robert Iannini. But, even then, I can't see Iannini coming up with that lame idea for a title. What dullard at the publishing house would try to pass off other books under the guise of Iannis hard work and true genius. Dave Cutcher is anything but genius - boring and confused is more like it. All you authors out there should be warned to stick to your guns and give your books their own titles and personalities - don't get bullied by the burocrats with the boring covers
