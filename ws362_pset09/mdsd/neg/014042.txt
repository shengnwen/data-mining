I listened to a CD from the library.  Then bought the book, simply to get the one-time use ID code required to take the test.   For about 20 bucks, you get a quick guesstimate of your strengths.    I'm a bit disappointed, at the lack of direction, e.g. 
Deliberative
Ideation
Learner
Analytical
Intellection...With only a small paragraph describing each strength.

If you are serious, I would suggest spending serious money.  For example, about 4 years ago, I paid $2500 for a psychologist to administer a full battery of IQ tests to my son (6 year-old taking 6 or 7 hours of tests)  For $2500 I received a 30 page detailed report on how to best teach my gifted son.  If you are looking for TRUE INSIGHT as to career change, I would think that you would be better off investing some real money.  Twenty bucks only gets you thinking about a journey, but provides little in the way of a road map.  If it happens to help you, great. To me, the book is more an appetizer than a full meal.  The website informs you that you can have additional guidance for about $2000.  If you have that kind of coin, I would advise you skip the book and have testing administered by a psychologist in your neighborhood, so that you get advice tailored specifically to YOU.
