Great Expectations was perhaps one of the worst book ever written. I'm no Dickens' expert, but I do know a little about literature- I don't know how this even passed through the editing stage. It is slow-paced, boring, pointless, and an all-out waste of time to read. I have read challenging books with strong points like this before, and have sometimes enjoyed them,  but never have I read a book this pointless and difficult to read, with such a stupid ending.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND VALUABLE TIME ON IT!!!!!!
