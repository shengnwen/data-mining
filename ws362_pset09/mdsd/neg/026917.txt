I enjoy watching Andey Rooney on television, his thoughts are always insightful and funny.  Much to my dismay, "Common Nonsense" is neither.  It is truly a waist of time to read a bitter old man's opions on anything and everything that has to do with modern life.  This is the first book by Andy Rooney that I have read and it has truly ruined my opinion of him, I almost feel sorry for the guy!  How can a man live through a war and return home only to become a well known, if not famous figure in the U.S. media and still complain about EVERYTHING!  Don't buy this book unless you enjoy being disapointed.
