Based on others' reviews, my expectation was that this book would fan the flame of my desire for Jesus. Turns out it's not terribly biblical. It borrows a few isolated ideas from Jesus's teachings, but it doesn't promote the gospel. It purports to discuss a life-changing, amazing philosophy, but the philosophy pales in comparison to the truth. Sure, it's nice and all to philanthropize without getting recognition for it, but that's _not_ what fulfills you in the long run. _MO_ discusses this concept of the Major Personality (who is supposed to be God), but doesn't acknowledge it as God, and doesn't recognize that Jesus is God in the flesh. Even the reverend who plays a part in Bobby Merrick's life toward the end of the novel fails to acknowledge the truth of the Bible. The story line is mildly interesting, but for me, that didn't redeem the whole reading of the book
