I am a disappointed in Ken Wilber for writing the Forward to a lay Catholic "mystic's" use or rather abuse of the integral path of Christianity.  He praises Marion for his claim that this book is `the first book to clearly describe the entire Christian spiritual path", meaning that Marion "includes the basic stages of spiritual development described so beautifully by the great saints and sages, plus the psychological stages of development only recently discovered by modern developmental psychologists."  

It is clear from the book that although Marion studied seven years at a Catholic seminary, his theology and hermeneutics are on the level of a 13-year old gay alter boy who might be enlightened.  A warning to potential readers: if you are a non-Catholic do not even contemplate buying this book.  Marion is so full of Catholic indoctrination that he cannot divorce himself from it or be objective about it.  He still worships the "Virgin Mary" and is on a Catholic guilt trip, even though he tries very hard to convince the reader that the true mystic is sinless.

"It has always been the (Catholic) Church's tradition that the contents of all the books of the New Testament, including the letters of Peter and Paul, are the `revealed word of God.'  This means that they were either written by persons with the Christ Consciousness or that they were channeled from the Christ Consciousness of the Spirit."  (Pg 245.)  This total disregard for rationality and Wilber's careful explanation of holarchy is astounding.  Modern Protestant theologians like Sally McFague and Dorothee Soelle see the Bible at most as a Constitution for Christians, but never the "revealed word of God."  

If you are a serious Christian who wants to travel on the Spiritual path to the mystical, buy and study Dorothee Soelle's "The Silent Cry - Mysticism and Resistance".
