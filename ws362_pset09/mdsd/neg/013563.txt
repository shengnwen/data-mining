I have laughed and shed tears over all of the authors books. Im am completely dumbfounded as to what he was thinking when he wrote At First Sight.  Like me, you probably loved all the characters in his previous books.  He makes every character in this book NOT loveable! I kept asking myself, who am I rooting for?  Do I care if things go well?  The best part were the medical issues but only a few pages in the book - could have been a story in itself.  I miss the old spark.
