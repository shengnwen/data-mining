I read the reviews and believed them.  When I read the book to my 2 1/2 year old, I felt weird.  First of all, the mother has a habit of 'crawling' across the bedroom floor to get to her son in the middle of the night while he's sleeping--as a baby that's fine, but when he's a grown man?  And, to be rocking a grown man in his sleep???  And then, the son, now a grown man, rocks his aged mother in his arms as well.  I can't do justice to how creepy I found the book.  After reading it, my son pleaded with me not to read it anymore and said he found the mother in the book "SCARY!"  So, I'm returning my book and the extra copy I had gotten, thinking I would keep it and give it as a gift
