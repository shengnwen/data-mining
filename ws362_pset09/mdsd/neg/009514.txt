Don't buy this book. Save your effort and money.This book won't help you to become a better writer. I bought the book because I was influenced by 5-stars reviews on this board, and, for my pity, I completely ignored opinions of those who was disappointed with this book ( Sorry!)Those who rate the book  5-stars, it seems to me that  them just didn't read really great books on writing: John Gardner " Becoming a Novelist" and " Art of Fiction"; "The elements of style" of Shrunk & White; Thomas S. Kane "Essential guide to writing".
