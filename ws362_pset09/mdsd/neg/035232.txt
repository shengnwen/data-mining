I am an AVID reader, pretty intelligent and read at least 1-2 books a week (more when on vacation).  I have read books about all kinds of people in all cultures...and this book turned into a quest...a quest to FINISH it!!!  I never stop reading a book once I start it, but I was about ready to shoot myself in order to end my distress.  If you want to read a REALLY, REALLY good book about desperation in the Indian culture, you simply MUST, MUST, MUST read "A Fine Balance"...one of the best books I have ever read.  It's always on my suggested reading list when people ask me for the name of a good book...along with "Life of Pi."  I simply don't understand all the wonderful remarks about this book.  It went on and on and on and on with the same thing happening to this man over and over...with only a change in his location.  It would pick up every now and again, and I would think "now it's going to start to get interesting" but I was only entertained for a page or two before Mr. Biswas returned to his same ol' depressing self, repeating the same mistakes over and over and over and over and over and over...well you get the point.  Boring, boring book.  I would have given it 0 stars but that wasn't an option
