The book itself is OK for beginners or average users. A lot of content in the book is redundant with the online documentation or simply obvious and things like how to launch the registry editor to make a change are  explained OVER and OVER again. Once is enough! Hardly for advanced users.  Some undocumented registry keys are mentioned, but those can be also found  by a quick search on the internet. Screenshots are outdated with  beta-version content and some other documentation is outright wrong because  it got changed in major ways between the time the book has been written and  Windows 2000 got finally released. The book is a typical example of  &quot;take a lot of screenshots and fill the book with lots of redundant  help available elsewhere, put here and there some new and good content and  make it appear a big deal.  Advanced NT folks will be rather disappointed
