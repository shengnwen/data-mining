To create a story of lies based on fact is sad. Writing is more than that. Klimt is an amazing artist. If you are interested in Klimt or art in general, there are plenty of factual souces available. I defiately admire and recomend learning about his true life story to anyone sincerely interested in art. I can't speak for everyone,  but to know about real art and life must be more rewarding than a desprate farce
