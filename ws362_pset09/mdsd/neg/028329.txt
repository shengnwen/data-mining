Whether it's the 'Left Behind' series, (such a charming title), or 'Countdown to Doomsday' or any of the other blood and thunder books, you can count on one thing: God is mad as hell at all of us, (except the 'chosen') and is going to unleash a fury against his archenemy Satan.  The great cosmic battle will be played out at Armeggedon where Satan and God will will duke it out in front of the whole world.  Well, most of the world.  The elect will be taken by rapture into Heaven safely ensconced away from the raging, bloody battle.  

Eventually, most of the world will be tossed into a flaming, eternal pit of torture for an eternity, while the saved get to look down on the agony of the unsaved and stick their tongues out: nyah-nyah! I just wonder if when Hagee sees Christ he will yell JJJJEEEEEEZSZZZZUUUUUUUSSS like he does on television.

And all this mind you, in the name of the Prince of Peace
