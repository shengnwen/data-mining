This book has had an enormous effect on the world. Sadly, the effect has been nothing short of total disaster. Sharansky's naive ideas convinced an American President and his cronies that all they had to do was walk into Iraq, push over the government and they would be greeted with flowers as democracy bloomed around them. Hundreds of billions of dollars later, Iraq is moving toward a disasterous civil war. In the Palestinian Authority, Sharansky's wonderful ideas ended in the election of Hamas. If he had been listened to more, we would have the Islamic Brotherhood ruling Egypt and Terrorists taking power in Saudi Arabia. And in "peaceful" Afghanistan, "democracy" is a narco-state floating on money from opium while America looks the other way.

The book is naive and simple-minded. Democracy is not the natural state of people in the world. It is a difficult thing to create and to get it right can take decades of work by people inside the country. It cannot be imposed by any army or by force.

The hard-headed true believers will not be convinced by any amount of failure. In the face of failure, they redouble their efforts. Good money is poured in after bad. And if democracy fails to produce the proper result, the corrective action is to (as in the Palestine Authority) finanically punish the voters until they make the right choice.

The lesson of this book is that simple-minded ideas lead to disaster in the real world. Those who want to use Sharansky's soviet experiences to justify the book only tell half the story. Sharansky grew up the son of one of the Stalinist elite party bosses. He was given the best of everything in the old Soviet Union and for all his early life was a true believer in communism. He eventually turned against the system, but as with this book he followed bad ideas long after he should have known better
