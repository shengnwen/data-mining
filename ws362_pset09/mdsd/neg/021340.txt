The author examines Genesis from a strict fundamentalist/literalist/&quot;scientific creationism&quot; point of view. Typical quotes from the book are: &quot;The other books of the Pentateuch,  Moses wrote out of his experience, but not Genesis. Genesis he learned at  his mother's knee.&quot; &quot;The basic command for all living things is  that each reproduce 'after its kind'... It is the rock upon which the whole  theory of evolution perishes.&quot; &quot;One great factor in precipitating  the Flood was the intercourse between 'the sons of God' and the daughters  of men that resulted in a demon progeny of extraordinary influence.&quot;  &quot;Noah was fruitful... Three sons. That does not look like very much  fruit, but from those three sons every man, woman, and child on the planet  has descended.&quot; The book's principal weakness is that the author  continually draws conclusions from scripture that the text does not  substantiate. For example, about Joseph's brother Gad, a man of whom the  Bible tells us only his name, Phillips writes as follows: &quot;There was  something about Gad that savored of the gang. He was the bully type, the  kind who would pick a fight when it was safe, when numbers were on his  side... Gad, the coward.&quot
