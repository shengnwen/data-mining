This book claims to present a paradigm for implementing games that learn.  In reality it's a book about a very specific implementation of a very  specific game. The &quot;paradigm&quot; is limited to a few very general  observations that you could have made yourself. 95% or so of this book is  code, and this reviewer was less than impressed with the quality. Clearly,  the code in this book was developed as a hobby project by a couple of  non-professionals who decided to make it into a book. They also decided to  ignore the vast body of existing work on artificial intelligence and make  simplistic claims based on their own experience about what is and isn't  feasible in a computer program. You should be able to find better books on  this subject than this one
