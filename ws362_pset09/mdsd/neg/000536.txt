I was very disappointed that this cookbook is basically the same dozen recipes with some minor changes in added ingredients.  I was hoping for some new ideas on using eggs, and got same old.  If you have never cooked with eggs at all it might be useful, but every basic cookbook has omelets, quiche, egg salad, custard, etc. and anyone with imagination can come up with their own flavoring and add in ideas. I bought it along with the &quot;Totally Eggs Cookbook&quot;for 1/4 the price and with less than 100 pages, and got more new ideas from the latter
