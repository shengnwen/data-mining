I bought this book after researching books on Iran.  I felt, as many Americans, that I was not educated enough about Iran.  I wanted to find something that was well written and had good reviews.  This fit the bill.
I have to say that Pollock is quite knowledgable on the subject.
While this book may be excellent for masters of world politics.  I feel it important to inform those novices out there about my experience.  Maybe I am a single case, but I found the book very difficult to follow.  The author makes a lot of assumptions about the reader's existing knowledge.  Granted, the topic is quite complex and deserves its own graduate level course or more.  It appears many books can be read on the subject, and even then, one might not get a full understanding of the complexities in this "puzzle."
Regardless, I was hoping to be led through the landscape a little more easily. Perhaps it is my unfamiliarity with political writing or Pollock's writing style, but I would not recommend this book for a novice - someone looking to get their feet wet on the real story.
Again, I'm sure it is great for a recent history or political science buff
