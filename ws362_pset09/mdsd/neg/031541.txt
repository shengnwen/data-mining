I enjoyed reading the book until about halfway through - there are a few instances of animal abuse (particularly about horses) that really bothered me, so I won't finish the rest of it because I don't know what other upsetting things might be contained in the book.  Was the author trying to illustrate the rough, tough life of the Canadian wilderness?  If so, I know I won't do any sightseeing there! If you love animals alot like I do, find something else to read
