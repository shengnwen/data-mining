What a complete waste of time. Lindsey was really reaching here for plot. The first two books of this series were actually quite good. I would give Man of My Dreams a 5 Star and the other Sherring Cross after that a 4 star, but this? Ick, terrible. Deep down I wanted to see a love story between Melissa and Justin (the son of Megan and Ambrose). The plot was silly, a regurgitation of crazy uncles protecing a lovable niece, if you know LIndsey's Malory series you know what I mean. Really very stupid...I want my three hours and $3.50 back (glad I got this one from Half Price Books at least). Barf
