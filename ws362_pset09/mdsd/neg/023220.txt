In the preface, the hyperbolic Tom DeSanto wildly trumpets "Red Son" as a devastating critique of American foreign policy, not the cookie-cutter "feel-good propaganda" that might have been expected. Instead, he hints darkly at surrendering freedom in favor of security.
Oh please. The Soviet Union that Superman serves here is the sort of cookie-cutter comic book autocracy one might have expected in a 1950s comic and bears no resemblance to the murderous regime that truly was an "evil empire." At one point, Stalin understands why Superman must rush off to save thousands in Vladivostok. This is the dictator who killed, yes slaughtered, tens of millions of his own people. 
It's this sort of superficial investigation that dooms "Red Son" to superficial stabs at political comment, and third-rate reimaginings of history that are, frankly, tiresome. 
Though the story is redeemed in the end by a circular ending which seems to say we are always doomed to repeat the same mistakes, this "devastating critique" is not really all that original, exciting, or particularly entertaining. Nor does it comment on anything except the overexcited imaginations of a bunch of leftists who obviously learned their politics from comic books. Grow up, guys
