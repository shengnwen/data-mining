This dictionary was required material for my first Arabic course.  However, I often found natives saying "we never use this" when I would ask them about translations found in the dictionary.  Very rarely, if ever, are the translations within it correct.

As such, it has found its place in my home as a home-made picture frame.  If you need an English-Arabic dictionary, you can't go wrong with Al-Mawrid.  I'd stay away from the Oxford at all costs.  It is so concise it has left out accuracy altogether
