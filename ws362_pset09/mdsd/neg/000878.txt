We got the atlas for an 11-day trip to Minnesota, and ended up hardly using it at all. 
I've used many road atlases, as I prefer them to folding maps, but this one was more of a nuisance due to its size and unclarity.
I also doubt its up-to-date-ness, as a couple of roads that looked promising in this atlas turned out to be non-existing or dislocated.
To me, the most undesirable trait was the fact that it was quite unfriendly - graphically-speaking.
Some main roads (and even freeways) were represented similarly to smaller roads (color and width), which required really exerting our eyes in order to figure out which is what.
We drove ~2500 miles in Minnesota, and after a couple of attempts, the atlas ended up on the back-seat, and we switched to the AAA map we had with us, luckily.
Disappointing.
