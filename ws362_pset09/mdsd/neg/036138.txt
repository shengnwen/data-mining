Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot
