You almost feel sorry for the author.  Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations.  More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard.  And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment.  It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief.  It also feels entirely formulaic.  It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration.  There's no doubt that Iweala can write.  I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life.  I'd risk buying another book of his
