I was totally ready for this book when I read it back in 1989.  I very much believed in consulting my inner wisdom in most matters and was ready to believe that would work with food as well.  Who wouldn't want to hear that you can eat all your favorite foods-even an entire carrot cake-if you crave it?  Sounded like a dream come true.

But the authors did not consider the bio-chemical grip of sugar addiction.  Sugar is not a nutritive substance, so cravings for it are NEVER a signal of a bodily need.  In my case, and the case of many sugar addicts, we want sugar for the same reason that a smoker wants a cigarette:  X number of hours have passed since the last fix and it is time for another one!  There need be no emotional trigger.  I need my first sugar fix the minute I get up, in the form of a big glob of honey in my tea, when I am barely conscious.  

I spent a long time trying to find emotional reasons for my sugar cravings, only to conclude that sugar, for me, is like a drug and I crave it for the simple reason that my body is used to it.  A better, healthier approach is found in Kathleen DesMaisons "Potatoes Not Prozac."

Neither can I concur with the authors'  unconcern over extra pounds.  Obesity exacts a terrible social, emotional and medical toll, and simply "deciding" to be okay with extra pounds doesn't make the risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer go away. 

These women have taken an excessively feminist approach that emphasizes accepting our bodies as they are, fashion magazines be damned-never mind that obesity is a DISEASE.  It is ugly because disease is ugly, just like varicose veins, a dowager's hump, and eczema are ugly.  

I think that "The Zone," "South Beach," and "Potatoes Not Prozac," are on the right track-lots of low glycemic foods to keep insulin and blood sugar both low, is the key to ending cravings and naturally losing weight.  Food is not just about emotion-there is a big bio-chemical component to consider.
