This supposedly radical tale of adolescence, shallow political conviction, lesbianism and prostitution was a letdown.  Tea's prose reminds me of those girls who will natter incessantly to anyone who will listen about their  self-inflicted degradation with all the gory details but not a point to be  found.  Lacking introspection and only rarely showing flashes of wit, this  one's a simplistic catalog of truly sad events.  It is not helped by its  affected prose style, featuring teen-girly exclamations, run-ons, and  erratic capitalization.  This is beneath Tea, who doesn't seem willing to  write at her obviously high intelligence level.  She does a great  disservice to this material, which could have been incisive literature  rather than the forgettable trash it is
