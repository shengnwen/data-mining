This book was written in 1969 and tells about how it is better to bury a son or daughter than to have him/her loose their chastity.(pg. 63) 
Bishops give this book to teenagers when they have commited a sin without even reading the book themselves, not realizing the contents of this book. 
We hope that this message will help teenagers not believe what is written in this book. God is forgiving and loving and in the Bible it says to repent to him, God, not a "elected" man (bishop) who has no training in counseling or phychology to give advice or give you this book. 
Page 196 states that "it is better to die in defending ones virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle." Remember, all of this is what the author thinks and not what God thinks. There are no quotes in this book from the Bible, only the books of the LDS church. Please do not read this book for it breeds guilt, sorrow, humiliation, and sadness for the rest of your life. Thank you, a previous LDS member. Been there, done that. Still recovering from 1986
