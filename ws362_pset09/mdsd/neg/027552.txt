i wanted to buy "you the users guide" and perhaps i clicked the wrong one but that is what i was searching for and the covers are similar . did not check the confirmation properly because did not realise author had two books with the the " you " in bold type . the book  is useless to me but is probably my fault " buyer beware " thankyou
