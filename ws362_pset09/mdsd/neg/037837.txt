If you have had little or no exposure to North American culture or media, this book would provide you with all of the fundamentals of the upper class.  Beyond that, Lisa Johnson's advice seems largely based upon common sense or on how to not be lower class.  Very little useful specific information is given.  I also disliked the author's approach to meeting people.  In the unlikely event that one does see a millionaire in the 7-11, it's just not the sort of place that one socializes and properly meets people.  Yet that's just the sort of thing that is suggested by the author.  The general lack of propriety in her methods is what makes this book poor instruction unless you really need the basics.  Try Ginie Polo Sayles's book for something a bit more useful
