I was informed that this particular text book was in new condition and that it came with the scantron test form sheet. Not only did it NOT have the scantron test form sheet I needed but it had writing and highlighted parts inside the book. (answers for quizzes not sure if correct)After several e-mails to the seller I sent it back for a refund. (She said she could only send half)I am still waiting for my money. I had to buy a new book at the college bookstore
