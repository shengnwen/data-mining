This book is full of propaganda and misinformation.  The general concensus of the larger scientific community is all but ignored by the various authors on virtually every subject.  The one example I will site is in the essay Fishing for Solutions:The State of the World's Fisheries.  Although the book has a copyright of 2000, and the author sites some data as recently as 1998, he chooses to paint a rosy picture of the fishing harvest by limiting his data to data available up to 1996.  He fails to mention that it was at this point that the fishing harvest hit its peak and that it has been in decline ever since.  Being a biology teacher, I have spent considerable amounts of time researching the literature on various environmental problems including population growth, global warming, loss of diversity and the state of our fisheries.  In every case, the authors of this book are at odds with what I have found to be the general concensus of the larger scientific community.  I find it troublesome that the publishers of this book apparently did no research of their own to determine the validity of the views expressed within the pages of this book.  Such misinformation is dangerous and unconstructive and presents a real risk to our environment and the economic health of our country in decades to come
