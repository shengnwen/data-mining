After hearing so much about this book, I was expecting something really informative but what I got instead was a book talking about America's federal debt for 300 pp.--BORING and NOTHING NEW.  As a financial professional, I can tell you that America has had debt for decades with no major consequences, and debt alone won't cause a problem for America.  There are so many other issues that are more problematic such as free trade and its devastating consequences, America's healthcare crisis, the real estate bubble, the pension problems, the global oil shortage, the elimination of the middle class, and the control of America and Washington by corporate America---issues that this book does not address.   After researching the authors, I now know why their coverage was so limited.   They are not financial experts, nor have they even worked on Wall Street.  

In contrast, the book---America's Financial Apocalypse: How to Profit from the Next Great Depression---does address these issues in detail and makes Empire of Debt look like a comic book in comparison.   The debt chapter alone is better than the entire Empire of Debt book.  As well, the author does a spectacular job showing how the government and Wall Street twist statistics.  There are too many topics to mention but if you are looking for a book discussing ALL of America's challenges with hundreds of tables and figures to back up everything, look no further.  America's Financial Apocalypse is the book to read and was obviously written by one of America's foremost financial experts.  The price is well worth it.
