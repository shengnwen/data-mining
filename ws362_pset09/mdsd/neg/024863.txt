Does anyone besides Seabury Blair's friends like this book?  Marlene Kocur liked it but she has also drew the maps for the book.  Another reader gave it 5 stars but also happens to live on the Olympic Peninsula.  Probably another of Mr. Blair's friends.  If you give this horrendous book a positive review please be completely honest about whether or not the author happens to be a friend of yours.  Blair has written a pamphlet for beginning cross-country skiers and then stretched it into a book by printing the same route descriptions over and over again.  Then he slapped a cover on it to try and sell it to backcountry skiers and snowboarders.  A quick perusal at the bookstand would make this obvious but on the web we don't have that luxury
