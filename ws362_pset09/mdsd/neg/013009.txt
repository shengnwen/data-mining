Oh, what a bitter little man is Marcus Gray.  I don't know how anyone can excuse this hate festival of a "book."  All that Gray does is make personal attacks (mostly on Joe Strummer), and claims that his purpose is to take apart the myth of the Clash.  No.  He clearly has a major bone to pick with them (especially Joe Strummer.)  I gained no new information from this book, nor was I entertained by the "author's" writing style.  The only thing that we know for sure about these four guys is that they made great music, and were human beings, no more or less flawed than any of us.  The only thing that we know for sure about Gray is that no one will write a biography about him, nor, in the spirit of this "author," will anyone, but the handful of people who may consider him a relative or friend, notice when he exits the planet.
