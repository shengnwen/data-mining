But I was wrong. The Puruit sucked the whole way through. I want the hour and a half I spent reading it back.

There could have been a decent story in here about a girl who has already made up her mind going through a season anyway, to please her family and learn about society. Instead we get a wooden hero and a cast of unremarkable secondary characters... oh, and no romance to speak of. Lindsey drops potentially interesting plot points like last year's Old Navy fashions, and then throws in every bad plot twist she knows in the last 100 pages.

Almost nothing happens in The Pursuit. The entire plot is overtaken by the kudzu-like MacFearson brothers. They're like a circus act. 

The Pursuit is a sad excuse for a romance novel. I'd give it negative stars if I could.
