I was a little disappointed in the book as it did not meet our needs.  I was most interested in "inside" info for Olympic National Park such as cool areas off the beaten track and insight into specific campgrounds.  However, this book provided nothing beyond what you can easily find on the internet such as number of campsites, bathrooms, etc.

The one time we tried to use the book to find a place to eat (in Forks), we were told that the restaurant that book highly suggested had closed down 2 years ago.

Those who are going to the Peninsula to visit the towns (not the Park) might find this book a good and useful buy, but certainly did not meet our expectations
