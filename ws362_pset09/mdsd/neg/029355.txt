As a student of cultural studies who is interested in limning the taxonomic and theoretical relations among the "queer," the "Asian," and the "American," I must say that I found this book rather disappointing.  Eng seems to have an unerring eye for the trivial, the irrelevant, and the beside-the-point.  He also seems to be unfamiliar with current scholarship that highlights the errors underlying the view of the performative subject as a figure whose agency can, in any proper sense, be seen as "entailed" by virtue of its positionality vis-a-vis the rights-bearing subject.  Eng would also have benefited from consulting recent legal scholarship on the "intersectionality" of the queer Asian male (or female), as well as the "co-synthesis" produced by juxtaposing various marginalized identities
