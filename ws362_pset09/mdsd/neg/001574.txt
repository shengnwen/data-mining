In this book, Byron York only promises to present the evidence of a vast Left-Wing conspiracy - and that is all he presents.  The discussion here is limited to what left-leaning money has done. Primarily, this amounts to a muckraking castigation of George Soros for pointing out the fascistic tendencies inherent in Bush Administration policies and a denigration of Soros' concerns that the US is now, currently, moving in the same direction as NAZI Germany in the period between the World Wars.

There is no discussion here of any sort of moneyed conspiracy on the other side of the aisle:  no reference to the vast amounts of AmWay (DeVoss family) money available to smear Democrats and moderate Republicans; no reference to the vast amounts of  WalMart (Walton family) or Timkin (Timkin family) money available to do away with a justified and justifiable estate transference tax; and absolutely no reference to the extremely close, and extremely profitable, relationships between George Bush and Ken Lay (Enron) or between George Bush and Jack Abramoff (Republican corruption and treason)
