James Agee's A Death in The Family is a challenging prospect for a 300-page text. It is a book that has received the most valuable award that one can bestowed upon an American writer: The Pulitzer Prize. While the depths of Agee's written skills are not in question, the flow and the nature of the text left much to be desired. While I was enraptured at time with the depth of the visual imagery and sheer emotion carried throughout the text, I thought that the general flow of the novel was a bit too fractured and laconic. Also, at least for me, the emotions of the children were not clear enough. As well, while the prose was marvelous, it was a pure chore to finish reading this book. The only part that I found engaging was the actual death in the family. They took a strong moment and made a comment about race? This narrative move did not make sense to me, and it helped to ruin the pace that it so slowly had gained from the pages upon pages of ink that were spilled about the breakfast and Jay making and not making the pancake along with generally bickering (in a playful way, of course) with his wife. While some may consider this a classic, I consider it an exercise in style over substance
