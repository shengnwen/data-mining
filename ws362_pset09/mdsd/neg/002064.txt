This slim volume, part of Penguin's "Great Ideas" series, contains three essays from the famed Roman statesman-philosopher: "On the Shortness of Life," "The Consolation of Helvetia," and "On Tranquility of Mind."

Each of these essays is a small masterpiece of thought and prose, but they can also be found, along with many other stellar pieces, in "Stoic Philosophy of Seneca: Essays and Letters" (edited by Moses Hadas) for a comparable price.

In short, this book is useful as an introductory gift to someone amiable to learning about Stoic philosophy, as is Epictetus's "Enchiridion."  Still, the continued publication of the Hadas volume makes it something less than a wise purchase.
