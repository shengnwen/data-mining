The Special Prisoner has a promising premise: retired Methodist Bishop confronts Japanese soldier who brutalized him in a prison camp 50 years before. What happens next ? A lot, but it's so shallow and simplistic that by the end, which comes mercifully soon, I cared not a bit. This work is not worthy of Jim Lehrer, and I would not recommend it to anyone
