This book is so bitter.  It repremands a learning improvisor on the very thing they should be trying, experimentation.  It trys to enforce it's view of an artform that is often open to interpretation.  I used to love this book until I realized it's just another name dropping text trying to masqerade as an authority on improv.  I recommend trying Mick Napier's Improvise or Keith Johnstone's Impro instead.  They realize that there is very little room for the term 'don't' in improvosation.  Truth in Comedy is just another example of the politic laden ImprovOlympic machine that makes Charna Halpern money and doesn't pass on any of the profit to the performers working for her.  To buy this book is to contribute to a corrupt system.  Don't get suckered in like myself and many others
