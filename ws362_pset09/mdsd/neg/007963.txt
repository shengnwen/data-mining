i was looking forward to updating my bible studies but i was totally disappointed in this book..it wasnt the content but the printing is way tooooo light..a 60yr old eyes cant pickup the words or numbers the print way too light and the words and numbers printed too close together it looks like they were trying to save on paper by condensing it all. this book is half the thickness of my other strongs soo "i do not recommend this book"
