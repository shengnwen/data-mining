I have read all of this author's books that are out in paperback, and have been giving him the benefit of the doubt up to now in regard to him getting his facts wrong on each item that I might happen to have any personal knowledge about. He seems to always get his facts wrong when talking of airplanes. In the River of Ruin he has the pilot flying a helicopter from the left side seat. In others he has 737s making transocean flights, and people falling 10 feet to the ground from a 757 or 767 on the ground(its more like 20 or more feet). A helicopter flight from one city in Peru to another is something like four hours to him, when in actuality its about an hour and a half TRAIN ride. In River of Ruin he has one player in a Henderson microprene one half millimeter body suit. Henderson is merely a brand name with no significance. He means a NEOPRENE WET suit. In every area the author writes about with which I'm familar, he doesn't get his facts right, so, such all of his errors are very easily researched, I can only assume he simply is too lasy and doesn't want to bother to get his facts correct. I assume this holds true concerning the guns, etc. also. I like to think that although I may be reading a work of fiction regarding the story line, the basic items in it are true, or at least we're told by the author that he made them up. Not so here.He needs to do his research if he's going to be a real writer
