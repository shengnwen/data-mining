If you want a quick intro to Adam Smith, read the chapter on him in Heilbroner's "Wordly Philosophers," or read "How the Scots Invented the Modern World" to understand the context of his contribution.  There are also several larger competent discussions of Smith's books.  This book is a waste of time.  It has the usual Smith quotes and some unfamiliar ones too, and the discussion is sometimes helpful, but O'Rourke's attempts at humor range from cutesy to irrelevant to obnoxious.  Smith has aged well, O'Rourke has not.  At several points O'Rourke simply dismisses important elements of mainstream economic theory as confusing.  I thought a short book about Smith with his juicy quotes and some intelligent discussion of contemporary issues that prove his points couldn't possibly miss, but this one missed big time.  O'Rourke himself admits he's a sad imitation of Mencken.  If you want funny, read Mencken.  I hardly ever take books back for refund, but I'm asking for a refund on this one
