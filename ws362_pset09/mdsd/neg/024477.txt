I read and studied this book," Official (ISC)2 Guide to the CISSP Exam", for my one study aid in quick preparation for the CISSP exam. I found the book's coverage of topics and the common body of knowledge to be fine; indeed the book is tuned to the CISSP exam's intended scope rather well. The problem with this book is quality control and the details. Just to get it out of the way, what annoyed me the most is that many of the sample "exam questions" are flawed lacking quality control. Not flawed like the CISSP exam questions themselves are known to be, but simply poorly written. The answer section for the sample questions has many flaws and mistakes: such as mixing up answers for other chapters' questions, unfinished text, etc. A frustrating way to end each chapter.

The main body of the book suffers from major reuse of subject matter, and at times contradictions on subjects. A whole-book editorial review is needed to tighten the thing up -- it suffers from a high-level sloppiness that makes reading and studying more tiring than necessary. Lastly, in some subject areas the book is inaccurate and/or out of date. As it stands, do not use this book as a security-subject expert-reference. Too many little mistakes of omission and half-correct contexts, and at times too little detail to give a subject "enough" coverage to put the important issues in the right light
