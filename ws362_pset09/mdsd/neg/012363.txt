This book was disappointing.  Although the art history and forgery in today's world are interesting and well written, the book lacks romance, and the characters are rather flat.  It could have been so much better if Mr. Pears had expanded the romantic relationship of Johnathan and Flavia.  The writing style seems dry and bland.
