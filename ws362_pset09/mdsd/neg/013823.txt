This book has generated so much hype, and yet I fail to see how a Christian cannot be other than offended at the way Tenney treats the Bible. I picked this up to read, as it was recommended to me by a number of people, and I put it down again after the first chapter. He talks about the Bible as God's 'old love letters to the church' and defines a God-chaser as someone who is not content 'to camp out on some dusty old truth known to everyone'. I have listened to him preach at a conference and the same derogatory approach to the Bible and its doctrine was evident. So Scripture is not enough? Historic doctrine is inferior to Tenney's direct revelations? The teaching of Scripture is just dusty old truth, not the living word but 'old love letters'? Sorry, but this is nothing but plain mysticism. Tommy Tenney might think he has privileged access to new revelations and experiences of God above and beyond Scripture, but I don't accept it and have no intention of reading a book that so denigrates Scripture. Looks to me like nothing other than a revival of gnosticism
