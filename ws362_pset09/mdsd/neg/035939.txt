i'm not sure that all the information provided in this book is truth. i will say that i believe some is inaccurate, and limited. hopefully you have better luck with it. i have noticed a rising popularity in shamanism and i hope there are better books out there than this one, regarding said subject. check out anything by thomas cleary for a great read. also i recommend tao te ching, the urantia book, and melchizidek truth principles.
