I quit reading the book after about ten pages.  I didn't understand most of what I read.  Sentence structure too strange for me.  I don't claim to be really smart, but I do have a college degree and I can read Ameican english.  This is my first posted review.  I usually don't comment.  But, this book was a waste of my money.
