Samples taken from WTC steel now confirm (soon to be released by Professor Steven Jones of BYU and five other universities) Thermate was used in the WTC Towers to take them down. This meshes with the global collapse times of both Towers (and 7 WTC) and the eyewitness reports that day from firefighters, police, tenants and workers who said bombs were in the Towers. Not only do we have dispicable people in government who, of course, knew this all along, but the U.S. media knew it too. Soon both will be out of employment
