Why would you like this book? If you already knew a ton about history and were looking for new comparative methods of evaluating the modern world. There's certainly an interesting argument set forth by Bayly, but I remain unconvinced that his methods of documentation (reliance on secondary sources and a self-avowed lack of references) and his choice of material (severe neglect of certain portions of the world) should permit this book to be the academic blockbuster it has been claimed.

Why would you hate this book? If you were anyone else, especially a layperson, trying to get a good sense of why things are the way they are today. It's dense, scattered persepctive will ultimately leave you more confused than enlightened.
