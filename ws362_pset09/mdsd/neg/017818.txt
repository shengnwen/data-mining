"The Sound and The Fury" is reported as one of William Faulkner's early successes.  From this performance I have trouble understanding why.  The book alternates between dialogue and descriptive narration.  I had trouble following the story.  It sounded like a series of barely related scenes.

I did listen to a recording of this book.  I do have more trouble following recordings of fiction than I do with history.  It may be that I would do better reading this book than listening to it.  There was nothing technically wrong with the recording, I am just hopeful that a written version would be more understandable.  I would recommend giving a written version at try
