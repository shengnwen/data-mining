Banks can be forgiven for making his heroine unbelievable.  Unfortunately, she is also unsympathetic and uninteresting.  That's quite an achievement; after all, Hannah Musgrave is a terrorist, lesbian chimp-keeper who runs a farm, helps spring a Liberian dictator from prison, and raises three guerilla rebels.

Banks does a much better job with the real-life terrorist John Brown.  Skip 'The Darling' and read 'Cloudsplitter' instead
