I liked the first book in this series, really enjoyed the second book, but I had a really hard time getting through "Voyager".  There were way too many mini-stories in this novel, way too many characters, and a lot of the story didn't sit well with me at all.  I enjoyed the beginning (that's where the 2 stars come from), which was set in the 1960s, but the book dragged on and on and on.  I thought I would never get through it.  I'm afraid that this one may have convinced me not to continue through the series
