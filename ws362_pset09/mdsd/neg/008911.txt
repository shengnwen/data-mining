Unlike other reviewers I cannot praise this book.  It has its moments - passages of writing that let us enter the mind of an artist - but most of it I found tedious. Being just about believable the main character is easily the best of a thin an unconvincing bunch. The novel hasn't aged well and the story line is silly and not very interesting. The humour escaped me. I haven't read the other parts of the trilogy and nothing about this book encourages me do so
