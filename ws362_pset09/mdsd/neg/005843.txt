I purchased this based on the numerous reviews here and glowing recommendations elsewhere online, but it has turned out to be the poorest choice and truly the most useless book on drawing I've ever read.  I wish I hadn't ignored the fact that others commented about nearly everything except actual drawing instruction.  I wish my mind had registered the key words analysis and theory in so many others glowing reviews.  If you want to learn to draw, or learn to actually apply lines, mass, tone, balance, proportion, etc. to improve your drawing skills then look elsewhere.  However, if you want to read one author's horribly long winded rambling lectures about how these things influence art, perception, and the psyche then this is the book for you.  This is far more an analysis of drawing as it relates to art than it is a tutorial.  Nearly three hundred pages and you could compress the portions related to applying these ideas to your own drawing down to two dozen pages at most
