"The Well-Ordered Office" is about techniques that can be used to reduce stress in your office.  Author Kathleen Kendall-Tackett gives 50 techniques to get things under control.

I'll be honest... I didn't like this book.  The title suggested to me that this book would be about specific office organization techniques like filing and equipment.  However the author only gives a brief overview and ends up offering no help whatsoever.  A good example is the chapter on good programs for your PDA where she only offers categories of programs and no specific programs whatsoever.  Sure.... list management software could be helpful but only if you have a good program!  Which one is the best!?!?!

The book also contains several "filler" chapter that I have no idea why they are in this book.  Chapters such as "Travel safely and in style" and "Balancing work with the rest of your life" are completely unrelated to the title.  If I want travel advice, I will get a book on traveling.  If I want advice on how to balance my life, I'll get a book that deals with that topic, not a book that spends 2 pages on such a broad topic.

In summary, don't waste you time or money on this book.  It isn't worth it.  While there are 1 or 2 pieces on advice in this book, I would recommend "Getting Things Done" by David Allen instead.  2 out of 5 stars
