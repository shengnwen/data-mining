Perhaps I had been expecting a true sequeal to the original. I was so excited when I saw the book but instead of a taut, touching tale I got a rambling, frequently boring, difficult to follow story that I had to force myself to finish.  It seemed more a tale of politics and religious infighting than a science fiction story.

Problems?  How about WAY too many characters, many with multiple names. I consider myself intelligent and widely read but the rush of people created such a flux that the plot seemed almost secondary.  I liked the hero but for all his potential he did little more than whine, worry and wonder.  His boss, the antipope, became the star of the show along with the swordsman.  

The story did not "flow" and bogged down several times in minor details.  The first section covereding the time in the abbey passed uneventfully but for a few personal crises. Then we journey toward the conclave and are introduced to host of new folks.  Finally we arrive in the city and meet yet another cast of characters.  The story was as much about Native American culture as anything.  The language issues, interesting at first, became tiresome as we switched from various dialects (some almost unpronouncable with special symbols) to Latin (frequently) to English.  All in all, not a success
