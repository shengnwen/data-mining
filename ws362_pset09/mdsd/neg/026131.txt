First, let me say that I learned to read from this book. When I was a kid I knew all the words and I loved it! But then again, I didn't know any better, and frankly, neither did my mom and dad. I was lucky in that the book applied to me: I looked like my mom and dad and therefore the message of the book, that your mother is the one who looks most like you, was seemingly harmless.

Now, however, I have an adopted son and am friends with many other families created through adoption, including lots of families with children of different races. The message of this book is really inappropriate for those families and even though my adopted son happens to be physically similar to me, it's not a message I want him to hear, either. Families don't have to look alike to be family! 

One of the earlier comments mentions A Mother for Choco by Keiko Kaska and I think this is a MUCH BETTER book than Are You My Mother for ANY child, not just a child in an adoptive or transracial family. The message of that book is that your mother is the one who mothers you...not necessarily the one who looks just like you
