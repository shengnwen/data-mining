I must agree with some of the other reviews that have appeared on this book.  I got this book with the intention of learning something more about Toulouse Lautrec.  I really like all aspects of his work and wanted to find something that would be more true to life than the the movie &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot;  Usually in most biographies of artists there is a more than passing interest in the work.  I did not find this aspect in this book.  Instead the author focuses on rather facile Freudian looks at the paintings themselves.  As Freud himself observed, &quot;sometimes a cigar is only a cigar.&quot; Elements of composition are subjected to a desire to demonstrate some sort of unified field theory toward Toulouse Lautrec's art.  I am still looking for a book that illuminate's Toulouse Lautrec's art and life for this clearly is not it
