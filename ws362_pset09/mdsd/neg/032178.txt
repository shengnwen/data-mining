This book is the most extreme that I have ever read about. It advocates eating ONLY alkaline foods, citrus,avocados, bananas, almonds, etc. It eliminates your freedom to ever eat any quantity of acidic foods all red meat, pork, most fruits, and everthing processed. The flaw in this author's theory is the fact that the body is able to moderate its internal PH by excreting extra acid through the urine.Yes, I agree with him that over eating acidic foods all the time will cause your body to retain water and body fat and tax your eliminating organs. I also agree that following his diet plan of drinking greens, 5 liters of water a day and eating only vegatables and small amounts of fish will cause you to loose dramatic amounts of weight, but who can live like that for an extended amount of time? Read The acid-alkaline diet by Christopher Vasey, N.D. for a more realistic and balanced approach. Read Mastering the Zone by Barry Sears for a diet you can live with for the rest of your life. I went from 209 to 151 on the Zone diet and have never gained it back.Read the Superfoods Healthstyle for a truly  realistic healthy lifestlye.
