I've begun reading this book and I was sailing with Thomas Moore real tight.  He was skillfully sailing the ship until I got to his fourth chapter where he got off into a skiff and cut the rope.  He has set me adrift in a wide sea without a moral compass.  

He leads his readers into the occult and astrology. A place where a former Monk should fear to tread. While I don't mind learning about insights of the dark night through greek mythology and other lesser known personalities, I feel Mr. Moore could have served his readers better examples by using concepts and personalities from the Judeo-Christian tradition. 

Mr. Moore holds too highly the concept of self and self fulfullment.  What I understood from Part Two of the book "Disturbances" is don't take responsibility for your choices.  Follow what you feel you must do in order to develop your inner self and talents even it that means to destroy and hurt your relationship with family and friends.

Jesus' idea was in losing one's self that we find out true self. 

I haven't finished the book yet so I guess it's a bit unfair to write a review so soon. However, I thought I would tear through this book because the first 68 pages held so much meaning for me.  I've gotten bogged down in the middle and have picked up another book by James Finley which is an expose of Thomas Merton's thought.  Merton's Palace of Nowhere -A search for God through Awareness for the True Self.  I love this book.

What I am discovering from Merton is that the self we construct is an illusion but we need to find our true self through our search and union with God.  I believe this is the true purpose of the Dark night of the Soul which is to lead us to the realization of our need for grounding in the source of life.

I have two more books by Moore which I plan to read. Care of the Soul and The Re-enchantment of Every Day life.  So stay tune
