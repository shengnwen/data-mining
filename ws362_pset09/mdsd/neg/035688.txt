Let me start by saying this is a review of the Audiobook version, which unfortunately is an abridged version of this book. I was pretty disappointed. I enjoyed "Amazonia" and loved "Black Order" -- both as unabridged audiobooks (I have a long commute!). But this story and, especially, the actor were abysmal. Most audiobook actors make an effort to switch accents, tone of voice from character to character (listen to to "Black Order's" reading for a top-notch example of this). But in this story, all of the characters sound alike and the tempo is hurried. Plus, the abridgement must be amiss (or at least, I hope it's the abridgement, not Rollins' weak story) because things often don't make sense and you are left feeling like you missed too many details. Omaha Dunn is a major character? I wouldn't have known from this version. I feel cheated, like I was rushed through a journey I had been looking forward to.
