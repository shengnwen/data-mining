Well that's about all this book is realy about.  David is Gay....368 pages can be summed up by one take home tidbit.....David is Gay.....oh yeah there was also a not-so-subtle jab that the war for Independence of the State of Israel was similar to the Mai Lai massacres and the Nazi slaughter of entire villages.  This book is a perfect example of slash and burn from other sources.  This isn't a biography....it's a third rate english paper filled with references that are mostly crap......did I mention that....David is Gay....the good news is you don't have to read it...you can fake it...when someone asks did you read King David.....you can quickly reply...."wow...can you believe he was gay?"......I hear Mel Gibson is optioning the rights for "brokeback mount Sinai
