I just received my copy of "A Sense of Place" by Michael Shapiro, billed by the "Dallas Morning News" travel book reviewer as a great book about great travel writer's craft, lives, and inspiration. Most of the Amazon reviews to-date were glowing as well. As a travel enthusiast I quickly purchased and dug into the book and found a blatent hidden agenda. This author is clearly not seeking the great travel writer's adventures as much as he is seeking to underline his opinion that the world hates American policies and our current administration in particular.  Buyer Beware...his book embraces liberalism at its worst. Note two examples: Michael Shapiro on living in San Francisco..."but sometimes I think that we live in these oases of sanity" Then, he asks travel writer Jonathan Raban if he had owned a bumper sticker reading, "Somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot".

Perhaps this travel writer needs a good dose of a year or two of travel in the United States, yes, our "fly over" states.

Does Amazon.com give refunds? I plan to scrutinize your book reviews more carefully in the future for your reviewer's biases.  Don't mislead those of us who truly love to travel and don't want a so-called travel author's pedantic, self-righteous view of American politics.
