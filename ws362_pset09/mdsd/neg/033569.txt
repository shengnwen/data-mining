I hate to say it.  This book provides very basic information that lacks depth and the insider viewpoint I expected.  The limited info that did scratch slightly deeper than the surface centered on the cities of Phoenix and Tucson.  Other cities such as Flagstaff, Sedona and Winslow were barely mentioned.  I found this book of little real value to someone serious about Moving to Arizona
