This book was recommended by our book group but in spite of my best intentions I think I'm going to do the unforgiveable and abandon it.
It's not as if the origins of life on earth don't interest me, I did my degree in Plannt Science.
BUT I have got as far as p130, a fair test I think, and I'm finding it pretentious and tedious. Who has 20 page conversations with a geko?? What is all this nonsense with elves and the joker?? Unfortunately I can't be bothered to find out.
In the words of a fellow book clubber who got to p50, "Life is too short"
