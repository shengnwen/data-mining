I found this book to be almost annoying in the level of arrogance the author exuded in her writing.  She has absolutely no training in psychology apart from the fact that her daughters struggled with eating disorders.  This book did not reveal any new insights or cures.  I find it appalling how little training she has in the arena of eating disorders and yet feels qualified to open a clinic and write a book.  She does not back any of her statements up with scientific data, and the book seems to be trying to sell her clinic more than inform others on how to help those struggling with eating disorders.
