I was initially impressed by the topics to be covered in this book however found that few areas were well discussed.  Whilst myself exploring the differences between modern psychology and Nouthetic counseling, this book failed to completely discuss the areas detailed in its contents.  I was particularly disappopinted with the chapter "The myth of intergration" which had very little to do with intergrating modern psychology with Biblical concepts.  Examples were biased and information appeared to be delievered without the thoroughness that such texts require for today's critical minds.  As this review is titled, I believe the author had good intentions, however with exposure to Jay Adams and the like for his work, this book offers very little useful information.
