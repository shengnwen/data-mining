The idea behind this book is that traits of good crime detectives will also be traits of good investment analysts. 

This is done by giving small samples of some of literature's greatest detectives.  Then you are to apply the traits you see in the markets.  

Mystery lovers will be disappointed.  As you are never given enough information to solve the detective's mysteries.  Nor are you even given the solution as that would spoil your need to read the original.  You instead get choppy pieces that don't really shed much light on anything.

Investors will also be disappointed.  You are told such wisdom as do your own investigations, look at all the clues, keep an open mind, etc.  No one could argue with such logic, however what did you learn from such things that you did not already know?

There are little or no ideas on where to look in the market for opportunity.  There are no strategies discussed that have not been covered in dozens of other books.

It is not that I doubt what the author is saying.  It is that I do not believe much is said that any reader would not already know.  Of course knowing is different than doing, so perhaps someone would read this book and say "Oh yeah, he is right I should not rely on stock analysts" or "Hmmm market psychology would be a good thing to look into"
