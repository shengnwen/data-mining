i got this book because i am struggling as a woman to come to terms with male/female hostilities. and what immediately struck me about this book is that the author is going through a protracted, painful adolescence, and while he may be very intelligent he is emotionally immature. he is basically blaming some all-encompassing concept of "WOMAN" for the pain he is feeling about his struggles with his manhood. and other books such as those by lionel tiger also come across as deeply bitter and full of blame. but i think to place blame on women for your lack of strong identity is misdirected. your father was supposed to teach you the basics of being a man. if he failed to do that, then you will struggle for your identity as a man well into middle age. i think it's too easy to blame your demons on goddesses and witches and gypsy women...and i think these men are absolutely terrified to confront thier fathers, but making the hero's journey into the self and confronting your father is exactly what you need to do. i also think blaming feminism for taking the traditional male role away is a sop. men need to be men, regardless of whether their lady works or not. being a man is much more than providing financially. to have courage, integrity, requires true growth, not whining and blaming. this author reveals his immaturity right off the bat when he tells us he cut ties with his wife of seventeen years and three children, because he was in love with a younger woman, and then when the younger woman threw him over for a man her own age, his world fell down--and he proceeded to use yet another woman for sex to numb his pain. immature, and a little pathetic. the women in his life seem to be crutches for his frail ego. no wonder he had problems
