I was once very active in "antiracist" action. It took me a while to realize antiracist basically means antiwhite, because you only hear one side of the story: Whites are bad and have caused everyone pain.

If you want to make a stand against racism, you should be able to take a stand against ALL racism in ALL its forms. There is racism happening right now in the world between nonwhite groups who are just as bad, if not worse, as anything seen in America.

To the self-hating white guy who said that "white people who live in all white communities live in a bubble". Wouldn't that apply to Latinos who live in barrios and blacks who live in all-black communities? Or does that not meet the standard of Political Correctness?
