Having farmed cotton for over 30 years, I am familiar with the subject of this book. The inaccuracies are numerous, an example being, the caption under the picture of a cottonpicker opposite page 239 stating " Mechanical harvesters span ten to twelve rows at a time."  The largest picker today is only six rows wide. I found the same type of inability to get the facts correct and exaggeration throughout the book. There was also a feeling of a slant, as if, the author already had an opinion on the subject before he started his research on the book and made the research meet the opinion.
It seems the author should continue writing fiction and leave alone historical subjects where accuracy and objectivity are needed. I would skip this one
