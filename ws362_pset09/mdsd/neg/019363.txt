This book gives plenty of background into international finance.  Unfortunately, it has some big flaws, in my opinion.  First, there are not enough calculation examples.  Second, there are too few questions at the end of each chapter.  In addition, you must go to the author's website for the solution.  Once you get there, you will be surprised to find out that the author has only solved maybe two out of eight problems.  That's annoying.  I do not recommend this book.  Take a class from another professor who uses a different text book
