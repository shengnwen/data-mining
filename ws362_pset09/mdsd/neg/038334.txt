This book reminds me of athlete biographies written for kids.  All the characters are presented as totally one-dimensional cliches-- business leaders who refuse to lose, tough-acting butchy women with hearts of gold-- all your favorites are here! You're forced to read page after page of detailed conversations that are clearly fictionalized.  The author bends over backwards in an effort to elevate Bass and Wells to superhero status.  All of this can get very annoying!  The bottom line, as I understand it, is that Bass and Wells did something that they should be very proud of.  By treating their adventure as a world-class mountaineering accomplishment (which it clearly was not) the author actually detracts from the story
