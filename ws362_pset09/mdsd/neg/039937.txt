. .If you could sue writers for false advertising regarding what they write on bookjackets, you'd have a great case against these two! This book rehashes old legends and stories but provides nothing new. In fact, it does not even provide a good synopsis of what allegedly occurred during the &quot;experiment&quot;, providing only bits and pieces along the way. It actually sounds like an addendum to some previous work that assumes you have heard all the cool details, and provides you with a few coincidences that the authors assume support their case. A don't know much about William L. Moore, but I used to read all Charles Berlitz's books when I was a kid, as I thought the Bermuda Triangle made for some great stories. But as I got older, I realized that that's all they were. Charles Berlitz never made any groundbreaking discoveries while &quot;researching&quot; his Bermuda Triangle books, just rehashed old sailor's tales. I recall him during a guest spot on the &quot;Larry King Live&quot; program, and when I Coast Guard officer called in and provided known, verifiable details on some of his &quot;without a trace&quot; cases, Berlitz looked like a monkey. As a former Coast Guard Rescue Pilot myself, stationed for 3 years in Borinquen, Puerto Rico (one of the apexes of the &quot;Triangle&quot;), I can also assure you that it is quite easy for an aircraft or moderately sized vessel to &quot;disappear without a trace&quot;, and that there is nothing mysterious about it. . .it's a big ocean! I witnessed the indistinct horizons and other phenomena, all of which had perfectly good explanations. Save yourself some money and avoid all books that have Charles Berlitz's name associated with them unless you're reading them for &quot;entertainment purposes only&quot;
