I am a education major at Macon State college.  John Dewey's book is simply a summary of three talks Dewey gave to parnets and students at the University of Chicago Laboratory school in 1896.  The book covers topics that are often very diverse and shares conflicting political and  philosophic positions in education. I found this book hard to read and very  wordy.  I did not enjoy the read at all
