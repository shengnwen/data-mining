This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead.  In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written.  If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.

I could not finish We the Living.  I got sick of the stupid relationship.  I guess I got about 1/4th the way through.  Maybe my tastes are changing
