I didn't find this book helpful, and here's why:  My 10 year old daughter tends to over eat and crave unhealthy foods, so I'm working on educating her on nutrition and keeping her active.  I thought this book looked like a good resources, but the problem is that it looks like a young child's book, even though it contains good information in the second half, appropriate to an older child.  So, my 10 year old took one look at it, declared it a 'baby's book' (because the cover and art and first pages look like it's designed for a very young child), and I couldn't get her further in it, because she prides herself on now being able to read 'big kid' (chapter type) books.  The packaging/art approach just don't match the level of the content
