I've read this and it does have alot of truth in it, but also alot of junk, imo. My overall impression was that it's just too lame, too hokey, too much wishful thinking. They have obviously missed the point that it's a harvest of SOULS. For a much better, more serious, and higher calibre work, read the Law of One series. Now THOSE are the real deal
