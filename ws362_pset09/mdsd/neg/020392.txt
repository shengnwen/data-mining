This book was a very interesting way of looking at relationships.  I had a hard time reading the entire book because about half way through, it suggested that I change who I am to be more like the guy I wanted to fall in love with me.  I am just not willing to change myself that much, so I don't think that I was a very good candidate for the book.  I had a difficult time believing that it is morally correct to make someone fall in love with you when you are not acting completely like yourself.  After reading this book you may spend more time focusing on all of its rules then actually getting to know the guy.  I do think that it is an interesting read but try not to hang on its every word
