The best researched work on the subject matter by Greg King and Penny Wilson who not only did exhaustive research in the USA in preparation for writing the book, but also traveled to the sites in Russia where the action took place digging in archives never before viewed by other researchers. Time travel at its best! Unlike most authors Penny Wilson is a researcher who reads, writes and speaks the Russian language.
