This is the worst book of this genre I have ever read. Plus her experiences absolutly are not congruent to what occurs in hauntings. I think this lady was lying big time! She mentions burning sage in her home. Sage must be code for what type of drugs she was using. I laughed out loud when he said she astral projected to pet the ghost of a dead cat through her window, Geez. Pass on this unless you are looking for a good laugh
