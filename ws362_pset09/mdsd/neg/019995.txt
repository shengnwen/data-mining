Not much information here that one doesn't already know.  Cheesy pictures of senarios of what I guy looks like bluffing and not bluffing.  Don't waste your money.  Take that money and go play some no limit poker, buy Harrington's books or Phil Gordon's Little Green book.  If you want the best book on POKER TELLS, hands down Caro's Book of Poker Tells is what you need.

Postscript:  I have to agree with J. Rubino.  I expect to get blasted for only giving it a 2.  In my opinion, I was being generous with a 2.  Notice the people who give 5 stars.  They always seem to give 5s on everything they read.  Its not unusual for the author to come on here and down grade a review by an unbias reader.  They know their book is being sold here. This book is sub-par.  Save your money
