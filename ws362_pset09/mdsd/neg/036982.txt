While I usually enjoy books of this particular genre, Betty J. Eadie's &quot;The Ripple Effect&quot; was disturbing.  She describes the death of her baby daughter from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in heartbreaking terms.  The scene in the book touched me deeply - until I happened to describe it to an expert on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, who said, &quot;What she is describing is physically impossible.&quot;  Who EDITS some of these books anyway?  Who PUBLISHES these books without at least doing enough preliminary checking of the facts to see how plausible the events described within really are
