Although providing nice code examples and clearly explaining the mathemantics of standard computer graphics algorithms, its ~270 (paperback) pages do not cover the scope or detail of the ~1100 (hardcover) pages in "Computer Graphics" by Foley, van Damm, et al., which costs roughly the same amount. John Wiley & Sons needs to be brought to task on the pricing issue, as the high price really shadows the real value (and business opportinity) of the book. My conspiracy theory is that the publisher is aiming to market it as a text book where students can't counter being ripped off by a publisher endorced by a professor or university
