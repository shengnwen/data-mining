The thing that stands out most upon initial reading of the text is the unbelievable amount of typos, which render the book nearly unreadable. You will spend twice as long reading this book than any other, due to the fact that you have to interpret what the author is trying to say, in light of the fact that sentences are often given contrary meaning due to typos. I truly believe that no one but the author read the text prior to publication. The work stands as the most archetypical example I've ever come across of the need for a proofreader. In addition, the author may be a philosopher but he is no writer. Sentence structure and punctuation seem foreign to the writer. The writer seems to love using a colon; but seems not to understand that it cannot be used as a comma substitute. Additionally, his descriptions of philosophic thought are obtuse and wordy. His characterization of Spinoza is all over the place, resulting in an incoherent mess. I genuinely think the text was published due to an academic publishing requirement and no one had actually read the text prior to publication, nor should be forced to do so following such an inauspicious event!  However, the writer scores in his concise accounts of Reform/Conservative history in America (about 10 pages). However, I tend to avoid 300 page works that have only 10 pages worth reading, and even those are filled with typographical errors, usage mistakes, and incorrect punctuation. The text should be used by English professors as a bad example, not philosophy classes and the writer should stick to history
