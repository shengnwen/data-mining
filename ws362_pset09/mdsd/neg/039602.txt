Well, I have yet to buy this book out of principle, even though I am a huge Brooks fan, and own all his paperbacks. My problem with this release is that it was released in a Trade Size Paperback, rather then a Regular Sized Paperback. In fact, I am annoyed that I was not given a choice at lkeast on what size I would want to purchase. If the Publisher wants to get a few extra bucks out of fans by releasing a Trade Size Paperback, at least release the regular Trade Size Book so that the consumer can make the decision on what they want. Plus, for filing purposes, it is a pain to merchandise a trade size Book with all my Terry Brooks Regular Sized Books
