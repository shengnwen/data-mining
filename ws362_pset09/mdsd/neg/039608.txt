Thank goodness my company paid for this book.  In no way is it worth more than $100.  Consideringing that every other page is a notes page, you effectively get a 60-page book.  Exclude the related information (ex: sales questions, presentation tips) and maybe 15 pages of this book actually relate to writing a proposal.  I have read most of the books out there on developing proposals and any of them are better than this one at helping you develop a proposal.  And they cost a tenth as much
