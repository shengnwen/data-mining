The use of Soviet bloc sources, at first glance, nearly persuaded me that Reagan merits hero-worship. But the superficial handling of the 1946 Hollywood strike made me wonder, in general, about omissions. So, I scanned through the index. There is no entry for "Beirut" or "Lebanon" or "marine barracks" or "national debt." The author informs the reader that marines diverted, at sea, from Beirut landed on Grenada on February 23, 1983. He does not inform the reader that, on February 23, 1983, over 200 marines were killed by a truck bomb in Beirut. What a startling coincidence! How can the author fail to mention it? But, of course, then he does not have to report the cut and run from Beirut - nor consider what the terrorists may have learned about the efficacy of asymmetric war comparing the firm response in Grenada to the limp response in Lebanon.

Upon consideration, this book did not push me from the opinion I formed several years ago that Ronald Reagan is the third most overrated President in American history.
