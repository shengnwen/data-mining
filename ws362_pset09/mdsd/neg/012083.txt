I realize that it's subjective, but the images in this book are not "stunning".  Many are a jumble bag of doodles and diddling.  Some are interesting.  Hidden in the "tennis plays" there are some tips on Photoshop image making, but it's difficult to consider looking for them because of the dreariness of the imagery.  This book presents the case for me that it may be best to check these kinds of books out more (e.g, reviewing the pages available at Amazon or actually handling in a bookstore)
