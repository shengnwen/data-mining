I bought this book based on the great reviews from other customers. But, I don't see what they see. I see parents and kids wearing clothes from the  early 80's and information that can't possibly be more basic. There's  nothing wrong with the basics, but there are plenty of books that give the  basics and more in a creative and entertaining way. Well ... at least it  was cheap
