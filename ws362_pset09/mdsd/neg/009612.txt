I am currently a medical student, and Physiology is on our required texts list.  It's an awful read.  Very dry, very dense.  Difficult to keep interested from one scattered clinical tidbit to the next.  PLUS,  there were multiple mistakes in just the few chapters I made myself go through.  Thinking about petitioning for a new text listing for next year's class..
