I have had cats myself for over 15 years, and right now have three very amusing ones at home. That said, this is one of the least funny calendars I have ever seen, and you'll get more entertainment staying at home and letting your cats OD on catnip, believe me. I do have the book, and thought it was cute, although mostly for the pictures rather than the banter. I did expect this to be in B & W because one-a-days rarely come in color, but many of the pictures are not particular funny, regular cat shots (i.e. a head shot of a basic cat), of terrible print quality, and the quotes are awful. Very stale and lacking any sort of wit. The people saying this is hilarious are probably the types that think that "Blue Collar TV" and fart jokes are the epitome of high humor. So if you like basic, straight-forward comedy, by all means, get this calendar. I like more substance to my humor, and if you do too, pass on this.  Even "Cathy" cartoons are funnier than this. *Gasp
