I thank God for Doug Shields. He seems to be a good man with a big heart for God. However, I would like to honestly and meekly give some positive criticism to his book. 

It seems that Doug has put an inflexible blueprint on youth ministry, a cookie cutter so to speak. He's showed us a plan which works for him, even supporting his claims with scripture. But do we really want to reproduce a church after the letter, or after the Spirit?
 
Doug writes from the perspective of one-man guidance with a leadership team, and teaches us to scrutinise and organise. However, so much human interference can certainly leave no room for the Lord to build His church. Its unfortunate that we, as Christ's body, have come so far from doing ministry the way He would want it. It may be a good idea that we hit our faces and ask that God reveal to us His purposes, for His purposes will certainly bring heavenly results. 

Not all the content in the book is bad, however. For a period of time we implemented many of his suggestions in our youth ministry here in Switzerland. Another plus is that it is easy reading. My objection is simply this: we cannot replace following God's Spirit in the ministry with a manual, irrespective of how successful the writer is. (This might take a long time for all of us to learn.)

Please don't take this as an indication not to buy this book. Make up your own mind. I only say: proceed with caution!
