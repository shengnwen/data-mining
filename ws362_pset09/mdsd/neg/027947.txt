I suppose this is a good book for someone who is just learning how to play poker.  I didn't have much faith in the book when I purchased it.  It's cheaper than alot of poker books, so I figured Hellmuth would at least share a couple of good nuggets of information.  If you have never played poker and want to learn the rules of the game, and starting hand strengths, you will benefit from this book.  If you're a thinking player looking for insights from others, look somewhere else
