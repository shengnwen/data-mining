As a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan, I looked forward to reading this series after seeing all the glowing reviews. I quickly realized after reading just a short way into the first book that the author had a deep issue with religion. The only other impression I had was boring, boring, boring. I kept waiting for the wonderful story to arrive. I resolutely started the second book, hoping I was wrong in my initial reaction and the author didn't truly hate religion and God. Well, guess what? He does. Not only does he blast the church and present members of the clergy as murderous villains, he introduces homosexual angels and informs the reader there is no God, just one angel who took control. Feeling like I had to finish the series in case the author changed the point of view, I struggled on. The third book jumps all over the place and I was left feeling dirty from having read this garbage. It went straight to the trash, something that I never do to books. However, as a Christian parent I am appalled that these books are being touted as excellent children's books
