Someone should ask the author how much more successful the UN would be in it's role if the US and Israel weren't always vetoing it's resolutions to act. If the single most powerful nation on earth and it's little buddy completely ignore the UN, veto it's every attempt to act, and directly undermine it's authority in the world for 50 years, who's fault is it that the UN is unsuccessful?
I firmly believe the US has a moral and ethical obligation to lead the world, and I firmly believe we can do it morally and ethically. However, writing history in such a way that the sins of the US and Israel aren't there won't make that happen. We need to know what once was in order to know what now is, and we need to know what now is in order to lead a better world
