A previous reviewer wrote: "depending upon where a person is in their process, I believe that Forward's approach could actually do damage."  I want to confirm that his/her suspicions were correct.  Although the responsibility for my actions are my own, I feel that my decision to follow the advice in this book nearly destroyed my life.  To this day - almost 20 years later - I am still living with the disastrous consequences, for which I was not at all prepared.

There is, even to this day, a vacuum when it comes to the understanding and treatment of severe childhood psychological and physical abuse. At the time this book was printed it represented practically the only "consumer" information on this subject. 

At the time I read it (shortly after it was printed I believe) I was very young and dealing with extremely serious abuse issues.  Unfortunately, I followed the misguided advice it contained about confronting my abusers - something which I never should have done.  The results were disastrous.  I then made my second mistake in reaction (also following advice in this book) - cutting off all ties with my family.

I still believe that I needed to eventually cut off ties with my abusers.  However, the advise in this book gave me the false impression that I could take on more than was safe or advisable.  It minimized and/or omitted the possible consequences.  The confrontation escalated the situation and put me in actual danger; it provided no healing or closure whatsoever.  What it did do was isolate me from family members who weren't ready to confront the issue, and added a huge layer of trauma that I've struggled to overcome ever since.  

I would like to advise anyone dealing with extreme abuse issues to proceed with caution indeed.  I sincerely hope that my feedback can help other readers avoid making the same mistakes I made.  I would urge you to think twice before following any of the advice in this book
