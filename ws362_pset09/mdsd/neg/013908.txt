As a former Novell MCNE I was expecting the same excellent coverage Novell provided in their CNE and MCNE certification books, but I was shockingly disappointed.  For example - look up the route command - configuring routes on page 372 - there are two short paragraphs of introduction on the first page and two screen shots on the second page, one of the output from typing route and one of the man page for route - I turned the page and... what a shock!... we're onto the next objective.  Nothing about relating entries in a route table to the route commands required to get them into the table. No explanation of what a route means, just the man page, which is the motivation for most people to buy a Linux book - but not this one.  The rest of the book offers scant coverage of topics that cry out for attention.  Of all the Linux books on the market, this is one of the last ones I would turn to for help. This book has served to deter me from buying other Novell books, although the course 307 and course 308 books for SLES9 appear to be much more what I was expecting - in depth coverage, and cheaper too if you get them used
