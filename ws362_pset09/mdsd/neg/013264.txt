I finished this painful read last evening and can only say that I have yet to read a book that is more tedious than Blue Shoe. 
Several reviewers, smarter than I, quit (while they were ahead) before finishing it and, oh, how I wish that I had! 

The main characters grates like chalk across the board, in their lack of substance, vacuous self-centeredness, and purposeless lives. In the lead, is Mattie. A milk toast of a woman living a gray life as a victim. Her divorce is boring, her affairs are dull, her parenting weak bordering on bad. There are no lessons learned or insights found in the draining excuse of an existence Ms. Lamott created for her. Peel me a grape...and please do yourself a favor and pass this one up
