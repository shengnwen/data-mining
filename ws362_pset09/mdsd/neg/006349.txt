I'm giving this novel two stars for a clever idea and some good writing (though it could have been edited better).   I began reading with high hopes  (I liked the psychological insights into Dexter's "condition" and his childhood) but found the endless mid-section with gruesome "action" scenes and unrelentingly smart-ass (and often repetitive and redundant) inner dialogue tedious.  I flipped through the book to see how it would end (I rarely do that) because it just seemed to go on and on about one dismemberment after another...not  even very interesting, just the lopping off of limbs.  Ugh.  The worst part's the ending -   Dexter daydreaming about how great it will be to teach his fiancee's little boy -  an (apparently) budding psychopath like Dexter - the  "rules" of his murderous trade.  So Dexter will pass on to the kid what his own stepfather did: that it's O.K. to kill  if you just kill bad guys.  How very convenient and simple it would be if psychopaths really did think that way.  Then they would not murder their spouses, children, or the victims they hunt down  and slaughter in cold blood, just for kicks. There's going to be a TV series based on these father-son "bonding" stories?  It's basically a one-note black humor joke that should go no further than  two clever, disturbing novels. I say Deep-Six Deadly Dexter before an audience of young people can be indoctrinated into this rather nasty version of the Old Boys' Club
