Not a very modern book about 16 years out of date now.
is major book about one person's sharpening system and yet it does have a lot of infromation on how to sharpen knives and such. 
which is a lot more that almost all the other books sold out there.
If you get ripped on other books on "how to sharpen" and want something else get this one 
Toma the Old One of "SHARP NOW! company
