Kimball's book is all about inducing guilt in the reader. As noted in "The Subtle Power of Spritual Abuse" by Johnson & VanVonderen shaming is a type of spiritual abuse and Mormons are very good at that. All the following points as pointed out by the authors may be found in the way Mormon Leadership handle people or intimate the workings of God to people: "God rewards spritually with material goods", "You can never say no to those in religious authority", "The existance of trouble in your life indicates a lack of faith", and "everyone in the ministry is called by God, is appropriate, and must be trusted". Mormon religious leaders receive no training in counseling or psychology but yet are told that they can do it because they have been called by God. Without training it is very easy to slip into a mode of spiritual abuse. And this book does not help alleviate this but helps to foster it
