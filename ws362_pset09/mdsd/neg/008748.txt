I love Daniel Handler. His two books (aside from Unfortunate Events) "Watch Your Mouth" and "The Basic Eight" are impossible to put down and brilliantly constructed. This I did not see, however, with "Adverbs". 
"Adverbs", to me, is all over the place. First it's in Seattle, then New York, with all these different people, and I feel like I'm reading the journal of a lunatic more than a piece of work done by Handler. I believe he is a genius and one of the most talented modern-day authors, but he really let me down with this book. Try as I might to understand/get into the story, I failed to. I just hope he whips out something just as brilliant as "The Basic Eight" again soon so I can forget about his faux pas of a novel
