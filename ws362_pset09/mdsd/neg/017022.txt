I have traveled to China and am fascinated by the country.  I looked forward to this book and as I started to read it, the bginning fulfilled all my ideas of the early twentieth century in China,  tidbits about living there and the white russians.  I eagerly read and then realized that the book had lost it's potential.  I am sorry that the author's two brothers had lost their way and even more sorry that his oldest brother committed suicide but I lost all desire to read the book. It is almost like he is still coming to terms with the death.  ANytime some relative does something that drastic, it is traumatizing but after a while it became less about China and more about life outside China.  Of course that is where I stopped reading so I didn't know if he got back on course.  Still I would have hoped that the actual life in China as a child would be more interesting.  What about his sister and what it was like for a girl born in the 1920's in China?  It seems Frank was the only one who mattered and the suthor's sister is bearly a footnote.  
Did the family learn Chinese or not?  Did they live in an isoltaed european word or did they take in the chinese atmosphere, description of housing, clothing, a read feell for China would have been a better read than all the non-chinese section
