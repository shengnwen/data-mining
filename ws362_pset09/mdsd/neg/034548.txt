I was so enthralled with the story of Elizabeth and Wynn in the first three books of this series, and could not wait to read this one, but I found it terribly disappointing.  The hallmark of these books was the tender way in which Elizabeth and Wynn loved and cared for each other.  There were also interesting story lines about Wynn's work and living in the north. All of that was missing from this book.  The dialogue was stiff and the story line changed from adventure to evangalism, making Elizabeth and Wynn into missionaries.  I am a Christian and even I began to be bored with these characters.  I also do not agree with the author's passion of wrenching children from Elizabeth and Wynn.  So, in my mind their story ends differently. When they live in Athabasca, and Wynn has a regular work schedule, they will indeed have children of their own as well as the two they adopt.  Into each life God also wants a little SUNSHINE to fall!  The author seemed to rush this to press (both the third and fourth book were published in the same year) without giving it the same attention she obviously gave the first three books.
