It had been a long time since I've read a Martha Grimes novel, and now I remember why I felt no urge to return: bored (and boring) pampered aristocrats with nothing to do but drink and waffle on in a way that is presumably supposed to be witty (but isn't), characters defined principally by their one-line quirks, relationships that aren't defined at all yet take up space... and now this: a book without an ending.  It just stops dead, when the only reason I plowed on was the hope that something clever might happen at the very end.  It was maddening to have a detective who doesn't bother to make the most elementary common-sense investigation of the "mystery" (yet waxes on about it to everyone he meets), makes absolutely no use of forensics, and just wanders off when children are in deadly peril, leaving them to be saved by an improbably brilliant dog.  And that's putting it mildly. (And even then, Jury apparently doesn't care that the children are still in peril from a combination of criminally lax guardians and a homicidal madman who has barely been interferred with, let alone arrested.) As others have noted, the far-too-many references to superstring theory added absolutely nothing, and were on the level of name-dropping after watching a PBS special or two. If this book is a joke, then I'm out $10 without getting it.  If Ms. Grimes were an unknown author, this book would have been sent to the slush pile - unless an indulgent editor gave her a chance to cut 200 pages and come up with an ending.  The two stars, by the way, are for old school literacy and some pretense of style... which was what sucked me in long enough to spend too many hours of my life finishing this - if you can be said to finish a book that ends as if the publisher just ran out of paper!
