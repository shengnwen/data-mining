the book the color purple is a very good book.The book is kind of hard to understand because of the way that they talk. The book is about a girl  name celie and she and she was the oldest out of her sisters so she was picked 2 marry a guy and that guy used 2 beat her and rap her. this book make me think about what do i what to be when i grow up and that im going to make more of my self as a black young lady
