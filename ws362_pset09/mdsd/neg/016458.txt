Irritatingly predictable, I might add. One might sum up the entire book by flipping to just one of the expected photographs of some idiot with gizmos attached to every limb. This is technology out of control. We should not be serving technology, it should be serving us. Just because it's a gizmo and hooked up to a computer doesn't mean any sane person will prefer a digital life over a biological life. I may just be biased because I found Portman's TECHNOPOLY before I found this book. If you think technology and gizmos attached to the human body are cool, go ahead and reinforce your geekhood by reading this book, but don't expect to be surprised by any of the cliche's found herein
