shocking but true. i'm a die-hard matrix fan who has read every book written on the movies. journey did have its merit -- being the only matrix book to take on the symbolic significance of explaining why the humans can talk on cell phones, but need a hard line to exit the matrix. nevertheless, something remains missing from this book: the author's pride. 

dr challiyil isnt taking any profit from this book, deflecting all funds to his charitable foundation. good for him. but that is no excuse for such a piss-poor presentation as rampant misspellings, irregularities in the spacing and several contradictions of the plot.

it is as if he said: i'm a nobel winner. there's a big matrix audience. if i spend all of two weeks writing a pseudo book i'll make some money for my cause and do some good. who cares if it's accurate or presentable? i'll have fun and that's that. 

the book reads like a long blog.

welcome to the desert of the spell-check
