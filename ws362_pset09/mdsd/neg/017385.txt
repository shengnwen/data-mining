Bruce Bawer, Daniel Pipes, Ibn Warraq, and others, have covered the important points with much greater skill and clarity.

And yes, there are important points: the threat of Islamist imperialism is real; the traditional Left's failure to grasp this has had catastrophic results; Eurotrash anti-American and anti-Israeli sentiments are irrational and hypocritical; etc.

Beyond this, Berlinski is so pickled in Republican broth that she cannot stop undermining her own positions.

1. She complains of the urban sprawl and degraded environment of Europe, but wishes Europeans would breed faster.
2. She enjoys the freedom that European secularism gives her (as a secularist of Jewish parentage) but whines that more 'old tyme religion' is needed to counter Islamism.
3. She attributes Marseilles' (relative) freedom from Muslim mob violence to the inclusion of religious councils in city government. But must report the selection of a archetypal fundamentalist imam by the Marseille ummah.

The book appears to have been padded out to its current length, several later chapters are seriously below standard.

For one toothachingly tedious chapter, Berlinski appears to have skimmed Norman Cohn's great work The Pursuit of the Millennium. She manages to miss Cohn's central point--that Medieval Millennialist uprisings were specific to their time and do not support comparisons with Lenin, Luther etc.--and mines the book for examples of anti-clerical/anti-feudal revolutionaries so that she may compare them to a contemporary anti-globalization/anti-American French demagogue.

In addition, we must slog through an entire chapter on the German heavy-metal band Rammstein, so that Berlinski can point out that ... ya know ... Germans are, like ... different.
