Now I know where Maureen Dowd gets her boring and rather idiotic rants that chic pseudo-intellectuals find so amusing while the "inbred" (in other words, dissenting free thinkers who actually do not just give blind praise to someone because of their gender,race, religion, ethnicity, etc.) hicks think of a reason why we wasted our time of this drivel.

This crap has been disproven by many professional men and women time and time again. It is understandable that some women are angry at how they have been treated. However, some of them are becoming what they hate. And it will destroy them in the end.

This book is garbage, pure and simple. It is this kind of stuff that makes people who can think for themselves realize this author and Dowd merely undermine their efforts instead of aiding them. Good job, dingbats.

Anyone find this rather scathing? Good, they can dish it, they should be able to dine on it
