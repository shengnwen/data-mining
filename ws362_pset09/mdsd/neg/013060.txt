As I had consumed all my leCarrï¿½, I sought something to fill the space of a long plane flight. This was suggested to me. If you are a JlC fan, be forewarned, this book's low-calorie diet will be very disappointing. Short on detail, a lot of repetitive word usage, even trite phraseology....it's all here. I have been told that this is not AF's best stuff, and I have no doubt that might be true. This feels formulaic, hurried. Remember the movie Foreign Correspondent? This book, of course, is not that story, but it illustrates an unusual point for me. Ordinarily, print has so much advantage over film in its ability to evoke imagination and supply rich textures. After all the praise of AF for his ability to evoke the moody 1930s, I was certainly jazzed to get some of that. But not this book. I was consistently aware I was reading a novel, unengrossed, unpersuaded, no disbelief suspended. The movie TFC, in contrast, is extremely effective in transporting you to pre-war times. It could well be--indeed, I have zero trouble imagining--that a movie of AF's book would actually be more interesting than the book itself, that in the hands of a great dirrector, it could be quite compelling. That's how unsatisfying the book is
