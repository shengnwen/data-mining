Pretty much everything that needs to be said about this stinker has been said in other reviews -  a ridiculous premise carried forth by astonishingly artificial dialogue.  I tried twice to read it, but life's too short.  Turns out it is one of Meltzer's first novels, maybe his very first.  Subsequent efforts are much better.  Ditch this one and read The Zero Game or The Millionaires.
