I have been a graphic designer for ten years. I am formally trained in this field and have a background in fine art.

I purchased this book because on the flyleaf it states that the author wanted to share ideas about some pitfalls to avoid in this business and to help others with his knowledge and expertise.

I have quite a few problems with this book. Firstly, it was typeset in this hard-to-read-but-looks-beautiful-in-layout sans serif font. Whose bright idea was that? This is a book about graphic design, supposedly sharing important ideas, and yet the designer who did the layout was more in love with form and pretty layouts than in making the book easy enough to read to actually impart the information it was pretending to care about.

There was also a lot of self-congratulatory interviewing with 'top designers' and some of the challenges they faced. While this may have been a great idea, the questions were worded in such a way that there are no real insights ABOUT THE BUSINESS to be gleaned from the answers. A fresh grad will most likely not be that concerned about staying fresh, and an experienced hand will probably find reading about other designer's process no more than a curiosity.

In other words, this book was written for noone but the author himself. Skip it
