I have never read Sidney Sheldon before, and I don't know if this book is typical of his writing style, but I can honestly say it was horrendous. When I finished reading the book, I came here out of curiosity to find out what others had to say about it. I couldn't believe the glowing reviews on this site!
Sheldon writes like an elementary school student. He attempts to develop his characters by say "Paige was a tough woman" instead of putting Paige into a situation and demonstrating her toughness. The reader is just supposed to accept his little facts about each character without any evidence.
The courtroom scenes are lame and overdramatic - people yelling "Objection!" every couple of paragraphs, and the judge engaging in unbelievable dialogue such as Judge: "Did you see a tent?"  Lawyer: "I beg your pardon?" Judge: "You're not going to turn my courtroom into a circus!" Groan...
The situations in the hospital are equally ridiculous, with every patient, doctor, intern and orderly trying their darndest to get the three main characters (all female doctors, gasp!) into bed. It's so contrived, it hurts to read it.
The whole book is full of lame dialogue, and the earlier-print version that I read also contained several editing bloopers that made me believe that Sheldon's own editor didn't get through it. There was one part where two paragraphs were repeated word-for-word, one right after the other in an obvious editing error. How could that go unnoticed?
I picked up the books because of the rave reviews on the covers from the Associated Press, the New York Post, etc. I asked myself several times, "Did these people read the same book I am reading?" It just didn't seem possible.
It's true that the book is a quick read, which is fortunate, because when I finished it I was sorry to have lost the couple hours it took away from my life. Don't waste your time or money on this one
