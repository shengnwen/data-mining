I am relatively new to craps. I can play but don't really understand the nuance of the game. Saw the reviews and bought it. 

I find John's banter intolerable: "macho type dude, with muscles bigger than Dolly Pardon's trademarks," "Does Sophia Loren look like a boy?". I'm sure it a generational thing. It's kind of like having Buddy Love teach you trigonometry. 

Anyway, some good information that's just really hard to get to. I'm looking for something modern and less dramatic.
