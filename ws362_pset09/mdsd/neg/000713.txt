I agree with the reviewer that said she didn't learn anything new. Although the list of what is in the book is impressive, I didn't learn anything I didn't already glean from articles or other books. The writing has a forced
"compassionate" sound to it which is consistent with the author, who is a know-it-all. Reading the book is better than meeting the author as your doctor in person
