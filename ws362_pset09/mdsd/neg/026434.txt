The only reason I'm reading this book is for school reading. Otherwise, I  would have put it down a long time ago. It's just the author venting about  his dislike for technology and how he thinks that it's going to destroy  mankind as we know it. I realized that the computer boom has its bad side  effects, but Slouka takes it to the extreme, and her repeats the same thing  over and over again. I don't find much value in his book except for  disagreeing with him. Please, spare yourself
