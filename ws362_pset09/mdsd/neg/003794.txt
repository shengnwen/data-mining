Halfway into the story, my kids asked if we could read something else. I suspect this may be a book that appeals more to adults than to children. The art work is beautiful and the plot worthwhile, but the narrative voice is so distant and emotionless--I expect that is probably what turned my kids off. The girl, the tribe, and the animals don't have names. The piece reads like a prologue rather than a story
