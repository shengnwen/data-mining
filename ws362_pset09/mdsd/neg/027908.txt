The most unfortunate thing about this book is that you should have read Pratchett's other novels to catch some jokes about Rincewind, the wizards and other characters. My intention was to introduce a friend to Terry Pratchett's hilarious writing and was not able to use this book for that reason. I would probably have to use some other book, may be "Moving Pictures". 

Apart from that, this book is only moderately funny and Pratchett resorts to some cheap puns here and there, which I found disappointing. This is a novel that seems like Pratchett wrote at the insistence of the publishers, but did not really have the energy to.
