The photos in this book are superb. In macro photography I'm really attentive to backgrounds, and Loaec has mastered the very difficult task creating colorful exciting backgrounds on high magnification images. The author demonstrates his highly evovled skills time and again with an abundance of awe inspiring photographs.

My disappointment with the book is with the text.  Maybe there's something lost in translation, but I find the writing rather stilted, and the information content was sparce. There was very little discussion that helped me understand how he produced his very fine images.

I did note that in many cases he used comparatively low magnifications, and then cropped and enlarged to create his images.  This would not be evident, though, to those who are not practiced macro photographers.
