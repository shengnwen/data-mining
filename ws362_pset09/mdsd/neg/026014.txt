I must admit that I find Christine Feehan's "Dark" desires deeply disturbing in many ways, and this book, along with _Dark Secret_, is the most disturbing. I was happy when rape stopped being such an essential part of romance novels; I still remember reading Kathleen Woodiwiss and Rosemary Rogers' novels when I was young and being freaked out by how often the heroine ended up falling in love with the man who had raped her. But Feehan's books have returned us to those dark days, when sexy heroes force themselves on young and innocent heroines, who then blame themselves for tempting the heroes beyond reason - just as Savannah not only excuses Gregori for raping her, but actually blames herself for wanting some choice and freedom in her life. Frankly, the whole doomed Carpathian species/lifemate thing seems like an excuse to indulge in the misogynist fantasies that say that men can't control their sexuality and that women like to be raped. It is possible to write sexy paranormal romance/erotica that doesn't indulge in the most retrogade gender stereotypes around. Try Emma Holly.
