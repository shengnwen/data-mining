A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.

It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite
