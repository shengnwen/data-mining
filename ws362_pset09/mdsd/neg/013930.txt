I have both the text and the solutions manual that accompanies it.  The book itself is lousy; the examples skip so many steps they're nearly impossible to follow.  The so called solutions manual isn't any better; it only has certain problems worked out, and even those aren't done well.  At least the book has one line answers to ALL the problems in the back
