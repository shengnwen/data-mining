As a Web professional, I'm always interested in reviewing the work of my peers, seeing what I can learn from them. I visited the author's Web site and perused his portfolio since a look inside the book wasn't available here, and I was more than a little disappointed. The integration of his CSS/XHTML is flawed and it just doesn't display the way it should on the major operating system/browser combinations that it should. With this in mind, any advice from the doesn't hold much water for me. I was most interested in this book as a source of inspiration, and have found the Taschen series much more to my liking
