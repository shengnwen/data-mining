"Pylon" is the story of a newpaper reporter's fascination (or obsession) with a menage a trois in a flying team operating in the deep South, racing planes for cash prizes. The attraction is the openness of the pilot's relationship with Laverne and hers with the fellow team member, the "jumper" or parachutist. There is child, but which of the men is the father is not known. The dangers of the sport and the immorality of the relationships draw the attention of the reporter.

This is a strange, disjointed novel, very lumpy in which Faulkner's portentious, over-written prose often overloads both the over-stretched plot and weakly-drawn characters. Frequent globs of indigestible writing weigh down the novel.Given this background, there's little surprise in the fact that this is one of Faulkner's lesser-known efforts.
