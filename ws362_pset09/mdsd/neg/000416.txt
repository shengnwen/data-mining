On page 20, Ross Gelbspan talks of all the melting ice. What he does not say is that Antartica, which has 90% of the worlds ice, has cooled by .7 degrees C since the 1970. This is a reversal what is a 6000 year warming trend. 

He also calls the couple of skeptics that still exist are the laughing stalk of the scientific community being paid by oil interests. He talks about how over 2000 scientist in over 100 countries say that global warming is a fact. He failes to mention the Global Warming Petition which says there is not enough sciene to support the conslusion that man is warming the Earth. This Petition has been signed by over 17,000 scientists

According to sea level monitoring stations in Austriala, sea levels have risen at most, 3 mm each year. They have been rising for over 6000 years, ever since the last ice age. Austriala is capable of measuring the two largest bodies of water, the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean. 

The spreading of diseases is not related to climate change either, but to GDP. Repressive countries have a lot of disease will rich free countries have much less. As countries become poorer they become more vulenerable to disease. 

Theres are just a few of the flaws in this book. The climate has always been changing and will always continue to change. It is incredibly arrogant of mankind to think they can do anything about this.
