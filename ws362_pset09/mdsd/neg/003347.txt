This book could quite possibly be the most poorly-written book that I have ever read.  The most glaring flaw is that the last approximately 40 pages are completely irrelevant compared with the rest of the book.  Since the book is only 200 pages long, this is quite a tangent for the author to take.  Within this section, the narrator descends into a self-pitying diary of his early adult years.  I would like to point out that the plot of the book originally centered around his last year of high school.  Past this, the rest of the book suffers from a lack of development.  Many new characters and conflicts are introduced, only to disappear in the next chapter.  The main character never develops, and the reader does not have the ability to empathize with his internal struggles.  The book simply does not have redeeming qualities, and even takes a few moments to trash Ayn Rand; since this is a book that young adults will probably read, it prevents them from forming and informed opinion about that author, controversial as she is.  I was surprised and disappointed that this book was nominated for the Pen/Faulkner award.  I strongly suggest that inquisitive readers look elsewhere for even mediocre reading material.
