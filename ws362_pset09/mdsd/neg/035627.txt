This book is really disgusting. The author is one of those people who live based on abstract principles, without any contact with the real world. He simply ignores the needs of the modern state and the real problems of public administration. Besides, he is one of those Americans that cannot see beyond the US borders. He thinks all the time in terms of US universal values. Very bad
