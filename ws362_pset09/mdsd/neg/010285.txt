   White studies, what an interesting concept. Those who subscribe to White Studies are the first to tell you that there is Race is not a viable construct, except, of course-the White Race.  Hidden in this insanity is the popular trope that only white's can be racist (except the chosen white feminists. 
  This may remind those who have studied the rise of Nazi Germany of the melding of the hated Oost-Juden and the Jewish citizens of the German state-thus. Attempts to differentiate between the groups became impossible under the Nazis and likewise with the pushers of White Studies.
    When one explores the writings of White Studies authors the bile comes out with regularity: white (the non-race) people harbor all sorts of stereotypes, predjudices, and hatreds-even whites who rarely interact with minorities are guilty of the sins of their race!  Whiteness is a problem that must be erradicated so that the perfect peace of equality can reign supreme. But, before this peace, according to Harvard's Prof. Ignatiev the white race must be destroyed! 
   What we should ask is how this is to be done, and what will replace the non-white race?  Will it be the hip-hop folks with their bling-bling and multi-colored underwear, the lesbian feminists with their short hair or the latino/latina with their barrio culture and enchilades?  Stay tuned-the white race is here to stay
