I am very enthusiastic about exposing my children to different cultures and ideas, and when I saw this book and read the reviews on Amazon, I was excited to get it for my girls.  When the book arrived, I read it immediately.  The story and the pictures are beautiful.  I liked everything until the very last sentence of the book -- I was very surprised to read that Yeh-Shen's stepmother and stepsister were "crushed to death in a shower of flying stones."  Although I understand that this may be part of the original story, I am giving this book one star because it is supposed to be appropriate for children 4-8.  I don't believe, with such a violent and disturbing ending, that it is appropriate for this age group
