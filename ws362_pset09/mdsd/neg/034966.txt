I found the formulas to be too exotic. Most of the ingredients  are very expensive. I was also dissapointed that natural preservatives were not discussed. The thought of someone keeping their lotion in the refrigerator is an inconvenience. I want to sell my concoctions, and that can't be done without preservatives
