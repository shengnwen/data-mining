This book bothered me a lot.
The author begins by presenting himself and his spiritual quest and accomplishments. He tells us that he attained high states of consciousness. I guess this is done as a substitute to any scientific proof of what follows.
Don't get me wrong. I don't deny his experiments or the data collected over years, or the validity of almost anyone of his statements. But generally, there is tendency from the author's part to at least vaguely indicate how he came to some of his conclusions!
I think our time is better spent reading something else.
Also, I recommend to anybody interested in reading this book to read what wikipedia has to say about the author
