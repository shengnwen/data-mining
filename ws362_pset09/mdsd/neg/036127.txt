30+ years after Jimi's death this author jumps to the head of the (very long) line of Hendrix biographers who claim to have the "true" story behind/about the man and the musician . . . and like so many previous biographies this one falls woefully short. What you will find in this book - an interesting narrative on Hendrix's childhood, a perspective on Hendrix's heroin possession trial in Canada, a brief chronology of The Experience's 1966-67 rise to stardom, a "theory" on his death and A LOT of the stereotypical tortured artist trapped in a web of managers, lawyers, promoters and hangers-on. What you won't find in this book - any serious discussion, analysis, description or even a glimpse of Hendrix's music - a fairly extraordinary feat for a Hendrix biography. Quotation marks are used very liberally throughout this book and I'll leave it to someone else to discuss/verify the authenticity of the remarks and sources - I'll simply say the "conversations" proved incredibly uninteresting to this reader - again somewhat remarkable when you consider the subject matter. The last section of the book concerns all the financial/legal issues concerning Hendrix's music since his death. As a long time fan I've "experienced" the re-issues, bootlegs, dub-overs etc.,(and long ago realized that these releases had more to do with money than with the music), and I guess I've been peripherally aware of the legal battles, but at this point in time as long as the Hendrix audio library stays available with an occasional addition here and there I'm happy, so the in-fighting chronicled here, (as pathetic and petty as it was/is), was of somewhat less interest to me... and also paints the author in a similar light. Unfortunately, as it was 40 years ago, Jimi has many admirers/fans but very few if any friends.
