Clearly this product is overrated. In my opinion the book is a complete mess, with definitions, propositions and theorems mixed with the main text and not clearly evidenced from it.

It's funny, because the book uses a panoplia of bolds, italics, etc in the main text (well, there is only main text here) which I dislike and think is unnecessary, and then do not use it to evidence the important results. As a result I think this is probably the worst book that I can remember of for reference.

There are better books and it's almost impossible to get one worse than this one
