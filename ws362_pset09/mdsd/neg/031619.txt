Spoiler alert!!

This book was a waste of my time and my money.  The only redeeming value it has is that it is atleast a quick read so it didn't waste too much of my time.  Bad dialogue is everywhere in this book, and the story is ridiculous.  Webb's son comes back from the dead to hunt him down and kill him?  And ofcourse he just happens to be trained to kill on top of that.  One of the above reviews likened it to Guiding Light, and I'd almost agree if I didn't dislike this book so much.  That's right, I'd appreciate Guiding Light more than this book.  If Amazon would allow me to give it 0 stars I would.  I keep the book around so people will ask me about it and I can do them the favor of driving them away from it
