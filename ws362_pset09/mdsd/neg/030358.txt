I am sure he is an amazing mathematician, but I found this book to be the most horrible linear book I have ever seen. The text that was bolded and italicized was inconsistent and therefore very confusing especially in a book which employs bold face to denote specific mathematical qualities. Furthermore, the conversational style and lack of fluidity had a synergy that would drive even the craziest mathematician crazier. I would reco Lay's or Pooles or Bronson's (this might be my favorite because it is proof intensive). Again, he is a better mathematician than I will ever be, even if he was wasted, but I would not reco this book to any first semester linear student, go for one of the aforementioned authors
