Bjerknes spends 400+ pages attacking Einstein for not being an honest author and yet CJB's disclaimer on page 4 loudly proclaims (along with all of the comma splices!), that CJB is equally dishonest "Neither the author, nor the publisher, guarantees the completeness, or the accuracy, or the adequacy, of any information in this book." At first, I thought this was a bunch of legalese, but once I got into the book I realized that about half the book is authorial conjecture and mental naval-gazing that wouldn't (and couldn't) stand up in a court of law.  Although almost half the book is dedicated to sitations and sources, it's a truly shameful and amateur effort on Bjerknes' behalf; in the hands of a better writer (any OTHER writer), a strong and coherent argument could be made for Einstein's plagiarism- given all the source material. Bjerknes' rants, which can only be interpretted as anti-semitism, color all the material in such a way as to cause even the most die-hard critic of Einstein to have a change of heart. It's really an embarrassing effort for the author and a waste of money and time for us, the reader.
