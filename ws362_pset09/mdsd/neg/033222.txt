I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with this one. I have been a big Bee Gees Fan since 1977, and also love to read Biographies, so I purchased this book as soon as it was released. It is an extremely disjointed read - there were a few different contributors, and it really shows - it seems like, as each writer finished a section, they just added the pages to the rest, with no thought to continuity or to the art of storytelling. Also, there are so many different names being thrown around constantly, that I had a hard time keeping track of who was who. It reads more like an encyclopedia than an artful biography with a story to tell. I consider myself a diehard Bee Gees fan, and I had a difficult time making it through the entire book. Definitely not for the &quot;part-time&quot; Bee Gees fan
