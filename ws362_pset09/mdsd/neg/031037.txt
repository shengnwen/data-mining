This was the first book I bought when I became interested in picture framing. Since then I have read many other books on the subject, met many professional picture framers, taken courses in the subject, joined the Professional Picture Framers Association, and basically learnt much much more about the subject. I CANNOT recommend this book to any one who is new to picture framing.  First, the information is scattered between many chapters, and is difficult to pull together.  Second, many very important topics receive very little coverage.  Third (the major problem for me): the author is first-and-foremost, a wood worker, and this is reflected in the book. Thus, there are many chapters discussing tools that most professional picture framers would never buy, methods that most professional picture framers would never use, inadequate discussion of conservation framing vs. non-conservation methods, mat cutting, etc.  If you are interested in making your own wood picture frames, this is the book for you.  If you are new to the subject or are interested in many of the other aspects of picture framing, you would be much better off with one or more books by David Logan, Vivian Kistler, or others
