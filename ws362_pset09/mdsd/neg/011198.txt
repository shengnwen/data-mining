The book looked fairly instreasting so I bought it a local store a fairly siginfigiantly higher price then amazon offers it. I noticed the binding looked bad on all of the copies, but choose the best copy and went home. The dvd was scatched, sticky and looked like it had been to hell and back.This is horribile, this publsiher needs to try to copy other reccent coffee table books such as according to the rolling stone's which is an handosome and well done book. I will be returning my copy to the store and hoping I can get  my money back or atleast an in store credit. This is the worst book of this type I have ever seen
