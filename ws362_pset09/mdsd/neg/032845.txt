On the book jacket of DAMON RUNYON: A LIFE there is the line, "Much more than a biography." Actually it is much less. Rather it is a colection of oft told tales of the roaring twenties, secondhand stories with little corroboration, and with little effort being made to set history straight. Runyon is just one of the many characters who captures Breslin's fancy, Pancho Villa, various mobsters, and "colorful polticians all make appearences, with or without Runyon's presence. It's entertaining in the fact that Breslin always knew how to tell a story, but if you're actually looking for a biography...look elsewhere
