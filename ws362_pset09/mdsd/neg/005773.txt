If I could give a rating less than 1 star, I would have. The book did start out well. Julien was the perfect hero so in love with the heroine. And Kate the perfect endearing heroine. But when Julien asked Sir Oliver (father) for Kate's hand in marriage, Kate got so angry at Julien and started to hate him- as in really loathe him. Isn't it but proper during that era for the man to ask permission from the father first before proposing to the woman? So why is Kate so angry? Julien tried to win her by showing her everything a woman would die for- his love, his comfort and his social standing. What more does she want? But she scorns him and hates him even more. And her hatred lasted until almost the end of the book. Truly unbelievable. How utterly boring and irritating. There was no special moment that made my heart flutter. Kate is not endearing at all. I even hate her already for being so irrational- and so stubborn. Doesn't she know how lucky she is to catch Julien??? Also, if Kate is really a troubled woman, shouldn't it show from the 1st page? She was a carefree, independent and so happy woman. Not at all the characteristic of someone who is troubled with the child abuse and the regular physical abuse of her father. I did not even finish the book. I gave it a try until the 300th page, but couldn't continue anymore for it is just a waste of my precious time. There was also no reason why Julien would rape Kate. He never even tried to be intimate with her at any point in the book. It's just so stupid. The writing style is good though- but the plot is just so bad! I can go on and on... but in the end all I want to say is- Do not waste your time and money with this book. Really- it's not romantic at all. Kate's actions will make you roll your eyes
