This is an unbelievably bad book. The story, including the identity of the villain, is obvious within the first chapters. The characters, dialogue and situations are so unbelivable as to be ridiculous. If the protagonists in this story graduated from medical school, I might consider sending my hamster, because they seem to have about an equal intelligence level. David and Angela should have figured this whole mess out even before I did, but they were too busy listening to their daughter's improbable dialogue, answering her with trite, cutesy nonsense, and putting her into situations that should have made them lose their parenting privileges. Cook should leave polemics about HMOs to the analysts and concentrate on basic writing techniques - plot, character development and dialogue
