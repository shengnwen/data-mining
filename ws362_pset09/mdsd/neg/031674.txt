I bought this book after seeing Mr Florida talk on CSPAN-2. He does have some interesting things to say about creativity, but...

I found it very difficult to finish.

Mr Florida claims to be politically independent, but he doesn't even hesitate to engage in the sort of casual Bush bashing one see's only in the extreme left, and along with this he repeats almost every silly platitude of same, including the ridiculous "pentagon holding a bake sale to buy a bomber" bit.

If he's politically independent, then I'm the King of Siam.

And his solution? right out of the leftists playbook, we have to spend more, lots more, way more than we ever have, "several orders of magnitude more" on "education", "culture" and "the arts."

Anyone interested in buying a used book? Only read once..
