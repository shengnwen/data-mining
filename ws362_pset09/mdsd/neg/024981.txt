This book is not helpful at all. They mostly teach you how to compute and they prove some very basic theorems. Then, the homework asks you to do these complicated proofs that you have no idea how to b/c the text doesn't teach you how. I wish that they would do less examples of computation (which is easy enough) and more proofs. They also have a bad habit of defining key terms within the hw that you might miss.
