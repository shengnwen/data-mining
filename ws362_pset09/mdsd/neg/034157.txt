Evidently, this book does not target people starting out in Public Relations. I am a VP of Marketing in a start-up company looking to get some feel for the value of PR. I found this book utterly unintelligible. I was also irritated by the constant reference to `clarity of communication' - advice that the author clearly ignores. Why is `plain English' considered to be such a crime? After reading this on a 3 hour flight from Denver to New York, I was none the wiser about PR and given the significant weight of the book, decided to leave it on the plane. This is a text for PR academics
