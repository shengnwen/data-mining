The jacket copy on this book claims that it covers events "spanning two thousand years... beginning with the rise of... Oc Eo, to the glory of the Cambodian Empire in the first millennium..." This is true to the extent that all years up to 1511 are covered in the first 30 pages, and the next twenty pages take us up to 1860. For coverage of early Southeast Asian history, I recommend the Lonely Planet guides as much more detailed, and more useful once you're there. (On the causes of the fall of the empire at Angkor, Osborne says "No single, overriding cause for this event can be identified, nor would it be sensible to try and find one." My Lonely Planet guide discussed the patterns of overbuilding, mentioned the deliterious effect of the corveé, and talked about issues with water supply, at least.) If your interest is in Southeast Asia since the French came, then this is a fairly absorbing and well-written book
