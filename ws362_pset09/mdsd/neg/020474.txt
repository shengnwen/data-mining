The book Gemba-Kaizen is somewhat disappointing if you have read the book 'Kaizen' already. It gives not much new information. The only new idea in  the book is the attention given to the 'Gemba', the place where the  processes are performed. Imai is right to stress the importance of the  Gemba for operational excellence and he gives some nice tools and examples  to illustrate the Gemba's importance. However, only one nice idea is  somewhat poor to fill a whole book. The major message of the book can be  told just as well in an articel of no more then 4 pages
