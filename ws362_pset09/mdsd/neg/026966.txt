I ordered this book because of the reviews but the reviews are for a different book!  This book is basically a calendar that you use to fill in what you ate and what exercise you did and note how it made you feel.  It is a companion book to The Chemistry of Success.  I bought it used so I'm not out alot of money and its my own fault for not reading the editors reviews more carefully.
