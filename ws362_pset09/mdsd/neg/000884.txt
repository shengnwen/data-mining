This was my first reading of a Kellerman novel, though I'd obviously heard about him for years. I can't imagine a read much more painful than this novel. He is the king of what writers call Talking Heads, just pages and pages of dialogue that go nowhere. He also loves convenience, an absolute deal killer in mystery and suspense. The characters Delaware interviews protest for a few sentences then suddenly realize they better help him. And then there are the pages and pages and pages where he and Milo have to have impossibly mundane dialogue so the author can tell you how the mystery is unfolding...because nothing in the material leads to any mystery of merit. It's also amazing that Kellerman is a psychologist and his character is one as well, and yet so often it is other characters pointing out what even amateur phsychologists or observers of human beings would know. If this is, as the jacket says, "one of the world's most popular authors", I need to go in search of the worst sellers.
