Okay, so I'm at work one day, a Christian bookstore, and I open up a box to check it in when I come across this book. I read the back cover and think to myself, "Are you serious?" But, being the curious person I am, I have to read it. I'm pretty sure I wasted about 3 hours in which I could have been doing something more beneficial, like watching grass grow. 

Okay, so it wasn't THAT bad, but I definitely felt as though I should talk to my manager about selling this book in our store. The only way this could be considered a Christian book on dating is that it says that you should wait until you're married to have sex, but even that, it says in a way that makes you think that you should save it more for (if you're a girl) keeping the guy interested than because it is morally a sin. This book is not scripturally based, so if you're looking for something that is, go elsewhere. Try Joshua Harris or Eric and Leslie Ludy, but don't buy this book. 

If you insist on trying this, be warned that you may not like what you read. This book tries to be hip, so it is interesting. But in the end you may feel as I did, like you wasted a good 3 or more hours of your life
