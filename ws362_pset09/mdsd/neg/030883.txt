This book consists of 18 essays about various aspects of the history of the Times Square neighborhood. There are over 40 illustrations, mostly b&w period photos and reproductions of old theater programs, as well as one map. The drawback of collections of essays is that the reader never gets a chance to become comfortable with the tone or worldview of a single author. On the positive side, if one author is offputting, perhaps the next essay will be better, and it's impossible to dislike every essay of the book. Some of the essays are quite broad in topic while others are quite specialized (such as "The Syndicate/Shubert War" between two theater entrepreneurs in the early 1900s). 

When so many authors are involved, it's hard to generalize about the book. To the extent that there is a theme, it is nostalgia for the pre-1990 era when Times Square was filled with criminals, beggars, and porn shops. For example, here is one of many negative comments about the Marriott Marquis hotel: "The hotel is a nasty piece of business .... [the hotel's design] seemed more deliberately arranged to sift out all but the most doggedly determined street people before they reached the eighth floor [lobby]" (p. 13). The complete context implies street people would be a positive addition to the lobby.

I have been to Times Square both before and after its revitalization, and I am mystified by the notion that porn theaters, junkies, and beggars are preferable to having the sidewalks jammed by respectable tourists seeing Broadway musicals. This is a strange form of nostalgia, indeed. For a much more balanced treatment of the topic, read "Ghosts of 42nd Street" by Anthony Bianco
