I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.   

Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.   

In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.

This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.

For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr.
