Sorry...it's not what I expected. I kept thinking, "where is this going???" It just wasn't funny. It reminded me of something written 100 years ago. But that's not to say someone familiar with Portuguese linguistics (maybe a German academist or an up-in-coming Dr. Dr. Longname, etc. etc. hrumph, cough), could not read between the lines and find this humorous...it was just a little dry and boring to me. After the first couple jabs at these pompous doctors, it got tiring. I read every single book in the Ladies Detective series and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the next Precious Ramotswe story. This, however, was a disappointment. I'm only sorry I bought all 3 in the series, sight unseen, based on the other books I'd read by Alexander McCall Smith
