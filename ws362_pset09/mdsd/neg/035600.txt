 I was so relieved to see that other bakers were disappointed with this book. The recipes SEEM as if they'd be good, but they're so disappointing, and the directions were overly confusing. I was once a professional baker and I found this book a big ol' waste of my money. The little guide to cookies has better recipes for much less dough
