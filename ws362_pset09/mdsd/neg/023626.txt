I have the Proper Care and Feeding of husbands and I enjoyed that book.  Woman Power is full of blank pages for you to write your thoughts and ideas. I think it is a waste of time unless you just LOVE to journal.  If you took the useful information and took out the blank pages the book is about 2 chapters.  My advice is to put your money to better use at Victorias Secret.  Your husband will get a lot more out of it!!
