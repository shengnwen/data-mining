Unlike the rest of the reviews here, this one isn't exactly a glowing recommendation.  I found most of the principles in the story completely out of character with their established personalities.  In the series, you were  left with the impression that Picard was extremely upset with Ro Laren's  betrayal, yet in the book, it's hardly even mentioned at all.  Another  point, the author does a good job of describing federation prisoners  suffering thoroughly at the hands of the Jem Hadar and Cardassians while  doing slave labor, while the main character completely forgets them at the  end to start his own life, no longer caring about his suffering comrades  who are still prisoners.  He even forgets about his best friend who helped  him get through the tough times.  No, I was completely let down.  The noble  Picard acting like the brash young Captain Kirk threw me for a loop also
