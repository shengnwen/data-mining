While he gets high marks for imagination about this planet with a thinking landmass/bioshpere, his storyline and his characters just don't cut it. This is despite the fact that the protagonist later appears in significant roles in Eon and Eternity. His experince here is supposed to affect his outlook in the other two books. Granted I read them in the wrong order as this prequel came much later, but it doesn't work for me on any level
