The text would be more focused, cheaper dollar-wise, and generally improved if the auther cut out all of the examples.  They are essentially worthless.  I really enjoy this material, but every time I go to the book as a reference, it's like watching a Golden Girls marathon, completely unbearable.  I end up wading through example after example never finding any real substance ...and there is only one chapter on random processes!  In short, too many examples make theory hard to find and follow.
