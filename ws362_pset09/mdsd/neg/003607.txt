The Review at the top says:"the author's work invites comparison with that of Robertson Davies."
Invites comparison? Anyone who has read "World of wonders" by Davies would , i think,upon reading "Eisenheim the Illusionist" use a different term than "invite comparison"...one wonders if Davies estate lawyers have not noticed ..
