This is a mean spirited, humorless diatribe on everything A.A. Gill hates about the English, uncluding their humor, sportsmanship, war memorials, you name it.  As the author states, it is a collection of prejudice.  There are no laughs that might make it ironically amusing.  Unless you hate the Brits, don't bother reading it.
