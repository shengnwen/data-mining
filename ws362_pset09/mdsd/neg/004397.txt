I don't know what type of Italian/American family other people grew up in, but I grew up in a loving family with wonderful warm traditions, holidays filled with love, humor and great food, songs sung in Italian, stories of the old country and a door that was always open with the coffee on the stove...I found none of that nostalgia here.  What I did find was the stereotypical pictures, sayings and gestures that unfortunately television portrays Italian/Americans to be.  If you are looking for a book that not only will translate swears from Italian, but will show you pictures of the gestures as well, or teaches you the correct Italian response to someone farting, this one is for you
