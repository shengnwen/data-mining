I've never read anything by Michaels (who also writes under the name Elizabth Peters), but this seemed mildly interesting (although I gather this book is nothing like her other works). The premise here is neat enough, we are taken to an old-fashioned gentlemen's club somehere in time and allowed to eavesdrop on a convocation of experts on trickery, pschology, and the paranormal, including Harry Houdini, Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle, a veiled Sigmind Freud, Nandor Fodor, and one or two others. They gather to share their research on unexplained paranormal events and propose solutions based on their own theories. The first tale is about the &quot;Bell Witch&quot; hauntings in Tennessee (which I had never heard of). The &quot;ghost story&quot; just barely maintained my interest, but when the sleuths started proposing their solutions, the writing got overly clever in trying to replicate the mannerisms of each. The second story &quot;The Phelps Case&quot; failed to hold my interest and I moved on to other things. If you're into ghost stories you might like this, but otherwise I'd suggest giving it a miss
