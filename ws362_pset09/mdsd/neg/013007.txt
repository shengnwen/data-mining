While several books provide us with beautiful and harsh truths about other cultures, this novel is not one of them.  A chaotically written story that bounces around the life of the central characters, combined with weak character development and far too many adjectives in every sentence, make for quite possibly the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Wholly depressing and utterly incomprehensible, I would steer clear of this and instead pick up a copy of The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinback
