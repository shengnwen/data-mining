This book offers little more to the reader than a collection of full color photos of various forms of body art.  It is nice to look at, but the content is very biased and non-scholarly.  The author oftens voices his  opinion about what is 'acceptable' or 'attractive', and questions people  who use body modification to &quot;take things too far&quot;.  There IS a  wide variety of body modification discussed and shown in the book, however,  the author often repeats things he had previously stated in the book,  making for very little content of value.  Overall, not one of the better  books on the subject.  Check out Bodies of Subversion by Margot Mifflin, or  The Art of the Tattoo by Ferguson &amp; Procter for better histories of  tattooing, as well as any Modern Primatives issues
