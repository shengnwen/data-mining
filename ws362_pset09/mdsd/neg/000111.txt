When I first read the premise for this novel, I hardly thought it was creative, (I have seen American History X), but decided to give it a chance anyway. Prose's writing is so unbelievable that I could hardly finish the first few chapters. She has no knowledge of what a thirty-something male ex-skinhead might be thinking, and it shows. Her use of slang is awkward and difficult to read, as are the passages of Vincent "looks too much like McVeigh" Nolan checking out Bonnie's "ass." This novel is forced and it screams it.
