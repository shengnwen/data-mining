I am an avid reader and a lover of books.  I will generally read anything cover to cover, whether I am enthralled in the story or forcing my way through the end of an awful yarn.  I couldn't even finish this book.  It was HORRIBLE!  I had prepared myself for a hilarious adventure (such as any of Douglas Adams' books) and instead got a disgusting, boring set of chapters that seem to have been forced onto the page by an immature, high school drama student.  Don't even bother with this book.  You'll be disappointed
