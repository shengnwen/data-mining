I bought this book because I wanted to read the Gospel Of Thomas. What I got was Elaine Pagels recollections of the Catholic Church and a short history. All of which would have been fine if I was not looking to read the Gospel of Thomas. Other wise it is not a horrible book, just not what I was in the market for.
