Great at telling you what to what to watch out for--look out for temperature.  PH is important, etc.  But your next question is of course, what is the right temperature?  What PH should it be?  It's not in this book.  If you're a new person to this you need a more informative resource.  This is only good at telling you what to look for, but not good at telling you what it should be, and certainly not how to fix things that go wrong.
