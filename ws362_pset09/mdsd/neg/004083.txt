It seems that the aouthor is very confused about the identity of Egyptian Jews.  He is under the false impression that they sided neither with Egypt nor with Israel; they had their own identities.  While this may be true, with the exception of the very few who were communists, their sympathy was entirely with Israel.  

By coustoms and temperament, many of them were Egyptians yes.  Yet, They were happy that a Jewish state finally came into existence, even if they insisted they were Egyptians.  Many were also elated after the Six Day War.  Also, the more Egyptian they look, the more supportive of Israel they were.  This is because for Egyptians, religion is part of our blood, and since Israel is a Jewish state, they felt religiously obligated to pray for Israel, even if in public they felt obliged to support Egypt, probably out of fear.  

That being said, the Jews of Egypt were good people, and I do understand the feelings of Egyptian Jews, since I support the Palestinians because they are Moslems.  And yes, in truth, Egypt mistreated its Jews, but that is to be expected during bad times.  The incarceration and torture in Abu Zaabal and Tura, however, was cruel and I think the authors omitted it, probably because he is not all that competent.  Though he can write better than I can, I do not think he understands what he is writing about, and I do not believe the author really understands the Middle East
