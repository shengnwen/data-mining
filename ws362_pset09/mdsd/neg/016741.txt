Robert Jensen carries the burden of a strongly opinionated man, which is that of inability to see the possibility of legitimate disagreement with him. This is not the only problem with this book, but it is at the root of most of the problems.  

First of all, Jensen offers extensive and justified criticisms of American imperialism in general and the aggressive actions of the Bush administration in particular. The criticisms are legitimate, in my opinion, but they are nothing new. Other than the precise manner of the workings of cluster bombs, I had heard every one many times before. If you are in need of a rehash of the sins of America, then this may be the book for you. Beyond that, there is really very little to recommend it. His primary points (beyond "America is bad"), as far as I can tell, are the following:

- American citizens (of the empire) of integrity and good intentions must now lead the way in dismantling "the empire" which means they must bring down the capitalist/imperialist infrastructure. He subtly implies that it will be replaced with a socialist/feminist infrastructure, but is intentionally silent about the specifics what will arise when the existing order is finally destroyed, and how it will arise. The necessity of the destruction itself is the theme of the book.

- Patriotism and love for ones country are vices that must be shed, not only in order for progressive principles to prevail, but because they are very bad things in and of themselves.

- Hope for the future is justified because of the inherent goodness of mankind in general. This goodness will eventually overcome the corruption that is at the heart of what we know as America today. Thus, enlightened individuals such as himself must keep pounding away at the foundations of this evil empire, and it will ultimately collapse and a better day will be upon us. He believes this is inevitable, though likely not to happen in his lifetime. The reader is invited to join him in his activism and in his peculiar brand of "hope".

- Corporations are evil. They must be eliminated.

- Universities do not sufficiently protect and promote the discussion and advancement of leftist issues. (Yes, he really does have a section about this!)

- The fact that prominent socialist Scott Nearing had a wider audience in his day than Jensen now enjoys is proof that people were more politically aware in those days than now. (It's interesting that Jensen does not see the extreme egotism in this conclusion.)

There are more, but I do not have my copy of the book in front of me, so I will let it stand at this. I believe that I have accurately expressed Jensen's ideas here. Each is worthy of a full analysis, but this is not the proper place for such.

Jensen is clearly an intelligent man of high principle and fine intentions. That does not always translate into useful expressions and goals. Citizens of the Empire is, unfortunately, a demonstration of this fact. Unless you are already a member of the socialist "bring down America" choir who enjoys a good sermon, there is very little of value here
