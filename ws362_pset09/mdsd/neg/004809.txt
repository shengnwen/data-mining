Most military histories of the American Revolution focus on the "great" battles, and give scant attention to recounting other, lesser engagements. However, those lesser engagements are often the best way of depicting the harsh and divisive nature of the war. In the Carolinas, for example, the war took on many aspects of a civil war within a war, as Loyalist militias, stiffened by British soldiers, took on Rebel militias in a brutal, back-country partisan conflict. 

This book attempts to describe that slice of the war by highlighting one engagement within it. That small battle, prosaically named "Huck's Defeat" (after Captain Christian Huck, the Loyalist officer who lost his life in the fight), was the first Rebel victory in the aftermath of the fall of the city of Charleston, and it is the opinion of the author that the importance small militia engagements like this one are overlooked. Huck's Defeat, and several subsequent victories by partisans and militia units, convinced most locals to side with the Rebel forces and oppose the English. This, in turn, kept South Carolina in the war, and ultimately led to the Rebel victories of King's Mountain and the Cowpens. The rest, as they say, is history: the British were forced to leave the state, marching down a path that led to Lord Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown. 

While making a good point - that these lesser back-country battles were important and are often neglected - Edgar overstates his case. "Huck's Defeat" was a very small battle indeed: 115 Loyalist and British soldiers vs. ca. 250 Rebels, and lasting no more than an hour. The loyalists were massacred, but unless the Revolutionary cause in South Carolina truly hinged on this one engagement (i.e. defeat would have meant the end of resistance in the colony), then it was simply one particularly bloody skirmish among many
