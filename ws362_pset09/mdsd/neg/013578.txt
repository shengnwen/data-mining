Like Moo/Baa/Laa this is another book that attempts to be silly but ends up being stupid!
The books messes it up in the very beginning.. "Aardvark Admiring". That is just plain stupid!
If you want silly; try "four fluffy feathers on a fiffer-feffer-fef"
Sandra is no Dr. Seuss for sure! 
Even my 14 month old thinks this book is lame! If I start reading this; she brings me the Dr. Seuss ABC.

I found one good use of this book! It makes an excellent table levele
