I taught classroom NLP for years, and I'm offended by this so-called self-help book. NLP is found by John Grinder, and in its purest form has been misused and misrepresented. Everybody claims to practice NLP as a  result of Tony Robbins. This book should have focused more on the real NLP  techniques. See Tony's Unlimited Power. It's much better
