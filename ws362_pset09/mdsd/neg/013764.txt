Joel Kotkin is not a professional historian.  Because of this, you can find many faults in his book.  First of all, his critique that the city can only exist on three basic principles simplifies human experience to a third grade level.  There are far more guiding principles to "what makes a successful city" other than sacredness, security, and commerce.  What about culture outside religion?  What if a nation is conquered, is that because they were not secure enough?  In World War II, was Europe under Nazi regime solely because every city in Europe was not safe?

Kotkin deliberatly skips over WWII.  Why?  Because more contemperary readers would be able to challenge his claim.  In his discussion of Athens, I am doubtful he even read Thucydides.  He argues Athens was not secure.  Then how did they defeat Persia?  Why did Athens form the Delian League for, if not for Security?  This was "overlooked" in his analysis.

Furthermore, his critique on Russia not being sacred in Soviet times is nothing more than old Cold War jargon.  Did Russian history and culture vanish in 1917?  NO.  It did not.  Sure, the Orthodox faith went underground, but religion is not all culture.  St. Petersburg, Petrograd, or Leningrad, whatever you called the city, was the same thing.  Changing its name did not destroy what it was.

I have never written a review here, but this book needs a critique that will prevent others from wasting their time.  The City offers no new insights.  It offers nothing but a repititious read of the same drawn out conclusions made by the author over and over and over again.  If you read this book, hopefully it is because you were forced to, and not because you wanted to
