As one reads this book he must be alert to know the truth.  Mr. Kavanaugh writes from a very broad and quasi-Christian viewpoint.  His conclusion is that the majority, if not all the composers he writes about are Christian.  He assumes all music written by these composers to be without flaw.  As near as I can tell he believes that music is amoral.  That is, he believes that music can not be right or wrong.  This idea is at odds with the supposed Christianity of these composers.  Oh, I'm sure many of them were believers.  I can tell you though that not all are.  And so you see my dilema.  I love classical music and reading about the composers.  However, I don't enjoy having to sift through a bunch of rubbish posing as spirituality
