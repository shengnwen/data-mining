The story would be alot better if this guy new how to describe ANYTHING. Short exerpts from his description of a character, "tall black man," another exerpt, "white man," and another, "naked blond woman." (...), I would've been happy to read the phrase nubian goddess as a description, but nope, couldn't even get that descript.

I may not be rascist, but I think the writer probably is. I'm still slowly drudging through this book because I'm having trouble getting past the horrible writing.

I'm also upset because the binding in my book fell apart
