It's tempting to spoil the end of this novel in order to describe how BAD it truly is, but Ms. Grafton has somehow earned a following, and as I've said before, there is something for everyone out there. After all, some people (not a majority) actually voted for George W. Bush, on purpose! I think this level of mystery fluff is for them.

Rather than spoil the nutty climax (I have worked in hospitals for years, so I ain't buying it) I will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words: "...life is one big, savage joke; not funny ha-ha, but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began."

I became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began (where did they go to kindergarten?) that I almost missed the rest of the chapter
