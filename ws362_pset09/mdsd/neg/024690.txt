Except the very equation of ROC which is a natural extension of ROI, and chapter 12 on data privacy issue that are quite unique in themselves, it is by far the worst book of its kind I had read within the last 30 days, amongst them "Technology and Customer Service" by Paul Timm, "Customer Share Marketing" by Tom Osenton, "The Dollarization Discipline" by Jeffery Fox, "Loyalty Rules" by Frederick Reichheld and "The Customer Loyalty Solution" by Arthur Hughes. I quoted those names not to boast anything, but to express my strong disappointment and frustration against this book or the authors, that I really feel being cheated of my valuable time and price of the book. I sincerely recommend you to look for something much better, which is so easy to find, if you truly want to learn CRM.
