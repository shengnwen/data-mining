Perhaps it is because the show is UK based but I was taken aback by some of the after pictures.  Alot of dresses over pants and very outlandish hats are shown as do's.

Some of the befores don't look too bad other than the dated 80's look which I think we all know not to wear.  I would have preferred more tips on handling body types rather than the obvious no's.  They put in some really sloppy don'ts which aren't much help unless people in London are really walking around like that. We need more realistic don'ts as opposed to the obvious
