I had a number of problems with this book.  The good parts were that it contained much information on the regulation of gifts in a small community over a certain period of time.  This is the kind of contextualization that  really should be apllied to any anthropological work.  Unfortunately, an  eye towards the readers is something I also believe should be included.   Specifically, I don't think there should be much line between literature  and science in a field that cannot possibly hope to perform like a physical  science.  Trying to gauge human interaction on a scale does not work in my  opinion.  Since that's what this book attempts to do, it bugs me.  As a  piece of anthropology concerning gift giving in rural China, it is actually  quite good.  But only if that's your bag
