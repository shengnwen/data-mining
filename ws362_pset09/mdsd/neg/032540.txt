First of all, I want to make this clear that the two stars I give to this title has nothing to do with the content of the book. It has everything to do with the Author's reading of this book!

I bought the CD version of this book and found that the Author's reading of the content of this book was not impressive at all. He delivered the speech in a dragging and delibrately slow fashion.  

His voice was tense and unnatural. This gave me the feeling that he was not confident during the recording of this CD version in the studio. 

I was greatly dissappointed with this CD version. He did not deliver as I would expect from an expert negotiator. I almost fall into a sleep 20 mins into listening his CD!  I thought "what happened to him? He does not speak like respectable negotiator. Why would an negotiator speak in such a boring & weak tone, almost dragging every single words he speaks. I wouldn't want to listen to a slow speaker. He bores me to death! I going to stop playing this CD!"

Believe me, I am not exegerating. I would advice you to buy his book. Save your money, don't buy the CD version! It's not worth it.

By contrast, Brian Tracy is more competent in this area. I have listened to Brian Tracy's Audio Book. You won't regret buying any  of his Audio CD; I can assure you!  His deliverance in the Audio books is commendable. He speaks with a clear voice, not too fast, not too slow, very natural and this reveals his self confidence. 
He does not only read from scripts, he speaks from it.
