A basic overview of the Gospels offers an example of how Old Testament texts are often spiritualized to say things about Jesus they were never intended to say in context. So that they appear to validate his person and messiahship, historically, even though they actually do not. That is, if examining the issue from a factual-based perspective. And, of course, the world of science is about factual bases for all we know and think to be true or untrue. Thus, it is no wonder recognized scientists (genuine scholars having actual credentials in the field in question) never write books like this. Since science is about the actual data of the dig or experiment. But, if genuine, authenticating, empirical science is what you are looking for, you will not desire this book. Against a mass of well-documented evidence supporting today's genuine scientific claims, this book spends relatively few pages taking cheap shots, presenting inaccurate analyses, and offering false information in its attempt to support its suprareal (Xian fundamentalistic) vision of earth history. A much more genuine and honest look might be "Finding Darwin's God" by a renowned biologist, and Christian, Kenneth R. Miller
