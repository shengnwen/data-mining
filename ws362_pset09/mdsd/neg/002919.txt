Most of the selected campsites are really really remote...especially if you have a motorhome.  If you're under 30, on a limited budget, and love to camp, this book's for you.  Unfortunately, I am 62, with arthritis, failing vision, and a motorhome that's a b*tch to maneuver.  If you're in the latter category, there are better guidebooks to buy (you may have to pay more than $12 for a campsite but you'll have water, power and a dump station)
