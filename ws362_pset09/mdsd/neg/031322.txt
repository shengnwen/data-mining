I just finished reading this novel by Bruce Cordell.  

Absolutely horrendous.  Amateurish writing to say the least.  It could have been written by a high school student.  I was greatly relieved to see that he was not the author of any more of the Priests novels.  And hopefully he'll never be allowed to write another one.   

What could have been great characters and follow up novels, were poorly written and developed by Cordell.  The way he had them act and the things he had them say would never be uttered by characters living in the world they live in.  I felt embarassed for them at times.  Save your time and money and skip this novel.
