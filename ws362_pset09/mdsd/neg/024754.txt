I wonder whether Terry Goodkind has fallen into the Anne Rice and JK Rowling trap of selling so many books that editors don't dare to interfere with them anymore. Any sane editor would have told Terry Goodkind to cut about 200 pages of this novel. Cutting the endless speeches and repetition of the same points over and over again might have helped make this book somewhat up to the standards Mr. Goodkind has set by the previous books of the series (except Pillars of Creation, which, frankly, I skipped). The narrative is long-winded, the endless exposition is tiring and the repetition of Richard's - questionable - moral lesson at every given chance sinks the book in a quagmire of all talk and no action. The plot is ridiculous, and the final resolution cheap and lazy. 
I must confess I'm growing tired of the way Goodkind writes Richard and Kahlan. He underuses the latter and makes the former into a terribly boring stiff. Where's the spark? 
Somehow the air's gone out of Sword of Truth somewhere in the second half of Faith of the Fallen, and I only hope Goodkind will get it back to finish off the series as strongly as it's started.
