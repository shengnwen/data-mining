After reading how highly regarded this book is, I decided to buy it. Enthusiastic with the location of stories, I couldn't wait to start reading. Unfortunately the first few stories were nothing brilliant or even what I expected of a Noirish genre writing. I've already skipped 2 stories because the first couple of pages into the stories did not hold my interest. Honestly, I'm disappointed with the book so far. To it's credit, I'm only 1/2 or so into it, and do intend to finish reading it. One writer did make an impact with a premise that was fantastically new and alive. Thomas Morrissey, Can't Catch Me. This was a piece that I will remember from the compilation, whereas the others will probably be forgotten
