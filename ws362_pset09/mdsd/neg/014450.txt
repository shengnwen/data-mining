I wanted to love this book, just as I loved Ragtime. Doctorow shows his brilliance in his use of words, his character development, and his knowledge of history, but even though he has tremendous compassion for his characters, he also has moments of an underlying sadism that is offensive and disturbing. Also I was annoyed by the literary conceit of the constant shift in narration, changing from paragraph to paragraph at times; I found it jarring and ineffective. In the end I was so troubled by this book that I couldn't finish it. 

4 stars for brilliance; 0 stars for an enjoyable read
