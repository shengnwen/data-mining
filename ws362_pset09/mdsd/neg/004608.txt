I've owned the 1993 edition for many years but a recent roof leak ruined my copy so I ordered the new edition.  Big mistake: the contents are excellent but the fourth edition is printed on trashy paper that you can see right through, and the illustrations and beautiful photos in the 93 edition are ALL GONE.  Get the older edition for a lot less money and you'll have a much higher quality printing.  If you really want to cover the last couple decades, get some other book - maybe Robert's History of the 20th century.

The book is going back on Monday...
