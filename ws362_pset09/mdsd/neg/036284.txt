I've been doing business in China for more than 10 years.  I believe most readers would benefit from reading some other books ("China, Inc." and "Chinese Business Etiquette", old and revised, but still a great basic resource, and the HBR's "On Doing Business in China").  As I drag myself painfully through "China Streetsmart", I can't help to wonder if Mr. Chan decided to spin a piece of quickly put together stories hoping his last name would sell the book.
