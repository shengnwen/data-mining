This was a miserable translation, even when it was first published, and for far too many years it was the only one avaiable in English.  Now, however, there are far better choices.  The Wood-Nisbet version published by Cambridge is far superior, but I believe that mine (HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF RIGHT, Focus Press) is the best of the lot.  For some reasons, see either my review of the Wood-Nisbet edition, or Peter Kalkavage's review of mine, on its Amazon page
