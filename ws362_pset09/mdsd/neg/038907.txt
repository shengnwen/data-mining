	If you like Dee Henderson's book Danger in the Shadows, you will like the book The Negotiator. In the book Dave from Danger in the Shadows meets the O'Malley, a group of orphans or abandoned kids who adopted themselves into a family of seven, and begins a friendship with them. The first O'Malley that he meets is Kate; she is a negotiator who walks into any situation to make sure all of the hostages get out alive. She just so happens that she gets called out to negotiate at the same bank that Dave is getting held at. Between the two of them all of the hostages get out a live and they hit off a good friendship. 
	Then Kate starts to become a target, first to a stalker that just got out of jail and then to a bomber that blew up a plane with 214 people on it just after he told her he not to forget the past. Dave, an FBI agent, is the assigned to be Kate's watcher. When Kate's family gets to the wreck, they are as mad as she is and tell her that she is staying with Dave because his house was used as a Safe House for his sister when she was staying away from her kidnapper. Then on top of all of this, the suspect is her brother that was born one year after she was taken away from her parents and the youngest of the O'Malley's has cancer. This is a book of a group of adults who have been hardened by their past trying to find god's mercy and power in a time of despair.
	I liked almost everything part of this book because it was a mix of books that I like. The only part that I didn't like about it was that is some places it was dragged on a bit too long. 
	I would recremend this book to any body who likes novels of suspense and people over coming odds and ending up at the top.
