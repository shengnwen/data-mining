I wasn't that happy with the book. Seeing the personal post cards the Beatles sent to each other over the years seemed like a good concept. I guess it looked better on paper than reality. For one thing, there aren't many postcards.Two: They are just the average postcards anybody gets when someone travels, except more boring. Nothing more than "having fun, see you soon". That's about the whole lot of them. Each postcard has a one or two line Ringo quip about it. Sometimes they're interesting, mostly not. The only good thing about it is the fact that it was only $10.00 and some or all of the profits go to charity. Even a die hard Beatle fan won't find much to love about this book
