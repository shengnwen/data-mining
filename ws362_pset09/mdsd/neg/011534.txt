My book club read this novel. I'll admit it's well written; I couldn't have made it to the end if it had not been. However, it was impossible to relate to the crazy experiences the protagonists in this book had. I am a mature woman who found these two young men hopelessly dangerous. Almost every decision they made was senseless. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone over thirty
