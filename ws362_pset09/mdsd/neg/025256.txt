I bought this book before my first trip to Japan, almost 4 years ago now. At the time I had just begun to really learn the language and took it with me for reference. Unfortunately, even at that point I found little use in it, the vocabulary in my experience tended to be lacking. The fact the Japanese section is both in romanji and in alphabetical order made it very counter-intuitive to use so it was quickly thrown to the side and forgotten.

As other reviewers have stated, nothing can beat an electronic dictionary these days, however people still looking for a print-and-bound dictionary or a cheaper alternative to purchasing a $200-300 piece of equipment would do well to look elsewhere. This one comes across as outdated and anyone who can read kana and kanji will soon find it become a hindrance. Beginners in Japanese need to learn hiragana and katakana immediately, which puts them outside the limited scope of this dictionary, and more advanced learners will find it easier to cross-reference entries written in Japanese text or consult with a more specific kanji or vocabulary reference text
