Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.

The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.

The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.

Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.

I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype.
