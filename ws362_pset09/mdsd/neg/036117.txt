I am quite disappointed with this book, considering my pediatrician's office recommends it! The recipes are unhealthy -most using honey and canned foods. The chapter devoted to making baby's first foods is not informative or helpful. A better choice is Mommy Made, which includes a guide on when to introduce foods & how to prepare them. If you're looking for a nutritional-how-to, Feed Me is NOT the way to go
