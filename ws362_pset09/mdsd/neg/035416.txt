Executive summary: should you read this book? Answer, if you want to see a vivid imagination at work, yes. If you're looking for a sober, carefully-argued work, no.

Author Tony Blankley is clearly a US conservative of the deepest hue. This is thus a book written by a conservative for conservatives. It is also strong on patriotic heart-string tugging and worship of the US state religion, that is, America (which can do no wrong, which is eternally benevolent).

The thesis is that the West is menaced by radical Islam, which seeks the destruction of the Western way of life and its replacement by sharia law. To me, this is as far-fetched as the proverbial bucket of sugar from China. Mr Blankley makes some good points - there are indeed problems with Muslim immigrants in Europe, the proportion of radical Muslims is indeed rising and, as I write, the Deutsche Oper's production of Mozart's "Idomeneo" has been cancelled for fear of offending Muslim sympathies (for some reason it featured the severed heads of Mohammed, Jesus and Buddha). And there will certainly be more terrorist attacks by fanatical Muslims. But does this amount to a resurrection of the Caliphate that knocked on the gates of Vienna in the 17th century? No. But Mr. Blankley would have you believe that it could. 

In his opening chapter, Mr. Blankley paints a nightmare scenario of Muslim takeover and domination that reads like something from "Monty Python" and which, to my eyes, tears to shreds the author's credibility for everything that follows. And what follows is a bit like what the British memo to Tony Blair said about the US intentions in Iraq, that the US fitted the facts around an already-decided US course of action. Mr. Blankley does this with much loaded language and strong (and occasionally questionable) statements, and ends up by saying that the USA should declare war on radical Islam and utilise full war powers, such as internment. He clearly strongly disapproves of those lily-livered, multicultural, soft, godless Europeans (I don't know whether he is religious, but he is careful to play to his US audience by invoking Providence a number of times).

However, anyone from Northern Ireland or northern Spain could tell Mr. Blankley what the West faces - a larger version of the IRA or ETA, a relatively small number of terrorist fanatics with a larger number of people actively supporting or passively ignoring them. More security, better intelligence are clearly needed, as they were with the IRA or ETA. But the British and Spanish managed without going to extreme lengths of declaring war on terrorism in the style advocated by Mr. Blankley. These are complex problems requiring compromises and adjustments on all sides; the rapier, not the bludgeon, is needed.

At one point, Mr. Blankley seems to hit on the essence of the problem, but then steers away from it. This is a war of ideas. How exactly does one declare war on ideas? It is not possible to bomb and shoot people into your way of thinking. The Irish Republicans on the Falls in Belfast are still just as ardently Irish Republicans. 

The only way to combat an idea is with a better idea. And America has a better idea - democracy. However, no matter how much Americans wish it, US-style democracy is NOT the default condition of humankind; the mere displacement of a dictator or two will not make US-style democracy automatically flourish. Only by example can the USA make it appealing. If America lived up to the high ideals of its founders, not to mention the first Republican President (would Abe even recognise the present incumbent?) it would be unstoppable. Naturally, one will never please all the fanatics, who will insist on continuing to have both feet firmly planted in the air. But if the world could see an America, which gave a fair deal to ordinary Americans and minorities, in which the government wasn't beholden to religious fanatics and lubricated by corporate money and backscratching and in which it was even-handed in its foreign relations, most of that world would be impressed and want the same.  The world is ready for such an America. Problem is, America, having with the recent law changes essentially acquired its first dictator, with an apparent desire to arrest and torture whoever he wants, apparently isn't. Pity.

It seems to me that this book almost certainly has an ulterior motive. Although the dreadful word "Iraq" is rarely mentioned (and then only in approval of the US actions there), it seems to me that, having invaded Iraq on a totally falsified pretext and found no WMD there, some justification was needed to cover backsides that suddenly were looking very bare indeed. Answer: The Clash of Civilisations! This book may be an attempted justification of the mess into which the USA has got itself. By holding forth the thesis that the Clash of Civilisations is the real reason that George Bush invaded Iraq, the author seeks to transform him from bumbling incompetent to great visionary, just in time for the forthcoming elections. 

At one point, Mr. Blakely gets slightly carried away and calls President Bush "George the Bold". And this is quite appropriate. The previous "bold" leader in history was Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy in the Middle Ages. Charles's name in French is "Charles le T�m�raire", and "t�m�raire" is more accurately "rash" or "foolhardy". He led his duchy into a disastrous war with the Swiss Confederation and lost his duchy and his life. France then acquired Burgundy and has been drinking the proceeds ever since. "George the Rash"; bon, n'est-ce pas?
