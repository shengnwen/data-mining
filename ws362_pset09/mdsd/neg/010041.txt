OK, Mr. Koontz,

Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.

Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?

Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.

I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook
