I know Toni Morrison fans may not agree with me but "Love" is a real flop - at least in my opinion. The book was so boring that I could not get past the first 2 pages of the very first chapter. I couldn't get into the introduction either, so I decided to by-pass it. I read the same two pages over and over again for two days on my hour and a half commute home. It was so slow....and she had to explain every single detail about every single person or object. I couldn't take it. I'm going to give the book to one of my co-workers......she's going to attempt to read it. I'm really not trying to be mean or overly critical because I know that she's an excellent writer. I just wanted to express my view. And my view is to focus on another one of her books.
