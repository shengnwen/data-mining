I was very upset that this book was geared towards Christians.  Nowhere on the front or back cover did the book mention that the book would include quotes from the bible, tips for abstaining from sex before marriage and how to maintain a close relationship with God.  I am an atheist!  This is more than a little misleading...frankly, I was very offended that the authors would just assume that everyone who picks up a book about relationships subscribes to Christian beliefs.  For that reason, I'm only giving it one star.  Luckily, I got the book from a library, but if I had paid for it I'd be very unhappy.

That said, if a religious guide to dating is what you're looking for, you may like this book.  It does have some good suggestions to offer, and I like how each chapter had a summary list of important points.  This is great for a quick review of each chapter.
