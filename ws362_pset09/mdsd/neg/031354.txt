When I picked up this book at the yearly meeting of the denomination of which Waters and I both are members, I began reading his book immediately and with great interest. It is impossible to miss the fact that he has familiarized himself with much material. His quotations of the men he critiques are extensive. I was disappointed, however, with Waters' seeming inability to get beyond the surface semantics to the fundamental arguments. In critiquing the FV proponents from their writings and lectures, he consistently uses words that indicate that he thinks these men are "coming close" to a particular aberrant view. He will say things like "they don't deny this but they overemphasize this." Then, in his final analyses, he condemns them for being aberrant. His analyses are based upon exegetical assertion (of the Scriptures and the Westminister Standards), employ quite a bit of question begging, create false dilemmas, and don't account adequately for the qualifications and nuances given by the men in question (though he records many of those qualifications and nuances). Waters may win many people pre-disposed to being against these men, but by just a little closer scrutiny the reader will find that he employs poor argumentation
