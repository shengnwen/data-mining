Well I bought Kids Rock by Rachael Ray and although I thought I had a hit on my hands I was dead wrong. I have made some recipes for my kids, but they responded with the 3 bite test thats it nothing more. I keep racking my brain with them I have no idea what else to do, but this book wasn't a hit with them, and therefore I rated it 2 stars. Still on the search for something MY kids will like other than Nutella and Mortadella
