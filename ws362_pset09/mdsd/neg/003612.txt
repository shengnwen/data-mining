Just a warning that no nutritional breakdown of the recipes (e.g. calories, fat, fiber, carbohydrates) is provided.  This is a big miss considering the number of people that use this information to calculate Weight Watcher points or determine insulin units needed.  

The selection of recipes is good and geared to a more simple and speedy preparation.  So not a complete waste - just more effort if you need the nutritional guide
