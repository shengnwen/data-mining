so many things he misses, so much obvious stuff he includes, and so little detail on the meaning of some of the annotations end up making this book somewhat of a nuisance, breaking up the flow which makes the Wake enjoyable.  I still prefer Joseph Campbell's Skeleton Key to FW, though it admits that it does not try to catch every allusion.  I find that most of the things that I really do want to find out, where I hear some echo of something, he doesn't touch on, or doesn't touch on to my satisfaction.  Really, this project should be a collaboration online where people would add their comments to the possible meanings of different lines, because there are so many.  Each man comes at it with his own knowledge, interests and needs, and can't get everything.  So while this is useful for some, it's more of an impediment for me.  A tattered security blanket that trips you up while you walk, you feel like Linus from peanuts lugging out this big blue thing
