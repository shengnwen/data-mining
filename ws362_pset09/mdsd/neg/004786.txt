Reminiscent of essays written by bored school children, The Planets by Sobel is lacking in enthusiasm and excitement for its subject matter. The boring regurgitation of fact bogs down what might otherwise be an novel approach to astronomy integrating myth and science.  I highly recommend this book to those who have trouble sleeping at night, otherwise find an author who brings the wonders of the planets to life
