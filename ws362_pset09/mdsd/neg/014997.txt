I am not sure but I believe the part in the book about Pryor being influenced by Monty Python was written only AFTER Pryor died late last year. I have been everywhere on Google trying to find evidence of Pryor being influenced by Python and could find none. RichardPryor.com shows no evidence of this alleged influence. I believe the writers of this book just included that in to make Python sound more influential than it really was and to appeal to african-americans more too. I believe the book's statement on Mr. Pryor to be totally false! 

And to the poster named Spiney. I am not kidding at all when I say I believe the book is indeed taking bad advantage of a dead celebrity in a vain attempt to appeal to african-americans.
