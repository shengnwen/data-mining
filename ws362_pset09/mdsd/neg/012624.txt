   Nelson starts the book with a promising and fair essay.  How strange, then, that he has chosen a bunch of disappointed elitist profs to fill out the rest of the book.  The majority of the essays positively drip with disdain for all things Republican, and the authors work more to assure (fellow disappointed) readers that 2004 was but a fluke and not a harbinger of anything to come.   This is not a scholarly tome.  There are no daring interpretations of the 2004 results, and by daring I do not mean without basis or substance.  Thus, the book gets old fast.  I expected some deep thought to have gone into some of these essays, and with one or two exceptions, was disappointed.  I'm an independent who has voted for George  Bush and Ralph Nader in the last 5 years, and I despise the kind of biased, shallow thinking found throghout this book.  Actually, the book serves far better as an example than it does as explication: it is a classic piece of self-possessed, elitist, out-of-touch whining; exactly the sort of political preaching which drove millions to say "NO THANKS" to the Democratic party last year......If you must read this, stop after the first entry and you'll not have wasted your time
