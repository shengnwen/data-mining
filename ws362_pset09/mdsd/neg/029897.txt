Honestly, this is a book you don't need. Torts are not that difficult and this text is not the best aid for a student. While it comprehensive on the subject, you'd be better served to supplement your casebook with a guide like an Emanuel or Gilberts. Because Torts are not that complex, the brevity and structure of those two will probablely better serve you when it comes time for the final. Furthermore, the Emmanuel's has two additions and tries to match sections to your casebook. While in general it is a fine book, if I were a student, I would go another route
