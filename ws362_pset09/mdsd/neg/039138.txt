It is obvious that the authors are biased against the Disney corporation and wish to force their perspective on everyone else. The money I spent to purchase this book could have been better used elsewhere. I wish i could shred the book and send the pieces back to each author.  THE ONLY REASON IT RECIEVED ONE STAR IS THAT ZERO WAS NOT AN OPTION.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PURCHASING THIS PIECE OF TRASH
