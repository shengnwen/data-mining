As a licensed private investigator, college instructor of private investigation courses, and an experienced covert surveillance operative, I can personally tell you that most of the techniques described in this book are of little value to private sector investigators like myself.  The vast majority of techniques described assume that the "surveillance team" has an unlimited supply of resources and operatives (i.e. a law enforcement team). Anyone with even remote covert surveillance experience knows that this will seldom (more likely never) be the case.

Most private sector covert surveillance operatives (i.e. private investigators) work alone or in teams of two (when and only when the Client can afford it of course).  Therefore, the vast majority of the techniques covered in this book are of little use to most private investigators. There is some (emphasis added) good information in this book, but certainly not what one would expect based on the title.

If you are looking for a title that actually contains useful (emphasis added) surveillance techniques/procedures, I would highly recommend: "Covert Surveillance: The Manual of Surveillance Training" by Peter Jenkins (ISBN:  0953537803).  I have had the pleasure of reading this fine text, which I consider to be the only covert surveillance techniques/procedures book worth recommending.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to find a copy for purchase.
 
As always, check with your local library or bookstore to see if you can read/review this or any title before deciding to make a purchase.  This method has effectively allowed me to make the most of my investigative library budget.

I hope you found this review helpful. [...
