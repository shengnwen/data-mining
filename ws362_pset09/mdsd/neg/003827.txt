I first started with the a book entitled, Moving to Arizona, published in 1991, then picked up this title, Arizona in Your Future, published in 1998, and writted by the same duo. The two books are the same! Minimal, very minimal updates, same use of tiny, completely undetailed maps and very bland reading.  The &quot;Top 10&quot; reviewer who rated this book 5 stars obviously didn't read this book, just rated it. Please, make better use of your time and don't throw other readers off to heighten your standings as to the amount of books you review
