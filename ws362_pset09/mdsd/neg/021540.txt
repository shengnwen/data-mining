While Malamud is without doubt a very skilled writer, I gave up attempting to read this book approximately 1/3 of the way through it.  The atmosphere of the book was overwhelmingly dour and depressing: story after story of loneliness, poverty, bleakness, bitterness, struggle, alienation from family.  It leaves one ready to jump off a bridge somewhere
