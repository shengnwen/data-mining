We borrowed this book from the library because of the joy we find in reading "Where the Wild Things Are", and assume this book would have the same kind of childhood imagination, and also the fact that it received an award.  Yikes! If this is childhood imaginagtion, maybe the makers of horror films should use kids for inspiration.  This book made my son afraid that goblins would steal him away in the night, and that babies might be goblins.  The father is absentee, the mother distant, and the big sister has to care for her baby sister.  Goblins steal the baby away, and the big sister is able to retreive her through some drug-trip-like ritual.  Meanwhile, dad's away and mom's staring off into space in the garden.  
Don't read this to your toddler/preschooler/school-age/tween/teen-age kids!!
