Anyone who gives this book more than two stars is insane.

From beginning to end, this book is full of nothing but internal monologue, stale, cliched dialogue, and debate.  I'd gladly quote a few examples, but my copy of the book is back at the library where it belongs.

The only reason I refrain from giving it one star, is that it did keep me interested till the end.  I wanted to know who stole the blue sapphire.  But it was a long, painful slog
