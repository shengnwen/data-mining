No wonder this book has not been translated into Spanish. It would be an absolute fiasco. "The Story of Spain" was so obviously designed to be a good seller among American tourists, that it would make an excellent Hollywood movie -such is the distortion of history! 

The author did very little research or none at all, and never submitted the manuscript to the scrutiny of a Spaniard scholar. To prove what I am saying I need only to state that he committed the two most capital of the sins: first, to be wrong about Spain's Saint Patron; and second, to mix up the most precious symbol of hispanidad. 

In page 44 you can read: "Popular legend says that Saint James the Elder (Santiago), believed to be half-brother  of Jesus, brought Christianity to the peninsula around AD 40." 

Some confusion has arisen over the identity of James, the Lord's brother, who was not one of the original twelve apostles, and St. James, son of Alpheus, also known as James the Less. Neither of them is Spain's Patron Saint. In about AD 44 King Herod Agrippa I beheaded the Apostle St. James, James the Great, son of Zebedee and St. John's the Evangelist's brother. This is the one we venerate. Every Spanish man, every Spanish woman, knows the difference. Ask them.

As for the symbol of hispanidad, there is one Virgin of Guadalupe whose statue lays in a monastery near Caceres, Spain. There is another Virgin of Guadalupe, with no relation whatsoever to the first one, whose picture was, according to tradition, miraculously imprinted on an Indian's cape, that of san Juan Diego. This picture (not a statue) can be seen at a Basilica in Mexico City. The latter was declared "Queen of the Americas" by the Catholic Church. Most Latin Americans don't even know that the first one exists, let alone that She is "the symbol of hispanidad".
