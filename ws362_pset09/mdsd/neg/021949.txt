I dare any Christian to read 
The Jesus Mysteries: Was the "Original Jesus" a Pagan God?
by Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy

and look at the bible the same way....go ahead.
Don't let your fellow believers scare you with talk of going to Hell by questioning the bible. Do you really believe that God would hurt you for examining the world that he created
