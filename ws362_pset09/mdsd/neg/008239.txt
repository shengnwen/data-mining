I started to read this book, but then I thought I'd check Amazon and I saw where it was selling for 29 cents.  That convinced me that here was another boob writing about things he didn't know anything about, so I didn't finish reading it.  Now I see that O'Reilly's on some sort of tear up in Vermont about some Judge or something.....boy he can't have much to do....but then I guess he has to feed his ego...
