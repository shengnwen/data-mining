Like what was stated earlier, I am an experienced windows system administrator w/ MCP status and this book leaves out some details. I like sybex but this one looks like it might have been rushed. I dont particularly care for the sybex CD's also. The questions were to easy for the actual Microsoft exams. Plus the chapter about optimizing Server 2003 left out some noticable details in how to optimize the page file. Its good for beginners but if you really want to know more and better prepare for this exam, read another book
