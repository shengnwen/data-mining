I spent much of one grad school course being assailed by Barker's prognostications, which are essentially the entire body of Hegel's dialectical philosophy distilled to the lowest common denominator (Hegelian Cliff Notes?).

Once upon a time, western civlization had intellectuals, and now we have wonks.  Once upon a time, members of the business community were actually challenged to think, and now they are required to memorize trite management babble like "paradigm shift".

As a side note, one of the most incompetent executives I've ever met had, as a stock answer to any question that required contemplative thought, "that's a paradigm shift!".

Unfortunately for office brown nosers enchanted with Barker, other guru flavors-of-the-month have long since supplanted his musings, so you aren't likely to score any points
