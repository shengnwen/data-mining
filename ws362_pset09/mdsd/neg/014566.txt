Contains quite a few made up things that would make good analogies, but are presented as facts. Many of these claims aren't sepcifically attributed to any source, although the book has a "further reading" list of about 50 books. The author goes so far as to try to explain in detail how all these things work. For example, the soul is explained to be residing in a cavity near the heart. It explains that the soul passes messages back and forth from the brain via the central nervous system. This essentially means that anyone paralyzed from the neck down has no soul, according to the author. Overall, I found some useful information in the book, though most of it wasn't and it one needs to wade through "facts" to find what's actually useful
