It is alright to present an alternative point of view, but it is not right to attack other recovery programs, especially those with a proven track record. I suspect Mr. Trimpey has an axe to grind or is just hostile to the spiritual underpinnings of 12-Step programs.The truth is that one size does not fit all. Some methodswork for some people and other methods work for others. Read this book and try this method. If it does not work try another one. They are all good in their own way. But Mr. Trimpey: If one person, who cannot be helped by your method, ignores other options because of your attack on AA, you should be ashamed of yourself
