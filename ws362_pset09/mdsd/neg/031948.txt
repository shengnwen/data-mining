I love and admire sandy weill.i purchased this book to learn more about the man and his deal making prowess.although this book was well research,its presentation was what turned me off.i have never read a book so disjointed and dull.it doesnt follow the conventional chronological sequence that most biographies does but skips back and forth from one event to another i.e 60's-to-the-80's-to-the-70's-to 60's again...this goes on and on and on.this can be very very very frustrating.Also i dont think the authors did a good job in capturing the readers since the paragraphs come and go in that fasion throughout the entire book!

All who follow sandy weill's career knows his excellent ex-protege, jamie dimon.I would loved to learn more on Mr Dimon (curently President and COO of J.P Morgan Chase & Co) and i hope there will be a book on him in the future.

All in all, sandy weill is one hell of a guy who has done tremendous things in the financial sector.but if you really want to read a book which is more entertaining (or way better) than this book,then you should read "Tearing Down the Walls:How Sandy Weill fought his way to the top of the financial world...and then nearly lost it all" by Monica Langley.The book by monica langley is way way better and enjoyable.You'll also learn more about Jamie Dimon!!

In conclusion,dont buy this book but the one by Monica Langley....
