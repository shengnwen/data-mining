This is not a book, it's a pamphlet containing a few hundred random Seinfeld trivia questions followed by a few hundred answers.  My first reaction was to the cover, which features a sillhouette of Jerry and his  co-stars.  Talk about  &quot;unofficial&quot;, the author couldn't even use  Jerry's face on the cover?  Anyway, the book might have been passable if  the questions had been arranged in some sort of logical order, either by  subject or chronology, and enough questions were included to make the book  worth $8.  As it was published, it's very difficult to read and enjoy.   NOTE:  Do not attempt to use this book as the &quot;final word&quot; on any  Seinfeld related discussion, as there are various mistakes strewn  throughout the book.  Main offender?  Q: What is Jerry's address? A: 129  East 81st. St.  Now, any fan worth his Snapple knows Jerry lives on West  81st St.  The bottom line is this.  Spend a few minutes with a search  engine and the words &quot;Seinfeld trivia&quot; and you can do much better  for free on the Internet than you can with this book
