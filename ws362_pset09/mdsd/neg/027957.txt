I expected fast and flavorful recipes that might fit into a low processed carbs, high protein diet.  For one reason or another, none of these recipes appeal to me.  Each one had a different reason I wouldn't make it:  more meat per serving than I like, large amounts of cheese, too many calories or too much saturated fat.  (I've never said I wasn't picky.)  If the Atkin's diet works for you this book might be just the ticket.  I might try another Rachael Ray cookbook but I would read it before buying.
