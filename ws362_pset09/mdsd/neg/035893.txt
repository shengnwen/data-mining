You can't judge a book by it's cover! That's for sure! When I saw the Teddy Bear Square on the COVER of this book, I decided to buy it. Well, I went all through the book, page by page and it is not there. That is fraud as far as I'm concerned. 
I thought perhaps there was a missing page, but NO! No missing page, just no Teddy Bear Square. I think this is very deceptive.
How can I trust the rest of this book???
