I had to read this book for a class.  So I read the book from beginning to end and I am surprised at the amount of critical acclaim it has received.  The author relies heavily on shock tactics to gather your attention, which is not only insulting to the reader but the tactic is also completely disgusting (think maggot farms and lots of references to bowel movements).  This makes entire chapters of the book completely unnecessary, making the reader wonder...why is this even important; why should I care?  "Geek Love" is completely predictable and the characters, particularly Arty, are irritating at best.  A redeeming factor to the book is that there are moments when the descriptions of the terrain or the family interactions are quite poetic.  Dunn, at times, has a unique style of describing events and landscapes.  But this is usually disrupted by a yet another shock tactic, which just ruined the novel for me.  I understand why some people like it so much, but why on earth is this book a National Book Award Finalist?  The author's style of writing reminds me heavily of Chuck Palahniuk or Irvine Welsh.  So if you like these two authors, then "Geek Love" is the book for you.  If not, then avoid this book if possible
