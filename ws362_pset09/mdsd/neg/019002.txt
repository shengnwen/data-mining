This book was a bit of a disappointment, the text is informative, but the poor black and white images are really quite awful, and not every state capitol comes with an image, which is very odd in a book of this kind..the book feels like a ph.d disertation that was bound into a book, the physical book is quite second rate in quality, though the text is scholarly..could have, should have been better...seriously over priced
