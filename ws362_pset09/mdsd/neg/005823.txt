I bought this book with the camera hoping to learn something that I would not be able to figure out effortlessly on my own using manual or pressing buttons. I wish I saved the money. Book has basic instructions from long-time user. No specific insights of the professional. Photos that are illustrating the book are plain and boring. No huge mistakes in light or composition, just ordinary objects in uninspired setting. 
This is my first SLR, I was using digital for 3 years before.
Rebel XT is such an easy camera to use, you do not need this book to take pictures that you will love
