This is a really thin book, and for the price, the production value is terrible. The graphic design, and poor layout, takes a lot away from the information of the book. Page after page, you wonder if this recent publication was from the 1980s.

The information was light, and just skimmed over details. There was WAY too much emphasis on Analog. There are other search softwares out there. The case studies were nice, but no real insight was given.

Overall - it's an overpriced fluff book. Could be summaried in 5 pages
