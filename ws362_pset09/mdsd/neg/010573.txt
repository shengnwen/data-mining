The story of Inanna can only be described as wierd. Yes, we all know that the story is from the Middle East and comes from a time when literature was completely different from how it is today. Although it was fun to sing the songs of the characters within a group in a high school class, the story didn't strike me as a personal favorite. I believe that it is a story not particulary written for high school students as we sometimes get lost in the humorous hints of sexuality and the numerous accounts of repetition. However, the story does contain good story line about a character known as Inanna who is the goddess of love. It enlightens certain decisions that she must make in her journey that will make her a woman. From Enki, her father, giving her all of his "me" because he was so drunk to Inanna's journey in the underworld, the story is rather entertaining if you are attentive.

From my experience of the book, its not a story that I would pull out of a bookshelf and just begin to read. When laid in front of me as an example of a different writing style from the past, I took it what it was and made the most of it.
