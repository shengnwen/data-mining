While reading this I realized that Blood Games holds the dubious distinction of being the worst book I have ever read. Forget for a moment that it is not scary and is in fact BORING-Laymon wrote this book as if from the point of view of a hormonal 13 year- old boy in the 1950s who wants to be a writer when he grows up but doesn't know yet that he has no talent! These grown women (college graduates) do and say things I've never seen or heard any other woman do. They talk like men (or perhaps 13 year old boys) and use language I haven't heard in atleast 25 years. I was bored to tears by all the talk about their bare body parts (no-these were not sexual situations.) No, women do not frequently hang out naked together for no reason, No, we do not walk naked in the woods because it's TOO HOT to wear a tank top, No, I did not finish this book and No I will not try another Laymon
