This 1998 book examining the war between Russia and its breakaway republic Chechnya is a product of great expertise and tremendous thoroughness.  The war is examined from all angles in great detail.  Furthermore, author Anatol Lieven has an affecting writing style when he relates his personal experiences among the Chechens.  But things are still unsettled in the former Soviet Union, and events have overtaken this book.  New wars have broken out in ways and in places that call Lieven's theories (which were based on the best information available at the time) into question.

For the person who needs to know the current zeitgeist in the former Soviet republics, this book is too dated to be of much use; while for those who are interested in the Russia/Chechnya war as a historical subject are going to have to wait until the region settles before a definitive account can be written.  This is a good book from a thoughtful, talented, and well-informed author; but the lapse of time has rendered it unfit for its purpose
