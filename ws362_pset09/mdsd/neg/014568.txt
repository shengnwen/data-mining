Another bunch of blather, in my opinion.
The biggest stock market crash in history may be
coming. IS probably coming, even. But WHEN, Mr.
Kiyosaki, WHEN? In 2016? It might, but you don't know,
the chairman of the fed doesn't know, the President
doesn't know, no one does. You're guessing. All your books
say you're a money expert, based on a questionable
autobiography, anecdotes, and a gullible public. I don't
think Mr. Kiyosaki gives very good advice. I'd prefer
Andrew Tobias, Ben Stein, or God help me, Suze Orman.
Sorry
