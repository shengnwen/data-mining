In my opinion I don't suggest this book to kids that are younger that 13 years old because of the language it has and how it tells you that drugs are the only thing that could make you feel better. As well as, how the teenagers made a bad choices in their life. When I finished the book, I felt like drugs is the only thing I need now, which I know is wrong and I'm not even going to take any, but my point is that someone who'll probably finish the book might think that and do it. 
This book is basically about two young teenagers Gemma and Tar who decided to run away from home and go to Bristol. Where they met new friends and started taking drugs and making bad choices, but then they started to realize of what they were doing is wrong, but they cannot stop taking drugs, and so this story unfolds of how Gemma and Tar find their way back home, through the path of where some of their friends had died or even went to the hospital and jails for the rest of their lives, but Gemma and Tar work together to make it safe and sound.
