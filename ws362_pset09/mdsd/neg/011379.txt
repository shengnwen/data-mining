I heard the author on NPR and thought the book sounded promising. I expected to discover a wonderful family experience of four people locked for days in a car; I really wanted to know these people. I expected an enjoyable trip. Instead, Mr. Sullivan gave me a synopsis of every book he'd read about Lewis and Clark, and more trivia than I wanted to know. This author even turned a brother/sister backseat conversation about Barbie into a mindboggling trivia fact sheet. Mr. Sullivan, I wanted to know you and your family; instead, I'm afraid I learned only about you. Frankly, on a road trip, you're a bore
