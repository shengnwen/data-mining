I don't think I've ever read a book as blind to its subject matter as &quot;Race-ing Toward A White Future&quot;.  Bernardi misinterprets many of the episodes, taking certain scenes and characters way out of context, and  ignores the vast majority of scripts that would counteract his hyper-PC  argument.  I found myself disagreeing with him in almost every paragraph.   For example, Bernardi seems to think that every use of the color black in  Star Trek and other Sci-Fi shows and movies is an automatically racist  gesture (!); this is a paranoid, ignorant and ridiculous assumption. And  just when it seems like he's about to make a valid point about a particular  episode or scene, he takes it too far by making grandiose statements which  have no basis in reality.  AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS.  It is poorly  written, narrowminded in focus and misinterpretative of Star Trek's  position on race
