I came to Kellerman after dabbling in Stephen White's Alex Gregory novels, a series about which I'd developed rather mixed feelings. In order to get some perspective I decided to go back to one of Dr. Gregory's role models, with the book that started the Alex Delaware franchise.

In the beginning, When the Bough Breaks was a revelation. Flawlessly written, with perfect pacing and a slowly building sense of menace, this book is required reading for any fan of the genre. However, problems develop about 2/3 of the way in.

Things took a turn for the worse when Detective Milo Sturgis dropped out of the action. At first I didn't notice he was gone because the pace was still holding up very well. In hindsight, this awkward handling of a major character is indicative of Kellerman's unbalanced approach. My first real problem came with the overlong episode at Jedson College, where the plot relies on dense passages of expository prose. This seemed like an immature writer's mistake, and it was odd coming after so many pages of confident buildup.

Looking back on it now, I wonder if Kellerman is one of those writers who is better at setting the stage than he is at leading the reader to a conclusion. My satisfaction rapidly evaporated as the story reached its climax. What started as a haunting meditation on loss and evil, in the manner of Stephen White's Private Practices, became overblown, with too many plot elements and a dramatic showdown that could have been lifted right from the latest Hollywood action movie.

My final opinion is that for all of his flaws--the smugness, the lapses into banality--Stephen White displays a craftsman's mastery of the mystery thriller, a mastery that strangely eludes Kellerman. Two stars
