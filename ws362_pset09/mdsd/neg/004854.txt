If you are interested in version 2.0 of hibernate, this book works well. If you, however, are interested in learning hibernate 3.0, you will struggle to get anything to work.

Examples:
1. code/ddl generation from mapping xml doesn't work without serious adjustment
2. the session.find command no longer exists (page 48)
3. session.delete(HQL) no longer exists (page 51)

For someone who is trying to learn hibernate, this manual has caused more headaches than it has solved
