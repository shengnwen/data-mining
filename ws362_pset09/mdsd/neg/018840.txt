If you are looking for a book that gives meanings behind the names don't buy this book.  It only gives the author's opinion on the name or a list of famous people who share the name.  I also find that is does not have a good selection of names.  For example, it lists the name Torquil(which I have never heard of) but does not have the name Travis, and the book even mentions the name Travis in an opinion on another name.  I find it opinionated and poorly written
