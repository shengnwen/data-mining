If you took a White-bread Christian and plunked them down in the middle of the Goth Club scene--well that is the jist of this book. The author has little understanding of the Gothic Subculture, much less the diverse Vampire culture, and their deeper connotations in modern society.

She is laughable at times, misguided completely at other times, and sadly mistaken when she tries to explain the fasciantion of/for the vampire.

Anyone who has a toe in the Gothic underworld will wince at her naive observations and chuckle when she classifies Vampire: the Masquerade Role Players as potential mental cases. 

In the 1970's and 80's when everyone was bashing D&D as 'The Great Evil to the Minds of Our Youth' claiming that roleplaying caused mental problems in youths. These fanatics are the same target audience this book is trying to reach. Basically it states "Vampires are somewhat real...and your kids will be warped by them." Whoever them is, because she bounces from roleplayers, to teen killers, to the Goth NightClub scene. And in her research she never uncovers the reason as to the disappearence of the journalist she is seeking.
