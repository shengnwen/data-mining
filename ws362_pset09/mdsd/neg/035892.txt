I agree with the earlier reviewer, as far as mean people and animal cruelty go.  I could hardly finish the book myself, not only because of the animal cruelty and abuse but also the author's total indifference to it.  I don't particularly care to read about people abusing and killing animals (killing a mother cow because she wants to keep her calf, and shooting 13 puppies because "they are ugly"), and basically that is what a lot of this book is about.  Not a very good or interesting read, author is whiney and self-absorbed - don't waste your time with this garbage
