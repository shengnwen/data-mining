I bought this book after hearing Randy Cohen on NPR. In extremely small doses, he is sometimes amusing as he addresses topics that made me think. However in book form his "style" translates into simply being annoying. The author may think he is being funny in how he tries to insert his own political views (whether it has anything to do with the topic at hand or not), but I don't. Save your money and just listen to him on NPR
