I found the book to be a waste of time, energy, ink, and trees. It is nothing more then common sense re-emphasized. It gives a little bit of understanding the basic personality types, but does not give one the ability to "speed read". It basically says stuff like 'if a person is shy and doesnt socialize well, they are an introvert', well duhhh. DO NOT waste your money on piece-o-crap book. It is useless
