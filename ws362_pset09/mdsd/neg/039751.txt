If you wanted to make up a story of Ronald Reagon being as close to Jesus as possible, and needed to see an example of how, then I think this might be the book for you. The author, an indicted man himself, writes how he believed One Shot Ronny was incapable of telling even the smallest lie. The author's disclaimer, that the Gipper was a completly self-made man, provided much amusement as I read this deification from his former Media Strategist. But hey there's a sucker born every minute and they do need something to read
