As mentioned in my review of the same authors &quot;Thrill of the Grill&quot; book, I was misleading into buying this book. This book was touted, along with the first book, as being &quot;the two best books  written on BBQ&quot;. Being a BBQ man, I decided to order both books. This  book is even more feable then the first book when it comes to BBQ. The only  BBQ recipe I remember is BBQ duck or something odd. There is a section on  boyscout/hobo dinners cooked in aluminum foil, which is interesting for the  fact that its never talked about in cookbooks. Maybe because most authors  wont bother to write about cooking methods as simple as wrapping piece of  meat and cut up vegetables in aluminum foil and throwing them in a  campfire. Whats next, recipies on microwaving different kinds of frozen  burritos? Like the original, this is strictly about exotic and weird  carribean grillings, which most american BBQers or grillers wont care much  for. However, either in this book or the first, I found a great recipe on  grilled vegetable soup. So, I guess it does have a redeeming quality to it.   But one good recipe does not make a good cookbook
