this book just reifies the old boy/girl dichotomy.  we have to move on from finger pointing to some real issues.  are we really to believe that boys are being harmed by feminism? poor things...  is there really anything inherent in being a boy or girl.  We know that there is not, so how can people still be making these passe and inflamatory arguments.  Give me a break.
