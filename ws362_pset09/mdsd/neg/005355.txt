This small book (a bit expensive at 25 bucks) has some interesting things to say about location and economic activity (though I wished there would have been more on the way of examples). It is surprising, though, that Krugman never mentions one reason why labor mobility it's not (and, in all probability, will never be) as high in the European Union as it is in the United States: the fact that European workers speak different languages (OK, many speak english, but many don't, and one almost surely is bound to be less good working in a second language than in a native one)
