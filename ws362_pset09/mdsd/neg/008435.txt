I was very disappointed in this book.  Other than the "Preparing for Death" chapter, there was nothing new and I've seen organization much better addressed in other books.  The author seems to concentrate on office work - well, I've done office work for 40 years and she didn't tell me anything I didn't know.  Maybe it would be good for absolute beginners, but anyone who has been around a few years already knows the tricks of opening and sorting mail, filing, etc.  I didn't see anything special about her advice, especially with all those glowing references included with the book
