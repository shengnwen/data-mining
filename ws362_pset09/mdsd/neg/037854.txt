Price's rant against white racism (brought on by Kenneth Hagin, Jr.'s silly comments on "mixed marriages") has revealed his own bigotry.  While watching his weekly TV program, I saw how Price lambasted the white members of his church as guilty collaborators of America's treatment of blacks.  This is the same thing as blaming Japanese-Americans for the attack on Pearl Harbor. If the white members of Price's church were bigots, then why were they attending in the first place?  The following week's broadcast showed Price chastising his black attendees for harassing white attenders as they left services the week prior!  Price continued his tantrums for many weeks--which now constitutes this book.  This whole episode demonstrates how Hagin and Price are more alike than different.  Ignore the book as you should these two undisciplined, self-righteous teachers
