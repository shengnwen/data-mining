The book offers no rigor in any sense and the author seems to have simply copied a large number of formulas from a real probability book. Explanations are sparse and incoherent with vague references to "important applications" with no sense of the abstract concept and virtually no insight into any of the information presented; as another reviewer wrote it is quite dry, I can't see Ben Stein narrating it, but I can picture the author sitting at his keyboard haphazardly plunking in text from other 'sources' all the while wondering what it means.

Skip this and get something with more substance, Peebles offers nothing more than you could find on wikipedia, perhaps less
