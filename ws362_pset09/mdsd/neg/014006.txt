This book is actually good for the beginners. This book clearly shows where the major and the minor lines are and also the exact location of the mounts. But if you are looking for a book which will help you become an accurate palm reader, then this book is not for you. I noticed that many things written in this book are not true and unscientific. People who bought this book will realize this once they studied their palms and that of others. I recommend "The Benham Book of Palmistry" for serious students
