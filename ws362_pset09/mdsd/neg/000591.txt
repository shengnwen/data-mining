This book was...interesting. I didn't really think this was a great book, but it's an easy read. Take a day or less to read it. The book itself didn't really strike me as a good. I think this story is more for kids from kindergarten to around 3rd grade [at most]. I got bored with it quickly [I mean, I don't see why people would want to read about ther adventures of a stick with an nut head!]. This is just my opinion though
