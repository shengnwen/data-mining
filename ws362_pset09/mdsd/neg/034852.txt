The material quickly goes astray claiming that "the primary path to greatness in the social sectors is not to be become more like a business."  Collins manages that conclusion through a non-sequitor - stating that basics such as personnel selection, demanding results, etc. don't count "because poor companies don't do those either."

Regardless, while Collins does identify the NYPD as an example of a well-run social-sector organization, his coverage is less than superficial.  Similarly, while Collins admits that social sectors often have a problem getting rid of unsatisfactory performers, he doesn't seem to appreciate how important that is.

American public education and healthcare are the two biggest social sectors, and both perform poorly while costing more/client than that of any other nation.  Public education costs have escalated far faster than the CPI in general (while pupil achievement and dropout rates have stagnated), and healthcare costs rise faster than most anything else - despite repeated evidence that basic treatment steps are frequently omitted or performed poorly, millions lack healthcare access, and Americans' outcomes lag those of a number of nations.  

Part of the problem is that both sectors are heavily funded by third-parties (thus appearing "free" to users); another is the lack of good outcome measures; a third is that neither sector strongly links provider success with pupil/patient outcomes - in fact, both sectors generally achieve more income the worse their clients' outcomes.

My "Bottom-Line:"  The two largest American social sector components need enormous improvement; this is best accomplished through providing incentives for them to act more like businesses - Collins' point of view notwithstanding
