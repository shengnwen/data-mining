Ms. Acocella was not happy that I took strong issue with her book; rather than address the substance of my remarks concerning her failure to present a balanced and informed perspective, she decided to disqualify my comments  by blaming them on my alleged embarrassment about ISSD. Sorry, I'm not  embarrassed; her remarks constitute a form of mind-reading based on what  she would LIKE me to say. My words speak for themselves without needing Ms.  Acocella to invent motivations for them
