I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's mysteries and found this one a huge disappointment. I found it almost totally lacking in the kind of tension and suspense that made her other books page turners.  In fact i twice skipped 50 pages just to "get on with it."  I was curious who the real killer was but that question was raised at the beginning and resolved at the end with very little in between
