Dr. Amen offers some interesting new ideas on the etiology of treatment of emotional disorders but his perspective is rather imbalanced in favor of the medical model of psychiatry. He seems to suggest that "chanding your brain" is rather simple and non-invasive, but then much of his treatment involves taking numerous medications. He lacks both an understanding of developmental and family systems theory.

Regarding family therapy, he claims that their was no obvious mental illness in his nephew's family to explain his nephew's difficulties, but then later in the book he discusses that some of his family members (including himself if I remember difficulty) had rather significant emotional difficulties. In summary, he presents a rather linear, simplistic understanding of psychological functioning
