This book purports to change our view of the revolution by exposing things that no one ever knew.  However in general in 95% of all American public schools students are today taught that Paul Revere didn't do his ride, that Washington was a brutal slave owner in it for money, and that Jefferson was a hypocrite.  Every American revolutionary is described as greedy and wrong in their cause, every ideal is either hypocrisy or not true.  In general the line of teaching and thinking today is that the American revolution and the basis of the constitution and American values is all evil and bad and based on ulterior motives.  

This book is just continuing this anti-American theme of revising American history.  However this book pretends it is a lonely voice in the dark, but in general most of us already know what is being said her.  Most people are aware that the Native Americans joined the British side and were brutalized at wars end.  Most are aware that their were extremes and their was a racial aspect to the war and a class aspect and that it degenerated into a civil war so much so that Ben Franklins son joined the English.  Who is not aware of these things.  There is little new information here, accept perhaps a little bit more time spent explaining how perhaps it would have been better had American continued to be occupied by the British government and imperial Britain continued to tax Americans without representation and continue to force the church of England down every American throat and discriminate against Jews and other minorities.  American revolutionaries had many qualities to be admired, in some ways they were more progressive then politics today, their ideals were more utopian then ours, in the end American revolutionaries were people to be admired not spit upon the way this book does.
