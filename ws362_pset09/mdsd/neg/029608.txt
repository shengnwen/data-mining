This book should be titled "Perversity, Gossip, and Women's Issues in the Late Medieval Period."  It has nothing to do to with covert operations.  Perhaps it is the only way the author could sell the book.  Imagine spending $50 and expecting a serious discourse on medieval espionage, sabotage, spies, and assassins and receiving instead some feminist diatribe about gossip, sodomy, and other perversions.  Unbelievable waste
