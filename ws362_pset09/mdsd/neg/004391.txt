Since I don't normally write reviews, I'll not try to make this clever.  I was completely disappointed in this latest attempt from Vince Flynn.  Though I love the character of Mitch Rapp, in this novel he read like a cardboard cut-out of the Mitch Rapp in all previous books.  As I read, I tried to analyze what was going on: "Well, he just been through a big loss, very traumatic...Flynn is trying to show the audience that Mitch has been profoundly altered by the experience.  Flynn will deal with this head on at some point in the novel".  He never does.  The whole interaction between Kennedy and Rapp at the end of the book feels like it was written by an 7th grader - its out of character and unbelievable for two seasoned intelligence professionals, completely without subtlety.  I've now come to the conclusion that, as a writer, Flynn has lost the hunger (i.e. is too full of himself, now that he's "made it" and has friends in high places).  My husband is a writer, I know the difference between when he's producing junk and when he's in the creative zone, writer coming together with words, not satisied until he's melded creative energy to insight, to produce art.   It appears that Flynn hurried threw this together -- a great disappointment to his fans who have followed Mitch since Term Limits and connected with his ability to read a situation, act decisively and remain in control, objectives intact.  I've already sold this book (though I won't part with the others) and I'll be more careful before I buy Flynn's next offering. My advice to Vince: Remember why you started writing (I'll bet it wasn't to produce books of mediocity).
