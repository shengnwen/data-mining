I think this book may work for those who are really against letting their babies cry, but I have to say, if you are truly sleep deprived, trying to remember all of the things you're supposed to do at 2 am (and 3 am, 4 am, etc.) is nearly impossible. When I would wake up in the wee hours with my son, I couldn't remember all of the methods she described, and it wasn't like I could read the book right then! If you are really committed to this type of method, I would think it would work pretty well, but in my completely exhausted state, trying to remember several different steps to help my baby back to sleep made me more frustrated
