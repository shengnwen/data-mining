Well, when a dust-jacket calls your book the "literary love child of Stephen King and Annie Proulx" I guess that's already throwing you under the bus but seriously, this book was a MAJOR let down.  I had to force myself through the pages all the way to the last one where most books get the reader trucking right along.  Not this one.  The last 40 pages were just as hard to read as the first 40 pages only they were less believable even for a fiction novel.  I just love the way the Navy has the wireless headsets with a seemingly endless range but had NO technology to notify the community of the evacuation except for a few "Able Seamen" going door to door in a jeep . . . or a helicopter touching down in the middle of the street to rescue the one of the worst characters or the entire story, Miss Laracy.  Tommy Quilty was unbelievable as was Lieutenant Commander French.  This book had so much potential to be excellent and instead it was horrible.  So much emphasis on all the fish spewing weird things from their mouths yet the outcome of the entire book had nothing to do with fish but with the souls of dead fishermen?  HORRIBLE.  Save your money--better yet, save your time and don't read this book
