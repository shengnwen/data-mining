After reading all the good reviews on this book I decided it must be worth reading.  While I agree that there are alot of problems with watching television the arguements he gave were insane.  Half of the book didn't appear to have anything to do with television.  He blames things such as people commiting crimes and mental health problems to watching television.  He also said something about people substituting telelvision light for real, natural light.  He also talks about evolution and, as a christian, I don't buy into that and don't want to read a book that teaches that as a fact.  It's definately a book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone
