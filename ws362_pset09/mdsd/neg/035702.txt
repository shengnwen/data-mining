This novel was very frustrating for me because I just could not connect with the main character, Sam.  I found him attention starved and annoying.  Although the author did an excellent job at portraying the character of Sam, I have a hard time getting engaged in a novel if I can't connect to the characters.

Also, if you are looking for a happy, complete novel I would not recommend this one.  It will leave you lost and dissatisfied
