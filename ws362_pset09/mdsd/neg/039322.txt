I have to admit I'm disappointed in this title.  I was hoping to get acquainted with the more complex capabilities of this software, but the book doesn't go any further than the free download help files from Nero.

The Nero Vision (DVD video burning) material amounts to a little over a dozen pages, with most of the space taken up with screen shots - not really that useful, or, at least, not worth laying out the money for a book.  Even the part of "trimming" a video file was wrong based on what I found by trial and error using the real product.

If I had it to do over, I'd save my money and pass on this title.
