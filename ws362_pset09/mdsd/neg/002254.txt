It's a textbook for a self-sustaining farm, not for a backyard gardener.  I don't care how many seeds I will get from my plants, or how many pounds my yield will be, compared to the national average.  I bought this based on one review that stated I would be provided charts on how closely to plant my vegetables to maximize my 10'x3' garden spot.  And the title, by the way--but his plots are way bigger than mine. I have searched, I have found no such information.  If I wanted to know how many tomato plants I could fit in a 10'x10' plot, or how many types of cabbage family plants should be grown together--man, he loves cabbage this might be useful. But I don't want to grow only tomatoes and calculate my profit margin.  I also found the constant GROW BIOINTENSIVE extremely annoying.  How can you copyright growing methods, anyway?  
I rent.  I cannot renovate my garden or lawn, nor can I take it with me.  I fully support the message and the use of organics only--but I am limited by my circumstances, and am grateful to have a real garden at all.  Not to mention, I can't yet build a compost pile.
The useful information was the companion plants and companion animals chapter--however, I already own Carrots Love Tomatoes, and found it redundant.  
I wish I had read down to some of the other reviews, past the first three.  I hope someone reads this and saves $20.  It's on to the Square foot gardening, unless someone has a better idea.  I just want to know how closely to plant my squash to my tomatoes
