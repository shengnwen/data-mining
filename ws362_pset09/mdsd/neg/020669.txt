But if anyone asked me what these stories were about I would not be able to tell them. I remember the titles and some of the details but not the stories. Way over my head. And I am a pretty well-read person so it's not that I'm just not a reader. I wouldn't recommend this really highly because her novels are so much better. Try The King's General, The House on the Strand
