Ordered the book, and it had not even shipped 2 months later.  When ordering a book, you expect to receive it within a decent amount of time.  This says it will ship in 4-6 weeks, but even that didn't happen.  Don't order this book, find one that will actually ship to you.  I ended up cancelling my order due to this rediculous wait time.
