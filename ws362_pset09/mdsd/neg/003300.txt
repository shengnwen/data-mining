You know how some books create characters and a world you love so much, you try to read slower because you don't want the book to end?  This is not one of those books.  I'm a fairly fast reader so I always finish any book I start.  I have never regretted this policy more than now.  I am three quarters of the way through this book and the end can't some soon enough for me.  The best part of the book was the lengthy &quot;Acknowledgement&quot;.  The author seems to be a nice person and I feel bad panning her book but if I can save anyone the misery I'm in, I have to do it.  If you want vampire/romance, read the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton
