I am a Navy Wife of four years facing my first deployment as a wife and I found this book to be the corniest thing I've ever read. EVER.

The "comical" stories everyone seems to be gushing over sound like they were pulled right out of a dusty old Reader's Digest. I didn't find the book to be informative and I found the definition section of the book to be incredibly trite and boring. 

Example: Term Active Duty, Military Speak: Actively serving and deployable. Spouse Speak: This means your address is written in pencil in address books.

Dear God. How incredibly lame. Military members move. Yes. It's true. We ALL know that. Civilians know this. EVERYONE knows this. This poor attempt at humor is dull and over-used.

I didn't learn ANYTHING from this book and would NOT recommend this to anyone  SERIOUSLY looking for information or advice about military life or deployments. You can get USEFUL information by going to your local Fleet and Family Support Center or attending a pre-deployment brief.
