Before I right this review, I'm going to take a few moments just to calm down to avoid telling you of the idiocy of this book in all capital letters.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There. I think I'm ready.

The River Between Us is awful. No element of the story is particularly captivating. I struggled through the story, re-reading passages or even entire chapters just to get the gist of what was going on.

Peck's decision to tell what might have been an interesting story from an unimportant character's point of view proved fatal. The book may have gained an extra star if the story had been told from Delphine's point of view, or even Cass'. Any interesting aspect of the story is squashed flat by irrelevant detail. 

I read the book because it was a nominee in my local library's book award contest. I stumbled through it blindly, actually counting down the pages to the end. This book is not worth a read. 

If you are looking for a better piece of historical fiction to read, allow me to recommend "A Northern Light," by Jennifer Donnelly.
