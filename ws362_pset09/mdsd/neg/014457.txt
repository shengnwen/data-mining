Thumbed through this book in the store... Loved the idea, and the  selection of topics - architecture, natural phenomena, etc. - really wanted  to buy it. Ran across some typos... some missing information... and  ultimately just plain bogus &quot;mathematics&quot;: sin^2 + cos^2 =1.  Well, sin and cos of what? As written, it's nonsense... there's nonsense  all around us too, but I wouldn't want to read a book about it. Wondered  why the publisher did not employ an editor... put it back on the shelf
