Wow, for a series which started off with a strong independent older female character, Miss Julia has really really let herself go. I knew it would be the 'kiss of death' for Julia to get married, (this time to 'too good to be true' Sam Murdoch), and I'm sad to say I was right. Miss Julia's problems in this book are all in her head. Her silly dithering about her marriage, her jealous obsession over Sam and other women and her silly worrying about whether she is  married or not, are so unlike the practical sensible widow, I have to sigh.

I'm sorry to say it, but if Miss Ross is to revitalize the series, she'd need to do something drastic. Such as A: Dump Sam (sorry, never liked the character. Miss Julia needs a bad boy, not a saint), B: do something about the Mr. Pickens situation, C: and get something *real* for Miss Julia to worry about rather than herself. When I saw the title of this book, I thought Miss Julia *might* be getting herself a new hobby. Unfortunately, the title is misleading.

Might be worth picking up at the library, but definitely the worst in the series. I was *so* disappointed
