Although it mentions many of the traders I respect, I found the book to be written at an eighth grade level with a lot of redundant information (filler).  I can say this because I have read the main works that this book claims to distill, and Boik's book falls short of my expectations.  I would stay away from this one and read the main works.  You will learn a lot more and save your money
