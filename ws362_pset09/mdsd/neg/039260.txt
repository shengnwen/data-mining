If this book is required for your class, PLEASE buy a different book.  This book offers little to no explanation of key topics, is very poorly written, and is hard to follow.  In many cases, you will be better off simply reading Wikipedia.  If you go to a school that requires this book, I would advise you to write angry letters to the people who decided to use it until they submit to your whim.  By choosing this book, they have ruined an entire semester of class for you.  How does that make you feel
