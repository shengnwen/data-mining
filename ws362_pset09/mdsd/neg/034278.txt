This book is disappointing.  While it may help a college student or other really new person grasp some of the concepts of organizing it is not useful to practioners.

The Midwest Academy used to have a very good training manual covering many issues.  As the book got slicker looking the information got worse.  

Get Shel Trapp's old Basics of Organizing instead - much more useful, and free on the internet
