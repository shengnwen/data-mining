Then I guess you better wake him up!  That's right, I hope you like using the GLUT (Graphics Library Utility Toolkit) because that's all Angel uses here.  Sure, the GLUT is great if you just want to display a spinning triangle or create the most basic program, but if you want to create an OpenGL project with some bite then you should pick up another book which will teach you Qt or Windows programming.  If you're a n00b, opengl will render all of your shapes and colors, but it can't create its own window to run in.  The GLUT is one way to create an &quot;opengl window,&quot; but the GLUT is by all means the most basic and useless of the possible methods.  Yes, I realize this is a &quot;primer,&quot; but for 30+ dollars, you can do better.  Much, much better.  Besides nothing in this book isn't something you couldn't find in a pdf file on opengl.org
