I have read hundreds of diet books--but honestly this one is the WORST one EVER!!!  It was so depressing that I had to quit reading it!!! REALLY!!!  I ordered "THE OVERFED HEAD" by Rob Stevens at the same time and it was THE BEST DIET BOOK I've ever read!!! -- thanks to Rob -- it may be the LAST DIET BOOK I'LL EVER READ!!!  Take my advise and buy his book -- he gives great advise!!!  Rob was on a diet for 25 years, but when he STOPPED DIETING -- he lost 150 lbs!!! -- proving diets don't work!!!  The only thing you LOSE on a diet is the money you spent on the diet!!! -- because the weight always comes back -- plus more!!!  Mary
