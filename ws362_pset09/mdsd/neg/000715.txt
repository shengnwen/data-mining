     Peter Green obviously did his home work and is an expert on the Greco-Persian Wars. Having lived in Greece his knowledge of Greek geography is superb. These are tremendous strengths of the book.
     However, there are some mighty big weaknesses. For one so knowledgeable of Greek geography, his maps are awful. Perhaps the worst maps I have ever seen in a military history. A knowledge of Greek geaography is assumed by the author. You need seperate maps to follow his descriptions. Good maps are essential to an understanding of the narrative.
     This is an academic book for academics, not for the layman or specialist in another field of history like myself. A working knowledge of the literature is assumed especially Herodotus. 
     Most annoying is that instead of simply telling the story of what happens he cuts back and forth between a chronological narrative and an analysis of the sources and literature. Often times he jumps ahead to analyze what happened and the sources before telling what actually happened. It would be much better if he simply explained what happened and then analyzed the sources and literature. Much of his analysis of the literture could have been shifted to the footnotes and some of the longer analysis could have been included in an appendix. But to analyze an event before explaining the event is a style very hard to follow. 
     As one reviewer noted below, his use of Latin phrases is confusing and annoying. He seems to be showing off his knowledge of Latin. Well, it was mostly Greek to me. Several times he uses the word mole which he places on a map. No where can I find his definition or description of the term. I asked three historians who are nationally known in their field what the term means. None of them knew.   
     While many academics specializing in this field will appreciate his work, layman and historians specializing in other periods of history will have trouble with the author's style.
