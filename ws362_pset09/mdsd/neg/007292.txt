I went out and bought this book after seeing the reviews posted here and on other discussion lists. This is probably the worst book I have ever read on the subject. Anna Riva has more credibility than this guy! Llewyllyn Publishing House certainly does not seem to be bothered by the fact that they are marketing false information to the public. Who ever wrote in last and commented on the harmful effectd of combining traditions is correct. Hoodoo is not new age fantasy like the wiccan "religion" its a tried and true folk practice. The author seems to believe that he can mix Haitian Loa with hoodoo and blend in a bit of jewish mysticism for kicks. This book and the other Llewyllyn  mistake, Sticks Stones Roots and Bones are both just plain fantasy.
