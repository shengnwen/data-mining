As an ex-muslim, I checked this because a friend said I should read it.

What I discovered is a complete load of manure. Either the author has never read the Koran, does not understand Arabic, or else is deliberately trying to whitewash this hateful, vile, violent religion.

This is like a book on Scientology written by a brainwashed scientologist, nothing more and nothing less. He should be ashamed for lying like this - but of course, lying to infidels is okay if it gets them to convert
