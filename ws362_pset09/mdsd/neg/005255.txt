Fast, easy page-turner (I read it in one day) that gives interesting insight into what it may have been like growing up during the Cultural Revolution. Although it is insightful and terribly sad at times, it was way too underdeveloped and never reached its full potential. I wish the writer had gone much more in depth with the charachters and their anguish, love, fear,lives,passions and ambitions.

This was the first book I have read by this author and am curious about her other novels, only because of her positive reviews. However, this book wasn't a "must-read" at all- I would recommend it only if you have an interest in Maoist China and the Cultural Revolution, or a few spare hours to read an entire book.
