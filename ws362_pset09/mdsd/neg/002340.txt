    As a research scientist, arguments like this, always distinctly American, make me sad. Only America and a few other countries are holding back their scientists with bans on cloning and stem cell research. So far, the best argument to the contrary is the flawed, platitudinous "slippery-slope" concept presented in this book. The idea that genetic research will inevitably lead to a race of super-people is trite at best. In my opinion its sophomoric and idiotic. I have heard the same point presented in a 2002 documentary by MSNBC, this concept is far from original or compelling. In 2003, scientists developed a brain-machine interface for primates. Has this technology led to, or will it ever lead to, a race of cyborg people that are so vastly superior that us normal-people will never be able to keep up? I don't think so. In reality all this technology will ever do is lead to the development of better artificial limbs for amputees. In the same fashion, all genetic research will ever lead to is a greater understanding genetic diseases. 

	Proclaiming current research as "good enough" will lead to America being hamstrung in the global race to develop technologies, a race we are already loosing due to globalization and the fact students receive a far better science education in India and Japan. This fear of scientific discovery is a concept better suited for the middle ages. If the author takes even one college level genetic course, I am sure his opinion will change. Please dismiss this book and move on.
