I thought Fred Saberhagen's "Berserker Fury" (1997) was redundant.  But while Syd Field's "Screenplay" offers plenty of reassurance to the wanna-be screenwriter, pretty soon I got the point and was tired of all the cheerleading.

Field may indeed have something substantial to say, but I couldn't help wondering if this book started out as photocopied handouts (since Field apparently taught at Sherwood Oaks Experimental College) and ended up as a hardbound book.  That led me to question if the revisions to the successive editions of the book (1979, 1982, 1994) didn't simply consist of inserting additional redundancies.

If you can stand to wade through (and/or "weed through") the pep talk, you might actually get something out of this book.  I couldn't, so I didn't.  

That means it's time to drag out J. Michael ("Babylon 5," "Murder, She Wrote") Straczynski's "The Complete Book of Scripwriting" (subtitled "The all-in-one guide to writing and selling screenplays, teleplays, theatrical plays, radio scripts and animation scripts").
