I thought the patterns were fun and was anxious to make many of them; however, the patterns sizes were no where near what I needed for my Chihuahua.  Even so my Chihuahua is of the portly/chubby type, the sizes were still too big. I consider myself an intermediate knitter; yet in all honesty, having to re-guage a pattern, change the cast-on, the measurements, the inc's, dec's, etc etc etc is too much of a bother. Don't get me wrong, I always gauge my work and if I have to adjust a few sts here and there and/or change ndl sizes, I'm ok with that... I just don't want to reinvent the whole pattern
