I love the works of Salvador Dali. Look at some of his paintings and you can tell there is something profound going on in his mind. The question is, &quot;what?&quot; The problem with the book is that there's just way too  much information for one artist. 600 pages of small type? Nobody is that  fascinating. I'd rather have had more explanation for his paintings. What's  going on with the 20 foot elephant stilt legs? What's with all the  crutches? I'm sure the answers were all in the book, but it's buried in  tons of rambling stories. I think I'll just wait for the Ken Burns PBS  series on Dali
