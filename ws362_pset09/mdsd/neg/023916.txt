I found this book misleading. I was expecting a book on spirituality, but that isn't the case. I'm giving it two stars because of the bits and works that she does include.

However, the rest of this book is her own eco-rant. She writes in the front of the book that you don't have to have a house or live the country to impliment things things, but from her position, she really doesn't give any other opinions.

She managed to make me feel guilty page after page, as she went on and on about her enviro friendly house and land. (I'm sorry I don't make enough to live in the mountains and install sun batteries in my roof. Nor do I have the land to plant or the money to buy at organic markets.)

The few bits she puts in about the elements (and such working) were good, but it didn't justify the price of the book to me. The few points were interesting and fresh and I wanted to see them explored more then her use of fertalizers and worms and how she has to use back-up batteries in the winter because her sun batteries don't get enough sunlight.

Maybe I was just expecting a book on spirituality and maybe this is why I was disappointed. Anyhow, I'd check this out from the library to see if it's your flavor before buying it
