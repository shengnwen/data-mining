I usually like Deaver's stories, but I actually only made it through half of the book...then tossed the thing. I am not crazy about the subject matter when it involves children (even if they are at the teen stage). Should have paid more attention to the info at the back of the book. And I definitely don't need to have obscenities every sentence. My mother always stated that people who swore constantly had nothing of interest to say. I find this to be true, even in my choice of literature. My time on this earth is too short to waste reading this type of material. 

So I am a prude...
