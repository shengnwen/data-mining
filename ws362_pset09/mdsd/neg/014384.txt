I'm with Kimberly.  Although the book is richly peppered with colour and B&amp;W photos and drawings, the book as a whole is a prime example of Orientalist fantasizing about &quot;othered&quot; Muslim women gone wild.  Croutier makes blanket generalised assertions such as &quot;In traditional Islamic cultures, most women would sooner stand naked in a marketplace than uncover their faces&quot; and incorrectly misquotes hadith as Qur'anic text betraying ignorance of the most basic tenets and foundational structures of Islam.  If Croutier can make such simple mistakes as this, can we trust anything she has written as being anything more than snippits of wild Orientalist fantasies passed off as &quot;fact&quot; to an unsuspecting audience?  I think not. My advice is to cut out the pretty pictures and throw away the rest (or recycle it if you're environmentally conscious)
