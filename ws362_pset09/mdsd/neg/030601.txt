After reading his book NIGHT and being moved by Wiesel's holocaust experiences in the setting of a Nazi Concentration camp, I decided to read TWILIGHT when I saw it sitting next to NIGHT in a bookstore.  TWILIGHT turned out to be a very weird novel whose purpose I never could surmise.  I took it back to the bookstore for a refund.  I highly recommend reading Wiesel's NIGHT, but suggest avoiding TWILIGHT which is bizarre and perplexing
