After reading Kageyama's &quot;Fundamentals...&quot; I was a little disappointed with this series. I read volumes II and III and was surprised at how little substance there was: big pictures, big text, and lots of  distracting doodles. Volume III talks about 7 deadly sins of go, yet I  couldn't find them. Most of the book was devoted to reviewing a few games  that took place between high-level players. Although this series might be  great for the extreme novice, I'm disappointed that they stretched this  material out into so many volumes
