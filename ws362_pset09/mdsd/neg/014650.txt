First off, Starship Troopers is one of my top ten books period.  Well done Mister Heinlein.

This book?  In a word--UGH!   The dialogue is laughable at times, noxious at others, and sometimes entertaining enough to keep you reading to see what comes next.  Sometimes what comes next is plausible and exciting and entertaining.  Sometimes it is none of those.  And at one point, it's jaw-droppingly shocking and nauseating:
           Main male character, former military officer, is someone you learn to like a lot as you read through the book.  Until you suddenly find out he's bisexual around page 300.  And had a homosexual experience he didn't find unpleasant with a Boy Scout Leader when he was a kid.  Thanks for springing that on us just before the end.  

Bottom line:  Do not recommend.  But Starship Troopers--get 2 copies...one to read, one to lend out
