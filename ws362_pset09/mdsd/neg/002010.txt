This was one of our main texts for a class on the Ancient Rome I just took this semester. The information in here is solid, but in many (most) parts of the book I was bored to tears...something I've rarely said about any history book. A very dry read. Truely devoted students of Ancient Rome or Classics may find this book useful, casual readers or general history buffs I suggest look elsewhere
