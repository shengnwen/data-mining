Al Norman, who is the "shill of the anti-Wal-Mart union movement," has just written yet another jealous screed against the retailer, since a few years ago he discovered he could make money by doing so.

The book trumps up a "case" against Wal-Mart by taking rare, isolated incidents that occurred (and were corrected) at certain stores and presenting them as day-to-day company policies. In this way, Norman ( as in "normal"?) is able to spout forth his generalizing "Wal-Mart is a big bad bully" mythology. 

In place of Wal-Mart's "always lower prices" slogan, he presents the following kind of "evidence" to make the store look bad: 

* Always forces its workers to labor "off the clock" without pay: lie - isolated incident; they are paid. 
* Always uses overseas sweatshop labor to manufacture its clothing: lie - isolated Kathy Lee Gifford incident; no underage workers allowed.  
* Always sells knock-off and counterfeit merchandise that misleads and confuses its customers: lie - sells brand name merchandise. 
* Always destroys acres of environmentally sensitive lands to build new Wal-Marts: lie - for every acre of store land, another acre is donated to that same area by Wal-Mart.
* Always eliminates competition in towns across the U.S. by illegally lowering prices below wholesale: lie - sells at least 10% above.
* Always forces the movement of thousands of manufacturing jobs out of the U.S.: lie - Wal-Mart doesn't manufacture anything, and makers are free to work where they want. 
* Always calls "full-time" 28 hours per week: lie - at Wal-Mart, 30 hours or more is considered full time. (Although the lower the full-time designation, the quicker workers are entitled to full-time benefits.) 
* Always pays wages so low that many of its employees qualify - and accept - welfare payments: lie - workers earn far above welfare levels, and by doing so couldn't qualify for welfare anyway. 
* Always demands millions of dollars in tax breaks to locate in communities all over the U.S., while it earns billions of dollars in profits: lie - tax breaks were not invented by Wal-Mart - they apply for them if they can, like anyone else. 
*Always ruins towns it goes into: lie - the store actually contributes far more in jobs, taxes, and in contributions to local charities than any other entity in those areas. 

The book by Norman, the self-proclaimed leader of the "anti-sprawl" movement, goes Republican evangelical towards the "sinners" that tun Wal-Mart, and also towards those who shop there, calling for a "boycott" of the store. Where have we heard that before? That's right - in the boycotts by Germans against Jewish shops in the early days of the Nazi movement.

Strange how Norman and his labor union pals never seem to go after those retail chains who don't threaten their pocket books at the moment, on behalf of the "greater good" of the community. No, instead only the current top dog is going to find itself in Norman's sights, and right now that happens to be Wal-Mart. Before that it was Target, and before that K-Mart. 

Whoever the current #1 is, that's exactly who Norman and company are going to chase after, because then he can sell his books, and the unions can hope that Wal-Mart finally caves in to their recruiting pressure, and signs up its workers with the old Jimmy Hoffa vanishing pension fund gang. 

This is a book that every American shopper should read and laugh at heartily, before then making another trip to Wal-Mart and saving a big bundle of money, as usual. Are author Norman or his union buddies going to make up that loss in your wallet if you stop shopping at money-saving stores like Wal-Mart? No way!

So I can only advise you in this direction: "Friends don't let friends be fooled by union shills!" 

(Book Rating: 1 star for stupidity - and general comedy value.
