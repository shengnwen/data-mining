I lived in Chicago during the Bulls heyday during the 2nd run of their championships, and everyone I knew had this book, or knew someone who did.  I didn't have a copy, but I read it during a break, and found it to be very tiresome and really boring.  Even though it's not meant to be Tolstoy, Dickens, or even a dime novel, it's really a waste of time.  The book now is completely dated, and Rodman is just a nobody again.  All I remember from the book was a rant against David Robinson which started, in typical 90's fashion, "the problem with David Robinson is...".  Rodman went off on how Robinson didn't have what it takes to win an NBA championship (Rodman was wrong.  Robinson did eventually win a few).  Rodman was one of the greatest rebounders of all time, but that's really the only thing he was ever good at.  He was your typical celebrity.  Obnoxious, rude, outrageous, "outspoken", filled with drugs, marrying stupid women (Carmen Electra in his case), and generally moronic behaviour.  The media loved people like that in the 1990's.  Rodman just loved to party and behave like an idiot.  In other words, typical celebrity behaviour.  He did a few bad movies, wrestled in WCW (now defunct), and went on Fear Factor, but he was never a great actor, star, or writer.  Just a good athlete that like being a celebrity (hence all the ridiculous clothes, dye jobs, tattoos, etc., etc.).
