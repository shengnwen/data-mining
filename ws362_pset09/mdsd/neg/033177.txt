This isn't really a 260 page book, it's a 5 page pamphlet that repeats itself over and over.  

Really there is nothing new here if you've read Rich Dad Poor Dad, beyond a shameless marketing co-promote for his games, other books and a few of his friends.

Overall I thought Rich Dad Poor Dad was a pretty good book.  This book however made me realize that Mr. Kiyosaki really has discovered the secret to becoming rich - write one half way decent book and then milk it as long as you can with other related books and products
