I picked this off the new nonfiction shelf at the library to see what a writer might have to say about the stage of life I'm in too. As others have said Atlas remains, I think, too wrapped up in the expectations of his privileged class--envying classmates who made more money, while living in Manhattan, sending his kids to private schools and maintaining a home in Vermont--methinks he doth kvetch too much.

Just because you have enough skill to make a living as a writer doesn't mean you have anything interesting to say. Honesty alone is not enough if your story is not compelling. Atlas does well with biographies but as autobiography, other than the chapter about his father, this is too self-pitying and more irritating to me at least, simply too mundane. 

He has an opportunity for adventure--he mentions going to Tibet for example but derides it as trendy "Jewddhism"--too "commonplace" to consider. Commonplace?! How about staying home and crabbing about your life--that's commonplace. His age doesn't stop him from seeking excitement and engaging the world in new ways, but he'd rather stay on his familiar turf and ponder his limitations. And even a good writer can't make that choice a compelling read. Like reviewer "ts" I was reminded of Woody Allen. Both rarely stray from their Manhattan comfort zone. Which, fair enough as a personal choice, but any work produced as a result is unlikely to tell us much new. We all have these stories, many more interesting than his.

Take some risks James. Learn to scuba dive. Visit the Taj Mahal and Angkor Wat. Ride a bicycle around Mexico. Move to New Zealand. Seek some passion. Get outside yourself and your cocoon. Rage a little bit. Then write a book!
