I totally agree with the &quot;reader from Kansas&quot; on 7/18/99. I give this one star to bring down the overall rating. This reader's statement that the last 50 pages were somewhat interesting, and that the reader kept waiting for something to happen, are also true. I read this because I like the author, and I kept on because of the reputation of the author, but there is no tension, twists, etc to this story. It just goes on..and on..and on..The problem is that it is described as an espionage thriller, and it's not. It might be good if reviewed within another genre, but not this one
