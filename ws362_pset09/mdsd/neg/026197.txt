I bought and read this book and found it to be a superficial treatment of the subject for Christians who believe in a single God, which I am not.  I finished the book hoping for a deeper understanding of guilt and forgiveness after experiencing the recent suicide of my only child, a seventeen year old boy suffering from severe depression.  I am sure this book will be comforting for those it is written for but it did not shed any light on the subject for me
