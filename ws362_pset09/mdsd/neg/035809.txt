I was expecting a thoughtful assessment of the challenges that lie ahead.  What I got was the musings of a bitter old man who seems to hate everything about contemporary American society and is cheering for its imminent demise.

I knew the book wasn't going to be cheery or optimistic, but this was way too depressing.  I don't need this kind of nay-saying pessimisim in my life
