After purchasing Pamela Ferrell's book Let's Talk Hair, I decided to buy this one for more styling options. I was suprised to see the horrible lack of information for hair care and hair styling. This book provides no information on a maintenance regime, the hair products section goes into great detail on all the chemicals and ingredients in products but doesn't tell how to choose products or what products on the market are good, and the styling section has little information for home styling. The author goes into great detail on hair makeup and on what actually is in hair products along with a very detail nutritional guide on all the ingredients in food. The hair styling section is basically about popular braiding styles and a few natural styles like the 'fro and the twist out 'fro, and some information on locking. Overall, don't waste your money or time on this book
