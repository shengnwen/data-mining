Anglophone readers probably don't realise that Latour meant this book as a tongue-in-cheek exercise to capture the postmodern social theory market in his own country by using a postmodern style to show what an illusion  postmodernism has always been. But, as fate would have it, when someone  sneezes in Paris, an Anglophone is felled with pneumonia. It's hard to  believe that anyone with a firm grasp of the history of the last 250 years  of Western culture would find this book anything more than a diversion  worthy of maybe a couple of arguments in the pub. It's telling that  historians of science, who are really the people who are in a position to  hold Latour accountable to anything he says here, have given the book a  chilly reception.
