Any reviewer who finds a smidgeon of merit in this crazy excuse for rational thought needs to have his own head examined.  Bigots and fascists are always looking for some sort of intellectual basis for their beliefs and have for 70 or 80 years tried attempted to find it in Rosenberg's tortured and barren prose (along with Hitler's equally crazy "Mein Kampf").  Albert Speer, an intelligent and broadly educated man who was Hitler's architect, close associate, and armaments minister, declared the book "unreadable" (see "Inside the Third Reich," a vastly more worthwhile book).  Anyone who wants to see what this kind of thinking, when adopted on a large scale, can ultimately lead to should watch "Schindler's List.
