In his Preface, Feynman admits that these lectures were aimed at "the most intelligent students" coming out of high school into Caltech.  He also admits that many students had trouble with the content judging from their performance on the examinations and said that his system of lectures is "a failure".  I agree with Feynman.  These lectures are very hard to understand.  Partly the lectures, prepared in early 1960s, suffer from being rather dated.  Mostly though this material is presented in a confusing way, with lots of complicated mathematics that often hinders comprehension.  I recommend getting a basic college textbook instead (Physics for Scientists and Engineers by Wolfson and Pasachoff is a good choice)
