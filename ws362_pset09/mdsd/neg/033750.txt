it is a real pitty that the amazon editors didn't choose to publish the whole of Bickerton's review -- there we would, for example, see that Bickerton actually hopes &quot;for a sequel&quot; in order to have the book  actually says something one could appreciate.  this title certainly doesn't  do justice to Verdery's otherwise excellent academic record.  it is written  in haste, with a complete lack of attention and needed careful reading of  details.  at the end we get an impression that she is making fun of other  people's misery.  it was obviously a too difficult task for her aims: the  analysis is highly superficial, as if she aspired more to amuse than really  teach.  but dead bodies is something I find difficult to laugh about, no  matter how pathetic the circumstances of their manipulations are
