I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel.  The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller.  Don't waste your time.
