Just wanted you to know that I have had trouble ordering "The New England Cookbook".  Amazon took my order but kept delaying their shipment of it, saying that they were out of stock (and kept pushing the date forward).  I waited patiently for 2 months, then decided that they did not have the item they claimed was in stock.  

This was not the first time I have had problems with Amazon.  If they have the product they ship immediately, but if they don't.....
