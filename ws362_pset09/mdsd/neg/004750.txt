Just finished my first Iris Murdoch novel. I had heard what a great writer she was, oh what a disappointment. I felt that the story was very shallow; it was about an old guy who still thought he was young and his rather silly love affairs. I guess even Iris Murdoch didn't have the guts to end it on old Charles hitching up with a teenager, hence the hints about the two of them getting together
