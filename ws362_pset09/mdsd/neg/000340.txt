Schoenbaum's book is extensively researched. Almost every page has a list of social statistics from the Nazi period. But at the end of each chapter, I was so overwhelmed with details that I had no idea what the author had proven. Eventually I just gave up. Readers who are already very knowledgeable about Nazi Germany might gain something from this book, but people looking for introductory works should avoid it
