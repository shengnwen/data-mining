As a purchasing professional, I turned to this book to gain insight to new or advanced purchasing practices that might help me in my work and I was very enthusiastic about the book when I began reading it.  Instead of new knowledge, I found repetitive stories about the mass production environments in the automotive and related industries.  Although some new thoughts or ideas were presented, I did not feel as if this book taught me anything novel or cutting edge.  It is simply a repeat of purchasing concepts that can be found in many other operations or supply chain books flavored with managerial buzz words and the self-glorifying personal success stories of the authors and the companies they work for.  If you work in a job shop environment or for a small to medium size business, this book is virtually useless.  If you are in a huge mass production environment with a large budget, it might be of some value, but my guess is that you would already be familiar with the concepts presented
