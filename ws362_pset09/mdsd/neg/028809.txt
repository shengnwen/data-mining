I am 15 years old and was required to read this book as summer reading for my school. Let me just say that this is the most punishingly boring book I have ever opened. I say opened because I just could not finish it. I was doing fine until I reached his section about the future of computers. I had to skip the entire section...about 50 pages or so. It, along with almost every other section of the book is impossible to understand, at least for a 15 year old. After that, the book just kept going downhill, and I gave up. This book is not interesting in the least. Avoid at all costs
