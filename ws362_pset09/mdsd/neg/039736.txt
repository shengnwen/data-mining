Book Review By Sam K.

	In S.E. Hinton's Taming the Star Runner, a sixteen year old boy named Travis travels to the countryside to visit his uncle Ken. Travis is a tough looking city boy who can get himself out of any situation, and he has a hard time making friends at the "hick school." He decides to go to the barn to meet Casey, who introduces him to the Star Runner, a crazy untamed horse. Later Travis finds that he and the Star Runner have a lot in common. 
	I didn't care for this book because it didn't have a lot to do with the Star Runner. I think S.E. Hinton should have added more detail on how the Star Runner got tamed. I would recommend this book to a young adult like Travis: a procrastinator from the city. I think this because I feel if you're like the character you can understand more about the story you're being told. It was an okay book.
