I read this book for school, and  we went over all the good points of this book and its literary merit, etc.  The writing style is smooth and descriptive, but I find the plot dull and trite.  She is a teen searching for love and her voice, and the story is her traveling from husband to husband and her not being satisfied.  The idea of her finding her voice is inconsistent and unfounded.  If you want to read a book about a silly girl who doesn't know what to do with herself, and if you want to be bombarded with overused symbolism, be my guest and read "Their Eyes Were Watching God" by Zora Neale Hurston.  Only read it if you are looking at the writing style, do not read it for the plot.
