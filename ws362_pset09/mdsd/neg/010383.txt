I could only read about 20 pages of this book, it was
not clear to me that Lawrence needed to leave England to
write this . The new Landscapes, villages, and people only
seem an excuse to get a never ending internal dialogue involving
his views and prejudices. I want a travel book to be like
good reporting, with the author only visible by the style of writing.
Joseph Mitchell is without peer in this method.

It might be more enjoyable if his views were not uniformly obvious or
boring
