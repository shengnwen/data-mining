I was looking forward to reading this book but I was so disappointed by the drippy tone of the narrator and the constant one-liner questions directed at the reader. Yuck! I also didn't understand what the big deal was over the beautiful lie, it could have been a great storyline but the action scenes and the twists felt sooo contrived. I wanted to scream, "where was the editor?" Needless to say, I will not be buying anymore books from this author!
