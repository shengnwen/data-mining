either you like this book or you dont

i dont  --  
it exceeded my  BS  tolerance level

imho too much of this is a total crock full of words 

if this were condensed to a magazine article it might be worth slogging through

i wonder -  was this once  a magazine article that got put on steroids to pump it up to fill a book?

read it at the library if you must
dont buy it 
.
