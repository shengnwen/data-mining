the cover is interesting, the description on the back makes it seem amazing! and when i read about 20 pages of the book, i'm in total shock. this is not the book that i had in mind. 

first of all, this is the !MOST! unrealistic thing i have ever read. As hard as i tried, I could not get into the story. The language is very .. let me say this: it's complex poetry written in the simplicity for a five year old.
