Lucky for us, Siri Hustvedt went on to write greater things, and we can expect even more of her as she hones her craft.  "The Enchantment of Lily Dahl," he second novel, will disappoint those readers who absolutlely loved her novel "What I Loved," an emotionally gripping, sophisticatedly plotted and lyrical novel about the intersections of love, art and life in 1980s and 1990s New York City.  I found nothing really enchanting or enchanted about Hustvedt's protaganist in this one, a blond buxom waitress withering as in smalltown Minnesota but hoping for a career as an actress.  The story might have been about a young woman discovering something within herself and her surroundings, but instead, the reader gets a murder mystery with a psycho, as well as a handful of caricatured and unbelievable characters who all seem to love Lily Dahl but never seem to get her.  Don't judge Hustvedt by this one
