As others have indicated, this book features the reunion between the four young mages previously seen in the "Circle of Magic" and "The Circle Opens" books.  It deals with how the four friends have grown apart, and Sandry's required trip to visit her cousin, the Empress of Namorn.

Unfortunately, I just didn't buy it.  The fights seemed contrived, their conflicts weren't very realistic and I just didn't enjoy reading the book.  As for the "danger plot," I have to say, I thought it was idiotic.  The Sandry of the previous books would not have stinted her duty for ANY reason - her sense of justice was so strong, she would have stayed and fought the system, not fled it.  Renouncing a heritage because of a single custom was ridiculous.  Frankly, it felt as though Ms. Pierce just wanted to get Sandry back to her great-uncle's court and came up with this plot contrivance to do so.  Daja's character and romance were the only things that made this book even remotely bearable.

I used to be an incredible fan of Ms. Pierce's books, but they have really been falling off lately.  I hope she spends a bit more time and thought constructing stronger plots in the future
