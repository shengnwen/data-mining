I bought the book just to read the J.D. Robb story. Unfortunately, Robb should've named the story Distracted in Death. It reads more like a basic outline which has not been fleshed out and provided with emotional depth and intensity. When Robb gives short shrift to the usual description of Roarke and passes him off as "handsome," then let the reader understand that Robb, who is beautifully prolific with figurative language, is not really paying attention to the local color necessary to transform Distracted in Death into a fine story called Haunted in Death. 

The story is defined by its absences. Summerset, Mavis, Nadine, McNabb. Though it is true that all of these don't have to people an ...in Death story for it to come alive, these add levels of interest and connectedness that make the series unmatchable. Thus, their absence here is noticeable, especially given the quality of Midnight in Death, in comparison to which Distracted in Death is lacking.

Thus, Distracted  in Death is just going through the motions of being a J.D. Robb story. It does not meet the level of excellence of its predecessors, though it had potential to do exactly that
