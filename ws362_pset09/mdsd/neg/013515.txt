I bought this book in  a moment of weakness.  I'd had a rough prospecting day, was feeling down, and wondered into Barnes & Noble looking for something to cheer me up.  The layout and feel of this book are great, they draw you in...but that's about it. When you delve into the material, you'll find it to be very shallow.  Nothing new at all!  In fact, it's a complete waste of time.  I'm shocked to see all the good reviews.
