Carlton Mellick III is often labeled as an author of `bizarro' fiction and his book "The Menstruating Mall" certainly is bizarre. The short novel follows a group of stereotypical individuals who one day find themselves unable to leave the mall (which happens to be menstruating) while the rest of the mall patrons are trapped outside unable to enter. The group soon discovers that one of their ensemble is a killer bent on ridding the mall of the "mundane". As the group is picked off one-by-one the stereotypical individuals begin doing outrageous, out-of-character acts trying to convince the unknown killer that they are unique individuals, not mundane stereotypes.

Mellick uses a sort of flow-of-consciousness writing style in "The Menstruating Mall" which is fast-paced and effective for the material. The book moves quickly from fairly "normal" happenings to progressively more strange, gory, and down right weird events.

Unfortunately, though it was a quick read, I didn't enjoy the book that much. By the end I felt like the point of the book had been thoroughly (and with absolutely no subtlety) been beaten into the ground. It was a simple idea drawn out through a series of "ok, what's the next most outrageous thing I can come up with" events that, though they were weird, really weren't that entertaining.

If the goal of the book was to be weird and act as (rather obvious) commentary on stereotypes then I guess it succeeded. Beyond that it really didn't do anything for me
