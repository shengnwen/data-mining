I thought I would love this book...and out of all the viking series I did like it.  But it was poorly written.   I have seen that Ms. Coulter does rewrite some of her novels this is definitely one of them that needs to be reproduced.

She had one to many loopholes that aggravate me as the reader.   I loved Miranda's character.  In my opinion out of all her characters I've read, I've only liked Alexandra Sherbrooke as my ideal woman next to Miranda.   What was disappointing there was not enough more combatative fighting between Miranda and those that kidnapped her nor just a visual between her brother and her.   

Secondly with Miranda and Rorik...there was no romance.  I cannot figure how a man moves from detesting the woman to deciding to marry her...although there was a small explanation or round about, mainly Rorik's thoughts on how strong she is and capable.

But besides the romance...the sex scenes were horrid.   It seemed cold and clinical.  There was no passion.   Between Douglas and Alexandra, or even the Legacy/Brides/ and the rest of the Viking sagas..there was some kind of passion that gets you excited and into the hero.  But Rorik was horrid as a lover and poor Miranda just seemed unimpressed..until she decided to take things into her own hands...and then she had to be ill before that was sucessful.  So the quality of romance/passion was utterly lacking in this fic.

My main concerns would be to develop Miranda more and give her a bit more nuances, and expand on her fighting skills with a bit more action.   
Another would be to definitely romanticise a bit of the sex scenes at least and give them a bit more loving relationship.  That is not only based on a marriage of convenience.   

I think those two would change things a great deal and really improve the book
