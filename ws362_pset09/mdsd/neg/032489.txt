This was a really good idea for a book, but it just doesn't deliver.  Aside from the general annoyance of the cheap publishing and frequent typos, this book has no real structure or overarching argument ... if you read the last couple chapters you get more out of it than if you waste your time reading the whole thing.  It's basically a mixture of biographies of everyone in the Braves organization and the author paraphrasing the words of others indiscriminately.

I am a huge admirer of the Braves organization and their genius, so I was disappointed to not glean very much info about their magic in this book.  Every once in a while there is a real gem about the Braves' philosophies, but just reading the life story of Steve Avery teaches me nothing.  The book gets pretty repetitive with this and much of it is skippable.

The Braves are an excellent foil to "Moneyball."  This book certainly isn't
