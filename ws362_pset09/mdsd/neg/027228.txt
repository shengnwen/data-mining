I found the heroine (ZD) so flatly written that she could only come off as a selfish, flightly idiot. She never has a chance to be a real person nor to have any real character.  To anyone reading today, with any smattering of enlightenment, I believe Zulieka Dobson will be frustrating and annoying.  She's set up to make a mean-spirited point.  I suggest picking up Evelyn Waugh or Nancy Mitford to get some fine writing on the society of the between-war period and the English upper classes
