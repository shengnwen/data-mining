I hate to say this, but Child ripped the main structure of the plot, as well as the precise ending, from, of all things, an episode of KNIGHT RIDER titled 'Dangerous Maneuvers' from the fall of 1982. Everything is there: the army brats bonded together by accident,the love interest being not entirely white,
the MPs dealing in crooked merchandise,one of the MPs being the father of one of the two main characters...but the weirdest part is the climax...I was sitting there in a state of shock, gasping at the tv,since right in front of me was the ending of The Enemy. Maybe it isn't exactly identical, but it's so close it's really strange...You won't believe it at first. I didn't.
This was just yesterday too! The Sleuth network...
Then I remembered that Child worked in TV for many years.

By the way, except for the baby face and easy smile, Hasselhoff
would make a credible Reacher, he's about the right size. Too young, of course.

Anyway, it was very creepy.  It could be coincidence, but I
doubt it. The climax is almost an identical scene.
Yet I don't think it would be legally plagiarism, since there are dissimilarities as well. Interesting to think about.
