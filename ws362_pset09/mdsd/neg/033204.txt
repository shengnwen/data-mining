Normally, I do not find it appeasing to write reviews of books I own, but this one i felt rather vehement about. I received this book for a gift over the holidays.  Over father's day, I thought I would make the Lemon Meringue Pie recipe from this book for my father-in-law as a gift.  I started to make it, and realized that the recipe called for a mixture of ingredients it failed to tell me how to make.  Granted, I know a lot about baking and cooking  and at high altitudes (I am a chef and live at almost 8,000 ft), but still, when I am trying to follow a recipe that is incomplete it is impossible!!!  I gave up that recipe and just decided to go with a different recipe that I know is tried and true.  Furthermore, today (Aug. 11) I tried to make the Independence Pass Brownies, and once again was shocked to see how poorly written these recipes were.  Ms. Purdy should really take up a new profession, as I have found cookbook writing to not be her forte.  Not only in the brownie recipe she writes about how nice the brownies are, not too sweet (made with brown sugar) etc, but when she lists the ingredients, brown sugar is not mentioned, but white granulated sugar is. To ice my cake, the brownies need A LOT longer than she states in her book as the cooking time.  Needless to say, I will NOT be using this book again as I have found it to be as its title states truly a "pie in the sky" as all the recipes are just that.
