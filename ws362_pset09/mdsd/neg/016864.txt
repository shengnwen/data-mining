With the pace home automation as been changing, this book should be considered "out of date" and hopefully soon be "out of print."  While the author does seek to enlighten readers, the focus of the book is out-of-touch with main stream home automation thinking in 2002.  Even the control systems referenced are no-longer near the cutting edge. While references to structured wiring still ring true, the techniques for reaching a total intregated system have changed.  I was so disappointed with this book I actually returned to Amazon as I felt it could not enhance my library in any regard. As an alternative I would suggest "Home Automation for Dummies.
