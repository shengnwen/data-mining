Have you ever heard how an artist has a particular strength and weakness? For example, being able to draw really good faces, but not-so-good hands or feet? I feel that Ian Irving is like that -- he writes a good, entertaining read (obviously, since I am going through book #4), but his "weakness" is character development, particularly romances. I know romance plays a pretty prominent role in most fantasy and sci-fi books, but this is not Irving's strong point. The romances seem shallow, improbable, and rushed. I had a hard time enjoying the story because of them. But as other readers have mentioned, there is "something" about the books that make you coming back for more.

So what is Irving's strong point? Food descriptions -- pay attention to every meal mentioned in the books. You will learn the texture of cheese, the ripeness of fruit, the grains in every bread mentioned, etc., etc. It's almost humorous how much detail goes into food, but not character development. 

If I had any advice to give, it would be for Irving to to write a cookbook, or perhaps a Zagats review or two. I'm sure they would be captivating, and right up his alley.
