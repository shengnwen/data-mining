If there is a Donald Trump in the nanny business Ms. Kline would surely be hosting the next Apprentice show except that she does not seem to have the same gravitaz that Mr. Trump demonstrates.  Name-dropping and full bragging of how important she is to the "over achieving" parents who are basically folks trying to integrate work and family lifestyles does not make Ms. Kline a likeable decent person.  (Whether you agree with how the parents are spending their time or not)
Instead of being empathetic, Ms. Kline comes across as a self-ordained I-am-a-very-important person in Washington.  She brags about the fact she can choose you as a client and gets more important clients than she really cares for.

The book is a quick easy read, but there is no substance and a lot of snide remarks on Ms. Kline's clients make her a character that any parent should stay away from
