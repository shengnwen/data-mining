"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime" didn't just make it on my list of best books of 2005; it made it on my top-ten list of all time. That's why I was so excited to get my hands on "A Spot of Bother" by the same author. Unfortunately, this book didn't come near the interest level or originality of its predecessor.

This book reminded me of a blend of Jonathan Franzen ("The Corrections") and Nick Hornsby ("How to Be Good"), neither of which I enjoyed much. I found "Bother" to be deathly slow and the characters to be frankly uninteresting. I kept hoping one of them would die, just to liven things up, paradoxically speaking.

Though I hate to admit it, I quit reading after 150 pages.
