I picked this up from my local library.  I don't think i'll ever read his work again ... because:
.  it's clumsy, not well written.  
.  The plot is (or tries to be complicated) too predictable.
.  same old boring stereo-typing, for example, Captain Huong, an Asian, female captain of the Chicago PD in a highly revered special unit, couldn't be bother to speak properly: "you had fight with girl?" ... this is from a Captain?
.  Greely is good at the church, history stuff and he should stick to that, instead of venturing into writing or trying to write about romance, hot-steammy sex acts ... the romantic sub-plot is too simple, quite laughable.  something that one could expect from a 3rd-grade writer.  I'm wondering if he wrote from experience or failed to do his research.  ...  Father, please stick to what you are good at, and please have some respect for your audience's intelligence
