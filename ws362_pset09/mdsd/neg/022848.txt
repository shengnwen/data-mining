I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.

There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.

I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.

I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."

447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book
