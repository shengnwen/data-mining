This book provides more confusion and frustration to a student than anything.  It ceases to offer sufficient example problems, while the few problems that do exist pertain to the less important theory.  Also, the  text provides a lack of explaination as to where it gets its values for  constants - nearly all chapter problems require the utilization of some  type of constant, yet the book has no tables of these values.  I actually  had to refer to my thermodynamics text in order to finish the questions  from this book.  It almost seems as if the book was rushed, since it  doesn't explain or justify anything. Finally, I would like to mention that  this was the most expensive of all my texts.  I regret purchasing this  text, as I could have learned more about fluid mechanics in my bathtub than  from this book
