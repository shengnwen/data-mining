Being a big B.C. fan, I could hardly wait to get my hands on her latest. Unfortunately, there is nothing new, and nothing exciting in this cookbook. There are three recipes for broccoli (yes, 3!), a repeat recipe for roasted cherry tomatoes (as if one recipe wasn't enough??), and a recipe for roasted onion quarters to be served as a side dish (yuck!). These examples were definitely the low-lights for me, but as I flipped through the cookbook, there was nothing that jumped out at me. I was completely underwhelmed. To end on a positive, it is a pretty book
