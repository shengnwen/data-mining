when my friend read all of jane austen a few years ago and just couldn't stop raving, i thought it was time to give the old girl a test ride around the block and see what all the fuss was about. on first try i fell right off. it was like reading a foreign language. my mind wouldn't stand still long enough to learn it. now, though, with the continued push to read jane austen ever before me (the new book, "the jane austen book club" peeked my interest), i thought i'd strap on my helmut and give her one more try. a few years of meditation under my belt would surely slow me down and give me more of a chance to "get it", i thought. 
she's still out of reach. i was initially teased, even laughed once or twice as i started "sense and sensibility" but then....it's just soooo boring. austen's portrayal of elinor and marianne and the crew are about as shallow as it gets. there is no depth here in these characters.  my mother even joined me in this reading  endeavor. we started a book club of two, just to accomplish this task... strength in numbers and all that. but, alas, we were both so " monstrous" bored. it was a "sedulous" task at best. we have now named our book club the "anything BUT jane austen book club". 
the reasons for the boredom:
1)i'm just not entranced by long, long, long sentences. proust gave it a go and did a much better job.
2)i'm also put off by the confusing use  and over use of pronouns..who really is "he" and "she" and "they"...i think if i'd have submitted this work in college, it would have come back with many margin notes  on grammar, syntax and style.
3)i think i got the idea of the social structure and nuances(where there any?) in the first 50 pages.. the rest was just" monstrous insipid ".
4)and for the storyline.. when austen lovers run out of austen material do they go on to harlequin romances? seems it would be a  logical move.

no more austen for this old girl. life's just too short and there are too many really good books out there
