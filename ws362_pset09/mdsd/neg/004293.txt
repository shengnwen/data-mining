After reading the reviews, I purchased this book only to be severely disappointed.  This book does a poor job explaining casting, pointer to pointers and scaling.  The author included a lot of code in the text (and  on disk), but very few comments within the code or text.  In source 5.6, he  has a 1 sentence explanations for 6 pages of code.  I read the first 100  pages and that's all I can take.  This book stinks
