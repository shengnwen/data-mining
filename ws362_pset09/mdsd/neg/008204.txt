Cheap mixture of basic body language knowledge and psychology catered to the masses. Very shallow and some of its comments show a unbelievable degree of narrow-mindness (Comments like "if you look like this, you are like that" are all over the book). Very disappointing book, comments like "If someone speaks about sports a lot, he probably likes sports" (page 63) say it all.
