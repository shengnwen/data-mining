This review concerns the original 1932 edition and the revised edition published in the 1960's.  Both books follow the same plot; although, the revised edition is slightly different from the original.  While returning from a carnival, Nancy, George and Bess witness a large home suddenly burst into flames.  Thinking that there may be someone trapped inside, the girls rush to the house to help.  They are unable to enter the home because of the heat, but Nancy spots a man running away from the house and later finds a diary, written in Swedish, which contains numerous technical drawings.  Did the man start the fire?  Does the diary belong to him?  And what became of Felix Raybolt, the owner if the home, who apparently has gone missing?  Clues lead Nancy to suspect that the diary belongs to the husband of a poor woman that Nancy met at the carnival along with her little girl.  Nancy becomes determined to prove that Joe Swenson didn't start the fire, but all of the clues she uncovers seem to suggest that he is guilty.  Personally, I didn't find this book very good; there isn't much action, the mystery isn't very exciting and the book really lacks a true criminal.  Thankfully, the writing style used in the book is rather enjoyable, so it keeps the book from being a complete waste of time.  One thing to note about this book is that this is the volume where Nancy meets Ned Nickerson and oddly enough her first thought of him is that he is trying to steal her car!  This book is worth reading for the writing, but its not likely that many fans of Nancy Drew will find this book to be one of their favorites
