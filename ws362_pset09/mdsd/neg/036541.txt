This book was relevant at the time it came out, if nothing for the fact it helped pump the patriotism and zeal to go to war.

However now, after we know the true facts, the lies, and the totally corrupt and inept administration running this country - this book serves no purpose.  I recommend Bob Woodwards new book, "Bush at War Part 2:  Denial", where he illustrates in detail how bad this administration has bungled up everything.

Skip this one, it is no longer relevant.  The only thing Bush is at war with anymore is his own conscience and moral fabric - which is woefully lacking
