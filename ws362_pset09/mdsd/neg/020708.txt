I didn't like the book. It was VERY confusing because it was from the point of view of many different characters. I had a hard time understanding anything. I rated it two stars because it captured my interest less then 5 times and during those periods I only found interest for a minute. If you want to read a good book I recommend Harry Potter, A series of Unfortunate Events and book by Andrew Clements
