All I could do was be disappointed and I was.  Ben Pleasants has a reputation for being a widely published journalist; maybe that's the problem? His Visceral Bukowski is more of an odd collection of unconnected articles than anything else.  It is as if Pleasants has raked the obscure to try and pull up something worth telling, but all he could find was tabloid filler.  For this reader, Pleasants' Visceral Bukowski is just another one of "them" - that, for whatever reason, was written to fuel the myth.  The more I read of these things the more I become convinced that the only one to truly get below the myth and bring us an honest look at Bukowski was Cherkovski.  As for the Visceral Bukowski, even the most avid Bukowski fan will fine this one a stretch
