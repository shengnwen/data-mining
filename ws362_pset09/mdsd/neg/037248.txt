Mr Dahl claims he does not intend to propose changes to the Constitution, but, rather, changes in how we think about it. Since he appears ignorant of his subject, I find him unqualified to suggest either.

Howbeit disrespectful of the powers of the States - and the people's rights as citizens of the States - the Framers were, they still knew of those powers and rights, and much of what they did and said - and what they did not do or say - was affected by that knowledge - a knowledge Mr Dahl either lacks or disrespects.

Many of the faults found with the Constitution share a source: the fact that many powers that have been arrogated by the "federal" government belonged to the States, at the time of the Constitutional Convention. The franchise, for example, was defined and controlled at the state level and the central government had no business trifling with it. Slavery was a matter of property law - a body of law over which the central government had no power. (Indeed, the amendment eventually adopted as the fifth prohibits expropriation except as accompanied by compensation or due process; even with compensation or due process, the property must be taken for public use - an eventuality unlikely to appeal to the average slave of the time.)

The time to discuss this separation of power - this check on central power - was in an early chapter of Mr Dahl's effort, and he failed even to hint at the power of the States, let alone to comment on their importance in balancing the power of the central government.

While Mr Dahl's book may have a certain curiosity value, to those who need to know how not to write political history, I found it worthless to anyone with an honest interest in his stated subject
