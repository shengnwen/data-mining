I was looking forward to reading this but was not able to finish the book. There is no hint of objectivity in this work. The sole purpose seems to be to praise blacks. Toward that end the book is a stream of quotes that have only one thing in common--they say something positive about blacks. There is little attempt to analyze or coordinate these quotes. Quotes will be taken from authors who disagree with many of Jackson's theories but that doesn't bother him as long as the quote meets his immediate needs. It appears that he'll use any quote from any source without attempt at analysis if it meets his limited objectives.  Jackson inserts his own unexamined opinions often without any attempt at analysis. Any work based solely an attempt to promote one race is doomed to failure and this is no exception
