As with other books of the Ardagh series on Europe, this book is useful to all those who are totally ignorant about Ireland.  However, Ardagh's prescritions for Ireland and its future are all modernistic.  Basically, he hopes Ireland will abandon its cultural past and join the grim narcissistic future that is in store for the rest of the modern world.  Traditions are to be gladly abandoned.  After reading three of Ardagh's series now, I am sure he is not a good man.  His future world is a vulgar, crass, materialistic one in which a New Class and theuraputic state takes care of the citizen's needs and desires.  I am sure he is a fan of the Clintons and the Blairs and Ireland's Mrs. Robinson
