Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love travel/adventure books, especially books at sea.  So I was really looking forward to this book.  I have never read a book more disappointing.  The writing is almost impossible to follow.  The setting (North Sea during Winter with tremendous storms) should have been spellbounding.  Instead most of the book involves long discourses between crewmembers as if no one is listening to the other person.  I believe only once does the author go above board and then only for a brief spell during a storm.  This book is not worth reading.
