Achebe was correct when he described this book as a sick book. It is. Just disgusting and trying to hard to be sophisticated, ie, "European". The description by Achebe that Armah's book reminds him of the Jean Paul Sartre novel where two characters sit around looking bored in a cafe in Paris and then in a burst of nihilistic energy decide to stab themselves to make some obscure point to each other. He's on the money. Unfortunately Armah came on the scene when publishing in Africa was not more discriminating
