I was vacationing in Kenya when I finished "Eldest" and needed a new book desperately.  The only book of interest I found a bookstore in Mombasa was Crossroads of Twilight.  For some reason I do not remember, I read all previous 9 books in the Wheel of Time epic (and I use that in the negative sense).  So I place the blame squarely on my shoulders for reading such an awful book.

Jordan creates a fascinating world, but after Book III, he gets lost in his own story.  Honestly, and without exaggeration, there is not ONE plot development in this book.  Yes, that's correct: not one thing of importance happens in the 800+ pages.  Unfortunately, that has become the norm for Robert Jordan.  If you just have to finish this series (I am officially at the "I could care less" stage), do yourself a favor and skip this book and go on to Book XI.
