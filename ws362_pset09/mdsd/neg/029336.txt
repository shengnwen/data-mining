I agreed with previous low rating reviewers, while this book is good motivation read it lacks detail on how to find and evaluate good business opportunities. I find it amusing how the Author denounced investment in equities and yet happy to put money in Options. Further, throughout the book (every couple of pages) the author shameless promotes his other books which I found very annoying. The repetitiveness of certain topics (i.e. how trillion was lost during 2000-03) forces me to skip pages of the book
