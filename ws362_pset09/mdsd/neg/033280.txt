I read this book after reading all the glowing reviews here and couldn't believe how much I hated it. It was long and dull,  repetitive and predictable, and it went NOWHERE. It was depressing and not in the way that I like. I actually hated the characters and felt a sort of repulsed pity for them...Their upbringing is NO excuse, either. There are millions of people who had similar backgrounds to this and still managed to become intelligent, sensitive people who are aware of the world around them and have many interests other than sex and drugs. To be fair, the story and characters do contain an unfortunate realism but...I sure don't want to spend my time reading about them. The narrative however flows nicely, the author's very talented..
