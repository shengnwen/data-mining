This book makes a lot of assumptions.  It assumes that the reader is EXTREMELY well versed in corporate tax advantages.  It assumes that the reader already owns a corporation.  It assumes that the book will be read with a dictionary of financial terms close at hand.  (It should be.  The book is poorly written, with key terms lacking adequate defenition.)  I support the Rich Dad series.  It is a great way for a beginner to get their feet wet.  This book assumes that the reader can already swim!  Even the seasoned incorporator would probably not be pleased with this book.  Tell you what, if you are considering buying this book, save yourself some money and just send me ten bucks.  I'll then call you (on my own dime) and summarize the book for you.  Oh, what the heck, I'll do it now, for free...surround yourself with a competent team of advisors
