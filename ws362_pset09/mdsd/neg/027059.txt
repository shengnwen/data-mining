This is a very basic, thinly-written guide for restaurant workers. A good part of the book seems to be spent identifying who does what in a restaurant; definitely not for anyone who has ever worked in an upscale restaurant. There are also plenty of cute illustrations to help drive the authors' points home to the reader; they were somewhat unnecessary and actually gave me the feeling of being something of a fluff tactic and an effort to fill up space. The book would certainly benefit those who had never worked in a restaurant or had only served/hosted/bartended/bussed in a more casual place. Do not buy this book if you have ever owned a crumber
