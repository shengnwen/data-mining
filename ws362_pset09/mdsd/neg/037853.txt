If "false memories" of childhood sexual abuse are truly false, then why aren't people having false memories en masse about other traumatic events in their lives, such as being beaten up, or having car accidents?

This book is nothing but a business card Loftis uses to hand out to defense attorneys with budgets large enough to pay for her testimony. 

If you want to know how trauma affects memory, try reading Traumatic Experience and the Brain by Dave Zeigler, Ph.D.
