This is a book that someone puts together so they can say they wrote a book on Roseville- it reminds me of those cheap Printer/Fax/Scanner machines, that claim to do three things but do nothing well. There's just not enough photos, information on Roseville styles, information on fakes, or enough information on anything, to allow you to Buy without risk. In addition, the author should offer FREE price updates on current Roseville market prices at his website, but he doesn't. THERE'S MORE FREE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET ABOUT ROSEVILLE, THAN THERE IS IN THIS BOOK
