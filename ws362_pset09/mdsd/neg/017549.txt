This is one of the best books I have ever read on the Revolutionary War.  Even though it is technically classified as a novel, it is accurately presented history. Mr. Shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book, and presented the historical events accurately, as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable.  The main participants in the Revolutionary War were presented not as gods, but as truly great and courageous men and women.  He also presented the details of battles, troop movements, condition of troops, and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events.  I have a better understanding of the Revolutionary War years than I have ever had, and would highly recommend this book to every American who would like to have a better understanding of the founding of our wonderful country.
