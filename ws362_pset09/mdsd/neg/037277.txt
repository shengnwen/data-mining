And I suggest anyone reading this take it with a grain of salt.
The opening disclaimer of what is and is not "anti-americanism" is nice, but definitions coming from Israelis does raise the hairs on the back on my neck since there has been such a concerted effort by some Israelis to seperate American from American. Not to mention the effort to seperate America from every one in the world except...guess who?...Israel.
I gave it two stars from being not totally overt in the popular gimmick of .."everyone hates you and even some Americans hate America but...drum role...it's not because of what you do, it's because your rich and free.

If you like your propaganda served straight up, bypass this book...on the other hand if you like served with umbrellas and a cherry on top this is for you
