This book was extensively researched.  Unfortunately, the end results of this research is a very dry and somewhat boring academic study of Chinatown gangs.  One feels that the author could have presented many &quot;real life&quot; stories of gangs and gang members.  Instead we read about statistics and academic views. What a disappointment!  I just wonder what a great book it might have been had there been more of a &quot;human&quot; look at the gangs
