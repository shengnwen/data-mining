This book may be just as the Author intended, an outline of how to set things in motion.  AND, that is all that this is.  Don't fool around with this one... you'd be better off going to the FDA site for their guidelines.

The CD is a jokingly filled example of templates that waste your time and you have to put more energy into them to configure for your uses.  

ALSO, there really is NO MASTER VALIDATION PLAN within this.  It's a poor example of going about things.  It may seem clear, but there is no flow to it whatsoever and it is confusing.

I've been in this field of Validation and MVP and medical for yrars... this is a pure MESS.  Soon, I might write a real book
