I'm a big SF fan, and it takes a lot for me not to like a book. But this was a truly painful read.  With the story set in the far future, Benford's challenge was to convey aspects of the universe that lie well beyond our conceptual horizon, such as multiple dimensions, creatures based on magnetic fields rather than molecules, and the "galactic mind".  In my opinion, he fails miserably; his prose is simply not literary enough to handle such difficult-to-put-into-words concepts.  Nothing about the descriptions "sing".  No grab-you-and-hold-you plot swings.  

In the Afterward, Benford writes that he might do a sequel. Hopefully it will be  cowritten by a "wow-can-that-guy-write!" type author like William Gibson.  At the very least, Benford needs a much more aggressive "you-can't-write-that...it-just-doesn't-make-sense!" editor.  A lot of the shortcomings of this book might have been headed off by such.

All in all, a real glad-I'm-finally-done-with-that-book! experience
