Enjoying her Amelia Peabody books written as Elizabeth Peters, I was really disappointed by this book.  Slow plot, transparent characters and a very whiny unpleasant main character.  I gave up half way through the audiobook.  Just didn't care and was tired of hearing the character get on an out-of-place feminist soapbox (unless this was placed in 1977 and I missed that).  Even in the South, we've advanced farther than anyone in this book
