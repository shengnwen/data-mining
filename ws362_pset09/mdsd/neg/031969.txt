A REAL downer. I realize Marlon Brando's life had many sadnesses, but this book really seemed to dwell on them. Mr Englund told of how HE thought. I wanted to hear how Mr Brando thought.
The ending really ticked me off...I saw no need for the story of Butch, the dog. 
A TOO SAD story.
I do agree with the review by Book Review Weekly.
