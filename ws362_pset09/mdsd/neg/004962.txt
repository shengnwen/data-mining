This book is about a Jewish girl named Hannah Green who flees from Spain in fear of the Spanish Inquisition after witnessing her mother being captured and burned alive at the stakes for being a Jew.  She comes to England with her father and lives as a Christian while following the Jewish religion in secrecy.  Through a chain of events she becomes a royal fool and a spy - for both Queen Mary and Elizabeth. 

Throughout the book Hannah talks about how she misses her mother and can still smell her mother's burning flesh from the stakes and then also professes her love for Queen Mary and what a wonderful woman she is.  It is well documented in history as well as this book about Queen Mary's burning of hundreds of non-Catholics at the stakes.  A practice that earned her the name - Bloody Mary.  The book is very sympathetic towards Queen Mary and portrays her as a virtuous woman who believed that she was burning people for their own sake - "only doing what she believed to be right in her heart".  

The fact that Hannah was living her life in fear of being discovered as a Jew and continued to deeply love Queen Mary was extremely unbelievable and ridiculous. I could not help but roll my eyes every time I read how much Hannah loved and admired Queen Mary.
