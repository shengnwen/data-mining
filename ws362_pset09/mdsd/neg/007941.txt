Unlike "How to play in traffic" or "how to play with your food"  this book is neither funny nor a Penn & Teller book.  It is what it claims to be on the cover, a book about cheating at cards.    The book starts out with an introduction by Penn Jillette who basically apologizes for putting his name on this book.

Penn tells how he owes the real author ( who's given the nom de plum Dickie Richard )  an enormous favor for helping Penn get started in his career.  The terms of this favor repayment were that Penn put his name on this book so people buy.  It worked at least once because I bought the book thinking it was something it is not.

The BOOK IS ABOUT CHEATING AT CARDS.  Not magic, not humor, not funny anecdotes or tricks ;  cheating at cards.  It is not written be Penn or Teller and has nothing to do with either of them.
