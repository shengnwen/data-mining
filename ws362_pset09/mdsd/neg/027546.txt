First of all, this book is riddled with errors.  There are typos up the wazoo!  Second, a lot of the optical path diagrams of the instruments are very confusing.  You cannot make heads or tales from the illustrations.  Skoog has yet to enter the 21st century because everything is in black and white.  The picture style is very bland and terribly out of date.  Skoog also tries desperately to be pedantic.  For example, he describes a computer monitor as a cathode ray tube output device.  If you like Atkins, you will love Skoog, or vice versa.  It's great as a reference but otherwise worthless.  Trust me when I say this book is too wordy, too confusing, and way too 'Cold War' era boring
