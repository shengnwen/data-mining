in plot depth and character development.  You'll read in other reviews the actually plot and character names, so I'll keep my review a discussion of execution only.  The book is not poorly written, but everything just seems  to happen without a smooth flow.  Yes, the sex scenes are inventive, but it  all seems rushed with more lust than passion.  I didn't find myself caring  about either character.  Plenty of sex but little romance.  I was actually  more interested in the peripheral characters who are denizens of Mac's bar;  who seemed more colorful and more real.  I was a little disappointed given  the really high marks this book got, but believe with more time the writer  will develop a polish that would make her characters a lot more believable  and replace her sex scenes with sensual love scenes
