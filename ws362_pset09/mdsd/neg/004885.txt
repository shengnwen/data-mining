It is obvious Gary Leon Hill is a writer of fiction. Dramatic writing for the stage does not transfer well to the page. I was not so much 'Shocked and Intrigued'as 'Shocked and Disgusted'at his portrayal of victims of suicide as having done so because a 'spirit' has taken them over and made them do it. According to G.L.H. drug/drink addicts are 'asking for it' and Psychiatric hospitals are full of the possessed.
Is this Victorian attidudes or Creative writing? The latter, I think.
Stick to writing plays, Mr. Hill, and don't insult my intelligence or the memory of many a poor soul who took their life due to whatever unfortunate circumstances they found themselves in
