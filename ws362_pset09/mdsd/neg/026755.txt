I just began this book and I'm sure I'm premature in writing a review but I feel I must get the truth about this book out immediately.  This books is written strongly from a Church of the Latter-day Saints (LDS) slant.  Many of the quotations come from LDS "prophets" which is more than troubling to me as a Christian woman.  I'm trying to overlook this and gleen some help from book but it's difficult.  How can Amazon write a description and not mention this book has a strong religious slant?  Ugh!  I wasn't interested in getting indoctinated by another faith -- just improving my relationship with my husband.  BE CAREFUL
