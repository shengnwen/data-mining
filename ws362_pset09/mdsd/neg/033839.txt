I bought my first CRC book (Handbook of Math Tables) about 40 years ago.  I used it until it fell apart, then have bought a few more copies over the years, along with a few of the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics and the excellent Engineering Science book.  I've always had good regard for CRC's publications.

However, reading what happened between the author and CRC soured my attitude towards CRC.  While there's nothing wrong with making a profit, their behavior seems excessive.  Based on what I've read, I've decided to not purchase any more CRC products.  If you feel the same way, encourage your colleagues to do the same.  I'd like to feel that CRC won the battle, but lost the war.  

Finally, I haven't used the web site's material a lot, but when I did, it was quite good.  I suggest going with another poster's suggestion of using the web, but not buy the book
