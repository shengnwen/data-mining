At first I thought the history of women's sexuality in this book was interesting, but once I read that the author recommends fantasies that include incest, I threw the book in the trash.  She states that "fantasies aren't sick; only hurtful behavior is sick."  In my opinion incest as a fantasy is sick no matter how you look at it.  Other than that the book had nothhing new in it, stating that women should not depend on a man for pleasure and they should use vibrators, masturbation and pornography to please themselves during sex.  Don't waste your money on this book
