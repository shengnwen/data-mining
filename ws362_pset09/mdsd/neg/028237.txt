This book might be good for people that have never opened flash but for anyone that even knows a bit of flash stay away. It is a real boring read, well for me anyway. It did more of just explaining icons in the program, which is cool, but if you bought flash, you can open the help file for that.

The writer doesn't seem extremely proficient in Flash which is scary to think. Flash is a complicated program, and for a book being close to 600 pages, it might get you past the toolbars. 

I ran through this book in about a day with it really teaching me nothing new or anything for that matter
