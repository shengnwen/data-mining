The author does hit on many of the common arguments both for and against gun control issues and attempts to clarify both sides positions but in doing so he fails to answer the title question of the book. In contrast to the closing statement in the book description; "Casting aside ideology and abstractions, he cautions against the belief that there exists some gun control solution which, had we the political will to seize it, would substantially reduce violent crime.", the author suggests that several gun-controls be enacted while acknowledging that there is little if any evidence that the controls would have any effect at all. 

The book is a good indtoduction to the debate for someone with little or no understanding of the major points but the closing recommendations appear unfounded
