There's nothing really bad about this slim book, but the writing is bland and cliches abound.  I found the book neither enlightening nor funny.  I'm a big golf fan and like Peter Jacobsen as a player.  I always like to see him win or do well.  I think that the problem with the book is that Peter is simply too nice a guy, at least in print (and that does not mean to imply he is not otherwise a nice guy), to be very interesting
