I usually read novels, thick and thin, within a week; but this book took months. I couldn't stand to read more than a few pages at a time because it was just that terribly written. It was probably one of the worst books I've ever read. I'd much rather read a boring textbook on math theory than read this again.  I don't understand how it won the awards it did because I don't think it deserved it.  The progression was dreadfully slow, and many times the author was redundant and appears to be just filling space. Also, I don't think it dealt much with apartheid at all, but more so about a dysfunctional family in general.  And Michael's rage and his driving force (in the end) was really appalling and so fitting with the sensationalism in society and the media today.  This book was rubbish and I wish there was a 0 star rating because it definitely isn't even worth one. Don't waste your time
