The problem with Weil's book is that, if you pick it up in order to read about what is involved in trying to build a new, low-cost space launch vehicle,  it doesn't tell you very much at all. Rather, it is a colorful "human interest" story about the people of Rotary Rocket Company, who tried to build such a vehicle, but failed in that particular attempt. For those who are seriously interested in the question of how to get from where we are today to a vehicle that can make space affordable and accessible, this book will disappoint. She treats the whole enterprise as a science fiction fantasy, completely lacking in any rational justification. Weil fails to make any of the obvious comparisons with the people and ventures responsible for building the aviation industry - literally from the ground up -  in the early years of the last century. Some of them were successful, many failed, and many kept on trying until they did succeed. The aviation pioneers were considered eccentric at best, or crazy at worst. Maybe some of them were, but millions of airline passengers benefit from their craziness on a regular basis. If you like to read about interesting people, then maybe you'll enjoy this book. If you want insight into the many technical and business issues that need to be addressed in the process of building spaceships, don't expect much here
