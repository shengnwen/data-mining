Having read the three books in the series I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that they are a pleasant enough read.....but the worrying aspect of many of Bruce's assertions is how often he &quot;doubts&quot; what he is experiencinge.g. when he is sitting eating a meal in a  restaurant he makes an imaginative voyage to the site of the Oklahoma  bombing and performs a rescue of tormented and lost souls who have been  killed there and he passes them on to helpers in the other side..... very  good and laudible but he expresses &quot;doubts&quot;..he has been honest  enough in his &quot;Afterlife Knowledge&quot; site that he has only had a  few &quot;fully blown classic&quot; OBE's in his life...all the other  &quot;trips&quot; have been done by his form of &quot;Creative  Imagination&quot; and so on...I only worry that this &quot;Hey isn't it fun  and really helpful to save souls by imagining, ( and he usues the word  &quot;pretending&quot;! ) that they are here and we are with them&quot;  approach will only give succour to the sceptics...I hate to be awkward but  if I was in a state of distress in the afterlife environment I would far  rather get help from someone having a &quot;fully blown&quot; OBE rather  than a fairly easy &quot;creative/pretended imagination&quot;...In saying  all this negative stuff I have to state that I think,p[aradoxically, his  &quot;pretended/creative imaginations ,might actually help a LOT of people  get into the OBE mode...as those of us who are fortunate enough to have  OBE'd we are aware that such imaginings actually do help in this  regard...but of course we do not want to get &quot;stuck&quot; at that  level......it isn't very satisfactory or veriical to ourselves let alone  anyone else....so sadly, I cannot recommend the series very highly although  they are a better deal than a lot of the NewAge rubbish that is flooding  the market...
