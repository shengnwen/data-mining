Being new to stevia and very confused about how to cook with it, the types of stevia available and the sugar/stevia conversion proportions, I was eager to get this book.  I was very disappointed. First off, the book seems light on both information about stevia and recipes.  But more important, as a few other reviewers have noted, the recipes that are contained in the book are either so unappealing you have no desire to make them, or don't taste very good once you do make them.  For example, I wanted a few good pudding recipes.  The butterscotch pudding contains 4 cups of yams.  The lemon pudding has yellow squash as its base.  Now, I'm all for vegetables, but when I'm eating dessert, I want dessert.  Not squash puree. I made a spaghetti squash recipe that had proportionally so much stevia it was sickening.  I'm a good and experienced cook. These recipes were awful.  Not recommended
