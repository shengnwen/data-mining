     The funny thing about reading these reviews is that everyone focuses on the break in at the end.  Even many pages before, all the monsters and burglars have guns and guns are a part of the "pictures".  The story line could have been cute---My husband is the biggest advocate of gun ownership and has quite a collection, however the very first thing you teach a child is never ever to point even a toy gun at anyone, especially their head.  The idea of a child watching their mother being held with a gun to her head and threatened to blow her brains out, not once but twice is totally not permissable.  Not even if you are talking about a big doggie and his bad manners!  Guns have no place on page illustrations of a child's book!!
