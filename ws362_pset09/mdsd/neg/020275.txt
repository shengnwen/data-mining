This book is OK if you actually have a product to sell. If your business, like mine, is a service business this book offers little help in creating "Off the Wall" marketing ideas. At least 70% of the book involves high dollar radio, TV, and other expensive marketing ideas. Very little practical examples of non budget busting ideas..
