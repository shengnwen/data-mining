Its kinda stressful for me to be the first to review this book, especially that I rated it as 1 star, I was fortunate enough to find it in our school library before I buy it, I was looking for a book that covers dental photography, especially basic techniques, use of mirrors "occlusal and buccal", required photos for case presentation etc..., the book title and cover design is very tempting, and now that I've read this book, I can say the cover is the best part of it, unfortunately the book is full of junk, not a single useful piece of info, the author didn't cover any technique used for intraoral photography and use of mirrors, book was full of text about color and space that is unrelated to the subject" dental photography" and more over you will find portraits of semi nude model, I am still trying to find an explanation for such picture to appear in this book, the author was "explaining" techniques for portraits in studio, ignoring the fact that he didn't mention anything about the TEETH! and for some reason he was using Leica 105mm as a key to success in these pictures, this book is full of distractions and useless information, if you are looking for a good book about dental photography i would certainly recommend Mastering Dental Photography by Wolfgang Bengel, unfortunately this book is out of print but you should be able to find it used on amazon.
