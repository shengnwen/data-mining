Several reviews are right on!  Some think any photograph of a vulva makes a photograph "porn", I however do not.  In my opinion, most of the poses and locations are standard, not too imaginative, but not to bland.  The problem really lies in the reproduction!  As has been mentioned, the black and white is too middle gray. Compounded by her bland expression.  It is my suspicion that all of these photos were digital and color originally.  If I am correct, the artist would have been far better served had this book been printed in vivid color, and every shot an 8x10 print.  Instead, the poor quality B&W print causes a major loss in detail, and makes this a book not worth owning. (No matter how pretty she looks on the cover.)  Next time, full color, full size, and smile occassionally
