About 6 years ago I saw a 20/20 feature about this generation's greatest author Thomas Pynchon, and how incredibly acclaimed and mysterious he is.  So I figured I would check out his work.  I had begun reading fairly intensely and wanted to see what all the buzz was about.  I picked Vineland because it looked intriguing, and hey, anything that features lesbian ninjas can't be bad right??

Well, unfortunately the 20/20 segment was far more intriguing than this book.  I honestly don't understand what all the buzz is about.  Maybe it's because I didn't live through the 60's, or didn't grow up in Humbolt county.  But I certainly don't "get" Pynchon at all.

The man has an incredible imagination, but the problem is that the stories he concocts lack almost everything that I treasure in literature.  The characters are quirky, but I don't care about them.  The circumstances are ridiculous, but rarely to the point beyond a half-amused chuckle.  The "plot" wanders all over the place but ultimately leads nowhere.  If there's a point or theme that the author is trying to convey, it's hidden far beneath the depth which I would care to dig.  Looking back, I can't remember the characters, or the resolution.  I just remember it being a very disjointed story.  It's sad to me that someone with Pynchon's obvious mental and literary prowess, can't use them to write something that is moving, or teaches you something.  Something that sticks with you for life.

My recomendation to people who are considering reading Pynchon: if you like Tom Robbins, go ahead and try Pynchon.  For those who want something a bit more substantive, read John Irving.  

Note: It IS possible for some of us to enjoy Stephen King, as well as, the acclaimed "literary" scribes like Saramago, McEwen, Umberto Eco etc.  It just takes a little less pretension, and an open mind.  

...and for the record, the lesbian ninjas were a big disapointment.
