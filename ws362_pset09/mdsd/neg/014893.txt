I was appalled at this book, I grew up on a ranch close to the one she writes about.  Her facts about ranch life are mostly untrue and I believe she was on a vindictive rout of the people on this ranch.  I do understand that she has since retracted much of the book, but after she took all her 15 minutes of fame.  What has happened to her. I was furious so see such a blantant piece of writing get so much play.  There are such good books about ranch life she should never again create any piece of writing and expect the public to be so duped
