I have to wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers...to be fair the multiplication information that *is* contained in this book are useful and some of the pictures using the chocolate bar can help students. However, the art references by far overshadow the math lesson and as I was reading it, I found myself distracted and confused...and I'm an adult!

The hershey's fractions book is much better than this one. I thought I'd get the set and now I'm glad I didn't--this one is worth skipping over
