Caleb Carr's novel the Alienist is thirteen years old now.  I'm reading it for the first time.  What's struck me most is the vague feeling I've read this plot all before (ahem, Thomas Harris), just that Carr's deposited the Silence of the Lambs into 1890s NYC.  While much is made of the historical setting and actual characters, I don't thing they quite ring authentic, as opposed to gerrymandered characterizations of post-modern types of who we wish these characters to be.  Being a bit of a Roosevelt buff, I must admit Roosevelt comes across as if Carr read Morris' stupendous biography and watched "The Wind and the Lion", throughing in every possible detail he could just to show the reader, yes, yes, I have done my homework!

The brutality of the murders is definitely unsettling, and its delivered a bit too much like a gratuitous dime store novelist as opposed to the writings of a NY Times journalist in 1919.  The voice is inauthentic.

But, back to the pageturning plot, Carr's action moves quickly, and he leaves off at the end of each chapter with a suitable cliffhanger.  He's too inauthentic, a bit didactic with his message (prejudice bad!  psychology good! all criminal activity can be understood!), but fastpaced enough that you'll probably be sucked in.  Only afterwords will you realize that it was the seasoning, and not the meat, that hid the fact that this was all fluff.

Still, its tons better than Matthew Pearl's super-derivative pop-historical trash
