I was expecting a lot more anecdotes about the NBA and its players.  An inordinate amount of this book is taken up with discussing Red's post-retirement weekly roundtable lunch and the various participants.  Hearing about a bunch of middle aged and old guys sitting around eating chow mein and idolizing Red is not very entertaining.  

I have no doubt that all of Red's adventures in the NBA would make a fantastic book.  Unfortunately, this is not that book.
