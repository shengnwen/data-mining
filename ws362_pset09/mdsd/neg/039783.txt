I am a serious poker player and am well read in finance (CFA), so i assumed the book would be a natural fit for my interests.  However, I have to agree with the other reviewers who said "the book is confused" and the author's "editor did not reign him in properly".  It feels like the author is just rambling on without a specific point or idea.  It covers too many topics (off the top of my head: hand values, poker history, put-call parity, utility curves, psychology, horse races, society and wealth, then he adds some personal stories).  All those topics may have been feasible if they were weaved together better.  Unfortunately, he covers some topics superficially and some in painstaking detail.  Some areas are written for an audience unfamiliar with poker/finance, then other areas dive into advanced nuances.  The book is just not edited well enough to be a satisfying read
