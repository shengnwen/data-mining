I read this book long time ago and it reads like a dictionary.
He takes the subject and does not attempt to help you in this HUGE industry. It is like reading 10 dictionaries of French, without actually taking a real lesson. If you like to learn trading look for Toby Crabel's articles or Linda Raschke. They are professional money managers and traders. Not authors.Not self promotors.Last,Jim Rodgers told a conference that John does not trade actively and does not have a record of outperforming the markets
