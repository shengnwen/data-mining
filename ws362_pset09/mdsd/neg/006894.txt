I used to enjoy Iris Johansen.  This book is a super natural psychic thing. The book flap describes it as "psychological thriller", but it's not.  If you enjoy the super natural type of book (Stephen King, etc) then this is good.  If, like me, you dislike that type of book, STAY AWAY from this one.  The main character Kerry can get into peoples minds.  The other main character also does that.  Yes,that is the basis of this book
