This book appears to have been hastily written and edited to take advantage of the release of the movie "Munich". It is poorly written and the telling of several events uses a differnt set of facts than most of the other books on the subject.  This book is also very poorly edited. For example, chapter 21 is date stamped September 8, 1972 but tells of the events of December 8, 1972. In other chapters a character is referred to as Sylvia Rafael and then in later chapters as Sylvia Raphael. Small matters perhaps, but such lapses undermine the author's attention to detail and concern of the accuracy of his story. And, this book requires that you accept the veracity of the author.  Throughout the book the author makes unsupported statements of facts that he apparently just expects you to accept.  For example, in chapter 31 the author states that he can now tell the reader that Dr. Wadi Haddad was assissanated by the means of poisoned chocolates rather than dieing of natural causes as has heretofore been believed. However, he offers no explaination of how the chocolates were delivered to the good Dr. through the complex world of a terrorist or how anyone could have been assured that only the Dr. would eat them.

There are a number of good books dealing with this general subject but this is not one of them. I recommend that you read either "Vengeance" or "The Hunt for the Red Prince" for well written books dealing with the general subject.
