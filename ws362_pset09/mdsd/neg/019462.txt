I really enjoy the Falco novels, but this one was disappointing.  I purchased it soon after it was published, started it, but left it unfinished until recently.  I finished it and started Time to Depart which returns to Rome.  I feel that Last Act leaves much to be desired, but enjoy the other titles in the series.  Keep up the good work
