I've spent nearly 20 years doing mergers and acquisitions.  I keep up with all the M&amp;A books on the market. First off, the basic content here is good and its difficult to disagree with the ideas.  But, mostly they are just ideas. If you tried to do everything the authors talk about it would take forever to get anything done, if you ever got a deal done.  Some things sound good in theory but don't pass muster in the real world. This book is like that. Its hard to believe the authors have much real world experience, because so much of what they recommend lacks the ring of practicality
