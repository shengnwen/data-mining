The book started off great.  I was immediately satisfied that the author was wise enough to kill off the Seven-Chakotay relationship.  But that's about it for the whole story.

The story becomes absurd very, very quickly, and reads more like a soap opera draft script than the usual quality of ST literature.

As i'm a rabid ST fan, I can't give this book a 1, but it was close
