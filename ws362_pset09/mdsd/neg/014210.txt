To think someone actually wrote this book. Worse yet is that the reviews with 5 stars are bunched together to create the real picture of what evil lurks out there.  Fathers AND mothers ARE important to our children.  To even think otherwise is to deny our humanity.  What does this author think should happen to these boys that are being raised without dads should do when they become dads and the mother decides their being a dad is not important.  what a web and circle of evil this author weaves.  If you love our children, both male and female, don't even waste a dime on this book.  Take your child out for an ice cream.  At least ice cream has value.  My copy of this book found its home in the rightful place: "The Trash"
