I had hoped for much more from my first Cherry Adair book - the recommendations had been so good.  But the writing is simplistic, the characters lack dimension, the "suspense" is convuluted and not even remotely realistic, and the sex is formulaic.  Silly me, to want a little romance in my romance novels!  It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it, but I'll stick to Susan Andersen, Linda Howard and Karen Robards for my romantic thrillers from now on
