I ordered two of the authors book's based on raving reviews from a friend, not actually this title but another. I ordered this one as well and must say what a total waste of money. The first section of the book is about the authors travels and how she claims she was visited by the Virgin Mary...umm yeah right, there isn't much practicle help in this book at all, only her boring tales of travel around the globe. The second part of the book is a list of goddesses and their qualities. don't bother with this book, it a time waster and $$$ waster I can't believe Hay house published this work of junk. After reading this authors other works I do feel she is very very over rated and has taken the angel working brigade thing a little too far and people have jumped on this band wagon if that wasn't the case this author would be unknown because her writing is terrible. The misleading promises on the back of the book should be taken off as well "Manifest anything you want instantly"...I didn't find anything in the book even about *helping* your life, it was all about her travels...Like I said a total joke..I won't be so easily led when buying books by spiritual workers again.
