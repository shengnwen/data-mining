I had a very hard time getting through the 154 pages and almost couldn't make it.  Without a doubt Howard knows a lot about WWI, but he does not write in a way that I can enjoy reading him.  It took me a long time to finish this book and came out pretty empty handed.  James Stokesbury (A Short History of WWI) tackles the job superbly if you want an introduction to WWI
