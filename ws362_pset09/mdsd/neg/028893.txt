I was hoping that this book would provide me with some insight into how individuals are actually affected by war, but this book is nothing more than a forum for the author to express his blatent anti-war opinions.  As a psychologist myself, I found this book to contain no real psychology, and the author's statements and accusations were not bolstered by any solid research.  If you are interested in reading about the true psychology of war, I would not recommend this book.
