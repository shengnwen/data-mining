This book chronicles a few years in the childhood of a young girl named  Hattie whose mother is a severe manic depressive.  Unlike other children,  Hattie and her brother, Freddy, operate more as caretakers than as  children.  They watch their mother and act according to her state of mind  for that specific day.  Pearl, the cook and maid, acts as surrogate mother,  nurturing the siblings with care and love as they grow older, something  their mother has never been able to do.  Pearl also acts as guardian to the  mother, keeping her from leaving the house in a frenzy when she is manic  and from killing herself when she is depressed.  Although this book was  easily read in a day, it was disappointingly bland and somewhat  anti-climactic.  I can't place exactly what it was - it just didn't build  up to a page-turning &quot;what-will-possibly-happen-next&quot; mindset and  I grew bored and apathetic towards the end which is highly unusual for me.   I would recommend it as a good, thought-provoking, informative book on  manic depression but certainly not as entertaining fiction
