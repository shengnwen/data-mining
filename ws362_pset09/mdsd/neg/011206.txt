I had to put this book down several times before being able to slog through it.  Expositional and boring dialogue, ho-hum plot, and unlikeable characters. When Bourne's wife has the stupidity to follow him to Paris to "save" him only to admonish him for being a stone cold killer in front of his colleagues, it becomes laughable.  Couple that with the fact Bourne has to do everything for the bimbo, including grabbing her purse from the gunshot scene at the hotel and you almost wish she'd been offed. How is this tripe possible from the man who wrote The Aquitane Progression?  It truly seems like another writer.  This book is completely unworthy of it's predecessor, The Bourne Identity
