Just a note to the reviewer who mentioned Hayek's *Constitution of Liberty*, and the postscript "Why I am not a Conservative."  That reviewer clearly did not read, or did not understand what Hayek was talking about.  Hayek's point was that he was not a conservative in the original sense of the word.  In the US the terms liberal and conservative have lost their original meaning, because in the true sense, both Republicans and Democrats are liberals.  So before you bash the author for her characterization, you should make sure you know what you're talking about
