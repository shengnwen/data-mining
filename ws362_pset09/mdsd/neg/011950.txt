... I was disappointed when I actually got the book. It may be good for the 1-3-year-old set, but my 4-year-old is much more sophisticated about butterflies than this book addresses. For the same money, there are alot of other books that have more beautiful artwork. Don't waste your money-check this one out from the library instead
