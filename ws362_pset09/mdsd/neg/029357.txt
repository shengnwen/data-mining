I agree with the comment earlier that there is no why in the end.  Every reader wants to know why he committed such a heinous act.  If it is greed, greed is too simple for this book because everybody is greedy in one way or another.  Please, next time Grafton, let us in on the reason for a person's demise, especially if you have the audacity to take us back 30 years.
