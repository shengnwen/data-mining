I was disappointed in this book.  It is geared more toward adoptive and foster care families rather than others who are looking for some fun ideas to share with their family.  I only got one or two workable ideas out of this book.  For people looking for simple fun things to do everyday and on special days, I would definitely suggest instead &quot;The Book of New Family Traditions&quot; by Meg Cox.   That book has a lot wonderful ideas about celebrating milestones and theme nights and funny things to do and serious things too
