This book is great if you have one of the old machines that non one seels any more, but it's worthless forthe owner of a new TiVo. The author obviously knows what he's talking aboiut, but it doesn't matter any more. I sent this back and bought the Von Hagen book, which had the Series @ and tall of the old Series 1 info
