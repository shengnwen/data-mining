     The basic problem with this economics textbook is that Mankiw is unable or unwilling to present an analytic,technically sound exposition ,at the Principles level, of the fundamental theoretical difference separating Keynesian and Neoclassical(Classical)economists in 1936 or today.These differences appear in the paradox of thrift.I have already covered this in my review of Samuelson's classic 1948 first edition.Basically ,neoclassicals argue that the economy is naturally selfadjusting under conditions of resource scarcity.Assuming two types of goods and industries,consumption and investment,any type of private sector miscalculation and/or forecast error of the composition of the product mix that businessmen sell is self correcting by means of inventory adjustment.Too many consumption goods and too few investment goods will lead to an inventory adjustment via the Invisible Hand that results in less consumption goods and more investment goods.There is an inverse relationship between the two sectors of the economy.Unfortunately,such an inverse relationship only obtains if the economy is operating on the boundaries of both the static and dynamic production possibilities frontier(ppf) curves.This requires that business forecasts of their capital stock(factories,plants and equipment)are always correct.In general,the private sector is operating in the interior of both ppf's due to the problem of insufficient investment in infrastructure because the capital stock can't be adjusted in the face of constant innovation,advance,and technological change.The physical capital stock is cast in concrete;it is irreversible,irrevocable and industry specific.This explains why investment is unstable,volatile and unpredictable over time while consumption is stable,predictable and nonvolatile.There is no tradeoff between the two kinds of very different goods.It is interesting that the "real options" theory of Dixit and Pindcyk has come to many of the same conclusions without citing either Samuelson or Keynes.However, there is a solution.Increased public sector investment in needed infrastructure will,through the multiplier process,generate additional income and sales that will create positive expectations of future expected profits for the private sector.This will lead the economy back towards the boundary of both ppf's where the neoclassical marginalist calculus of rational utility and profit maximizers would again become operational.This is the message of both Paul Samuelson and John Maynard Keynes.Mankiw never presents this position in a coherent fashion anywhere in his textbook.The result is that users of Mankiw's book will never have any idea of what set off the Keynesian Revolution and why macroeconomics is splintered
