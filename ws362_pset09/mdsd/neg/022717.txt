This book contains a series of essays by investigative journalists detailing some of their successes but mostly failures in getting some of their more controversial pieces published.

It is a spotty work. The paranoia of some essays leap out at the reader from every page; others are more reasoned and convincing. Some of the essays make valid points, but the underlying elitism turned me off.

The book's major villain is capitalism, profits being the dirty word that prevents the various authors from imposing their version of truth reality and importance on the idiots who have the temerity to disagree.

In the hands of most of the essayists, the constitutional right to a free press has somehow been transformed into a constitutional requirement that all newspapers must publish not what the majority of its readers want to read, but what self styled elitist literati feel should be fed to the public.

While an interesting read, the book can't be taken seriously.
