Some books are vast in scope and others are half-vast. This is sadly a rather half-vast effort. Reading it I couldn't help but think that the author was given an advance, a deadline, and a minimum word count to meet and that's it. Otherwise it's hard to understand how something so unorignial and meandering ended up in book form. 
That said, I'll commend the author for doing the institutional and market research, most of which was probably valid, but I'll ask him at the same time why it felt necessary to rehash the work of so many other solid Wall Street writers who've said all this already, and certainly more succinctly.
Buy this if your curiousity is overwhelming, but not until you've crossed everything off your "to read" list first.
