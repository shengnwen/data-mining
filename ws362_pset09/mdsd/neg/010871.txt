I purchased this book after it was recommended to a friend of mine.
While reading it I felt as if I had found the cure for my PMS and heavy/painful periods. I ran out and got some Natural Progesterone Cream that was recommended in the book, and started using it.
Well all I can say is to proceed with caution. After using it for just a short time, I began to have a re-occurance of my depression symptoms. I have since stopped using the cream and am slowly returning to my normal self. When I did a net search on the side effects of too much progesterone I found many people with my same experience. This book is very one sided, and he does not talk much about the negative aspect of using the cream.
Please consult with a physician before starting this stuff on your own, or at least be aware of the possible side effects so that you can stop the cream as soon as you see them. This book has helped many people, I guess. But I'm not one of them
