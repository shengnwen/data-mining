I have tried to read this book. I read for 150 pages before I realized that this book is not for me. There are many reviewers who have abundant praises for Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty. I cannot count myself as one of them. Perhaps I have not read enough novels, by Austen, Dickens, or other British writers to understand the significance of this latest addition. I almost expected to be regaled with politics of Thatcher; instead, I plodded through descriptions after descriptions.

I might be wrong, but I got no sense that these descriptions were supposed to highlight class differences in British society. Perhaps there were allusions that I, by virtue of not reading those alluded, could not understand. Perhaps it was the dialogue that shows class difference between how people talk. Still, I did not know enough about British society to understand this humor.

Therefore, I did not like the book. You can say I am too unsophisticated. It does not matter. I did not see anything that might be timeless, or timely to a generation born in the 24th century
