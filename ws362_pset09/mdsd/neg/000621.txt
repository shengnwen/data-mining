Dershowitz is supposed to be a college professor, yet he consistently cuts and pastes sources from Joan Peters fraud, From Time in Memorial.  Norman Finkelstein all proves without any shadow of doubt that this book has manipulated figures from prominent Jewish historian Benny Morris.  Finkelstein debated Dershowitz on Democracy Now about this issue.  Despite Dershowitz's constant interruptions I believe it is the most intertaining debate I have ever seen.  Please download it from Finkelstein's website if you have time.  Dershowitz is just one example of people contributing to the distortion history and creating a fog to the real crisis in Palestine.
