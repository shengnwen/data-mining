These are revised remarks since my comments about "Prediabetes" and "Stop Diabetes" being the same book.  I got them both and felt somewhat duped.

Gretchen did contact me to explain the Prediabetes is a second edition of Stop Diabetes.  I wish it said that on the cover.

The book(s) info about stopping the progression of diabetes is great, so I do recommend either of these books.  It is well written in a style that's easy to understand.  Just don't get both books; they're essentially identical
