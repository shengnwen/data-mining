 
This book is an embarrassment.  It is cheap for a reason: This little book is all of 96 pages long, including the introduction.

The best edition of Sun Tzu is the Special Edition that contains two English versions; one simple version, like this one without commentary or notes and another version that the complete, fully documented Giles's Edition and, in addition, it has the text in Chinese Characters.

If you are going to spend the time and effort to read and understand Sun Tzu, you may as well spend a few dollars more and have a book that is worth the money.
