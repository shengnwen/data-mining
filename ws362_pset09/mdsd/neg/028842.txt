This book is only 184 pages and could have been much shorter. If you believe that human suffering is acceptable because you deserve it and because, eventually, you will see it as the "birth pains" to a suffering-free heavenly afterlife; and if you think that Jesus's sacrifice makes your passage from this world to the afterlife possible, then you're already a Christian, and this book is unlikely to add anything to your existing beliefs. Suffering will continue to be, for such a reader, one part "mystery" and one part "punishment." 

I find this extremely inadequate and rather glib to boot: "Oh, yes, it's a pity your child was paralyzed. But soon enough, if you follow god [cross-talk about whether faith or works is more important], you'll die and go to a magical place where your child's paralysis will no longer bother you or your child." In other words, the resolution to the problem of suffering is that suffering doesn't matter, when regarded from the "proper" perspective. At its worst, suffering is like a double-fault you commit on the way to winning Wimbledon, or the blister you get from walking the aisle to a wonderful marriage. Whatever you've suffered doesn't count for anything, because this world doesn't count for anything.  

If you're not already a Christian, I am even more sure this book will add nothing to your understanding of the origin and justification of suffering. If you're a naturalist, you'll realize the problem is a phony one springing from incompatible supernatural assumptions: that god exists at all; that god is all-loving, all-knowing, and all-powerful; that part of god's creation (the world) has suffering in it, and part of it doesn't (heaven). If you're a supernaturalist from a school other than Kreeft's, maybe you'll get a kick out of watching your assumptions and their implications duel with his. I found this book failed to take me anywhere I hadn't already been.
