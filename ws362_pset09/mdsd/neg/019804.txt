Attn all students! Amazon promises to send books by a specific date then changes the dates without your consent. Trying to get a refund is a nightmare. Be prepared to get stuck without the book and still get the bill. Customer service is outsourced to India and is no help even if you could understand them. 4 wks and counting and still no promised refund. This not the only time this has happened.The issue is not with the seller it is Amazon
