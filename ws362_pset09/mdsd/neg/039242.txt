I agree with some other reviewers.  Much of the information in this book is seriously outdated.  As a native Chicagoan, I was surprised to see that the China Club was listed as a hot spot.  Well, I hate to break it to you,  but the club doesn't exist anymore.  As a matter of fact, the China Club  was turned into residential lofts at least 3 years ago!   Overall, this is  an adequate reference guide, but double check your info before embarking on  a trip
