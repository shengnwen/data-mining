Somehow, if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing, I wouldn't have bought it.  He talks extensively about competition rigs, rules, etc. which I had no interest in. I have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns. Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines
