If the demented 13-year-old offspring of the unholy union between David Lynch and William S. Burroughs were given pen and paper and told to write a trippy story splattered (and I don't choose that word lightly) with blood, gore, zombies and sex, Baby Jesus Butt Plug is what you'd get.

Unfortunately the outcome will still suffer from the story telling of a hormone laden 13-year-old boy.  To illustrate, imagine a depraved pre-pube making up a wild sex-fi story on the fly, while his wide-eyed buddies eat up his every absurd word.  It's stream-of-consciousness story telling with all manner of shock and awe thrown in for effect.

On the other hand, the beginning and end of the story contain flashes of satirical brilliance, biting humor and quirky sci-fi-esque fun to offset the crude writing and story line.  One passage that I found particularly clever and amusing is when the narrator talks of getting a free Baby Jesus Butt Plug from a couple who just want to make sure the BJBP goes to a good home.  He says, "And when they said `a good home' all they really meant was they didn't want to give them to anyone who would stick them in their butts".

I wish Mellick had pursued the socio-religious angle of owning a BJBP that began to take form in the first third of the book.  Or he could have explored the conundrum of losing oneself physically and mentally in a sea of one's own clones.  Either way would have made for a much more powerful and coherent statement.  As it stands, the story begins to provoke and stimulate but quickly deteriorates into a menage-a-bizarre story of teen male angst, desire and fear.

I've read other Mellick works and know that in a lengthier format he can make you blush, throw-up and ponder in the matter of one short paragraph.  So I am comfortable in saying that this is not his best.  However, if you want a unique insight into the stuff of which adolescent boys wet dreams are made, then Baby Jesus Butt Plug will take you there.
