Vanishing Voices does a good job of showing how larger languages are destroying smaller ones, and the methods of language death.  This is all pretty much common knowledge.  However, the authors fail in their attempt to give a reason as to WHY language death is something with which we should be concerned.  The only argument they put forth is in a ecological/enviromental analogy, which says that biological diversity is good and stable, therefore, linguistic diversity must.  However, they only go part way in their analogy and reject natural selection for languages.  They also show that linguistic diversity corresponds to environmental diversity, but state this has nothing to do with the inexcessiblity of the areas.  The violin-playing and loaded words are hard to stomach if you are looking for good social science.  I would not suggest the book unless you are an ecological activist wanting to try to link your cause with "saving cultures" or with yet another critique of the West
