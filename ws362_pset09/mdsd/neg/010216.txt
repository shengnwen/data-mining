This is a pitifully obvious attempt to CASH in on the manga craze. The Comics Journal never covered manga until recently and mostly just scoffed at it. Now they have a huge book supposedly devoted to it. Yet the COMICS SECTION features a bunch of indy cartoonists and  TCJ regulars who don't draw manga at all!! 

With the exception of Tezuka the artists covered here are not terribly noteworthy in the scene as a whole and just further the feeling that they just slapped this book together to drain some wallets and ride the trend. 

This is just another crass attempt to cash in by a snobby magazine that has traded its elitism in for pure greed
