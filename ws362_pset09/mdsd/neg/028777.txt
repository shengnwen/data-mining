I know that I am supposed to laugh at the reference format of this book, but after 5 pages I had to set it down because my attention drifted.  Let's face it guys, reading an encyclopedia (even a jokey one) is just plain boring.  It's also old soup - warmed over. Lester Bangs did these kinds of insider jokes 30 years ago and the authors here are doing nothing more than the usual hipster plagiarism of a better dead writer's work.  

Daly and Kamp are probably very clever to some (see the suspect gushing reviews above) but to me, their humor is as dull as the people that they are mocking.  Perhaps they have just fallen prey to the snark o' the times as Vanity Fair cool are prone to do.  Also, at $14 (USD) this slim work is definitely overpriced.

One very large part of this book's problem is that it is dedicated to ridiculing music snobs and music neophytes alike.  What's the big idea? To ridicule everyone? That's useless to me. I have a TiVo full of crappy network sitcoms and old South Parks to satisfy the most devoted nihilist.  I depend on books for actual ideas. This book has none that are original.  At least Bangs was sincere in his viewpoint, even when he did complete 180s on them; yet somehow he still was funnier than all the Vanity Fair smurf boys.  

Kamp and Daly don't have the guts to stand firm on any side, and if that's cool to you then this is your book.
