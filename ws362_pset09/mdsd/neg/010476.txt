Never has the title of a book more aptly described the content within. This tome is nothing more than the recounting of incidents in the life of a group of marginally intelligent and emotionally challenged individuals who, when faced with choices, inevitably choose the one designed to create the most disasterous results. Over and over and over again. If you are looking for happiness in the recounting of a good tale look elswhere on the bookshelf.
