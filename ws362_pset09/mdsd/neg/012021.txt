How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents
                                              By: Julia Alvarez

This book is about 4 sisters, who come to America, New York, and leave everything behind. They have to get used to living in America, in which they have to do many sacrifices to fit in with others. They have to learn to talk a new language, they never talked before, (English) which is difficult for them to do. They have to get rid of their Dominican accents. The book is written in Dominican Republic and then in New York and it goes back and forth. The book is told by all four sisters. I personally didn't really like this book because it talks about many details that were not important.  The book talks about many examples that were important like what they had to go through and how difficult it was to get rid of their accents, which I thought were not really important. What makes the book unique is the story because 4 girls have to basically change their lives around, learn how to be Americans and how to act, which is very difficult for someone to do when they have different customs that they have to get rid of.
