I've read all of 'Dr.' Leon Kass's books on bioethics. In a nutshell his stance on ethics is that he thinks it dehumanizes mankind. His line of thinking is strictly in the 'Religious Right' camp. I truly wonder how technologies such as stem cells (used to help people) is dehumanizing in any way. Leon Kass is Bush's Medical Theocrat. Technologies such as stem cells and cloning are not dehumanizing in any way. What can set up dehumanization is how we USE these technologies - not that these technologies merely exist or will exist. This book was intelligently written without any reference to religion but the whole underlying message was "Do not touch Gods property even if it means healing the sick." These religious fundamentalists will do anything to STUNT us in our pursuits of happiness. This guy is for KEEPING PARALYZED PEOPLE PARALYZED. "Dr." Kass is for KEEPING AMPUTEES AMPUTATED. He's for KEEPING the depressed and suicidal DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL. Ill spare you the bull and say what Dr. Kass really wants to say - "I want you to follow Jesus with all your heart no matter how much pain and suffering you are in. If God made you depressed than thats how you should be. If God made you paralyzed then thats how you should be. If you are miserable in your existance then thats obviously how God wants you to be and thats how you will be with our new conservative laws that will effectively ban progress to help people". For this is the ONLY real argument you can use to support the banning of progress designed to help humans. - He wants everyone to follow the 'divine' rule of sanctity of life, not quality of life - an ugly ethic for a very stupid man. 
I guess people like this will keep the suffering people suffering indefinately
