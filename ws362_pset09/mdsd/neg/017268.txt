Full of completely illogical statements. The author seems to have just made up her diagnosis of the major diseases covered, as the diagnoses are highly unlikely and it seems that the author just made them up as she went along. Wow. Unfortunately the lowest score Amazon allowed me to set was 1. This book is not suitable for people of any age unless they are accustomed to chronic lies. Enjo
