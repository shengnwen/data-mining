This is one truly appalling book. If I could have given it zero stars I would have. Larry Niven was once an exciting writer whose excitement in novelties carried you along with him. Now he seems to be drearily trying to tie together the loose ends of most of his previous work, to little or no effect - just going through the motions.

Where can I start? Lack of characterisation. Slack plotting (which Niven now seems to believe is purely mechanical). Ho-hum action sequences. Personal obsessions (inter-species sex). Here-and-there action to no great purpose. And a resolution which is wholly deus ex machina.

Sad to see an author who once had it all together (and remember the younger Niven justifiably won both Hugo and Nebula awards) lose it to this extent. I ended "Ringworlds's Chidren" thinking it would have read a lot better had it been edited by E. E. ("Doc") Smith - and that's saying something!
