I'm a huge Yankee fan so I enjoyed the opportunity to remember the events of their first championship season in nearly two decades, but Sherman desperately needs an editor. The book completely lacks structure, with tangent building on tangent to form an incoherent mess. There are diamonds in the rough in the form of interesting revelations, but getting to them can be hard work indeed.
