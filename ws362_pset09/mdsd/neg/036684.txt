My college roommate, the best-read person I know, recommended this to me recently as the "best American novel ever written." While it is not without its faults - overlong, repetitious in sections, and too full of religious hokum - it has certainly found a place on my own list of Greatest Ten American Novels.  Its ability to create a sense of personal suffocation, its depiction of the price that both social conservatism and the American dream of upward advancement exact on the young is unsurpassed. It may seem dated stylistically, but thematically it still resonates. If you haven't read this novel yet, do.
