I am amazed at how many good reviews this book received.  I speak not of the translation, since I have discovered that Amazon, rather illiterately, lumps all translations together.  I will simply talk about The Metamorphoses.  While reading Ovid is sometimes enjoyable and easy, like ars amatoria, this book is both tiresome and inane.  If you intend to teach mythology, there are many other texts, including something new called An Anthology of Classical Myth by Trzaskoma, Smith and Brunet, that provide the Greek religion from the Greeks themselves.  There are also new books, like Antinomy: a union of mind by Whyte, that make good and novel use of classic motif in order to provide the reader with some form of intellectual stimulation.  This almost meaningless amalgamation of different stories was put together in order to win back favor for Ovid from the emperor Augustus.  It was a failure then as it is now.  The theme is childish with bits of gore and mayhem and murder placed inside so as to titillate.  The ending is supposed to be that of Augustus establishing an eternal empire and this too is made ridiculous.  I suppose these stories could be told to children who have an interest in literature, but who do not like the kind, soft and saccharine tales they are ordinarily given, but on the whole the metamorphoses of The Metamorphoses are maddeningly repetitive; it is like someone is smacking you in the eye with a plastic spoon.  Remember this: a work of ancient literature is not great literature simply because it is ancient.  Some of it is inane rubbish
