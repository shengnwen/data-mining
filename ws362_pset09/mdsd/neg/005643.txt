There is so much scientific nonsense in the book that it is appalling!
Working in the field of self-organized behavior in insects colonies, I can tell you that the presentation of that subject in the book is awful! 
The number of wrong statement is so outrageously large that they are impossible to list below 10 pages of text!!
It is a pity because such a book completely discredits a real scientific field that is confronted enough with new-age babble, scientific unfounded or wrong statements, pseudo-philosophical stupidities and so on.
If you want to learn something real about "emergence" please stay away from this book.
The rating of 1 star is just for the paper on which the book is written..
