This subject matter covered by this book is of interest to most wood turners, it is a pity it is so poorly presented.  The text does not live up to the pictures on the front cover.   

In short this book is a sequence of pictures and because they have NOT A SINGLE caption, it is almost unreadable, if not exceedingly frustrating.   The Pictures, for example have a reference, Fig 3.2 in bold, but the text has not bold reference to the figure so if you come across a picture that appears interesting, it takes many minutes to look through the text for a reference to the figure.  

Don't waste your money - if you want a good book that covers just about all the topics covered in this book and has far better ways of holding the work, then have a look at Tibbet's book, Segmented Turning....that is a gem.
