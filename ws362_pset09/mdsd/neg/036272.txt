This is DFW show-off opus, where he uses verbosity to club the reader over the head until they are senseless and *think* they really understand what he's talking about.

I wonder if this whole work is a cruel joke; to see if we "get it".

This is a book to tackle (and I mean that word) when you're stranded on a desert island with no other choices.

Otherwise pick up one of his collections of non-fiction
