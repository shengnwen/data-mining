The title of this book is misleading. I expected to find a detailed analysis of Viking warfare, but found a rather unprofessional rant on Scandinavian culture in the Viking Era. It is easy to see how a perception of history can be slanted, based upon the bias of the author. This insight is useful, however, in the review of latter-day protagonist saga writers or antagonist monks. Little more can be learned from this text
