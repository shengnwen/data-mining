The essence of "Iraq Confidential" is that the CIA and NSC were unwilling to permit a U.N. arm led by an American to successfully investigate what weapons Saddam had.  The problem was that U.N. policy was to lift sanctions once Saddam had shown disarmament, while U.S. policy was to retain sactions until regime change, regardless of Iraq's armament.  In addition, there were also problems with poor coordination between the CIA and FBI.

The key "bottom line" is that this Machiavellian U.S. strategy to defeat arms inspection probably led to the U.S. and G.B. being convinced in 2003 that Saddam had WMD when he actually had none, and thereby an unnecessary war.

As for Scott Ritter, he ended up becoming controversial himself (to say the least); fortunately Seymour Hersch's vouching for Scott makes the book credible.  Regardless, "Iraq Confidential" should have only been an article - not nearly 300 pages
