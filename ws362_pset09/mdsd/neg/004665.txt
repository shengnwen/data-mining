I was extremely disappointed by this book.  The title and the write-up on the back cover held the promise of a how-to manual to use your brain to its fullest potential.  The book reads like a superficial mish-mash of philosophy and neurology, with almost no back-up to its major claims and statements about human behavior or the development of societies.  At times it sounds like a new age environmentalist screed, noting that poor use of the brain results in the misuse of natural resources.  I was kept waiting until the final pages of the book for the magical how-to promised at the beginning.  The secret formula for better brain use: be a better person, preferably an environmentalist.  The only information of value is Huther's repeated assertion that your brain physiology will adapt to the way you continually use it, and will reinforce this routine way more and more.  This has been said by other's before (see Edward De Bono, Mechanism of Mind)
