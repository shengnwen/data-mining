I just completed a group study on this book. We spent months on it, not setting any time limit so we could go through all the questions and down all the rabbit-trails we needed to.

I had a very hard time reading this book. It was not the subject matter, but rather the dryness and lifelessness of the book. I had to force myself to trudge through each paragraph, and became increasingly bothered and irritated, not really knowing why, and very puzzled by my reaction, which I describe as almost an aversion. Finally, at the final session, I was struck with the reason: THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THIS BOOK.

The Holy Spirit is the life of God in us. It is how God convicts and guides us. It is, in basic terms, God in us. Without a treatment of the work of the Holy Spirit, the book is not only incomplete, but uninspired and dead.
