I was very interested in reading this book due to it's title, but as the saying goes, &quot;never judge a book by it's &quot;title&quot;&quot;.  I found the author to be arrogant, bregadocious and totally prejudiced against anything not of the &quot;democratic&quot; persuasion.  In addition I dont think he stayed on the subject matter, but rather used this book to expound his biased views
