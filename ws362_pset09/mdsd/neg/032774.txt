Dangerous Skies is a story that is mainly about two boys that live in the middle of the 1700s.  One of the friends is white and the other one is black so they have a lot of disagreements and they spend much of the story trying to figure things out.  One of the people lives on a farm and does a lot of work on it.  The other one is black so they get a lot of discrimination and stuff like that.  I do not really like this book because it was really boring and it had no point.  If you want to fine out what happens in the end you should read the book
