The title of this book should have been Suicide: The Fast Track to The Loser Lounge in No-Limit Hold'em Poker Tournaments.
This book teaches you how to quickly leave a poker tournament.
I've played against players who have used this system before this book was ever written. I agree they might get lucky and go on a rush...but eventually a good player is going to take them out, and they'll never win a tournament with this system....Guaranteed.
