I am giving this 2 stars simply because as far as writing goes, it's not bad.  However, it's not bad for an undergraduate psychology student's term paper.  Many of the "artistic quotes" from the likes of Goethe, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf seem to fit the author's particular point in a very contrived sort of way.  Removing great pieces of literature from their original context to support her own writing does nothing to enhance either one.  I found myself skipping the quotes which, I know, went against what the author wanted in the first place.  Unfortunately, that leaves a very basic, intro to psychology outline of a book, and I found it very difficult to get past the first few chapters.  For example, hasn't the body of psychology moved beyond the concept of "penis envy" which Mercer mentions as if it is a broadly accepted and experienced cognitive step.  I gave two stars rather than one simply because I didn't finish reading it and, in fairness, perhaps there is something good contained within it that I am missing
