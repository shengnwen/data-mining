	And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me. 
	The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations.
	This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college. 
	The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had. 
	All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away.
