This is the first Patterson novel I have ever read, and it is certain to be the last.  Most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in-depth characters, but Patterson does none of that.  The author's writing style is akin to that of a small child's, as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one-dimensional characters.  Patterson then holds the reader's hand as he matter-of-factly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation, presenting a book written by a Ralph Wiggums-like child for immature children to enjoy.  How does the reader know Alex was scared? The reader knows because Patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style: "The man pulled out a gun, Alex was scared, Alex shot the man and he was happy, and the man was dead."

Don't believe me? Simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch-nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare I had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who I thought he killed, or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist's evil deeds.

Quite simply, this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs
