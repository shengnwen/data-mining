Pointless formulas, impossible to find actual definitions, book is full of outdated real world references (ex: referring to online purchasing as a new fangled idea). I've never been so confused by a text in my life. I DO NOT recommend this book. It was a required text for my service management class and NOBODY was happy with the text. It almost annoyingly uses Texas as a reference for nearly all analogies. The only thing good about it was how highly it spoke of Amazon.com
