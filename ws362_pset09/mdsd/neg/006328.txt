Desdemona is an odd ball in her family.  She comes from a family of theater people, but she doesn't have any of the family talent for acting.  Instead, she runs a catering company that helps keep the rest of the family financial stable.

Stark runs a computer security company and first meets Desdemona when he is jilted and Desdemona is trying to collect on her catering bill for a wedding that never happened.

The characters in the book seem flat and with about 100 pages left I found myself skimming because I didn't really care what happened.  Sometimes the characters just acted completely irrationally.  For example, they didn't call the police when major evidence was found in a murder case.  I just couldn't get into it when the characters seemed so ridiculously unreal
