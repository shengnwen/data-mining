I'm surprised this book isn't banned. I'm not a prude or religious at all and believe children should learn about sex. But there's a limit to what they should know and how they should be taught. There are many other, more civilised, ways to bring up the subject. Babette Cole brings up very inappropriate subjects for kids with very inappropriate illustrations. If you think this book is shocking, try reading "Mummy Never Told Me", by the same auther
