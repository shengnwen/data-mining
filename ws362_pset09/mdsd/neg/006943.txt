I love my crockpot and am always looking for new cookbooks.  This isn't a good one.  I have never seen so many recipes calling for frozen/canned vegetables, Velveeta and cans and cans of soup.  Several recipes call for three cans of cream of whatever soup.  Not healthy; not imaginative.  Thankfully, I checked it out of the library.  I won't be cooking one recipe from it before it's returned
