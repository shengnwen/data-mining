This textbook takes microeconomics which can be explained in a technical, exact manner and makes it abstract and foreign.

This textbook's sentences run-on and lose their direction, confusing the reader...If a reader had a firm understanding of economics prior to this textbook, after reading it, it is certain that they will no longer have the understanding of economics, that they did previously.

It is a travestly when a textbook designed to teach the reader about a certain subject, actually makes them less knowledgeable of the subject.

I must also ask why it is being used to teach university students in different years and programs, when it should not be, for example in my university it is being taught in the following programs

IBBA - Year 1
BBA - Year 2
BAS - Year 3
MBA - Year
