If you have read "Reunion" or "Einstein's Dreams", you'll be quite upset with this novel.  

It seems rather limited in its scope, and is lacking metaphor like Lightman's other works.  He has developed as a writer since this book, however.  Don't let this one discourage you from exploring his other wonderful novels.
