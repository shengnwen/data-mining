There is nothing here that hasn't been written elsewhere, and better. But the biggest problem is the titular idea that &quot;success is a choice.&quot; Hogwash! If success is a choice, why didn't Mr Pitino &quot;choose&quot; to succeed as coach of the Boston Celtics instead of failing miserably? It's abjectly self-serving to win a college championship and then write a huge pat on your own back congratulating yourself on having &quot;chosen&quot; to win. Where is the book after the Celtics fiasco? In point of fact, most of our successes or failures in life are determined by forces completely out of our control. In the words of the old adage, people like Pitino are born on third base and spend their lives thinking they hit a triple. Worse, such an attitude allows the haves to blame the have-nots for their own plight, instead of recognizing the systemic obstacles standing in the way of universal socio-economic enfranchisement
