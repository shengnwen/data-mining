Danielle Steel has done it once again. Written a book that must have taken her all of one day. I was really disappointed after Summer in St. Tropez, but thought after a break from her books I'd try again. Sorry I wasted my time. This book is SO repetitive, same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph. The story line seems to drag on forever. If Steel's goal is to "dumb" her books down for the masses then she has succeeded. This book is written at about an 11-year-old's level. Don't waste your time
