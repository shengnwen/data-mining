I was so angry when I started the book I almost didn't read past page 3. I have a son waiting for his 3rd kidney transplant and on dialisis, you have your main person saying it was wrong and -that theme carried through the whole book. How dare you encourage your readers to not give the Gift of Life!!!"Organ Transplant is the Ultimate Recycling." I gave my kidney to my son and so did his cousin. Just a little was said at the end of the book but that's a little late. It should have encouraged donation all the way!!!!!!
