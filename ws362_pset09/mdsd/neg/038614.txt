this book is one sided and that's why I can not make use of it. was looking for severe advise to handle my mother-in-law. unfortunately Lebey only describes her point of view, that daughters-in-law 
1) have always the fault
2) want to control sons
and that's why the family does not work. Could not there be other perspectives in this book please!
waste of money because no advise, read the free pages here at amazon and make a choice yoursel
