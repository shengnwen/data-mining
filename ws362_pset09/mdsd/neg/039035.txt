I Have read two books by Rob Thomas, &quot;Rats Saw God&quot; and &quot;Slave Day&quot;.  Because I Read the former of the two books, &quot;Rats Saw God&quot; first, I assumed that Thomas was a fairly good novelist.  NOT SO!!  Slave Day follows the lives of several different high school students and one high school teacher over the course of one day.  The book piles too many subplots into too little a writting space.  In one plot, a supposed &quot;rebel&quot; deals with an evil teacher.  In another, a nerd does all he can to impress the &quot;hottie&quot; of the school.  The book's content was very depressing, and the ending was FAR TO ABRUPT.  When rating this item, I seriously considered giving it a &quot;3&quot; because it does have its good points.  Unfortunatley, the good points do not outshine its bad points
