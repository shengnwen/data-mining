From Better Homes and Gardens, I expected a more basic approach to cooking.  This book is so busy with garish cartoons and unreadable fonts that the recipes themselves get lost.  Not all kids are video game junkies who require constant visual stimulation.  I gave the book 2 stars because, as promised, the recipes themselves appear to be good.
