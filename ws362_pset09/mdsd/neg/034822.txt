This book sucks so bad.  All of the redundant crap that everyone makes  kids read about the Holocaust is so depressing.  We all understand that  WWII was a terrible thing and that the Axis forces did hideous things to  Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, etc.  Do we have to keep reading about  it?  I feel like my brain has been drained!  It's all so depressing, so  negative.  Move on, people.  I might sound insensitive...sure, this was an  atrocious thing and deeply affected those involved, but move on.  My priest  says that we bear our own crosses.  The Holocaust is NOT going on now.  We  need to learn from what happened (I have!) and MOVE ON
