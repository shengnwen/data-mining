Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book.  Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility.

The title says "interpreting" so I will allow him creative license. Expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in Stalin's treatise on the U.S. Constitution
