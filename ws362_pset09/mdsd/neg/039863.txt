Okay book, too bad he's a fake. FYI, this guy is not a real Indian-he is a white man pretending.  That's been proven by DNA. And he was never a member of a tribe, it was "honorary" and was taken away.  The AIM movement came out and said they don't want him speaking for them, that he's a "wanabee" and that they don't like his racism. If you don't believe me, go to their website.  They have a whole section on him and others like him.  That kind of make me not want to read anymore of his books.  I full believe that what was done to the Indians was very wrong, but I'd like to hear about it from a genuine source-like an actual Indian historian, not some fake who apparently hates his own race.  This is not a "victims" perspective at all.  He's not the victim
