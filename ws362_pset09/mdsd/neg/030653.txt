These opinionated anthropological essays are unnecessary reading for most thinkers born since since the end of the Vietnam War. Although they were at one time a salutary textual critique of anthropology and Western representation, they read today as critiques whose implications can be circuscribed to the the 1980s and early 90s. Read these naive works of idealistic old school anthropologists with a grain of salt.
