This book started out well, but it is as if the author got VERY distracted about half way through.  I did finish it, though it was painful.  Cheesy.  Bad dialogue!  For true vampire genre fans, give this one a pass.  I have not read the others in this series, so I cannot comment on those.  After reading this one, however, I have no interest in the others
