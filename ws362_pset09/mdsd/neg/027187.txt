I LOVED the introduction of this book--it really challenged me to think about how the mind works, and taught me things about how the brain localizes emotions.  So far so good.  Then the good part...or so I thought.  Rather than a synthesis of the profound ideas of his Holiness the Dalai Lama, instead I was "treated" to a blow-by-blow of how the meetings with him were set up, how "special" Mr. Goleman is to have had such influence.  I could barely make it though the first in the series of seminars when I gave up.  Maybe there was more there, but I didn't make it far enough to find out.  And I blame the author and editors.  I don't know who would enjoy this book.  Goleman should have stopped at the introduction
