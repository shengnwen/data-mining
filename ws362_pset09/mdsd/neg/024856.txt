MapEasy's Guidemap to Santa Fe was publishd in 1997, which means it was worked up in 96. The streets may not have moved [with some notable exceptions], but a number of establishments located on the maps have closed, been re-named or changed. Were it up to date, I'd give it 4 stars. 

I enjoy MapEasy products as they help one locate sites in neighborhoods, not just addresses. It's fun to use these to plan out a daily excursion on foot, or help in chosing restaurants and hotels in specific areas because they include drawings and names of establishments at their exact mapped location. 

The Santa Fe map was great fun to carry around while looking for museums and attractions, and choice places to shop, eat and have a drink were clearly placed when I used it some 8 years ago, but on a recent trip, I had to put it aside as it caused confusion and disappointment based on it's obsolescence. 

 I cannot recommend using this dated map until it's been revised and updated, which I hope will happen. 

A guide book from the series Access, Santa Fe, operates much the same, but with more information on destinations and attractions, similarly located on neighborhood maps . It too is outdated, being published in 1999, but a new edition is coming out November 30, 2006, according to it's listing here at Amazon. I recommend waiting for it.
