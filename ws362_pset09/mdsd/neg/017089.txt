Having used this text in my introductory Classical Hebrew studies I found the order of the lessons to be incredibly illogical, jumping from one verbal stem to another and then back to the first, rather than covering each one individually and thoroughly.   Further, the whole book is pedagogically atrocious.  Practice exercises in the book recommend translations from the Tanakh that contain a great deal of grammar that has not yet been covered in the book, rather than offering simplified paraphrases.  Further, the book offers no practice in translating from English to Hebrew, which is invaluable in learning Classical Hebrew.  Instead, I would suggest Thomas Lambdin's grammar which, though a bit more expensive, is worth every penny
