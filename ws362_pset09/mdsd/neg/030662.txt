After the excitement of THE WOLVES OF CALLA, SONG OF SUSANNAH is more than a little disappointing. Susannah and her demon possessor, Mia, are off to give birth to whatever, Roland, Eddie, Jake and Callahan are in hot, well, lukewarm pursuit, and for many pages nothing happens. Many, Many pages. This book plays to the worst parts of the series, overly mannered speeches, cryptic messages, 19's all over the place and page upon page of meaningless dialogue that will interest only fans of minutia. There are a few moments where things pickup, like when King himself makes an appearance, and while it proves  interesting for King to take such a hard look at his 70's self, it's not exactly Kilgore Trout meeting Vonnegut in BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS. Another problem I had was that unlike the clear and horrifying creations of Wrightson and Whalen, Anderson's blurry impresionistic images left me cold and did nothing to enhance this volume of THE DARK TOWER. For the second to last book in the series I had hoped for some real resolutions to some of the problems, but I guess King decided to save everything for the last book.  
P.S. Man, if I heard that baby called "the chap" one more time...
