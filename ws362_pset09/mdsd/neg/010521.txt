I've bought all the fertility books because my husband and I have struggled with infertility for three years. This book may have a different title but its just as academic and techy as all his others.

The best IVF book I've found so far is "What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant" by Daniel Potter and Jennifer Hanin. 

Potter is an RE like Silber but has a way with words and his book conveys all the human emotions and trials and tribulations that infertile couples experience and even offers sound advice dealing with them. Silber's book falls short.

If you need to get pregnant and want a book that has ALL the answers don't waste your time on this medical mumbo jumbo. Silber may be a good surgeon but he's not a writer
