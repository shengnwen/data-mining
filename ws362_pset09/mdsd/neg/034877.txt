The author takes a look at a baker's dozen of well known musicians and points out Christian elements in their works. In some cases this is more apparent than in others. However, it is much more apparent that the author has a politically liberal, anti-American axe to grind. Negative comments aimed at Republicans and anything related to them appear at unexpected and unnecessary moments. The putrid low point was contemplating the cause of 9/11 as being America's fault. Sadly, the author's take on an interesting premise is sandbagged by biased political commentary.
