At the book's beginning the plot is fairly good. As you keep reading it starts to get heavy and dull, but the last 100 pages or so are really boring. The second plot is nonsense and you'll really know who is the bad guy almost as it starts. The main plot is thrilling just the few initial pages, then it gets dull and boring. At least you can skip the last 75 pages of the book or better said you can skip the whole book.
