I found the book to be an endless and somewhat unnecessary attack on classical theism.  Her notions of pauline theology, based on a platonic dualism, have been shown to be baseless.  The disparities and divisions of the church and society are not proven in her work to stem from classical theism, but are assumed.  The church which she diminishes has worked to bridge culturally created divisions, which she fails to admit to.  Her pandering into pantheism and panentheism are also disappointing, for she reveals her true intention of not reforming the church, but espousing a new religion
