After reading his last few book with "co-authors" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the "co-author". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves
