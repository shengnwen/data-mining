the only people that may find this book useful have either never exercised or are very thin with little muscle tone.  I did not find it useful  because i have been lifting weights for a few years.  The most disappointing thing about the book is that several models used appear to be underweight with no muscletone and are absolutely terrible role models for  a HEALTHY female physique.they don't look fit-they look like they don't eat
