... men don't want to commit to marriage in this day and age? This little missive should put to rest any of those doubts - permanently.

While the writing is generally above mediocre quality, I am baffled at what this book is trying to prove, other than that marriage, in the US, in this day and time, is a lot more complicated and demanding than it was a generation or two ago. Well, duhhhhhhh ... why don't we make some more painfully obvious statements, like, The sky is blue?

Setting that thought aside for the moment, the overwhelming feeling I took away from this book was anger - all of these women are, to varying degrees, angry at what they perceive as a bill of goods sold to them by the Ms. Generation. That is, if they get an education, work hard, be strong, etc., they can Get The Perfect Man And Have It All. But then reality comes crashing down, and they can't seem to understand why their vision is not matching up with reality. Perhaps it's because reality is the way things are, as opposed to how we want them to be in our minds?

Don't get me wrong, I am not a misogynist. But after reading something like this, can you honestly wonder why more and more men want nothing to do with women
