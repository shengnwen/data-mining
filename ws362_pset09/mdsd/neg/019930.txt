First, I would like to make clear, or to put it more aptly, this book was written by an academic and not someone who is in the actual business. In other words, lots of theory but nothing practical to back it up. If I'm not mistaken, the author has never, ever actually written a screenplay and have it produced.
Those are strikes one and two against this book. Strike three is that, yes there is some valuable information contained between the covers but it's SO disjointed, you have to constantly go back and forth throughout it in order to try to make any sense out it. My advice? Buy something written by people who ARE in the movie business and NOT from the "Joe College" types who live off of tenure so they really don't have to prove anything to anyone. It's one thing to talk about writing and quite another to sell something for a six figure amount to a production company
