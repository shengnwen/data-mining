If you're a horse lover then you will like this story. It's a fun, unchallenging read, however, it's contrived, cliche, and Miss Leland has no confidence whatsoever in her reader's intelligence. Everything is pointed out to you, "She smiled because she was so happy," etc. The plot leaves something to be desired as well as most of the book is Beth and Conner "Brett" Hall, continually rehashing how much they like eachother and want to have sex with one another, with little else going on except the random accidents that are supposed to suffice as plot twists. Personally, I'm tired of equestrian fiction being held to a lower standard of writing than the basest high school novel. The Saddle Club has more interesting story lines than this book
