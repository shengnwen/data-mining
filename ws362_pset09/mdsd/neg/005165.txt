While Micheal White's book does serve as an interesting introduction to some of the biographical history of the iconoclastic Leonardo, White includes so much subjective narrative following up the context of each chapter that he turns the "total man" goal of his study into a hyperbolic and titillating read that could very well have been lifted from the "Milanese Inquirer", if such a tabloidic rag existed so  long ago!  Hey, it probably did!  But do we have to pay [money] for a ... Italian rag?  All right, I'm no writer, but I would hate to have read this book as cliff note version for class and then had my semester grade riding on the final exam.  If this is what you're thinking, don't do it!  Leonardo would thank you if he could..
