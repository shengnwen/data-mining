 Island of the blue dolphin written by Scott O'dell,was a great book. I recomend this book to 5th grade and up, dew to the books hard vocabulary.
I like this book because of the exitement, adventures, and drama of karanas life on the island alone.Island of the blue dolphin is for people
who like to read about survivle and adventure.I dont think people who only like to read about comedys mysteries shouldent read the book.
  Island of the blue dolphinis about a girl who gets stuck on an island by herselfand learns how to survie and has a big adventure on the way. The main charcter of this story is karana. Karanas village was fleeing the island, but her brother forgot his spear and ran back.the ship left ,and karana threw her self out the boat to be with her brother. Shortly after,Karanas brother was killed by wiled dogs.Karana is now on the island alone.
