I read the reviews here before purchasing this book and was encouraged by some of them. In addition to this book, I purchased Illustrator CS Killer Tips and Adobe Illustrator CS Idea Kit. Now, not to the insult the author, but this book was horrifying. I felt like I was reading a boring, difficult college textbook! I'm not new to Adobe or the interface, and I self-taught myself Elements and Photoshop. I must say that I was severely dissapointed by the lack of visual aid, visual detail, and failure to get me intrigued - how could I be with pages and pages of text to read with one or two pictures of angles or crappy artwork? I have to find another Illustrator book so I actually learn something...what a dissapointment! The CD was also relatively dissapointing - nothing was interactive and was not at all well-explained in the book or the content on CD. Plus, some of the lessons were advertisements for Steuer's online classes. Ha! The only good thing was the art that it did have was in color, and color is good - which is why I gave it one more star than I would've. If you buy it, don't open the CD so you have the option of returning it
