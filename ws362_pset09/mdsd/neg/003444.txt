I feel bad there are so many Americans out of work. I also am optimistic that this is another phase of job retooling and functional change. Those who aren't ready to face that their career path has alerted will find this great company for their misery because they won't find a new job spending money on this book. 

Think outside the box. Look at the obvious. Change and grow my friends. I want you all to find great new jobs in the global economy but this book will not move you any closer
