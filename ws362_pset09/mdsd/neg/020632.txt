I read this book after being directed to it by a colleague at work. It started out interesting about Carlos the under graduate student spending time with the Indian Mistic Don Juan. It seemed that Don Juan was trying to get Carlos to pierce the illusion of reality, but the story broke down quickly and just got strange and made little sense from a logical or mystical stand point. By the end of the book I started believing Carlos was being drugged and I did not trust this Don Juan. I would advise reading Vernon Howard or studying Buddhism for enlightenment and avoid this book
