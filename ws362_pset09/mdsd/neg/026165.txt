This is the shortest book I failed to finish. I'm sorry, but for a short novel, it was just got too wordy and touchy-feely for me. I loved Emperor of the Air, a collection of short stories in which feelings and places were described succintly. And the events happened at a quicker pace. But in Blue River, Canin stretches out all his descriptions of places, of main character's resentments, disappointments, fears, and memories. It really feels tedious to read and halfway through it, I just had to give up
