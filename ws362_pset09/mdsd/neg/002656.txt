I am with the other people who reviewed this item stating that it is kinda pointless to be releasing a boxed set for this series. I know for a fact that they have been doing this since at least book 4 and each time the next book comes out they are just making the box bigger. This is just a huge rip off for the people who buy "boxed sets" for the novelty of the box...once the next book comes out they basically have to just set it on the shelf next to the boxed set. Personally, I think that for the most part the idea of putting your books in a box like this is kinda stupid anyway...I prefer to have mine individual on the shelves. I am not opposed to the idea of releasing them in nice slipcases though...anyway I'll quit my rambling. Lets just end it at this, if you are absolutely one of those peeps who need the box set, wait until the last book comes out and buy it then. The one star here is for the boxed set, not the individual books, which are all brilliant
