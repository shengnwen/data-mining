The premise for this book had so much potential--examining cultural differences regarding time--but the execution was horrendous.  The wholescale condemnation of all things "Western," "phallic," "linear" and "masculine," and the unilateral and uncritical praise for "indigenous" cultures reminded me of a freshman in their first college seminar: juvenile, naive, and accusatory.  She praises what she terms the feminine and damns anything masculine.  I found this reductive and insulting.  I am an avowed feminist, but I believe this kind of devisive thinking to be harmful and destructive.  

Furthermore, Griffiths is an awful writer.  She is cutesy, smug, self-congratulatory, and badly organized.  Her one thesis seems to be "clock time, bad!" and never moves much beyond that.  There are many other authors, such as Linda Hogan, who can write poetically and also politically, but Jay Griffiths is not one of them.  

Avoid this self-important book and its hypocritical, accusatory author.  Direct your precious time elsewhere
