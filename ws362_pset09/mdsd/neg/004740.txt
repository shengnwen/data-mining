I kept reading and reading this book to see why I found it so profoundly disconcerting, knowing that she is a best seller, and finding it to be not TOTAL trash.  I kept staring at the picture of whatsherface, the author, and wondering why she looks like a marketing manager. Plenty of the other reviewers have covered things I wanted to say, like she shoves all that Africa stuff in because she's obviously been there/the characters are so self-absorbed you want to kill them, etc.  But I was also puzzling over her writing style and why I kept finding it so damned "off", and then I noticed her disgusting feeling tone.  For example, on page 111 we have the wonderful self-absorbed lovers meeting in some caf:

***There were nearly thirty empty tables, yet still she waited to be seated while a waitress with a humpback consulted a plan.***

Then, three paragraphs later:
***He unsnapped his napkin and placed it over his lap.  The humpbacked waitress immediately brought another cup of coffee to the table.  "I was hungry", she [the main character] said.***

Why is the waitress (who we never hear about again) humpbacked? Is it to make us start to care about the only interesting character in the book (the poor humpbacked waitress whose life I would like to hear about and who is never heard of again)?  Or is she put in as descriptive detail to contrast with the still-glamorous protagonists?

What on earth was Amherst, this kosher university, doing employing this woman to teach "creative writing"?  I am shocked and amazed and angry.
