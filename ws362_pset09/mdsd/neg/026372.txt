I have read several books on the history of Russia, like Peter the Great,  and the Romanovs, but this book frankly bored me.  The author definetly  knows his stuff about Catherine, but I got so tired of reading about all  the political stuff in this book.  I wanted to know more about her personal  life, more details about her comings and goings, not about how she ruled  her Russian cabinet officers.  Also the use of vocabulary was way over my  head, so it made it hard to enjoy reading because many times I needed to  get the dictionary, and I feel I have a fairly good vocabulary.  I would  not recommend this book unless you  want to know about Russian  administration in her time
