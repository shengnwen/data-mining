I bought this book because i was looking for  "A Users guide to Earth's Interactive Energy Body,"    I'm still looking.   The book has a little of this and a little of that, it's very unfocused and seldom has anything to do with the title. It has the flavor  of the stuff we were getting in the 70's when interest in these topics was new. We have come further and the topic is still open to anyone who would like to write a book with practical information.  Though if you're still interested - I have a used copy for sale.  I wouldn't have bothered with this if the "see inside this book" function was working when I bought it
