A man who should be tried for war crimes is not the right person to be writing a book on diplomacy. If anyone wants to know why the U.S. gets such a bad rep from the rest of the world, they should study the crimes committed by this self-named diplomat. On September 11th, 1973 Kissinger had the democratically elected President of Chile assassinated and the Chilean people had to endure the rule of Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet now faces corruption charges, is responsible for--at a conservative estimate-- 3,000 deaths (according to BBC), and tortured many more during his brutal regime. The fact that the Twin Towers were targeted on September 11th is not a coincidence. Thank you, Mr. Kissinger. We can see how far your diplomacy has improved the state of the world
