The research in this book is unbelievably shoddy.  In addition to the examples already given, here are two more:  On page 328 he states that The Band played the Carter Baron Amphitheater in Washington, DC on 16 August 1976.  The actual date was 17 JULY 1976, and there was a King Biscuit Flower Hour recorded there to prove it, complete with the correct date.  Also, I saw The Band on 18 July 1976 at Music Inn, Lenox, MA, where they were late because their equipment had been delayed from DC the night before.  Then on page 384 he states that The Band was opening for Crosby, Stills and Nash on their Florida tour the first week in March of 1986.  That would have been a real trick, as David Crosby was in prison then.  I saw three of those Florida shows, and The Band headlined all of them, no CS&amp;N.  Their final show with Richard Manuel was March 3, 1986 in Winter Park, FL, something Hoskyns managed to get right.  Avoid this poorly researched mess
