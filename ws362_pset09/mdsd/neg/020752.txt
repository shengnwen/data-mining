I have an eclectic taste in my reading material and I was hoping this book would present a neat atmospheric tableau upon which the author spun her "facts" about this topic, but I didn't find much that was impressive, cool, informative, or even suitably moody about Solitary Witch. In short, I'm sorry to say it was a bit of a letdown. EXCEPT man that cover is wild! Might I make the suggestion that better packaging would help a future edition? By that I mean dress up the interior with art and design that matches the grand cover. That would really spark this tome up
