While this book may contain some good information on multicultrual education I find it difficult to get past the bias presented in it.  Based on statements like 

"A crucial fact in understanding racism is that whites see themselves as superior to persons and groups of color, and as a result exercise their power to prevent people of color from securing the prestige, power, and privilege held by whites." 

and

"Whites go through a developmental stages as they develop their racial identity and abandon racism."

The authors seem to presume that all whites are racist, power hungry, pigs.  Knowing that such a generalization is patently false how can I trust the content describing peoples of other cultural backgrounds
