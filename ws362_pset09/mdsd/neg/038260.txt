I read this book with great interest a few years ago.  Now I have learned that there is lots of controversy over it.  It seems that one of the scientists who was behind lots of the ideas in this book was a creationist who kept that fact quiet.

There is another book "Life Everywhere" by David Darling, that answers many of the arguments in "Rare Earth"

To get both sides of the story, do a google search on:
"rare earth" "intelligent design" creationism
You might also add the name "Guillermo Gonzalez" to your search.  He is the scientist/creationist who I mentioned earlier
