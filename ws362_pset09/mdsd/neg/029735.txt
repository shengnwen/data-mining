This author appears on the cult promotional video What the Bleep, which was produced by the Ramtha people who believe that a woman is channeling a 35,000 year old cromagnon warrior.

Alberts appears on the film, emphatically waving his hands and talking about physics, which seemed to suggest that somehow our thoughts can influence external reality and its outcome.

How can you trust a man that then appears on such a cult film?

Maybe Alberts was duped and his sayings were taken out of context.  But then this speaks of a vainglorious man that was more concerned for getting his image and notions "out there" and seemingly not particular who was doing it or not checking what the film was really about.  It would not be surprisig then how such a man can get fooled and have that vanity used against him.

Either way, be careful, as this man seems too zanny to really know what he is talking about and plus his writing style in the book looks like some retarded monkey on crack was sitting in front of the typewritter.
