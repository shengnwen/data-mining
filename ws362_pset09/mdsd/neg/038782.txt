Ethan Canin is a great short story writer, but when it comes to novels, he misses the target.  His short stories are great because they are brief, and are told through actions and conversations, not sentimentality and excessive introspection.  Blue River, like For Kings and Planets, are undisciplined works, perhaps too ambitious, with overwrought language and too much filler material.  A much better story with the same theme appear in the Palace Thief, called Batorsag and Szerelem
