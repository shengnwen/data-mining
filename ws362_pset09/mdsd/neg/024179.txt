This is an easy read... But you have to hash through a lot of common knowledge about the Bulls to get any interesting tidbits about Jackson.  Sacred Hoops gives you much more perspective into Jackson than this book does.  The author teases the reader with an opening story about how Jackson smokes two cigarettes and drinks a beer before he talked to the Bulls after a game... A great bit of informaion, but many true Bulls fans could have picked this up the the local papers or sports talk shows...  The author gets most of his inside information from Tex Schram, Johnny Bach, and Skip Schaefer.   The majority of the book is a general chronicle of the Bulls 8 year 6 title run offering few insights on Jackson.  If you followed the Bulls, read Sacred Hoops, the only 'fresh' information comes from the last two chapters about Jackson's year off and some information about Jackson's first year with the Lakers.  It reads quick, but do not expect learn any new in depth information about Jackson
