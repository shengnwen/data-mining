Agreeing with Oldballs "GatoRanger", I too found it difficult to past all the GLARING technical errors in a book written by someone that is supposed to be an "expert" in this genre.  Good grief, Mr. Cerasin touts that he's written projects for Tom Clancy (who also doesn't always get it right), and Guides to Special Ops, etc. PLUS a book on 24.  

Yet, in addition to the laughable "Glock Safety and Undetectable to weapons scanners" error, he also gives us:

- FBI Agent Hensley carrying revolver, which the FBI hasn't issued to agents since the late 80s, all going to Semi-Auto with either S&W or Glock sidearms after the Miami Shootout.
- Jack picking up a "Heckler & Koch Mark 23 USP" from the gangster Georgi's collection and then goes on to describe it incorrectly as it "lacked the bells and whistles of the Tactical model, including the O-Ring barrel and rear target adjustable sites".  For someone that has written books on the Special Forces, he should know better.  The HK Mark 23 is never described as a "USP" and it has always had an O-Ring barrel.  Plus it is huge.  And Jack is going to carry it around in NYC in a shoulder holster?!?  I know of no shoulder holsters available for that weapon, nor does the author explain exactly how Jack came to be wearing said shoulder holster.
- Then we have the lovely Captain Schneider, who while raiding a computer warehouse with Tony, first pulls her "Marine-Corp issue Beretta 92F from her jacket" as she runs into the building.  And then when Tony catches up to her, she's standing over the suspect with "her barrel of her service REVOLVER pressed against the back of his skull".  DOH!
- Later in the book, Captain Schneider "drew her Marine-issue .45"...What?  I thought she had a Marine-Corp issue Beretta 92F - Revolver?!?!  

Aside from the technical Gun related errors, there are story inconsistencies that make you go "Huh, where did that come from".  One example was when Tony and Scheider saves the ex-Mrs. Hensley from a gang of thugs and then Tony asks her "Do you have any idea why your ex-husband wants you dead"?  He had no reason to suspect the ex-husband had sent the gang as they were just going to meet the ex-wife for the first time to see if she knew what her ex-husband was like after he had returned from the Gulf War.  

Mr. Cerasini is certainly not the first to make a lot of annoying technical errors (many authors that I read have at least one or two per book, Clancy, James Peterson, Lee Child, Vince Flynn), usually something like a safety on a gun that has NO such device, or a silenced revolver which is nonsense (yes, there was one such handgun made by Knights Armament in the early 90s, but it was a specialized device that was a one-off).

I hope Mr. Cerasini and his editors do a better job on the next two books in the "24" series.  If they need my help, I'll be glad to review it for them
