It was my fault I did not pay attention to the reader age group 9-12yrs.  I thought this book would have more details in the stories such as in the real Cinderella it mentions that the evil step sister had to cut parts of their feet to fit into the glass slipper, the prince notices the blood and then asked Cinderella the chamber maid to try on the slipper.  This is never mentioned in this version.  Of course I understand this is geared for children, and I was looking for the adult, true translation, version. The same for the Bluebeard story, looks like I will be returning my copy.  Hopefully a younger person can find some use for this book.
