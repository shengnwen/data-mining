Hmmm...I think I missed a whole lot of somethings.  This is a dreadful novel.  I'll admit, I picked it up because the movie is currently in theaters.  I should have known better.  A review of the movie..."...convoluted plot, ambiguous characters, confusing..." should have scared me off.  Each time I picked it up, I had to re-read a few pages, to figure out who was who and what was or wasn't happening.

I tried to finish this book...honest...but, all too soon, it got tossed in the "drop off at the club" pile.  I never even took the time to read the last few chapters to see what happened.  Why?  Because I had no urge to know.  

Will I watch the movie?  Well, maybe, because I like the actors...but, only once it's offered, free, on "On Demand."  I've spent enough money on this overly-hyped, drivel of a story
