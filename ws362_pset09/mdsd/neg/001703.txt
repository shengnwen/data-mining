I did not find this book particularly good. I did read the entire books, but that at almost 400 pages it was far too long and slow without any benefit from its length. The central characters were somewhat intriguing.   What ruined the book for me were too many inclusions of 20th century slang  terms. Words like &quot;creep&quot; and &quot;the Mob.&quot; were used  freely, but back then they would not have been part of the everyday world  view. I also had the mystery solved in the first few pages. I think if the  book was 200 pages and the mystery was less obvious, it would have been  easier to overlook the inclusion of slang.  I think Lynda S. Robinson does  a better job of writing historical mysteries. Her characters are  interesting to the modern reader without being imports from the modern  world
