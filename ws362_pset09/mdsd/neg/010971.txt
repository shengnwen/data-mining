Lets not get too excited.  Not sure how much reading and technical analysis other readers have done, while I think some of the book is useful other parts of it seem to be a waste and pretty basic.  It wasnt what I was looking for and the price seems way too high.  Seems for whatever reason its out of print in the stores so the author and his company are selling it for a huge mark up.  Didnt get the software and the code doesnt work the way it is written in the book, either out of date or needs to be updated TS code.  
Unless you really want it, I would pass on this one at the price offered
