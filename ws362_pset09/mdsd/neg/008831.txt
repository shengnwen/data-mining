I have always been very impressed with the life of Helen Keller. The difficulties she overcame in life were phenomenal. This book, however, was not interesting to me in the least. I am sad to hear about how she moved away from her traditional Christian background and followed the false teachings of Swedenborg. The book is more about Swedenborg than it is about Helen. It is a strong promotion of Swedenborg's New Church. She claims that he had a special ability from God to find the truth in scripture. The problem is, he like all other cult founders, only takes portions of scripture and uses them out of context. He claimed to have special revelations that no one else ever did. Beware of anyone who makes such claims. According to the book, Helen was pretty silent on her beliefs for the last thirty eight years of her life. I hope she was silent out of her realization that Swedenborg is not master of the truth, but Jesus is the truth instead. I do not recommend you use your time reading this book. It can be spent much more wisely
