I purchased this book for my granddaughter who will soon be 18 and heading off to college.  After looking it over, I can't give her this book.  It has very liberal ideas, and seems like it gives the okay to taking drugs, as long as you don't overdue.  It spends a lot time on sexuallity including what to do if you get pregnant and how to get an abortion.  I will not be giving this book to my granddaughter--it is going in the trash
