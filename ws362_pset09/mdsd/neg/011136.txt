Wendy Doniger, the "translator," of Manu calls the book "evil". Well, you won't confuse her as a cultural or moral relativist. She is quite happy to call attention to 'backwards' India from her Judeo-Christian ivory tower. Only buy this "translation" is you would also consider being taught Torah by an anti-semite.
