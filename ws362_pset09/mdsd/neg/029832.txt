I read this book after it was recommended to me and I came with high expectations, maybe too high. While I respect the writer as a sucessful author I was quite disappointed with this book. It was not the type of writing and storyline I expected.  The book forced me to ask myself if I was starved for more drama or could a simple, fairy-tale story satisfy my thirst? I did want to see more. When I noticed that I was getting very close to the end and nothing happened yet, not even a sex scene, I was wanting something to explode, some gun to go off, something to put me on the edge of my seat and cause me to escape, SOMETHING! I found myself skipping over pages while reading because I was uninterested in conversations, hoping to get to something, something that would drive me and make me say, "I didn't see that coming!" But that didn't happen. Everything was predicable to the very end. And the end was just that, the end, as one reviewer wrote, "The ride off into the sunset" toward D.C and while I wanted very much to feel good and say "Ah, wasn't that sweet?" it wasn't the heart candy that I believe the author was trying to give us. It fell very very short of that. The past life time storyline was just too ill-developed and not at all believeable even if I am one that believes in such possibilities.  I would have loved to have seen that developed more! With that said, I am very sure I will read another book by this author because I know she is an excellent writer. I will give her another try. She's proven herself, but this book just didn't do it for me
