I was greatly disappointed when I read this book after being given a copy of it by one of my Mormon friends.

I'll be the first one to tell other people that it's important to respect other peoples' religious traditions.  However, I find it a lot easier to respect the Mormon's religion than to respect their holy book.  This book strikes me as neither interesting nor deep.  The style of writing is rather uniform, unlike older texts which were compiled from a variety of sources and have been preserved for thousands of years.

My biggest complaint about this book is how it so transparently presents the dominant values of the society that Joseph Smith was living in.  The Jesus that appears in the book of Mormon is not the same Jesus that lived and died two thousand years ago, and whose life and teachings are documented in the four gospels and in other texts.  The Jesus in this book is oversimplified...he does not lead people through the countryside teaching them slowly and in parables, and he does not challenge the authority of organized religion--in contrast, he seems to support the notion of organized religion to some degree.  He simply appears and spouts out a bunch of stuff all at once, in a very simplified fashion, and what he spouts includes a lot of the dominant values from Joseph Smith's society--stuff that has little, if anything, to do with the original Jesus.

I've always wanted to re-write this book.  Maybe I will some day.  I haven't had any divine inspiration to do so, however, and apparently no one else has either...so until this day comes, we'll have to deal with it as it is.  I have a feeling it's not particularly high on God's list of priorities
