I have read the previous reviews and I am puzzled. I do not like this book at all. I have never written a review before but this book drove me to it. I am an experienced baker and tried two recipes following the instructions carefully.  Both failed miserably and I am not willing to waste the butter, or more importantly, the chocolate, to try another.
My first attempt was the Paisely Brownies.  The recipe called for 12 ounces of butter (yes, ounces, not tablespoons).  While nervous about 3/4 of a pound of butter going into essentially a double batch of brownie batter, I forged ahead.  What I got was incredible greasy brownies with a gummy raspberry topping.  I figured the butter amount must have been a typo so I tried again with 12 TABLESPOONS of butter and while the brownies were less greasy, they were still mushy in the middle with a gummy raspberry topping.  Next I tried the Topsy Turvys (didn't even get around to making the sorbet or the pineapple topping).  Each attempt to mold the baked cookie into bowl shapes yielded greasy messes on my counter.  Perhaps I got the two dogs out of the whole bunch but as I have said before, I'm not willing to waste any more butter, chocolate, parchment paper, etc. on any of his recipes
