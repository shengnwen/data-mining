First, I completely disagree with the major conclusions of this book, and frankly, even with its moral perspective.  I find it to be a one-sided work of propoganda which takes the form of an apologetic for the homogenization of the intellectual professions.  This work is a disgrace, highly misleading, and even dangerous if taken literally or adopted in whole as the correct perspective.  Evidence presented is extremely selective and the interpretation is guided mainly by the authors' predetermined values.  Forget about a balanced, multi-perspective book here.  Aside from the dry academic tone of the title, it is anything but an 'objective' or multi-perspective book. Risks are glossed over and lamentable changes to the academic profession are encouraged to be taken as far as possible in this book.  It is a wolf in sheep's clothing - a book pretending to be by and for academics, with an academic mindset; instead, it's a book by managers who, if they could, would devise standardized tests to determine the competence of professors.  People who see homogenization as inevitable and even desirable.  Not my kind of people. The most disturbing thing about this book is that it is sadly, correct and useful as a vision of where higher education may be headed, and it's a dystopian place.  The state (and particularly, the powerful class that manages the state) does want to control universities very badly, and they are finding "subtle" ways to do it.  This book offers a glimpse into some of the things they plan to do in order to end academic freedom while giving the public (and even some very misled academics) the illusion that academic freedom still exists
