Personal feelings aside, I beseech, urge, command that whoever has not read Tolstoy before to stay away from this book until you have read ALL of Tolstoy's previous work. Then you'll realize how simplistic and dull this book is. If you want spiritual guidance, go to church or watch Oprah; if you want art, read all of Tolstoy through Anna Karenin. Peace
