The ESV is a generally a decent translation. However, when it comes to the physical product, it falls to the bottom of the heap. Perhaps it can take a lesson in the printing and binding area from all its "rivals".  

Crossway claims to seek a decent pricing strategy but is it when you survey the entire field... it is another story.

This is not an isolated incident because I had purchased 4 variants of its offerings - 

the premium leather,
the hardcover pew edition,
its bonded leather and 
its Classic Thinline Editions

Each one of them far short of the competition in the generalized categories in binding, print quality and paper quality.

On a side note, I have not physically handled the ones printed over in the UK by HarperCollins noting from the scanned samples I received from a couple of friends, they are using the same printing plates for the EU market. 

HarperCollins (which owns Zondervan) perhaps may deliver differently in the paper and binding quality but then, this is a let down for the folks out here in the US unless we pursue the Anglicized version of the ESV with a higher imported price. 

Because of this, I rank it 2 stars for its dismal print/paper/binding quality. (Harsh but honest observation - It reminded me of the special edition low priced textbook program by the large publishing houses to help low income folks (Indian Edition is one such example). This is not a disparaging comment on the low price book program - that program is is a wonderful effort by some nicer publishing houses to help the needy students in the realm of education!
