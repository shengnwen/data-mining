Anthropology entails 3 perspectives: (1) cross-cultural, or looking at other cultures than our own, (2) holistic, or looking at all parts of culture in relation to each other, and (3) relativistic, or looking at each culture as its own standard of values and meaning.  Notice there is no &quot;Christian perspective.&quot;  Anthropology is not about judging other cultures, and it is certainly not about changing them.  This book should not be called &quot;Cultural Anthropology.&quot;  What it suggests is nothing like anthropology.  It should be called something like &quot;Destroying Other Cultures with Your Culture&quot; or &quot;Destroying Anthropology by Misusing It.&quot;  No real anthropologist would read this book, other than to learn about the mind of the true believer
