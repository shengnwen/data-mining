This is the book that launched the myth that pharmacology could do to the psyche what cosmetic surgery does for the human body. After all the hype and hoopla in the media the reality that SSRI's in general are breakthrough medications for depression have fallen to the sidelines. Prior to 1993 Prozac was handed out only to patients who had severe cases of ocd and depression. Although the SSRI's have a better side effect profile they are not more effective then older meds. Kramer claims to have witnessed miraculous changes in a handful of patients where no other doctor has.

I WONDER WHY KRAMER NEVER WROTE A FOLLOW UP REGARDING THESE PATIENTS WHO HAD UNDERGONE SUCH MAGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS. MAYBE BECAUSE THE EFFECT (IF THERE WERE ANY AT ALL) WERE SHORT LIVED ANY POOPED OUT AFTER A SHORT TIME. HAD THEY BEEN REAL AND LASTING I AM SURE THAT KRAMER WOULD HAVE CASHED IN WITH ANOTHER BESTSELLER. FOOLED AGAIN!
