This book presents as fact that humans and dinosaurs lived on the earth at the same time, that g-d placed all animals on the earth at the same time, and that scientist are all a bunch of crackpots trying to defame Christianity.

If you want to believe that the earth doesn't rotate 1 Chronicles 16:30 or that bats are birds Leviticus 11:19, please go right ahead and use the Bible as a science textbook.  There is no need to produce evidence that scientist are wrong when you have faith
