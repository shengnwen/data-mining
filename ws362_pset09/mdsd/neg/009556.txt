Hi! I'm a pseudo-intellectual and I dabble in obscure Eastern mysticism, therefore I am superior to you. Did I tell you about poignant passage where Az'herlhabeld casts a disenchantment spell on Saturn's rings? Oh that's right, you probably don't know who Az'herlhabeld is because you haven't read the beautifully mystifying KABBALAH
