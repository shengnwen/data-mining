There really is one very good thing about this novel. It is the last one. With no EEEEVVVILL France left, Sir Percy must find a new hobby. Perhaps he will take up bottle-cap collecing. Anyways, I harbor particularly averse  feelings to this particular episode of Pimpernel antics because of its  sickening portrayal of Robespierre. Orczy sure outdoes herself in terms of  historical laughability this time. Actually, I would laugh but I'm too  scared thinking off all the poor misguided people who take the Baronness'  word on this. OK, tell me...is there something wrong with this picture.  Robespierre, that EEEVVVVILLL man, dreams of beheading all of France.  Saint-Just, who anyone who knows anything about the Revolution at all knows  was more radical than R and who supported Robespierre in everything, is  described as &quot;one of the most romantic figures of the entire  Revolution.&quot; This is enough to make one's head ache, if one were  inclined to believe that it is of the least importance at all. Fortunately  for me, I am saved from that unhappy predicament. Like all the rest of the  Pimpernel novels this is a series of unlikely adventures rescuing  aristos...to heck with the common people!....with very little grace of  writing and an absolutely deplorable grasp on reality
