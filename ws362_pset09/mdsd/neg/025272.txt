This book is a definite cure for sleep loss.  If you like hearing neighbors bicker about the town they live in then this is your book.  I personally, can hear the same stories of sadness at my neighborhood town meeting for a lot less money.  Don't waste your time unless you like reading boring, dry commentary about people squabbling inregards to nothing
