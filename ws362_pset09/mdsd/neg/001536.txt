Joe McGinniss once was a good author.  At the age of 25, he wrote "The Selling of the President, 1968," which has since become a classic, read in political science classes across the country.  Then something happened.  He  couldn't live up to the expectations others had of him.  His next book,  "Heroes" parallels the breakdown of his personal life with his growing  disenchantment with his heroes from the 60's.  He concludes that book with  the notion that the only figure he examined who came close to being a  genuine "hero" was Ted Kennedy, and that Kennedy would be the subject of  his next book.  He wasn't.  Instead, McGinniss left politics and started  writing true crime stories.  He was fairly successful in that genre, but  returns to politics with "The Last Brother," the long awaited biography of  Ted Kennedy.  Amazingly, transparently, the whole point of this book is  that Kennedy couldn't live up to people's expectations of him and became  self-destructive as a result.  The book essentially ends with  Chappaquiddick, which happened in 1969, the same year "The Selling of the  President" was published.  But while that book may be been the culmination  of its author's life, Chappaquiddick was only one story in Ted Kennedy's.   Kennedy has been the most influential senator of the last 100 years and has  had his greatest impact on the course of American history in the years  since 1969.  All that is only touched on by McGinniss, who is more  concerned with using Kennedy as a stand-in for himself, and probably his  whole generation.  "Heroes" does it better, but Adam Clymer's new biography  of Kennedy is far superior if you want to read about the senator
