In its time, Rand's vision was intoxicating.  We are now living in a reality where big business pretty much influences everything in our lives, and the society that it has produced isn't exactly what Rand envisioned.  The idea of an unrestrained capitalism sounds wonderful as a philosophy.  But in truth, it's just as dangerous as total government control: Exxon Mobil, Walmart, etc. are not businesses, but institutions with power over our every day lives.  I don't think that this is the world that Rand intended, but it's the outcome of her philosophy.  Her efforts, while noble, have proven to be a failure.
