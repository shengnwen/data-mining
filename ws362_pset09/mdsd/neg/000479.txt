If you know nothing about CSS and you can find an inexpensive copy, this book will get you started, but there have to be better "get started" books. Probably good if someone needs a lot of simple, explicit examples though. The one place I had high hopes for the book was near the end where it dealt with using CSS to format "printer friendly" pages. I'm sure the code was OK, but there was no example of how to link a page formatted for the screen to one formatted for the printer. I was expecting some example of loading a second Style Sheet using the same page code.
