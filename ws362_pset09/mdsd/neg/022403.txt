The back says

He wants her for one night only.  Spanish billionaire Raul Carreras is used to getting what he wants: Nell rose will be his for only one night, and for his pleasure!  Then she becomes pregnant with his child.  Raul's red-hot seduction is hard to resist.  But when Nell falls pregnant with her Spanish lover's child, will she tell him?

The story begins with Raul's neice and nephew running away and he thinks they have been kidnapped.  They run to Nell their former nanny, and Raul thinks that Nell is his brothers former mistress.  So anyway he treats her like crap but asks her to come and be the childrens nanny again and help them adjust to a new life w/o their father who died recently.  I won't give away the whole story but in my opinion the book was very boring and I am suprised I was able to read the whole thing.  There was nothing even very dramatic about her pregancy.  The way he found out was kind of cheesy if you ask me
