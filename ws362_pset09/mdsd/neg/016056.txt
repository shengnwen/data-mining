The movie is dressed with a over serious aura and a pretty dumb but twisty plot, and take all the visual ques from the matrix and cheesy special effects from both daredevil and blade 2 and youve got constantine. Keanu Reeves plays and approaches the same role he did in the matrix. Kind of sucks because had someone else done they wouldve added depth to the charachter instead of butchering it with woodedness. scattered throughout are scenery chewing characters. Gavin Rossdale shouldnt quit day job....on second thought maybe he should stick to acting. The lifeless plot injects little life in the chracters. So what is there left.not much except a few decent action and beo-noir-ish atmospherics. too many times you wish the movie werent so pretentious so you could possibley enjoy whats there
