This might be a good book for someone who don't have any design experience. I was looking for direction in how to begin as a novice with some training rather than starting from scratch. This book is for those who would say, "Hmm should I get into graphic design? Where do I start I no absoultely nothing?". The description just wasn't very helpful to me
