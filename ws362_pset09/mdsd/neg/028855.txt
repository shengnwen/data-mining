Mr. Levine casts himself as a somewhat honorable person in this book. When forced by the SEC to implicate others in insider trading he states he was emotionally devastated but grudgingly complied. He claims his attorney, in 30 years of practice, never witnessed a defendant become so emotional with betraying his work associates.

Hold the presses.

On page 311 of "Den of Thieves" another perspective emerges: "Despite his claims to Wilkis that he'd never cooperate, Levine seemed eager to ensare his fellow conspirators."

This is just one example of Levine's revisionist history. Instead of reading this book, read "Den of Thieves."
