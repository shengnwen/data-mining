I'm sorry, but I've read the reviews about this new graphic novel version of the BSC and I can't believe what I'm seeing.  Like most little girls of the late 80's and early 90's, I was a huge fan of the BSC book series.  I read and collected most of the series. So I was disappointed when I found they weren't being printed anymore, but even more so when I discovered the new graphic novel version in the book store.  While graphic novels certainly have their value and place, I feel it cheapens this series--turning a classic series into little more than a comic book.  Don't underestimate your child's intelligence--get her the originals.
