reading this book, i had the distinct feeling of being at aparty and no-one wanted to let me into their little private conversation. this is probably the reason that a lot of what paul beatty was obviously trying to say went completely unheard by myself. i wanted to like this book &lt;i actually prefer tuff&gt; but it was just hard. i didn't like any of the character's, therefore i didn't care what happened to them. the author of this book is undoubtedly a very clever man, but with so many mixed points of view coming from each of the character's, i ended up just feeling that this was a rather sad and sorry affair. parts of this book are obviously self-autobiographical mixed with the ott fictitious, which made me feel a little bad that people actually had this outlook on people that they don't even know. sometimes leaning extremely close to the rascist and offensive &lt; i refuse to reveal my skin-colour&gt; this was a waste of good subject-material. obviously, i can understand why people waould enjoy this book but i wouldn't personally recommend it to anyone
