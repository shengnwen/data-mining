I laughed out loud when I read Annie Lamont's "Operating Instructions", but I understood the source when I read it.  I am very disappointed in Fox's book because she passes herself off as a "suburban educated mom" who is struggling with role definition.  The book is whiney to a fault, and Fox is not the typical educated professional with whom I can relate. In the first 50 pages I had difficulty getting past her foray into witchcraft and active participation in the pro-abortion movement.  At least one of these, if not both, are huge mis-connects for the "average" person, much less, the market for which the book was supposedly written.  Skip this and read Lamont.
