I had to read Annie John for my English class and I can say that it is probablly one of the worst books I have read yet.  Not only are the characters difficult to relate to, but the book is extremely dull and written as a comeing of age story. Basically, the book starts out with Annie, the protagonist a girl growing up in Antigua remembering how much her mother loved her when she was a young girl. Then, in the next few chapters, Annie describes herself as a 12 year old girl going to school and having an overpowering love for her friend Gwen.  She has behavior problems and does some things that her mother seems shamed about and she further distances from her mother. The next couple chapters, she is an akward 15 yr. old in classes with older girls who are more developed then she is as she puts it and she dislikes this.  At this time, her thoughts that her mother doesn't like her have escalated into her hating her mother and her thinking that her mother returns these same feelings.  She doesn't love Gwen anymore and feels lonely.  Finally, when she is 17 she leaves home and goes to train to become a nurse and oddly actually will miss her mother even though throughout the book (for the most part) she has shown strong resentment and hatred towards her mother....Anyway, this book was so extremelly horrible and I hope you don't ever read it. If you decide to read it or are forced to I pity you, because this book is trash and I don't see why anyone would publish it...BIG MISTAKE on their part.
