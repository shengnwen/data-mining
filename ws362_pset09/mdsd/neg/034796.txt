This book was not funny at all.  I consider myself an open person.  If a mother wants to breastfeed, then she should breastfeed.  If she prefers formula, then use formula.  There can even be a happy medium (I used both).  This book made breastfeeding mothers sound like selfish, nosey, busybodies who have nothing better to do than dish out unwanted advice.  It implied that mothers who chose to use formula were victims.  I found the material and language to be offensive and insulting.
