The only amusing thing about this collection is that Dean Koontz fancies himself a children's author.  The premise is a clever idea gone horribly wrong. Much of the rhyme is unoriginal or forced and some of it goes on and on and on so that we feel we are stuck in one of the author's horror novels.  Stick to what you do best Mr. Koontz and leave quality children's writing to quality children's authors, please
