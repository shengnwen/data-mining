This book is a good book, however there are certain people who should NOT purchase it. If you were someone who did well in high school, got good grades, managed to juggle school with other commitments like a job, sports teams, volunteer work, and family issues, this book is NOT for you!! You will only find repetitive tips and techniques that you've already learned and implemented into your life. If however, you are someone who didn't do their best or as well as you would have liked in high school, and want to improve, then I DEFINITELY recommend this book to you. You'll find nearly every basic tip that you should add to your repertoire in becoming an A+ student
