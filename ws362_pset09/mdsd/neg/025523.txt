As a political junkie, I loved reading "Election 2004", for the behind-the-scenes peek at the candidates' campaigns (well, mostly Kerry's). However, if you are to enjoy the book, you must realize that:

a) Newsweek is very pro-Kerry.
b) the Bush campaign (wisely) kept them at arms-length.

So we get fawning adulation over Kerry's daughters, while Bush's twins are treated as snide pranksters. Laura Bush is "simple", while Teresa Heinz Kerry "takes charge". The Swift Boat Vets are "grudge-bearing" while 527s like Moveon.org are "groundbreaking". Kerry's team used "sound strategy" while Karl Rove and Karen Hughes cooked up "dirty tricks". You get the picture.
