This was my first Grafton novel, and unless I take the word of a few other reviewers-that prior works in this series were much better-it will be my last.  There was essentially no plot and little character development. I agree with another reviewer, that perhaps this is what the trivial, day-to-day activities of a real-life PI might be like. I only finished it to see if at least there was an interesting twist in the solution of the case. I was disappointed to the end.
