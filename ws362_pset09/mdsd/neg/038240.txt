I'm not sure Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel.  I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point.  The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes.  But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'.  Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations.  I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers:  this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers.  It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then.  Yuck
