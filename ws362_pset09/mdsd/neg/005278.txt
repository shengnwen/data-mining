Conan is one of the great characters from fantasy literature.  Immensely powerful physically, keen witted, iron willed, and incredibly audacious... the barbarian from the bleak hills of Cimmeria is the star of many highly entertaining stories.

The bad news is that none of those stories appear in this book.  Robert E. Howard was the creator of Conan and none of his stories appear in this volume.  What is here is the work of enthusiatic but far less talented individuals who were such big fans of Conan that they were inspired to write their own tales.  I have read all of their stories and find that they are immediately recognizable as pale imitations of the original.

In sum, Conan is well worth reading and all of the original Howard stories are now available in paperback.  I would highly recommend buying those volumes and forget that this one exists.
