I read this book because my husband is a professor of intercultural communication and management. I am from the city where the material was gathered. After reading these 'entertaining' stories, I found myself asking questions to my husband and friends as to why do the Japanese not know how to explain their own culture. But, I then thought that Japanese culture is too complicated, as any other country, and Japanese culture is rapidly changing - even more so with the younger generation for this out-dated material, the  essays are university assignments from as old as seven years ago, to be applicable. It might be important to keep in mind that this book offers some very general opinions of how one British professor interpreted Japanese culture, as experienced by students who had to write an English assignment for a ESL lecture. My friends and I never thought that much about our work when we wrote it, it was school work only. However, it may be especially helpful for someone who understands only the basics of Japanese stereotypes. While the essays on values such as giri, amae, etc. are pointing at key values, I think they might continue further talks and scattered or old views of Japanese young people
