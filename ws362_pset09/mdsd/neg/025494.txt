This is the same review I posted for Green Mars. Also applies to Blue Mars. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.

I love epics, so I plodded through this trilogy, hoping it would get better, but it never did. I could sense that Robinson was extremely proud of the detailed world he created, but the story is horrible. The story unfolds glacially, with no sense of movement. Just when you think you might be getting attached to a character, he/she dies. Interesting story lines get dropped. There are long, long stretches where Robinson just describes everyday life, in excruciating, boring detail. There is no excitement or suspense, no character that grabs you. It's like some dull person's real life, full of routine, disappointment, and boredom. Robinson's typical character has a dream, begins to pursue it, getting you inspired, then gets killed or just gives up and joins the cause he was fighting.

This was the worst science fiction I have ever read. I can't believe I read all three books
