I found out that there isn't any difference with Adkins for Life from the first book.  Disappointing,  I tried both with a group of folks from work and we all have had the same results.  However, I never support anything unless I have been convinced it truly does what it says and I found that with "the average joes diet."  A friend told me about it and I was always considered the fat girl.  No longer! and it's stayed off.
