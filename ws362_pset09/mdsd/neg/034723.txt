I had to stop reading because I could not tolerate this novel any longer! I read 280 pages, and just couldn't finish it. Explicit sexual scenes seem to be the norm with Baxter these days. In this pornographic novel, Baxter describes two naked teenage children having sex in public, with adults watching them while pleasuring themselves. He goes into graphic detail. It's disgusting and shameful. Oh...it's all part of the story, and their behavior is just a result of the key plot element. 
That's an excuse to explore deviant behavior.

I am shocked that Clarke associated with this rubbish, because it reads nothing like a Clarke novel. For whatever reason, Baxter's publisher managed to get Clarke's name on the book. In my estimation, Clarke wrote or co-wrote the first chapter and that's all, because that was the only good part of the book! (BAIT AND SWITCH!).  

I have completely turned 180 degrees from being a fan of Baxtor to absolutely loathing his garbage now. He had a good run early on, but has totally lost it. I loved Ring, The Time Ships, Flux, all the way up to Vacuum Diagrams. This novel, like all of his recent work, suffers from pathetically weak character development (I am so apathetic toward his characters, I can't recall their names). His use of questionable and outdated physics theories, and his obsession with explicit sexual scenes makes this all but intolerable to a true sci-fi fan. I will never read anything from this former author again.
