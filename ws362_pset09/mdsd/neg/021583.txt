that I even read this book!  Even knowing it's a re-release doesn't help!
My sister-in-law and I are avid Plum fans and I guess it will have to suffice to say that we will simply stick to the Plum titles and leave the rest behind.

This book was SO light, I'm surprised it didn't just float away.  I think successful writers should not be so money-hungry that reprinting of old titles becomes the name of the game... JMHO
