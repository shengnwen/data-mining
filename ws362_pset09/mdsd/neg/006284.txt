This has to be one of the dullest and least insightful titles addressing the World Trade Center -- and just because it was written before the attack is no excuse! Clearly a kind of thesis that somehow got published, this badly written and unevenly researched book also adds to its misdeeds by purporting to be a story of the trade center's construction, yet offering no pictorial material to bring its desert-dry text to life. I was very sad to have wasted money on this book
