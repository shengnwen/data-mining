If you are looking for a biography on Daphne Du Maurier, I would not recommend Haunted Heiress.  This is a rambling, free form work of literary criticism.  You would do better to check this book out from the library rather than paying the steep price.

You can learn more about the story of Du Maurier's life by doing a web search.  

Also, if you are interested in visuals, there are none in Haunted Heiress, save for the cover. The text did conjure up some mental images of Ms. Auerbach, though... (narcissistic, cranky, and snobbish) but none of Daphne Du Maurier. 

I did very much appreciate Ms. Auerbach's observations on Du Maurier's affinity for the way men can live their lives, with more freedom and flexibility. 

I wish Ms. Auerbach would have done more research on Du Maurier's life and interwoven it with her pop-up thoughts on this book or that
