This book is near useless!  Don't let the title fool you this book has near nothing to do with Graham's views on value investing.  It is an extremly boring book on Ben's life, one which makes me have little or no respect for Ben as a person.  I made the mistake of choosing this book hoping to pick up some tips and save a few bucks on the cover price, instead of buying the sure things (Intelligent Investor or Security Anaylsis).  Those looking to be a value investor, this is one where there is little "value" in my opinion, and money would better be served somewhere else
