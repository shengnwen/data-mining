I would advise those who are interested in Medjugorje to read the books by Michael Jones and Donal Foley for a more complete and accurate picture of Medjugorje. Please note the Roman Catholic Church has in NO WAY authorized these alleged "apparitions" in Medjugorje as approved for personal belief. In fact, the Bishop of the diocese in which Medjugorje resides has written at least two opinions that the Blessed Mother is NOT appearing there. 
If you can get your hands on The Medjugorje Deception by Michael Jones I believe you will get a more balanced view of Medjugorje. I truly would hate for someone to go to Medjugorje and lose their faith instead of increasing it
