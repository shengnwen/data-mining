Read this book and see Christian zealotry at its worst.  Let's see, we have two amazingly naive girls who want to help the needy and change the world.  Hey, that's good.  Hummm, well, there just are not enough needy folks here in the US, so let's be world travelers!  Yeah, that's the ticket!  More, let's go where it is illegal to preach our religion! Yes, let's live dangerously!   More still, let's endanger folks who are so poor they consider clean water a gift and let's preach our illegal stuff to them.   These two nitwits are shameful, silly, and - make no mistake - dangerous.  Their selfish acts endangered innocent people - poor, destitute people.  Sadly, when one considers that they were treated as "heroes" upon their rescue (which endangered military personnel), we are in bad shape and things are getting worse.  Thank God that we are not a theocracy ............... yet.
