This is a &quot;self help&quot; book for managers and other senior level people that are job hunting.  The author is a recruiter of the &quot;headhunter&quot; variety - she gets quality people for companies for a fee.  This book (subtitled &quot;12 secrets to getting on the headhunter's radar screen&quot;) contains advice on how to act and what to write about yourself to better your chances of getting picked up by a headhunter.  The title is great!  It sold me the book, but then the book did not meet my expectations.  There is an excellent chapter on the interview, and a fair amount of very scattered miscellaneous advice that you must dissect from filler, padding, and repetition.  The disappointing things about the book were the remarkable lack of advice on getting selected by a recruiter, and the frequently repeated notion that only through a retained recruiter can you succeed.  The author, of course, has her bias.  The &quot;12 secrets&quot; are not really secret.  Most of the book is pretty mundane &quot;resume/cover letter/interview&quot; advice of the type that can be found in most &quot;job hunting&quot; books
