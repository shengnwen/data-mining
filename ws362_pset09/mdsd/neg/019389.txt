This book is a horrible waste of time.  Oh my gosh, the minimum wage taco maker put 2.5 oz of cheese on my taco instead of three.  Well, I think that I will march to wall street and burst into the CEOs office and get him to give me a new taco. If you want to learn how to become a complete jerk, please read this book, as it is an excellent guide.  If you want real customer service, try Clark Howard's book
