Yet again another boring book written with all the flair and emotional insight of the list of ingredients on the back of a shampoo bottle. I was not titilated or enlightened by this characters constant sexual confusion. I WAS IRRITATED AND DISGUSTED!!! When did V. C. Andrews turn into an after school special!?! I guess when she became a franchise! This is the only book of "hers" in the past 15 years that I have not purchased (HINT, HINT). Way back at End of the Rainbow I thought it couldn't get any worse. Sadly it has. I will not be purchasing any more of these books in the future.
