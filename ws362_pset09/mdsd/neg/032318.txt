No, not my type of book.  I really hate to put this review on here with all the other wonderful reviews about it! lol;  however, I guess people do need to hear from those of us that have differing opinions. I really thought I'd like it after reading IJ's 'A Magnificent Rogue' - but I was wrong.  It was very slow reading &amp; I was having a hard time staying in it then the heroine started acting extremely stupid &amp; the hero turned into an a real jerk.  I suppose I would have to say that due to his raising, he might have actually come a long way in life, but I still couldn't enjoy either the hero or the heroine.  So... I can't say I'd recommend this one
