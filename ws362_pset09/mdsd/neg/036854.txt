This work contains a number of Borges' most- well known 'ficciones'. 'Pierre Menard Author of the Quixote' starts off with a catalogue of the surviving known writings of this 'fictive' author. It then describes his great project the rewriting or writing anew of 'Don Quixote' and his completion of chapters nine, and thirty- eight, and partial completion of chapter twenty- two. It goes on to explore the meaning and implication of a writing which word- by- word is identical with the original and yet reads differently.
The other stories are also among Borges' most well- known. 'Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius' 'The Lottery in Babylon' 'The Garden of Forking Paths' 'Death and the Compass'.
Among the non- fiction works are 'Kafka and his Precursors' the now legendary 'Borges and I' ' Everything and Nothing' ' Nightmares' and 'Blindness'.
Borges games with Identity and Time are played here in the most masterful way. His depiction of the elusiveness and non- apprehendable reality of the private self is complemented by his celebration of the communal cooperative creation which is Literary Tradition. 
This does not mean the work is not moving on a private confessional level. For however metaphysical it may seem Borges and I tells us much about the man himself, coffee- drinker, map- reader and student of Stevenson and Kipling. The concluding essay is of course a most moving one, as it is impossible not to be touched by the voice of 'sightlost creators who heroically persist in creating literature for the world- Homer, Milton and Borges who God 'provides day- labor for, light denied.'
The mystery and joy of great Literature is in these pages. 
Read and delight
