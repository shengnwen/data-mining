I bought this book because it was reviewed well.  I have no idea who liked it, or whom it is for.  It's definitely not an investor's book, despite the title.  It's more of a theoretical diatribe by the authors against Graham and Dodd -- read that instead.

It claims to be the updated version.  The preface mentions Enron, but everything else is from the 60s and 70s.  Examples talk about oil at $5 per barrel.

Overall, it's a disappointment, with very little that's useful or interesting
