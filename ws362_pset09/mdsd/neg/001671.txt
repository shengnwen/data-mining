I admit that this was a light read.  I found the premise very interesting, and I didn't want to put the book down.  While there were some small places in this book where the writing was very good, much of it wasn't.  As well, I found some grammatical errors that irritated me.  Finally, I didn't like the main character, and not because she was a prostitute, but because her personality was very weak, flakey, and passive aggressive.  I found her very one dimensional.
