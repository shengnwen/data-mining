I was encouraged to buy this book by all of its positive reviews, but was disappointed to find it to be almost completely useless for me. First, our training seminars are reasonably well established: I was looking to better "market and promote" them, as the title of the book says. Unfortunately there are only 2 or 3 pages on this subject in the entire book, and they are little more than recommendations to buy the books & tapes from other promoters that the author works with.

This book does not provide helpful information so much as it plugs the author's many other products that promise to do so. It reads like a self-help book from the 1990's.

I was looking for a professionally presented source of good usable information (something that we provide in our seminars) but instead got a hard lesson on used car salesmanship 101. I am confident that those who leave my seminars got their money's worth, but I expect that Fred Gleeck makes a lot more money at his. Two different ways of doing business, I guess
