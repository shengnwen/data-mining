I am trying to learn enough Korean to be able to function in Korea even if on my own. The words chosen for the flash cards are not much help for what I wanted (unless I am at the zoo). This is a great concept but...if you are like me and want to learn words that will help you communicate in everyday situations save some money and make your own flash cards
