I bought this book based on the great reviews it has but the exercises did not ease my back pain. After suffering from back pain for over 20 years my hopes were getting lower and lower to find any relief. Going 3 years to the chiropractor helped somewhat but not really.

Reading another customer review I came across some exercises by DonTigny that correct commonly overlooked sacroiliac joint partial dislocation. This condition is most often overlooked as a source of severe and constant back pain. Even better you can download the program for free. Just google Richard Louis DonTigny home program.

This condition was totally unknown to me but after doing the exercises a few times something popped in my hip area and my back pain started to ease. Now 4 months later I am still pain free and can cut my own fire wood again something that was before simply out of the question.

If the Book Pain Free helps your back pain great ... if not maybe give Richard Louis DonTigny free exercises a try I am certainly glad that I did
