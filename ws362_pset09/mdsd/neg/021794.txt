Moon's activities, which include recently crowning himself "King of America" in a Senate office building is almost to surreal to believe. That he had a well known Senator reserve the room is equally disturbing.

This piece of information is *not* correct, Rev. Moon was *NOT* crowned "King of America"!

Dressed in a floor-length cape, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon was dubbed the king of peace at a coronation ceremony in the Dirksen Senate Office Building attended by several members of Congress. 

Moon is the founder of the Unification Church - currently known as The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification.  

According to columnist Bill Berkowitz, on March 23 Moon presided over the event during which he presented the "Crown of Peace" award to a number of honored guests.

......  

You as well as I are to be true parents and kings and queens of peace. Today, heavenly fortune is with us.

So what Rev. Moon says here is that *all* people should be *peace-makers* or kings/queens of peace. 

I can't help to notice that often the anti-cult crowd seems to not getting the facts straight.
