This book of short stories and poems by Edgar Allan poe is very confusing. I would only suggest this book to an adult of teenager with an extremely wide vocabulary. I'm in middle school and I didn't really undrestand some of the stories. If you are into bazzar and weird things then this is the book for you. don't get me wrong Edgar Allan Poe is an awsome writer but the book is a little confusing. Be sure to make the right choice on this book
