To the reader unfamiliar with the complexity of Holocaust and Catholic history Fr Blet's book could appear helpful.  Indeed as a summary of the Vatican's 12 volume series of Vatican during WW2 it is indeed helpful.  I  argue that this is where the positives end. This work is so tightly bound  by its parameters that it is difficult to see how it contributes anything  to the debate over Pius XII's wartime role.  Blet has, by his own  admission, produced an edited version of the twelve volume series Actes et  Documents.  The lack of references, an index and contextual detail from  both the wider Catholic world and the war years make this work weak.  While  Cornwell may have stirred things up by asking difficult questions - at  least he took the risk and asked them.  By failing to even address Pius'  pre-1939 history (where the evidence for his future action or inaction lay)  Blet has avoided taking any risks with the subject matter.  It makes the  case for the Pope's defenders look precarious.  The treatment of the Rome  Jews in October 1943 belies the whole neutrality scenario of Pius XII. The  documentation cannot hope to cover all the aspects of this part of the  nightmare of the Shoah.  While the train rolled out of Rome he was silent.   At every stop up the Italian peninsula people rang the Vatican to inform  them where the train was in the hope that the Pope would say something.   The silence of October 1943 has no justification for whatever reason.  I  respect Cornwell because he at least tried to make sense of the man's  inaction.  I cannot respect Father Blet's work since it looks alarmingly  like a &quot;damage control&quot; exercise out to crush any suggestion that  Pius did make mistakes after all
