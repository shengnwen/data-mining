This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.  

I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion
