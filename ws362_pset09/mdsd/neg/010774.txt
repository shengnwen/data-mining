What I thought would be an interesting trip through time and the consequences of time travel, was all jumbled up with ghosts, astrial traveling and disappearing infant clones. Sorry, but it was all alittle too much for me.

The father / daughter relationship was interesting and the only thing worthwhile in this story.
