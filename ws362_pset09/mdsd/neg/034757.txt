Most of her &quot;ideas' can be found in any monthly magazine except for some of the suggestions that were a real hoot: &quot;apply polish only to the center portion of your nail&quot;, &quot;apply honey and yogurt over body and let soak in for five minutes&quot;, for puffy faces &quot;carry a metal spoon...and keep it in a glass of ice water and hold it wherever your face is puffy&quot;, apply coffee grounds to cellulite, etc., etc. So, buy this only if you need it for the humor
