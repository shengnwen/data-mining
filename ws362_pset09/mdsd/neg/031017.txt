I've read The Other Boleyn Girl and a great deal of Philippa Gregory's other works and found them to be thoroughly enjoyable and hard to put down.  It is therefore unfathomable to me that she could have written such a disgusting, morally-repulsive "novel" (and I use the term loosely)such as this.  

This book is about a woman's desperate need to retain control of the land she grew up on.  Land which, by legal rights, passed to her dimwitted, sexually depraved, mouse of a brother.  The incest scenes are rife and horrifyingly detailed.

I could not bring myself to even finish this book, and I certainly was not about to read the final two in the trilogy.  If you have even the smallest thread of moral fiber...run the other way.  This book will make you ill
