The train directions are either out of date or were never correct to begin with.  The book tells you to take trains that do not exist, and then they don't even include the phone number you need to call a cab when their bad directions make you end up lost.  I can't fault the book for leaving out lots of good restaurants, but I can fault it for including some that were so bad they made me sick.

I cannot comment on everything in the book, but as a guide to restaurants, museums, and transportation it is the pits.  I have used dozens of different travel guides in my life, but this is the only one that has ever been so bad I felt it deserved a negative rating.

Do not be fooled.  If you are interested in New York's cultural sites or food that won't keep you up with heartburn, do not buy this book.  It contains nothing but misdirections, and the people leaving me negative feedback just think it's hip to be a Time-Outer
