    I read a good short story by Franzen in The New Yorker a couple years ago, but this book is lame, lame, lame.  The essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy, boring opinions on various subjects.  Imagine if you can a duller, less-relavant Andy Rooney.  If I wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings, I would get on the internet and start reading weblogs.  I hereby declare this book Unreadable
