I like Tauntons press books alot. So when I went to find a book on painting I looked for thier book on painting.
Most of Tauntons Press books go into more advanced aspects of what ever they are refering to. This book is more suited  for the slow 2nd grader. It mostly deals with outside painting and staining.
nothing at all on how to roll inside walls. This is the WORST book that I have ever bought. This book does not even come close to Tauntons Press normal quality, Shame on you Tauntons..
