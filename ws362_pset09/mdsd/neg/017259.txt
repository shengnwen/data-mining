I like most of Jodi Picoult's books, but this was the worse one I have ever read. The story line was ridiculous and unbelievable. The main character in the book, Trixie, is a teenager with problems but her parents never seem to realize this. They go to incredible lengths to protect her and never hold her responsible for any of her actions. The drawings in the book were distracting and annoying. I would not recommend this book to anyone
