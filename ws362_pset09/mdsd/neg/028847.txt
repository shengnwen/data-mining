I normally don't write reviews for books, but I had to for this one because it is so bad, as many others have said. I too am a Gibson fan. But I want the time spent reading this book back, I feel it was so wasted.

I almost put the book down, but instead I foolishly hoped Gibson would somehow tie all the scattered, half hearted events together in the end. As many have said, you never find out what this "nodal point" is. The payoff NEVER comes.

You don't get close to really any of the characters. You want to get close to Rydell, but there is not enough of him there. There is WAY too much jumping around.

And there is way too much of "look at what a clever writer I am" by writing incomprehensible "creative" prose.

I don't know why some writers - even great writers- fail to grasp the most important point about writing: It's the STORY stupid. 

This book is a chain of events that are disconnected, unfinished and unsatisfying. Read some of his earlier works, sure, but don't pick up this painted mess, regardless of what the so-called reviews on the cover say
