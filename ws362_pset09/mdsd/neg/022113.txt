Looking at pictures of Richard Laymon you get the idea that he wasn't popular with girls. This shows in his characters voyeurism and their rape fantasies (and this from the supposedly good guys) that they constantly indulge in. Most lead female characters in his novels inevitably end up been raped and beaten. There is no suspense in the novels at all, just characters that you actually hope will get killed just so that their inane thoughts and deeds will come to an end.

He recycles the same few stories over and over again just changing the characters names (exactly the same as his good friend Dean Koontz). His stories are basically just more perverted versions of Koontz's.

I really enjoy violent novels (like Michael Slade, Rex Miller, T Winter-Damon etc) but Laymon books are just puerile trash
