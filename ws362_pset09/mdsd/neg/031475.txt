Anyone armed with a high school world history textbook could have written this highly disappointing book.  My message for Mr. Fromkin: tell me something I don't know!  For beginners, say at a middle school or high school level, this book may teach you a thing or two.  For lovers of world history who are looking for rich details to expand their knowledge of the subject, this book will leave you wanting and quite bored.  It has all the basic facts that you can fit in 200 pages.  Perhaps Fromkin's other books are better, but I'm not going to take that chance.  When discussing European domination of the world leading up to the First World War, he states, "The world was won; the world was one."  Brilliant!  Let's give this guy a Pulitzer Prize!  Folks, save your time and money
