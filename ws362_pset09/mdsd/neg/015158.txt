The story had potential - a Pygmalion-like transformation story - but fell flat on its face with repetitive, immature writing, flat characters for whom you feel no empathy, and a lack of detail in settings and places.  Don't waste your time - you can get something similar in The Nanny Diaries or The Devil Wears Prada
