This book actually deserves 4 or 5 stars EXCEPT that the one that we got when we ordered it (a few weeks ago) has a major printing error- after page 138 pages 59-90 are repeated, before picking the story back up at page 171. That means that you miss the end of the second story and the beginning of the third, which caused great distress when it was discovered halfway through a long plane flight! We have the first Harper Trophy paperback edition (2003). Get the book- but make sure you get a different edition
