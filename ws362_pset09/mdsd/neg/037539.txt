I do not object to a humorous book about the exploitation of the Holocaust.  There is no doubt that the Holocaust has made too many scoundrels rich and famous.  There is also no doubt that it deserves a comic treatment, at least as part of a normalization of the abnormal.  

At first the novel is indeed funny, hilariously so.  It is no crime on the part of the author to be unable to keep this up for the whole length of the book.  The humor quickly ends and the rest of the novel is deadly dull.  I am in no position to complain about this, there is considerable talent in this book.  It just cannot sustain itself long enough to be taken seriously. Nice try thought
