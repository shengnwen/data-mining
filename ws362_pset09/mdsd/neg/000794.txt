Al Franken is intelligent, witty and informed and for those of us who were already sick to death of Rush Limbaugh's dreck when this book was released, it was a guilty pleasure. Yes, we knew the taunting was childish but on the other hand, we also knew Rush needed to be taken down a peg or two. Reason and facts weren't having the least effect, so why not hit him where it hurt?

However, with the benefit of hindsight, maybe it's not so funny to publicly humiliate people for their physical appearence. Especially when it results in the target trying so desperately to drop pounds, he becomes addicted to drugs (hey, fellow liberals, if we have enough compassion to support needle-exchange programs for street junkies, why do some of us have bumper stickers mocking R. L. for HIS drug problems?)

Neither is it very funny to contemplate the further degeneration of public discourse in this country. How can we complain about Ann Coulter and insist the Right renounce her unless we renouce the childish name-callers in our own ranks?

And so, although I agree with Franken's other, truly serious political critiques of the pundits, on my bookshelf, this particular title has worn out its welcome
