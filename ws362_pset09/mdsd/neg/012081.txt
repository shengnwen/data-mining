I heard a radio article about this and it sounded like the perfect Father's Day present. I found only favorable reviews here, so I ordered it. If, instead, I had flipped through it at a bricks and mortar store, I would not have purchased it. There are plenty of towns with funny names. In some cases, the author was unable to find a good explanation for the name. I can see how that would be difficult since he was usually in each town for only a short time. However, in places he found nothing memorable to photograph, he should have struck those towns from the list. Many of the towns were just names on a map, so there was no building or sign to photograph. In these cases the author found local residents willing to stand in front of nothing and provide exaggerated grins, or policemen willing to pose beside their cars at roadside.    The author ruined an already mediocre project by disrespecting the local residents. The condescending remarks, couched in attempted humor in the final pages, are unforgiveable
