I have never enjoyed reading the novels of one historical romance author so much. But this was a dissapointment Ms. Small! Altough she always has bored me a trifle with her details, the plots are usually well thought out and intriguing. But in this novel, after finding the love of her life, Patrick has dementia and they cancel their wedding plans. After two years she lets Logan who pursues her constantly throughout the novel take her body and her hand in matrimony after she refuses him so long! When it says: "Rosamund sat up. What was she doing? She jumped from her bed, lokking to gather up her other garments. "You shall not have me you monster!" I thought she was coming to her senses and would finally wait on her true love to regain his memory , but alas twas not to be. She should not have married again. It was tantamount to a betrayal! I am so mad atMs. Small for ending this book this way! I give the book two stars for the romance of a lifetime she allowed us to see between Rosamund and Patrick
