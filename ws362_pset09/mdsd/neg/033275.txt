This book just drowns in the satire it tries to create.  It takes extremely long just to get to the real plot of the story and throughout that setup it's just the same thing over and over again: Meet a drunk, stupid noble; Befriend him; and buy his dead souls.  
If you can get past that, the book becomes a downward spiral of unspired "wit," as people like to call poor commentary on a society
