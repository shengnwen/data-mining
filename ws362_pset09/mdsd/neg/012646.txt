this is one of the worst maps i have ever read. the streets are printed so small it is near impossible to read, and the street index is impossible to use due to the fact that some of the streets are listed by the article and others by the first word. give yourself a break and just pick up a free map at any of the numerous tourist information boards located around the city, most notably in grand place. the only reason to get this map is if you are going to be traveling in the brussels suburbs, where the free maps do not cover.

oh, and one more thing. the easiest way to get around brussels is through their easy and free subway system. this map does not have any of the stops on it, as opposed to any of the free maps
