This publication features vague descriptions of photo concepts that makes it useless for reference.  Possibly good for beginners, but if you are even an amateur photographer, you need a book that describes more in depth about filters, push processing, lenses, and chemicals. I was slightly disappointed and am still looking for a good reference book. For now, I am just googling concepts that I am  trying to research. Works better than this book
