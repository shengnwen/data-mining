I love "This American Life". I love "The Incredibles". I hate Sarah Vowell. She is rude and mean, and I wonder what gives her the right to think she is so much better than all those mass-cultured, uneducated people she scorns so much. I'm a 20-something, college educated, art-loving female punk musician from New York City (have I impressed you yet, Sarah??), and I am certainly unimpressed by Sarah Vowell's ability to randomly name-drop and brag about the artists, musicians, and authors she likes. Her condescending tone and mundane analyses of life leave much to be desired. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who actually knows a thing about art, music, or life
