I've had the misfortune to come into constant contact with Blanche Boyd seeing that she's a professor at my college. She berates students' work if it doesn't match her narrow definition of what "good" writing is and trashes well known authors, probably because she is nowhere near as successful. She is self-absorbed and abrasive, as is this book. Do yourselves a favor and DON'T waste your time on it
