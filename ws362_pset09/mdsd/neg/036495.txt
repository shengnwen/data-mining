I bought this book thinking it might help my daughter learn her multiplication facts. However, for the strategies explained in this book to help, you'd have to be a math whiz, and also know a fair number of multiplication facts to begin with. For example, this is the strategy for multiplying by 6: "Six is pretty quick to do, just multiply by 3 then 2. If this sounds like too much trouble, triple first before you double!" (!!) Now, this might be handy if the book taught an easy way to triple, but the strategy for multiplying by 3 is: "Three is as easy as can be, if you triple what you see. In other words just add it thrice, this simply is one more than twice!" Simple, hunh? I would have given the book 1 star, but I liked the illustrations
