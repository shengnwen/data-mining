As a former reviewer has stated this edition takes quite a bit of liberty in excising the less flattering aspects of Tocqueville's views of America.  In fact the entire section on race-relations has been excised --perhaps it was deemed too controversial?  This kind of editing is even more unacceptable in our age of open communications and hopefully open minds. Find another edition.
