I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.
