I often find that books that try to be two things at once don't really make it as either, and this is a case in point.  I thought it might be a book ABOUT the Mutter Museum and the exhibits there, but it's not really, it's a book of artsy photographs that happen to be taken at the museum.  However, it then includes bits and pieces of medicine and medical history, but never enough to really give you any perspective or answer questions you might have about the pictures.  There is a section at the end that is straight writing without photos, but it's ALSO a muddled mess---a thrown together hodge-podge of history and only one, for some reason, case study.  I don't think the medical information was that well edited, as I read with surprise that now babies born as early as the 3rd month of gestation can survive outside the womb!  Wow!  I bet that will be news to many OB/GYNs!

Maybe I don't know enough about art photography, but I found the photos underwhelming.  Many were not really focused.  There were often more than one of the same exhibit, from different angles, and for some reason in different places in the book.  The most jarring photos to me were not the sad ones of horrible deformities but the ones with the dogs of William Wegman posing with such things as a preserved diseased foot.  WHY?  I felt it was really a blow to the dignity of the people that gave their body parts to science.

The best part of the book to me was the older photos, taken in the 19th century, which gave dignity to their subjects, and the pictures of wax models.  They were so much more straightforward and clear than the other photos.

Overall, not worth the money.  I hope someone at some point does a different book about this museum
