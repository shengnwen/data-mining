All these posts must be by people who didn't actually take the time to READ THE BOOK!!!!! All I have to say is that the direction of current flow shown in the diagrams is either wrong, or varies widely between conventional and electron theory. For example, on page I-41 they show electron theory current flow from a battery through a lamp in the right direction (negative to positive), but then later in the section discussing Ammeters pages I-95 through I-104 they consistently show current flow going in the WRONG DIRECTION. Obviously the person who did the diagrams was confused and no one did a good job checking their work. This is the kind of thing that is terribly confusing for a person trying to learn "BASIC ELECTRICITY" and is just plain sloppy. I want my money back!!
