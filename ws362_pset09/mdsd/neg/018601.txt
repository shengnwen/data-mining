I looked forward to reading this book because it was presented to me as definitive in its field.  Much to my chagrin, what I read sounded as calm and reflective as something that might have been issued from the Union war office in 1863.  Cash has nothing good to say for the South, which is why this piece of cheap propaganda is a &quot;classic.&quot;  After reading about two hundred pages, I looked at the paragraph or two about the author, which stated what I had already suspected.  Cash was a Southerner who wrote this book and then hanged himself.  If you want to experience page after chapter after page of a man with complete self-loathing, then I recommend The Mind of the South, a book in which we learn much about Mr. Cash's mind in Cloud-Cuckooland, though next to nothing about the real South.  That this book is often foisted on unsuspecting students fills me with loathing
