I found this book to be useful for students who are trying to get started with IC design but less useful to the practicing engineer. The Circuits discussed in the book are old and some are not practical to implement in today's IC processes. The Book also fairly touches on simulation using SPICE level 3 models which is very outdated, most IC Designs use BSIM3 as an industry standard. I should also mention the book's strongest section is the one that covers OPAMP compensation, this particular subject is well treated in this book
