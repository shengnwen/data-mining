This book is not for people of color.  Paula Begoun only devotes 10 pages to information regarding black hair, and actually has the audicity to say, "Suffice it to say that the natural state of black hair is currently not an acceptable fashion statement for women of color."  IS SHE CRAZY??? This statement is extremely offensive. (Would anyone ever say almond shaped eyes are unacceptable on asian people?)  This is a part of our genetics and our looks. Does Paula notice all of the models, actresses, singers and even politicians who are black (women) who wear their hair natural???  Even white people and asian people try to braid/lock their hair to look like ours!!  If she thinks natural black hair is unacceptable, then she should not write books abour hair care, and go live by herself on an island (which is obviously where she has been).  Paula sweetie, stop sniffing hair care products..
