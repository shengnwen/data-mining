This book had some good points and I was eager to read it until its end; however, the characters in the book as well as the unsatisfactory ending caused real problems for me.

I'm pretty picky when it comes to character development, and in this book there was little to none. I found I had very little empathy for any of the characters and felt that they acted in a very unrealistic manner. The main character was a little too unpredictible and aggressive, the ex-wife was inconsistent at best, the receptionist was annyoingly typical, the reporter was carved out of a mold, and everyone else was "out to get" the main character.

There was no solid attempt to tie up loose ends at the end of the book. We don't know what ultimately happens to the doctor and his ex-wife (or wife - do they get remarried? do they have more children?). We don't know what happens to them legally. There is no resolution for the characters, which I suppose shouldn't surprise me as their development was very poor.

The plot itself seemed to be fairly good and this is why I wanted to see what happened in the end. The subject matter (medicine in general, as well as public health) is interesting to me. But I don't recommend this read at all.
