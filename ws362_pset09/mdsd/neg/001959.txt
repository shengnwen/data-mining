 I hate to be a kill-joy, but I'm tired of rave reviews, which fail to take stock of what Heidegger's philosophy meant - when tranlated into his chosen social (German/Aryan supremacist)context. Like the 'Introduction to the Metaphysics,' this book says more about Heidegger's preconceptions - than the actuality of 2,500 Years of Western philosophy. 

 Heidegger regarded 2,500 years of Western philosophy as a compounded error - built on Platonism. But what drove Plato to philosophize? The answer - Thaumazein - the 'wonder of being.' 

 Neo-Platonism was the driving force behind the Renaissance, via Ficino, Mirandella etc., anything but a sign of the 'forgetfulness of Being' attributed to Platonism or Platonists - by Heidegger. And what did Heidegger's Nazi philosophy spawn? Death camps, enslavement, human misery on an unprecedented scale. Heidegger 'enthusiasts' have been in denial too long, over the implicit connection between Heidegger's critique of traditional philosophy and his espousal of Nazi politics. But if you read Farias - 'Heidegger & Nazism,' which documents the German philosopher's involvement with the Nazi movement, it becomes clear that Heidegger supported German National Socialism because it appeared to give room for his philosophy. Even after the war, when the scale of the Nazi holocaust became clear, Heidegger remained mute about his support for the Nazi party and made no 'moral' revaluations in that respect.  All the talk about 'destiny' etc., in Heidegger's writings, was part of that. Don't read this stuff as if it was meant to live in a social vacuum.
