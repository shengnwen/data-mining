I was tempted to be stupid and buy an updated version of one of his books. The older bigger one I had ordered from a Home Shopping network about 6years ago. From the reviews I see it's the same story. The phone numbers are out of service or have new people answering them for different places. You know you always want to believe help is possible. Unfortunately it isn't though from him as he's only helping himself to your money
