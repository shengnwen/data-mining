This book was required for my intermediate macroeconomics course at Cornell University. I found the book to be very confusing, especially on the more technical topics such as the Solow growth model. I give Abel and Bernanke credit for trying to develop a unified, balanced approach to macro... which they do; unfortunately, the exposition is not clear and the book is extremely wordy and not concise. I highly recommend N. Gregory Mankiw's Macroeconomics text instead
