Ok, technically there is a point, but it's really, really not worth it.  Led on by my great enjoyment of the complex and imaginative milieux in _A Million Open Doors_ and _Earth Made of Glass_, I plowed all the way through this repetitively violent book, hoping that the main character would turn sympathetic at some point.  No dice.  The ending shows some intellectual ingenuity, but nowhere near that of _Doors_ or _Glass_, or even _Orbital Resonance_.  A must-miss
