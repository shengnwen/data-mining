I have a Vanagon, I have this book. Sadly, the book doesn't ever help me fix it. This book is an endless source of frustration for me. It's impossible to find what you need, the pictures are clear images, but unhelpful.  If you aren't a shop mechanic skilled with Volkswagens and you are trying to do it yourself, pay a mechanic, expensive as it may be, and save yourself the frustration and cost of this book.  I could use some very bad words to describe this book, but I'll refrain
