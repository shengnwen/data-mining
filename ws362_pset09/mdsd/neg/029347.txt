I can just see hundreds of nerds transfixed behind their computerscreen googling over the one thing coming from another thing. All you need is a piece of paper and a pencil, and you can do the same thing. Dawkins does not use the computer well, neither does he explain his use well. A small change in a program, can give dramatic differences, a large change can give insignificant differences. There is no rule of small steppiness involved here, much as Dawkins likes to twist the regular meaning of words to have it be so. Also Dawkins has failed to simulate intelligence in the program. Much as Darwinists like to deny intelligent design, simulated intelligence is actually required for any lifelike computerprogram. That means a sophisticated use of the computer's randomizer function. In the computerenvironment only the randomizer has the power of decision. The rest of it works in a preordained fashion so to speak, one would get the same results over and over, if not using the randomizer function. Alternatively a sophisticated use of the computerclock would also work, if the clock strikes irregularly. Dawkins has cheated, because he has introduced symetry in the program. All the forms would look awful without symetry, all the forms just reflect the lifelike nature of symetry. If you buy this, you would support turning science into a commercial enterprise, and deny peer-review
