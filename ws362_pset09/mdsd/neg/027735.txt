Let me shoot straight to the point.  The book was astoundingly disturbing.  The funny thing is, I can understand where she would feel the need to have done what she done.  However, to keep obssessing about incest, as she does with her other books, just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I thought I was in for some heart wrenching revelations about the human mind.  She didnt really delve into the emotional aspects about the wanting and lack of relationship she had with her mother above all.  I honestly, got the creeps just reading more into her story and its truly not inspiring in any way.  The saddest part of her book was when she dreamed of her mother.  THAT was sad.  But the other stuff just struck me as shock value.  It was too convoluted.  All I can say is that she is messed up mentally and emotionally from her truly sick family.  I wouldn't touch this with a 3 ft. poll
