I read a lot of books about motherhood before I had my son, while I was trying to figure out whether it would be really worth it. (ie., Is it as great as mothers always say it is, or are they just trying to bring happy motherless women into the baby pit with them?) I am still interested in reading about motherhood even though I have taken the plunge because I am still interested in finding words that describe the experience accurately. (It really IS wonderful but it sort of consumes you too.) Reviews seemed to indicate that this book had a revealing confessional honesty but I didn't find anything new here and it wasn't particulary well written. Anne Lamott's "Operating Instructions - Diary of My Son's First Year" contains many more "Yes! So true." moments and is more funny, and touching and beautifully written. To put it more succinctly, I laughed and bawled several times while reading "Operating Instructions" but this was kind of a bore.
