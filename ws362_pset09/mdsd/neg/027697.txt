While I was reading American Normal, I kept asking myself, why is he writing this book.  Someone finally asks the author the same question, and his answer is, &quot;I don't know.&quot;  I have a theory.  Osborne started out to write a book showing that AS is an imaginary problem coined to put labels on eccentrics.  When halfway through the book his research shows him that it's quite a lot more than that, in fact a real syndrome completely different from just &quot;a little eccentricity&quot;, he is lost.  He no longer knows why he is writing.  He keeps mentioning drugs.  There are no drugs in the treatment of AS itself.  He keeps metioning psychiatrists.  It's a neurological disorder, not a psychiatric disorder.  He meets, casually, a few Aspies, and suddenly he's an expert.  This book mostly made me angry, as it would anyone who knows someone with AS.  He seems often to think the whole this is a joke. After all, he's eccentric, and he doesn't have it... Worst book I've read on autism yet.  Pit
