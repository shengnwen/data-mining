I recently bought this &quot;Literary Classics&quot; edition of &quot;The  Diaries of Adam &amp; Eve&quot; expecting it to be the text of the  wonderful audiobook version of Twain's stories, as read by Betty Buckley  and Mandy Patinkin, only to find that it is not the same at all.  This  version is just a replica of the original books and does not include the  full text as heard on the audiobook.  Then I found the version I wanted,  subtitled &quot;Translated by Mark Twain&quot; and it, like the audiobook  version, is really something special.  To anyone interested in these  wonderful &quot;first family&quot; stories, I recommend searching for the  Fair Oaks Press edition
