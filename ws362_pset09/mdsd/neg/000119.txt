Inside Outside Upside Down was a very cute book. This story really has no moral; it's just a cute book to read. It talks about how the boy bear cub goes into a box and gets turned upside down on a truck and drives into town and comes back the very same way. I wouldn't recommend this book to any child if you are looking for something educational, it's just a fun book to read over and over again. But I would recommend it just for fun
