I actually never finished this one. Came recommended to me by a tug boat captain who started it while waiting for a dredge to fill up his hopper barge. I know how boring it can be steaming to and from the dumping grounds, especially at two knots, but a person would have to be lost on a deserted island to find this book even the slightest bit captivating. It starts out interesting enough, with some high stakes backstory about a captain going out on a financial limb to start his own salvage business, but it quickly degenerates into a cheap Hollywood actioner, complete with plastic characters and a forced romance to boot, which happens as soon as the main character reaches the antarctic to rescue a stricken cruise ship. If you ask me, you're better off with Jan De Hartog, Farley Mowatt, Joseph Conrad, Jack London, and for more contemporary sea fare, David Poyer
