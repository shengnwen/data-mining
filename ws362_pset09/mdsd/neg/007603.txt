As an undergrad in college I was required to read this novel for an English course--go figure.  From what I remember the story is centered around a woman who is caught up in a theocratic regime which takes over the US, and she is forced to abhorrent things like have men in the administration sire children through her.

Looking back now, the situation described in the novel reminds me more of the Stalin regime than any type of theocracy I can think of, even the kind they have in some muslim countries (Yevgeny Zamyatins "We" comes more to mind--Stalin admired that novel).  In fact, the "abhorrent" situation I described above is not much unlike the "Lebensborn" program (a.k.a. "human stud farm") which Heinrich Himmler used to propagate the "Aryan" race during the Third Reich.  And you youngsters who have been brainwashed into believing that Hitler's government was Christian, you ought to read up on the occult roots of Nazism (see e.g. Peter Levenda's book)
