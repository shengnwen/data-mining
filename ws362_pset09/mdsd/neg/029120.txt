I burchased this book as a refresher course before beginning a consulting
assigment for a County to build a performance appraisal system for all their employees. 

This book is a good scholars and scholarly review of the literature of what works in performance appraisal in the Public Sector (the answer is- objective systems such as BAR and MBO).

Unfortunately it does not provide much help on how to actually apply  these objective BAR and MBO systems. Contains just a little bit of material on BARs and almost nothing on MBO forms,concepts, tools and applications.

In summary, the book will not add to the tool box of practitioners. It could have been much improved by the inclusion of a detailed chapter on the nuts and bolts of objective performance appraisal systems which are really the only ones worth doing. Finally it is way over priced at almost $100 per copy. 

PS- I bought the same day read it on line extra feature. That was only partially working on the day I needed it  and severly limited the number of pages I could print out. All and all not worth the money. Told me little I did not already know and gave me nothing I could use in my actual project.
