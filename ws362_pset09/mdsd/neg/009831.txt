I must disagree with the others who gave this book a poor review. I do believe the book is not exploiting fear. It is depcting the truth of a horrible subject and those who downplay this are in some denial. Unfortunalty, how the book conveys this is sub par. It focuses mainly on the offender's mind and the type of horrible crimes offenders commit, but it is often redundant. It briefly departs from its overly dramatized narratives to cover types of offenders, but for the most part I found myself having to hunt for information. Many passages in the book read like a novel with the author trying to play up the drama of the situation which will be almost like culture shock to nayoen used to reading typical psychology books on this subject. It has a lot of filler, I think, and is certainly not a concise information packed book.

The book does drive home one very important thing, though- sex offenders can be anyone- your neighbor, your friend, your pastor and that is the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1
