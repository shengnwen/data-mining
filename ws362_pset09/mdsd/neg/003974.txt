I'm an average person who happens to know that a period goes at the end of a sentence and a question mark goes...well, you get the idea. Unless you speak Mandarin Chinese and have never heard of the phrase &quot;write like you talk,&quot; then this just isn't the book for you. It's drab, lifeless, boring, and a little too familiar. The book itself is nothing more than a cleverly disguised sales pitch that motivates you to do.... nothing actually, because he never comes right out and tells you exactly anything. Very vague, very smooth, very good &quot;happy and exciting&quot; writer. If this is how you want to IMPACT your skills, go for it. Personally, you'd get more tips by reading the ingredients label on a candy bar wrapper. No thanks
