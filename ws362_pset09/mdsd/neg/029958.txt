Though this book pretends to show all sides fairly, it's extremely biased against evolution (and poorly researched on that side too).  A quick look at the positive reviews here will show you that they are from people who are on the ID/Creation side.  It's a waste of time and paper, unless you just want to make yourself feel good about believing in ID/Creation
