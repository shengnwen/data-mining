After just reading this book I was dissapointed. There is no character development at all. I wanted to know more about Lori. The book is not well written & the book feels "thrown together" at the last moment to get a book out about the case. Alot of the book is about the Mormon Faith & mentions it quite a bit which can be hard to follow & understand if you don't know anything about the religion already. You don't learn anything extra about the people involved that you don't know about already from watching or listening to the media. I learned nothing that I didn't already know about the case. Nevertheless, it's a tragic story
