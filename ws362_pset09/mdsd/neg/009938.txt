I couldn't stand this book.  It is filled with meaningless cussing and there is no real plot other than these people trying to grow up.  They don't seem like they ever will because they are so self centered and morally vapid.  This is like hanging around with the worst kids in school and looking forward to spending the rest of your life in prison.  

I can't believe I'm the only person who hated this book.  That is why I'm reveiwing it.  With so much fine literature out there on the same topic I don't know why anyone would waste their time with this.  Why not read Joyce Carol Oates on adolescence where the girls who hang around with the bad crowd get hurt?

Gretchen is a thoroughly disgusting character.  She is basically a felon who continually gets away with agravated assault, which impresses her suitor who still rejects her for being fat.  How dumb and sleazy can you get?  I thought punks had more of a philosophy but I can't find a shred of even logic in this book.
