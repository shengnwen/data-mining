This is an updated publication of a c. 1980 text. It is very informative on the properties of fuel alcohol and the different raw material possibilities. It also explains in some detail how to make ethanol on the farm-scale from improvised DIY equipment.
It would benefit from a more up-to-date context and a slightly more commercial orientation, in my opinion
