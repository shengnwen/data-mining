the fact that Woodward was a briefer to Alexander Haig when Woodward was serving in the Navy. Tons of documents have come out disproving the allegations of Bernstein and Woodward in All the President's Men and Final Days. The authors downplay the relationship between Haig and Woodward dramatically, hiding the fact that Haig was Deep Throat. Look at this logically: why would a high up guy in the executive branch named "Deep Throat" come out of nowhere to reveal what he knew about Watergate? Deep Throat MUST have had a previous relationship with Woodward, and the only man with a connection to Woodward who knew so much about Watergate was Alexander Haig. Why isn't this mentioned in ANY of the Woodward/Bernstein books
