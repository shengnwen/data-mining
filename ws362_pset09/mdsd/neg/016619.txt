This book has fabulous marble illustrations, but absolutely no cross-referencing so a user can look up the description of the marble pictured. The author pre-supposes you are an expert and know what marble  maker and type you are looking for. Illustrations are grouped together in  one section of the book and each is identified only by the auction number  and lot number it came from.

Even then, the auction numbers within the  types are random.  The book is only useful if you know what kind of marble  you have and want to see what some similar marbles by the same manufacturer  sold for.
