Having a novel's narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre.  When this plot device is done well, the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist, not left wondering what the hell happened.  When the twist works best, the author hasn't actually lied to the reader, but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions.  When the twist comes, the reader experiences a `light bulb moment', realizing they were duped, but that they should have seen it coming.  

In Beach Road the ending doesn't make much sense, and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed. 

Beach Road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying.  My question to Mr. Patterson is:  If one of the characters lies to the reader for the first ï¿½ of the novel, why do they start telling the truth near the end?  Why not lie all the way through(or tell the truth right from the beginning)?  I think it would have been much more interesting if the character's lies were exposed, not by their own confession, but through the observations of other characters.

Of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel.   My other major gripe is that so much of it doesn't make sense.  For example, the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as Loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows.  Somehow Loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing.  This is ridiculous.  Drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find.  How else do people buy drugs from them?  It's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing, even with silly nicknames.  

Second case in point: the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains, yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen. They don't notice the absence of blood, and don't check to make sure the shot was fatal.  It doesn't make sense.

Patterson churns out novels faster than Nora Roberts these days and apparently isn't worried about quality.  Beach Road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a Patterson novel to avoid.
