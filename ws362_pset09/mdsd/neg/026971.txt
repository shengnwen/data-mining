I found this book quite tedious, since the author makes the fundamental mistake of thinking the subject of the book should be herself instead of her work.  There is almost no information on forensic anthropology; her descriptions of cases are very short and center mainly on how she felt about them, rather than what the actual details were.  From the cover and the blurbs I expected actual case histories; the book doesn't deliver.  The book as written would really only be interesting to people who know the author personally
