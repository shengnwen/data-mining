The useful points in this book are mostly common sense. But mostly this book tries to educate how those toiling in the working/middle classes can appear as though they belong in the champagne set. This is what the author continually refers to "flying with the eagles". Throughout the book the author makes comments to the effect that "eagles don't do this, eagles don't do that", "if you want to fly with the eagles you have to behave this way" etc. I found the author's tone at times condescening, at times mildly offensive.

It's not ALL bad, the book does make some interesting points and observations (hence the 2 stars) but IMHO it falls a long way short of its promise
