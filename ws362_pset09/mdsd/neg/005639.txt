I purchased this book excitedly, because of the paucity of reading material directed at someone like me- a 43 year old, first time mother via infertility treatments, with a long and successful professional career.  Then I started reading, and my excitement deflated.  
I don't think she was really committed to anything other than publishing a compilation of forced hilarity sit-com entries.  
I thought her style was trying to emulate Ann Lamott....but with the cynical, savvy-New York City angle (Sex-In-the-City with babies and their poo), and without the heart or introspection that make Lamotts "Operating Instructions" so precious.  
How does this book represent good writing?   She has not communicated so much to us... her motivation to get pregnant without the support of her husband, the complicated reasons why she has a very unconventional life, why she accepts incompetence from her contractor, why she is cowed by a Nanny.  I suspect it could be more interesting if we, again, got a peak at some real heart here.  Instead we get to read about how much money she can spend (except...well..not on a CRIB or DIAPERS...her friends/family have to come up with that for her after the babies are born), Manalo Blahnick shoes and exquisite catering...its often a very superficial and disappointing read that I basically slogged through.
I have no doubt Ms. Newman is a wonderful mother and partner who deeply loves her children and husband...and I would have liked to read about that side of her, and that can be done with humor interfaced with self exploration.   If she had gone just a few shades deeper she could have made a very engaging book for many of us, especially if she was less enamored with her fabulous lifestyle and more committed to an internal journey.  
But hey, this is 2005.  We don't ask for depth and character anymore. We're satisfied with a yuk.
