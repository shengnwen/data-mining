Part of the value of books on photoshop, particularly ones about digital photography, is in showing you how to take reasonable shots and make them better. In these examples the photos start bad and sometimes get worse. The problem is visible even on the cover. The photoshopped flag looks awful.

Definitely not the book for digital photographers looking to get the most out of photoshop. I recommend O'Reilly's Digital Photography: Expert Techniques instead
