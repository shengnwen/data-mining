Cardozo cannot string a sentence together that is simple and clear. He may have been a judicial giant, but how would you know from his writing? Richard Feynman, the physicist, said it best when he observed that anyone who cannot communicate what they know, clearly and simply, does not know their subject very well. The whole thing is a chore to decipher into common language. It makes you wonder if Cardozo wasnt one more Hoover screw-up
