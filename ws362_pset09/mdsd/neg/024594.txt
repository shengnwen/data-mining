This is the only book in this series I've read (thank heaven!), but I could not believe the author was serious with all her trite adjectives and cliches. Suits are "neatly tailored." People "peer intently" and "collapse in a heap." She is particularly found of well-worn similes: "Her heart thudded like a drum in her chest." "He gripped his pencil like a vice." "...thought that buzzed through her head like a fly caught between a window screen and the glass." And the most irritating of all, this book could have been subtitled "Antiques Author in Heat." I've never read a mystery that sounded so much like a bad romance novel. "He exuded a powerful aura of sexual intensity and electricity that seemed to surge through his hand." That was her second conquest -- the first "longed to kiss her full, pouty lips." Not bad for a writer "with thick legs." I laughed, but the sad part is I was predisposed to like a good mystery about antiques, but whatever plusses the plot had got buried in the horrible writing.
