I was rather disappointed with this book. I bought the other two (Vampires, summ. spirits) and was very thrilled. This book, however, did not live up to my expectations. This is not a book of rituals or some sort of necromancy. It's rather technological. ( that is the first part ) I wouldn't buy it if you are the romantic kind of magician. I would however recommened his other books. ( Nocturnal Witchcraft hasn't yet arrived at my home (Belgium) so I can't yet pass judgement on that.) If however, you are interested in the paranormal in wider context, I would suggest you buy it
