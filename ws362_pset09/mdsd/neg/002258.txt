Don't waste your money! The author allegorizes the text to say that Genesis (at least the so called "prehistory") is no more than ancient mythology. Its amazing to me a Christian scholar can claim that the bible is anything other than the LITERAL word of God. If you take the scripture seriously, don't waste your time or money
