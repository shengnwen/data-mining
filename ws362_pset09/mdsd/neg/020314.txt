This book makes the most grievous error a book can make: it's boring.  The title sounded intriguing, but the book is a real snooze.  I skipped page after page looking for something of interest to read.  Alas, I found nothing.  Talk about disappointment.  I was hoping for a scathing analysis of the degradation of language in contemporary discourse and music.  What I got was...well, I'm not sure but it put me to sleep within 5 minutes.  I don't want to read in-depth analyses of speeches from 1856 or whatever.  Maybe there's another book out there that discusses the devaluation of language in pop culture in a compelling way.  This one ain't...I mean, isn't, it
