I picked up this book when it was first published. Since there are so few books on the subject, any new book is a welcome addition.  That is, until you actually read it. I've had college textbooks that were more fun to read.

Apparently, this title sells very well.  Perhaps it's the curtain on the cover or the whimsical thought bubbles that lead people to believe the secrets of directing are within this book.

If you want a book on directing that is uninspiring, lifeless, and an all-around chore to read, this is your book.

If you're still looking for the straight-forward approach to directing you thought would be within this book, "A Sense of Direction" by William Ball will ultimately be more helpful
