This was my first Patterson book and I'd say, unfortunately, it was fair at best. I guess I will try another one of his books as many say what a great writer he is, but "See How They Run" is not impressive at all.

First, the story line is completely unbelieveable. Jews avenging the holocoust by using Nazi techniques and an American gynacologist as the super action hero just doesn't work. Add on top of that a hectic and confusing end, paper thin characters, an unbelieveable romantic relationship between hero and heroin, storyline tangents that don't fit into the overall plot, and what you end up with is basically a mess.

Maybe 2 stars is kind, but I'll hope his other books are significantly better
