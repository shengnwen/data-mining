I'm a Pagan who, to put it very mildly, does not have a high opinion of the Old Testament.  But Thompson has managed to write something even worse.

It is one thing to point out that Biblical stories of the Exodus and the conquest of Israel by Joshua are contradicted by archaeological evidence (they are).  It is quite another to throw out genuine archaeological evidence as well as any connections to Biblical stories from the Book of Judges onwards, as though neither people nor history existed back then!  

If folks want to say that there were ancient Israelites back in the 13th century BC, and have some evidence for it (including, say, Merneptah's Stele, which appears to refer to them explicitly), then right or wrong, that's scholarship.  If others want to say that the actual Israelites did not appear until the 12th or 11th century BC, and present some evidence for that (including explaining the Stele, of course), well, that's scholarship as well.  I'd refer interested readers to works such as "The First Historians" by Baruch Halpern (1988), "The Archaeology of the Land of Israel" by Yohanan Aharoni (1978) and "Who Were the Israelites and Where Did They Come From?" by William Dever (2003).

Thompson, however, is an anti-scholar.  He knows that people existed from the 13th through the 3rd centuries BC.  He knows there's enormous amounts of corroborating evidence about what those people were like.  And he's out to denounce anyone who says anything about them, no matter what they say!  It's simply ridiculous.  

The claim that there were no such people as the ancient Israelites is not scholarly unless it is backed up by some rather striking evidence.  Thompson has nothing of the sort.  

This guy is worse than the Bible-is-truth fundamentalists.  At least, those who believe the accounts in the Old Testament will get some of the later history right, once in a while.  Thompson, by denying that there is any truth anywhere, won't get anything right
