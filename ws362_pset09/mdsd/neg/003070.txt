To put it simply, Freedom Evolves is a philosophical failure, with as many holes as a Hollywood movie. I give the book one star for effort, for the attempt to get philosophy to the masses, and for pure entertainment purposes. But I subtract four stars because the premise is yet another arrogant attempt by a philosopher to gain a piece of the philosophical pie, one that I feel was eaten a long time ago, with mere crumbs remaining for contemporary thinkers. Dennett does not by any stretch get a crumb for this one.

Despite the myriad long-winded and frightened attempts to get around the harsh yet incredibly simple reality and logic of determinism, I have yet to see any valid arguments by any philosopher to even begin to disprove it. I'll go so far as to agree that we perceive an illusion of free will due to the individuality in character of each human being, based upon one's initial genetic programming and thereafter one's environmental programming, but that's as far as it can possibly go. We're still bound by cause and effect, just like every single other thing in the universe, "alive" or not. To think or state otherwise is merely another case of human self-flattery and arrogance, and therefore outright ignorance (or, in Dennett's case, opportunism to boot). The potential proof of parallel universes in physics will still have no bearing on the issue. And evolution, as Dennett attempts it, works more against his arguments than for them.

Recommended if you enjoy pop philosophy for clever entertainment only. Otherwise, with all the logical holes in it, you could use the book to strain your spaghetti
