Narrated by the adolescent Will Tweedy, this story recounts the scandal of a family in small-town Georgia around 1905 when grandma dies and - a mere three weeks later - grandpa marries a much younger woman. The story follows the family drama, Will's growing up, and lots of cute or funny anecdotes along the way.

For the most part, I didn't enjoy or like this book. Too many major characters are image-obsessed (what will the town think of this? and of that?) and judgmental. While this may be "how things really were," that still doesn't make it fun to read. Some of the characters are endearing, but the others really wore me down. The book also feels like it's too slow. I listened to the unabridged audiobook (narrated by Tom Parker), and while Parker gives excellent voices to the characters, audiobooks inherently slow down the reading. So if the book is already relaxed, the audiobook puts it on sedatives. And at the end of the book, one key event (not the _final_ key event) seems emotionally manipulative: a tragic event happening to a minor character pulls heartstrings while simultaneously feeling like it doesn't quite fit.

In the book's defense, I will grant that one story in the book (involving a Christmas play) made me laugh out loud, and several sections built temporary interest. It started to win me over in the last few pages, but it was too late.

In his strange book Timequake, Kurt Vonnegut jokes that in short stories, characters have to do at least two of the following three things in order to satisfy a general public: someone changes, someone learns from their mistakes, or someone apologizes. This being a full-blown novel, Burns includes all three. But I still wasn't satisfied
