I think there is probably a chance that this is the most poorly written textbook I've ever encountered.

I was going to hold off giving it a bad review until I got through the class, but at this rate I'm not even totally sure I will. I've just re-read the difference between nominal and effective interest for (no hyperbole) the 10th time, and I'm no closer to understanding it. Bad examples, useless derivations, poor explaining. I only wish I could give it a zero
