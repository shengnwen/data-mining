If you are so disconnected from the world that this book is helpful to you then you are probably too far gone already.

Did you know that there are things out there called Art Fairs? No? Then there's a whole chapter telling you that there is! Of course all the chapter does is tell you to buy the leading art fair magazine. No joke!

Does hearing that you should find a way to make potential buyers feel like their lives will be enriched by your art fill you with ideas? If so then you've got a whole chapter beating that very notion to death. You think I'm kidding?

If those things seem novel to you, here's another: It's called the internet and you can find out everything in this book and more, including actual working links and contact information, for a lot less money.

Sorry, this book is not very good. There is just absolutely nothing new in it and it's told in such a demeaning/upbeat style that will have all but the most bright-eyed and bushy-tailed gnashing their teeth. If it isn't a gallery then this book considers it "new" and wastes no amounts of usefulness giving it a gloss-over
