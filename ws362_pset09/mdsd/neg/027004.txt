I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically. 

Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.

There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden
