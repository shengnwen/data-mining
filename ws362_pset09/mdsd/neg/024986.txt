For some reason, a plethora of ex and aging porn stars are coming out of the woodwork to write books about the anonymous sex they've had with thousands of complete strangers. This book is one of those, dotted with "I play piano" and "I (use to)help disabled kids", but the author--instead of pursuing a meaningful path to life, and maybe touching the lives of thousands of disabled children, chose the dirt road instead of, well, sex with thousands of strangers. Forget for a moment about diseases (can we imagine?) We all make choices. "The 'I used to do this' seems to be an almost begging for a fake pat on the back. "See, he's not just a raunchy porn star--he has feelings, too!" You know, the softer side. 

But in reality, actions speak louder than words. Words:  I play piano and help disabled kids. Actions:  I'll skip constructive embellishments and have sex with thousands of strangers. Screw the handicapped children, I care so much about them I'm leaving them in the dust. But hey, I used to.

Yes, the book made me chuckle, and you will laugh, too. But realistically,  this is little more than verbiage from someone who has done very little with his life. We all have sex. There's nothing new about it. Some prefer monogamy. Some don't. But somewhere in the middle is the instintive notion that we as a species relish our family, our friends, our lovers, and our life. And then there are the psychopaths who lack ample human emotion and attachment abilities to form even the basics of human relationships, and dot their existence with self promoting pat-on-on-the-backs like "I help disabled kids" and "I play piano." --i.e., like Ron Jeremy.

The porn pension must be running out
