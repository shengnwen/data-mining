........that "tag" is actually a bit harsh on my part........this really isn't a "bad" book (i.e. one that's full of errors).....it's simply a book filled with cute little truisms that basically anyone who reads the Wall Street Journal 4 times a year already knows.

Maxwell is really a "Christian" writer who writes these little overblown pamphlets.  Technically, not religious or prosyletizing in nature, these little books smack of old-boyisms that are tired and have been re-hashed ad infinitum.  If you're a young, junior level mid-manager, get it, read it.  It's not a terrible book........just don't expect to be "the Person Others Will Want to Follow" by ingesting this little bathroom reader
