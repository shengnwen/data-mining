If you just got out of prison or maybe had a spell of amnesia or if your just hitting your 20th or 21st birthday then you may learn some stuff here. 

But if you got yourself online to read this review then I doubt you will find this book much help. There were a few helpful ehows for me in the book though. For example I forgot exactly how to boil an egg. And there it was in the book. A typical type of ehow. 

And this book is BIG and HEAVY. with most info ridiculously simple I would say the size to useful ratio is not that desirable.

Maybe this would make an ok high school graduation gift but other than that most people should avoid this book. The ehow website is great though and its FREE!.
