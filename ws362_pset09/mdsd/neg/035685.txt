This is a highly influential book.  Roosevelt has had many enemies growing out of his presidency.  No one has had the same negative impact on Roosevelt's name to equal Wyman's attack.  But, although Wyman, a  professional historian has well-documented his research, much of the  indictment of the Roosevelt Administration is based upon conjecture  incapable of proof.  The litmus test of his proposals was the bombing of  Auschwitz.  He asserts that the failure to bomb was due to a lack of  caring.  Thousands of Jews could have been saved.  But there is no way to  prove this.  Many Jews could also have died because bombing was inaccurate  and Jewish prisoners lived close to the crematoria.  Too much in his  charges is based on too little evidence.  Peter Novick in his book, The  Holocaust in American Life, calls Wyman's thesis a &quot;comfortable  morality tale&quot; and &quot;bad history.&quot;  In addition to Novick,  Henry L. Feingold, Frank W. Brecher, and William Rubinstein have written  critically about Wyman
