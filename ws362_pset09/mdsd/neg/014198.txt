I understand this is fiction but I have never read such an absurd crime novel.  It is a bit hard to believe that practically all the higher ups in the department for the previous generations are corrupt.  And to even involve her father in the scheme.  PLEASE!  I was waiting for her toddler to somehow be involved as well.  This was my second, and last, Parker read.  What a disappointment
