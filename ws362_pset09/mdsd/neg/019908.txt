After reading several books about the Founding Fathers and other Presidents, I was excited to read about Teddy.  Now in most books they discuss personalities, events, and impacts of decisions.  This book read like a cheesy novel with unncessary flowery language.  There are lines that were shown as dialogue, when the information was probably gleened from several correspondence.  He writes about facial expressions during conversations.  Morris even wrote about what they thought during events.  Most writers would state, "He would recall later..."

If I had wanted to read a novel, I would have.  I was disappointed not with the subject, just the way it was written.
