I just bought this book "the soft cover edition" after reading all these wonderful comments on the book. I thought, wow 9.95 and stats will be mine! I suppose I did not do enough research, because when the "soft cover" edition arrived it was not the same book that showed up in "Look Inside"... In fact, it's the outline study-guide for the text. I was really upset and feel that I have been misled. I am now returning the "soft cover" edition at my own expense because amazon "is not at fault". Please be aware that the reviews that are associated with this book are for the TEXT which costs alot more. I would have been happy to buy the text but I feel that I was misinformed and I am very upset. Don't make the same mistake I did. Make sure you buy the HARD COVER, unless you really want a useless "companion to the text" soft cover
