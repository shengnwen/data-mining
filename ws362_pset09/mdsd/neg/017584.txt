While the first publishing of Irrational Exuberance in early 2000 was indeed timely and prescient, that was a long time ago in the financial markets. Shiller now trots out the same arguments in 2005 about the housing market, adding some notes to the preface and a new 2nd introductory chapter about home prices. This is disappointing because all it says is there is a lack of consistent long term price data on houses, so we end up with detailed data about U.S. cities. Location matters in real estate, not so much for stock prices, but that doesn't seem to make much difference to Shiller. Yes, home prices have been relatively less "exuberant" in Cleveland, but how vibrant is Cleveland in the global economy? There are other commentaries I've seen which go in much greater depth about the housing market. I'll buy the argument that prices have increased, but I won't accept Shiller's innuendo that home prices are the same type of market as stock prices. There's not much meat here for real estate analysis, so if you get this book, it's just another historical analysis of things like the tulip mania and other bubbles. I should write a book like that, since there is so much material available to package, and I've seen several books that flog the "insights" for all they are worth.

This includes Holland, as any good book on bubbles must, through a paragraph about homes on the Herengracht canal in Amsterdam. The validity of this metric is that the buildings haven't changed much on the outside in almost 400 years. The real (inflation adjusted) price gain works out to 0.2% per year. Cool, in the long run real estate prices just beat inflation. Does that translate into a prediction of imminent collapse in global housing prices? I'm not sure you can connect those dots. In the long run, prices will equalize somehow. Shiller doesn't add anything to the discussion of how that equilibrium will be achieved
