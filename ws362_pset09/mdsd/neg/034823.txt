This book reminded me of some of the better novellas written by my high school creative writing students over my 27 years of teaching.  Characterization remains shallow, and description is often extraneous.  The present tense narration doesn't work well for the story, as the action is described in a detached fashion, for the most part.  Considering what she experiences, Kat is one cool female--too cool for me to believe in.  
   Awkward sentences and occasional grammar lapses were disengaging, as well.
   I'm afraid I can't fathom any comparison to Crichton and other well-known writers here--other than the plot.  It's a good plot.  Politics, medicine, war, romance, murders, your typical best-seller plot elements are all here.  The book is in need of major editing and revision, though, if it is to catapult the author to the level of other bestselling thriller writers.
