Do not waste money on this book. I bought this book and returned it after  reading the recipes. They are inaccurate and the author does not change the  bittering on his different versions of each recipe(the bittering should be  lowered on an all grain batch). In one of the barleywine recipes he has you  mashing 18lbs. of grain in 2.5lbs. of water-impossible.The list of errors  go on and on. The publisher dropped the ball when they did not get the  Szamatulski's(originator of Clone Brews) to write this book. I can not wait  for the next Szamtulski book to come out-the real sequel!
