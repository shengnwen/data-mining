"This is the novel that Jane Austen might indeed have written had she lived in twenty-first-century California," the dustjacket for the hardcover version of this book boldly claims, and any dedicated Austen fan will undoubtedly take issue with this statement. Austen was, first and foremost, a writer who possessed a superior talent for narrative and characterization. Neither of those talents are on display in Karen Joy Fowler's "The Jane Austen Book Club," a novel that uses thinly veiled retreads of Austen plotlines as its basis and characters that have vague echoes of Austen's own characters. And yet TJABC does nothing fresh or innovative with these rehashes, at least nothing as modern or clever as it seems to think it's doing. Here's the big fault: TJABC has a creaky plotline as a novel and Fowler's characters lack depth even without the comparisons to Austen (which only serve to make this novel's faults more pronounced). Perhaps the most offensive aspect of the "homage" is that Austen's novels were always of great social relevance. Sure, there is lots of romance and comedy, but what made her novels classic was the undercurrent of social criticism that was woven into them. Fowler has written a trifling romantic comedy and attempted to pass it off as deep, and a few tired jokes about how nerdy science fiction fans are (really, Ms. Fowler, could you have picked a more tired cliche, or an easier mark than that? I doubt it) do nothing to make TJABC any sharper or more pointed
