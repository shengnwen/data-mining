So what happens with these people die lol? All this money and "help" will have died in vain as will the three in jail trying to prove their innocence. You know, the amount of tax money funding these organization to help these people is probably a waste also. . . I mean come on. . . It isn't like they if freed from jail are going to go out and do great things (Cure cancer, stop war ((which would be a bad thing)) or any of that stuff.) Seems like a BIG waste of time and money to free these poor poor 3 people from jail
