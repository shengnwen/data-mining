I purchased this book about a year ago while I was 5 months pregnant with my twin boys.  Immediately I discovered that many of the views were a bit outdated.  It is very evident that it was written before twins and multiples were as common as they are now.  Many of the concerns (doctor's offices, shopping, travel) discussed are simply not an issue any more. Most pediatrician offices are very well equipped and able to handle twin visits.  Nearly all grocery stores have those awesome shopping carts with infant seats already attached (a push/pull of two carts isn't that hard).  And as far as getting around, there are literally dozens of twin and triplet strollers available now.  

I found the book to consistently present the worst of every situation. From clothes, to bathing and feeding nearly all the parents seem overwhelmed and frustrated.  It really isn't like that! My boys are 7 months old now and I can honestly say... raising them has been nothing like it seemed in this book. 

I say, find a more a recently written book and one that is based here in the US if you live here.  The cultural differences and new commoness of multiples really make for a big difference.  

Enjoy your babies, and relax! My twin theory is this:
 Whatever you just did... You just do it again.
