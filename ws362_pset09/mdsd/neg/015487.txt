In short by the time I got to the end of the book I didn't feel I had been taken anywhere.  The story switches back and forth between the characters several times through each chapter, keeping you up to date on what they are doing, but by the time you get to the end of the book nothing has actually happened.  The reader is no closer to the next step of the story than before beginning the book.  It was a very frustrating and unfulfilling book.
