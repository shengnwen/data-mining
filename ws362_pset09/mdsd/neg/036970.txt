I bought this book based on other user's reviews and I wish I had saved my money.  We used the book looking for baby names but constantly ran into the same names over and over again.  The repetition was annoying.  The name Riley is listed 32 times and the name Beatrice is listed 26 times.  Only the truly bizarre names are listed once.  The book claims to have thousands of enchanting names but that's a stretch.  Another disappointing fact about this book is it does not give you the meanings of the names so you have to refer to other books or the Internet for that information.  I would not recommend this book
