This book about put me to sleep. Bad anecdotes that don't really have a point, and opinions (that they think are facts?) that will depress some and annoy others.
Not every woman is a certain way, and not every man has the so-called "secrets" that are in this book.
I also dislike the way this book tries to talk about the man-woman relationship like it's a science, and that men are a delicate specimen that any woman should aim to understand. (ha!)

I am now going to save you the trouble of buying the book by telling you what's basically in it-- what your guy friends (or even girl friends) should already know:
1) Many guys are jerks
2) Many guys just want sex (yawn)
3) Many guys like the thrill of the chase

For the naive ones out there that didn't already know this, perhaps this book is for you. Otherwise, steer clear-- there are better ones out there! :
