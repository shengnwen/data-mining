I bought this book for $3.00 at a clearance. (Should have known then). The author includes innumerable cases of &quot;encounters&quot;, &quot;abductions&quot;, &quot;implants&quot; and &quot;sightings&quot; but at the same time , makes disclaimers about all of them leaving you feel that he is not sincere about what he is writing and wondering why he bothered with the book. I've read that his other books are much better. This must have been one of the &quot;lost time &quot; episodes he describes during an abduction. This is strictly for the Mulders out there who have &quot;I want to believe&quot; posters on there office wall. These are all the typical alien suspicions you have already read  and left you laughing
