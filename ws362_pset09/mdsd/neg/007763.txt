I have read and studied this and the original version of The Gospel According to Jesus.

One must always be careful not to bounce off one unbiblical teaching into another.  This has sadly been the case of some people who have, with good cause, been frustrated by those who make professions of faith in Christ, but do not live for Christ.  Christians should be distressed over those who call themselves Christians, but show little interest in living for the Lord.  This frustration, however, does not warrant changing the terms of the gospel, which is what Dr. MacArthur does in this book.

MacArthur desires to see professing believers live godly Christian lives, but he can't make the problem of carnal Christians go away by demanding from an unsaved man an upfront commitment to live in obedience to the Lord's commands in "exchange" for eternal life.

For example Dr. MacArthur writes on p. 148, "That is the kind of response the Lord Jesus called for: wholehearted commitment.  A desire for him at any cost.  Unconditional surrender.  A full exchange of self for the Savior.  It is the only response that will open the gates of the kingdom."

Dr. MacArthur conditions the reception of salvation on a commitment of man to do or become something.  He has, therefore, created a man-centered gospel, and this then is a works based, false gospel.

Pardon the shameless plug: I have written a comprehensive response to the Lordship interpretation of the gospel.  The book title is: In Defense of the Gospel: Biblical Answers to Lordship Salvation.

Dr. MacArthur is a sincere preacher; he means well and wants to be true to the Bible.  He has, however, erred grievously in his Lordship Salvation interpretation of the gospel.
