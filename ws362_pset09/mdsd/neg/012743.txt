What a slog it is trying to get through this book. I'm nearly there (I've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this)... the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends, and the mostly rave reviews it's got here. Ignatius Reilly, the main character is interesting enough (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring, I find myself flicking on the pages to see how far I have to go before the story gets back to Ignatius again. I keep thinking "OK, the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon"...there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the Pulitzer Prize. I'm at a loss to explain its popularity
