I don't recommend buying this book if you, like I, are a fan of Jez's other Duck Books: Duck in a Truck, Fix It Duck, and Captain Duck.  The whole book is about 7 pages long and each page is the duck making a single comment about his lost key (one liners) and has a flap which hides the frog, who also says a one liner.  Maybe a two year old who has never been read the afore mentioned books will enjoy lifting the flaps but this book has none of the humor, does not have the Sheep or Goat, does not have the catchy rhythm, and has none of the originality of Jez`s prior works.  Fortunately Amazon has an excellent return policy and this book is going right back.  Also, there is no glossy cover for the book.  This just isn't up to the other Duck books.  I was quite disappointed.
