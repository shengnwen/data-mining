This book not portrays every white person in America as a racist, but does so in a racist manner itself. The book cites almost no facts to prove its assertions that whites are inwardly racist because of their being white, and that radical measures such as affirmative action across the board (in jobs, schooling, housing, etc.) needs to become common practice to "overcome the disadvantages of being Black." The book claims to want to help all poor members of society, but mentions poor whites only in passing. The book does not effectively prove any of its claims, instead using obviously exaggerated and unlikely examples to make a point. This book only incited anger in me, not sympathy for the "poor Black man.
