     I believe that I was possibly unlucky to choose this book as my introduction to Mr. Yehoshua's work, for I am told that he is a fabulous writer and a fine creator of believable dialogues.  Well, there are no dialogues, and the story drags.  The book however had many characteristics that should make me love it!  My training is that of a historian, I fancy -- in my spare time -- reading on the Middle Ages, I've been fascinated with travel writing, I've lived in North Africa and to top it off, I've done some reading on Judaism in the Iberian Penninsula. And yet this book proved to be a collection of frustrations and it appeared never to end.

    Mr. Yehoshua chose to base his narrative in the oral tradition typical not only to the Middle Ages but also present in Jewish and North African traditions.  So the development of his story is as repetitive as those told from generation to generation, to remind each of the listeners the main characteristcs of what's being mentioned.  He does it however without the charm that a colloquial narrator would infuse.  This distant omnipresent narrator who tells us the  story instead took away any sense of drama, of importance, of eagerness, and of deeply felt conflicts.  The narrative line seemed adrift, like a boat going from port to port without a chart. 

      There was also not a single character that involved this reader emotionally.  It felt like an intellectual exercise that ended up being too boring to stand.  It was a struggle for me to finish the book and frankly, life is too short for the daily sacrifice I was inflicting on myself.
