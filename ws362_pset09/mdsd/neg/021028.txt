Because of its glowing reviews and my strong interest in learning more about Edinburgh and Scotland, I had high expectations for this book. I was very disappointed. It assumes that the reader has a strong knowledge of Scottish history, so the neophyte will not learn much. Yet, the book is written at such a superficial level that a knowledgeable person will learn nothing new. As another Amazon reviewer points out, the book is essentially themeless and has no point of view. I know that the book received many positive reviews, but it is difficult to know what audience will get much out of it. I havn't been this disappointed in a book for a long time
