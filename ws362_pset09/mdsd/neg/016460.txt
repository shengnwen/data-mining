The dog part was kinda interesting but the eclipse flashback(s) was disgusting and the rest of the book was really boring. It also could have easily ended about 50 or 60 pages before it did. But at least its short for a King book (445 pages) and I was able to force myself through it in a few days. Out of the 17 or so King books I've read this was definitely the worst, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you want to read every Stephen King book there is. - - 3/1
