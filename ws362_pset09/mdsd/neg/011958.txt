If you've been doing any game programming at all, you already know 95% to 99% of what's covered in this book. I give it 2 stars rather than 1 simply because it is fairly well written, not hiding details behind pages of complex lambda calculus. But it does not get any further than skinned keyframe animation- which is freely described on many web sites such as nehe or flipcode. I hoped for at least some discussion beyond that basic level. It does have some value for individuals that have ignored DirectX or OpenGL to focus on the other rendering API- since it supports both rendering APIs one can learn the similar components between the two rendering solutions. But the OpenGL user interface looks pretty poor, so I question the care that the OpenGL logic has been given. All the code is in C, when one would expect C++ these days. Overall, this is a very basic text, once again devoting chapters to basic math issues like how to use points, vectors, matrices and quaternions. If you're a early high school kid itching to get an overview of programming character animation, and you've not already scoured the net reading and trying out the umpteen game programming tutorials out there, this is probably a pretty good book. Like I said earlier, it reads fairly clearly
