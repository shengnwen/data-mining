After reading "Men Who Can't Love" (which, by the way, is brilliant!), I was excited to pick up another piece by these authors.  Unfortunately I was more than disappointed.  I should have seen a red flag when I saw the title, so I have no one to blame but myself.  Any woman who decides to "like herself" just so that a man can like her is sadly mistaken (you like yourself for yourself, not anybody else!).  Generalizations such as "a balding man is a better catch than a hottie" are... simply put, ignorant.  Theory that a lengthy first phone conversation indicates problems in the relationship going forward is ridiculous.  Half way through the book, I came to conclusion that it was written for teenagers - a couple of valid points surrounded by a whole lot of common sense rambling.  Women who want to improve their self-esteem should look elsewhere.  And finally, who in the world thinks about babies on the first date??
