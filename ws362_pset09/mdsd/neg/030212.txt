I gave up on this book about 50 pages from the end.  It seemed like the more I read, the more tedious it became until it felt like masochism to continue.   I think a previous reviewer made a definite understatement by saying that this book needs an editor.  Quite honestly, I have rarely encountered a book so disorganized as this one.  It seems like the author has a hard time telling apart the essential from the superfluous, and so he indulges in endless anectdotes that contain little more than truisms, presents complex concepts with long, drawn-out prose when they could have been more efficiently communicated with tables and graphs, and repeats the same ideas again and again using slightly different wording.  I wonder if this book was meant as advertising for the author's services, because otherwise it would have been about a fifth as long and would have suggested procedures and excercises allowing the reader to learn and apply dialogue from his own experience, not the author's.  I hope there will be other, more successful attempts to apply David Bohm's and Peter Senge's theories to the field of organizational dialogue
