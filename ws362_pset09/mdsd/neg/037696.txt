This is a good book for those scientists who are really, truly hiding under a rock, but will not be helpful for most others.  The book can be summed up in a few sentences: Be nice to everyone you meet. Do good work. Don't allow yourself to get walked on.  Now you can move on to a book with some practical advice like &quot;Tomorrow's Professor.&quot
