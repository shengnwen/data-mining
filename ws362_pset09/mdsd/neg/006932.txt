I read the amazon reader reviews before I bought the book. Yet I must admit that I am a bit disappointed with the purchase. The principles in the book about dream making is nothing new at all. The book tries to relate a  concept of 'ease' with a life working towards your dream. But it is not  very convincing to me. And the 5-step process on finding your dream is a  typical method that can be found in many other self-help books
