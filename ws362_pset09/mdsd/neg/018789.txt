Maybe I made a mistake starting with a book that's 3rd in a series without reading the earlier ones first. I gave it up at page 118 as I just couldn't get engaged by the characters. 
My previous experience with the Anita Blake series led me to this book hoping for a gutsy heroine and lots of action. There is action and descriptions of odd characters with extra eyes and magic skills. Guess I didn't make it to the sexy parts, as they mostly were talking about it, trying to be lyrical, but somehow the characters weren't coming alive for me so I gave it up. 
I didn't want to pan this book entirely, knowing Laurell Hamilton's abilities, she might pull it together, but I just wasn't willing to keep soldiering on hoping for a turn around.
