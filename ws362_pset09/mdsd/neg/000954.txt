I am glad I didn't buy this book, but got it from the library.  It definitely is not a good representation of Brockmann's excellent writing.  Maybe it is partly because I read this immediately after reading Lorraine Heath's "Parting Gifts" which is a true romance story and a 5++ star book.  I was just turned off by the sudden sex in the limo with the stranger when it seemed so out of character for Ellen who has teenage children and has never had even close to a one night stand before.  Then the sex in the limo leads directly to "I can't live without her", "I'm in love", without any relationship build up.  Guess I am just getting tired of these trite storylines.  I got tired of Ellen's constantly putting Sam off and telling him she's too old.  After awhile I agreed with her and wanted him to find someone else.  Her fear of being burned again just wasn't convincing enough for me.  This really is the first Suzanne Brockmann book I haven't liked.  She  has a talent for writing romance with humor and good character development.  It just wasn't evidenced here.  For a really great Brockmann, try Heartthrob
