I learned about 3 useful websites from this book, so reading it wasn't a total waste. But I kept feeling that it was written for women who are already a lot better off than I am, yet novices at managing their own money.

How about this--"You might not be able to quit your job and still make your annual pilgrimage to Tuscany. The new BMW every two years might be out of the question initially." In a section about maintaining what you already own, she talks about having sprinkler systems repaired and having your treadmill serviced. She encourages us to join a gym, and go to a spa. Give me a break! 

My husband and I haven't had a vacation in 10 years, and are driving 8- and 13-year old cars. Around here a gym is at least $360 a year, an impossibility for us and not necessary anyway when you can walk, and buy dumbbells and used exercise videos for a few dollars. Spend money at a spa when I can take a bubble bath? A sprinkler system to keep the crabgrass green? Good grief.

She talks about controlling your expenses by cutting down on emotional and impulsive spending, which for my husband and I is a paltry sum. But she doesn't say much at all about dealing with health care and insurance costs, which is a big worry for lots of people.

In other words, she just doesn't get my life and the lives of many Americans. Judging from what I *know* to be bad advice for someone like me, it makes me take the rest of the book with a grain of salt as well
