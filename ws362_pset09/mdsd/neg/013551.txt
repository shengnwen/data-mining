This is an inspiring story about one of the TRUE heroes of the United States, honored (much too late) both at home and abroad.  That being said, Bantam Books should be ASHAMED of the absolutely SHODDY, INFERIOR quality of this paperback edition!  When I opened my NEW copy, the first page in the photograph section fell out, which led me to look more closely at that section.  The pictures are so poorly reproduced that many, if not most, of them are barely recognizable as photographs!  Bantam Books has given this Great American Hero, Mr. Vernon J. Baker, the same disgraceful treatment that the U.S. Army gave him for so many years.  Reprehensible and unconscionable
