This recipe book was a gift and I am from the UK so I was excited to make some good british recipes but the format is so erratic and all over the place that it is hard to read. Maybe I am just used to Delia's books where if you are looking for an appetizer, you look under appetizer and voila but it takes ages to find what you are looking for. I would forgive that if the recipes turned out as described but I have made the fudge surprise cake twice now and followed the recipe to the tee and they were both a watery disaster, if you leave it in the oven for longer to dry it out, it comes out like cement and still has water floating on top. Dissapointing when you spend a small fortune to use valhrona and $$powdered cocoa
