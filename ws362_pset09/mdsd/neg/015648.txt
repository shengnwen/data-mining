I bought this book at the bike shop when I got my first mountain bike. Since then I have constantly had the shifting/derailleur system fail. Each time I have tried to use this book to solve the problem, I manage to make it just better than horrible, but not good enough, and end up bringing it to a bike shop for a professional tune-up. 

There are plenty of pictures but overall it has been worthless. The step-by-step procedures may work in a few situations, but not in the majority of situations you might encounter.
