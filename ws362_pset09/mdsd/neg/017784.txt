This book addresses some of the questions I have about alternative medicine but it is definitely not probing deeply into the questions surrounding medical treatment as was mentioned in the praise from Dr. Bill Bright  on the first page of the book. It touches the surface and quotes the Bible a little. There was not even a mention about the foods God recommends and advises not to eat.This book was a waste of my time.
