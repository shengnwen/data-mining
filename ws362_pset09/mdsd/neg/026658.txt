Hard to use and poorly laid out.  Doesn't list attractions and restaurants by neighborhood, so you are out and about but you can't find a recommended restaurant in the area.  Very frustrating.  This book is best used to hold the hotel door open while the bellman unloads your luggage.  If you go to Boston, have fun!...but DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.  Froemmer's does it better in their sleep
