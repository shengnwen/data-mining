Because of the distorted context in which this subject has been presented, I can say nothing good about this book. Under this convoLuted resoning, would Black athLetes be any Less a slave under BLack ownership? I think not. WouLd White athLetes be sLaves under BLack ownership? I think so. By it's very nature, whoever you work for you are selling your Labor for money. Does that make you a slave because the one you work for is not of the same race as you are? This book is 100% BS.
