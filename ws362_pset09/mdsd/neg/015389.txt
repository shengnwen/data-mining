I'm an Afx user and found this book painfully basic. I bought it because it was recomended for high-end users which I'm sorry to say is a lie. The 'keying tutorials' arent even tutorials; they're just examples of what you can do with 3'rd party Plugins. If I wanted a demonstration in how to download plugins I'd visit my local Crack site, thank you very much
