After having bought the first edition and read numerous other Finance & Strategy texts (in addition to having graduated with an MBA in Finance), I think it's fair to say this Grinblatt book is rather superficial in its coverage of technical matters e.g. options, financial engineering etc. and poor in its treatment of real life contemporary issues e.g. M & A, bankruptcy etc. Plus I still can't see what it has got to do with Corporate Strategy. Something is still missing here....

Most of the write-up are kind of basic (i.e nothing oustanding) explanation of issues, concepts or techniques in Finance, which you can easily find in other texts with much simpler names. The title of this book is catchy but MISLEADING. Priced at $120, this is really a rip-off. I just don't understand how other commentors could give a 5-star for this "shoddy" piece of work. Reference manual for corporate boardrooms and Wall Street? Come on! You guys must be joking! No offence but is this what they'd call "cutting edge"? 

Compared to classics like Copeland's "Financial Theory & Corporate Policy" or slightly less-advanced Brigham's "Intermediate Financial Management", this Grinblatt book really falls short of the standard and needs a lot of catching up to do. Hopefully, the authors will take serious note of this in their upcoming edition. Unless of course, they still want their book to be just another "appetizer" for business undergraduates....

In short, NOT worth buying. And NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER or in this case its rather appealing TITLE
