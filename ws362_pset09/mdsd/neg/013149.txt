The best thing about this book for me was that it was so short.  I really don't think I could have finished if it were any longer.  I just don't get it.  I found the book to be so simple that it was insulting.  I felt like I should have read this at about 10 years of age.  Profound? Hardly. Masterpiece? Certainly not.  The only impact that this book had on me was trying to figure out what all the fuss was about... and I am still working on that one
