While reading this, I felt at times as though I was seated at an upper-crust dinner party, listening to a child of privilege tell me why: "things are really NOT bad at ALL--well, at least not for ME."

The child of privilege is Ben Stein (whose Dad worked for NIXON, by the way), and yes, I'm sure that for HIM things are NOT bad --at all.
