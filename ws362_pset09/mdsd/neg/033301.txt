Tyson is funnier in person than on paper, and this book was a reflection of this fact.  Ultimately it panders to narcissistic fantasies, e.g., "All the ways the cosmos want to kill us."  (Actually, the cosmos are indifferent.)  The "Death by black hole" chapter occupies 7 pages.

Also, the book rambles all over the history and theory of science, the meaning of life, nature's place, and so forth.

Finally, the jokes were not particularly funny.  Too bad!  Tyson is genuinely funny in person.

Here is an alternative book:  Simon Singh, Big bang: The origin of the universe.  It was/is a NY Times bestseller and can be understood by a layperson easily
