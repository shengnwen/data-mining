About ten years ago, I tried to read this trash-book.This book is so absurd as UFO fables or eugenicists books and such as these things.
The core's source of this bad book are the lies told by an italian called Virgilo Scattolini, about sixty years ago.This italian was payed US$500 , each month between 1939 and 1947, by Uncle Sam government.At that times, US$500 were similar to US$15,000 today.Even with so many money, Virgilo Scattolini was nothing more than a crook and buffoon.After many years loosing money, with a buffoon, USA's government decided to dismiss Scattolini.This same buffoon, Virgilo Scattolini, looking as ever, for money, selled the same lies to italians communist who published the same lies.They became a best-seller until USA's government recognized that Scattolini, was nothing more than a buffoon.USA's only recognized that Scattolini was a buffoon, when he became to lie about the USA's ambassador.
This book is so bad and absurd, that I advise you that this is an useless book.
Were the gods astronauts?Was any Pope a nazist or eugenicist?
NO and NO!
