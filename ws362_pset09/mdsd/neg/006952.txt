This book is an ecumenical sermon about the global implications of hyper-consumerism. It contains little information about specific ways to reduce consumption, leaving it open to the readers to discover techniques that work for them. Instead, it focuses on the ethical philosophy of consuming only what you need. 
But are the foundations of this philosophy firm? The author seems to use guilt as a motivating factor for getting Westerners to cut their consumption. He repeatedly states that individuals in the West should reduce their consumption habits, suggesting implicitly that high consumption in the West is depriving the developing world of money or other resources. Paradoxically, reducing consumption in the West would deny wages to the Third World workers who produce consumer products for Western markets. So reducing Western consumption as a means to make the world a better place implies a very simplistic view of economics. Besides that, Western hyper-consumerism pales in the face of that displayed by affluent Easterners or South Asians. A more defensible reason for reducing consumption would be because it simply makes you feel better on a personal level. Also, it's beneficial for family budgets when money isn't spent before it's earned. And that leads to healthier family relationships. A book that focused its arguments on such issues would be far more convincing than this one.
