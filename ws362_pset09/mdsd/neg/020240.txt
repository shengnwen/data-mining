The Greens cookbook is a shoddy, carelessly dashed together list of recipes suitable for use only in a fully stocked restaurant kitchen. Another review pointed out that the recipes are not designed for use outside of the Greens' kitchen. Most recipes require (usually included in small print in the recipe itself) the previous completion of another exceptionally complicated recipe (often fanciful stocks, for which no substitutes are ever given). Some recipes require the previous completion of TWO other recipes, vegetarian shepherd's pie, for example, which should be a fairly simple recipe. Nearly a third of the recipes are pizzas, which I don't need a cookbook for) and the pizza dough recipe (again given in small print at the bottom) is for one 10-inch pizza. Who, I ask, is ever going to make individual pizzas at home? There are also no pictures. This is by far the most useless, arrogant, and user-unfriendly cookbook I have ever tried to cook with, the culinary equivalent of a punch to the kidneys
