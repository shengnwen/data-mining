I had to buy this book for coursework.  Now, I can't imagine authors with more knowledge of UML, etc. than these three guys.  However, every chapter reads like a student paper in which the main intention is filling up space for credit.  Don't get me wrong here.  I read programming books for fun.  I'm not one of those people who doesn't enjoy reading technical material.  They just managed to take an already dry subject and dry it further.  As you read through there are various references to other books, articles, whatever.  It seems as though no original material was written for this book.  So, here's my advice.  Read those books.  Don't read this one unless you need to catch up on some sleep
