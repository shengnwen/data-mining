AIkman wrote a fair history of of Christianity in China, however he misrepresents what is going on in China today.  By far the biggest problem in the Chinese church is poor teaching and abusive practices.  This exists almost exclusively in the underground churches.

Aikman wrote a book that caters to the palates of American Christian evangelicals who want to hear exactly what Aikman is telling them.  Young "missionaries" who have yet to understand the difference between culture and faith or have even critical thinking will use this book to find inspiration and funding. 

As a Mandarin speaking Christian who has spent considerable time in China I was hoping to like this book. If I was not, I would proabably think it was very good
