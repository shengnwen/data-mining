The critical praise of this book is shockingly inapplicable.  Presumptuous posturing is it's M.O.  Speaking not only for &quot;skin pirivileged&quot; whites, but speaking for other racial groupings as well. (In contrast, this  is where, Steele's appropriate sense of humility comes in.)  This work  falls apart once the p.c. hierarchies of the most oppressed are  deconstructed.  I.E. class is never a very important issue, althoug he  obliviously contradicts himself on this.  His arguments are not supported  by hard examples but by a subconscious acceptance of racial essentialism,  meaning monoliths about &quot;whiteness,&quot; &quot;blackness&quot; and  &quot;white skin privilige.&quot;  He is not only mistreating the wounds  but misdiagnosing and ignorantly caricaturing the patients.  This would not  be so bad if it were done in well intentioned and earnest misunderstanding.   But a well-placed and, yes, priviliged, educational elite  &quot;Oughta&quot; know better
