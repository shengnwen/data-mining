This might be touted by many as a "wonderful spiritual classic,"  but if you are a Christian, I'd stay away from this one.  It is gnostic to the core.  I bought it hoping to learn about Catholic hermaneutics - what a dumb mistake.  That's what the teaching magisterium of the Catholic Church is for!  Stick to documents of Vatican II and you won't get lost.  Plus, they are just as exciting and an easier read than this heady book of 'secrets'! 


Not everything with a Catholic label is authenitcally Catholic: Found these comments about a couple of the books endorsers on another website:  "The similarities between centering prayer and Transcendental Meditation are striking. "As an ex-TM mediator," says Fr. Finbarr Flanagan, O.F.M., "I find it hard to see any differences between centering prayer and Transcendental Meditation." Frs. Keating, Menninger, and Pennington authored centering prayer at a time when St. Joseph Abbey had received several retreats involving Eastern religions, including Transcendental Meditation. I cited Fr. Pennington's praise for the Hindu guru and author of Transcendental Meditation. This involvement in eclecticism has continued. Fr.

Pennington says it is "without doubt the most extraordinary work I have ever read." Amity House, the publisher, is heavily New Age. The Library of Congress has classified the book under "occult sciences" and "cartomancy."  'Nuff said
