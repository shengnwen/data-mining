I thought this book lacked focus and detail. Its basically a collection of thoughts from a number of so called "Pros" who use various methods and comment on what I consider to be the basics. I didn't buy it looking for handicapping advice(which is fortunate it has none)but I did expect some detail about wagering based on the books title. Instead it is a bunch of philisophical ramblings from a few well known handicappers and some who chose not to be identified. You'll laugh,(not really) you'll cry, you'll kiss 20 bucks goodbye. I can't reccomend it
