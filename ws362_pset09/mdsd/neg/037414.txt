Wyman's allegations regarding the means that might have been used to 'save' Jews from death camps seem fundamentally without substance. He ignores the facts surrounding the virtual impossibility of cutting rail  lines for any substantial length of time except in conjunction with a  strategic operation such as the Overlord landings in France [as well as the  possibility that the Axis would just have used other transportation];  ignores both the home front reactions to, and Axis propaganda repercussions  of, massive bombing of the camps, both of which might have slowed the end  of the war and actually increased the death toll in the end; and appears to  propose actions which were well-neigh impossible in the conditions of the  time. Taken together, this all raises the spectre of incomplete or hurried  scholarship. While raising points for discussion in the context of Allied  political reactions to the knowledge of the massive killing of civilians by  the Axis, the work in this book is certainly not in-depth or comprehensive,  in my opinion
