This book had very few colour photos, no application techniques, and often incorrect statements about hair and skin types.  There were no insightful tips or &quot;insider information&quot; that would have been useful to back up my current knowledge.  Everything was rather juvenile, with suggestions such as &quot;wear sunscreen&quot; and the use of a curling iron too often can &quot;damage your hair.&quot;  Who doesn't already know that?  The &quot;advice&quot; is not worth your money
