After finishing this book I have decided to throw it in the trash and find a better reference with which to try to learn if Tesla was a "genius".  The first book I have ever felt deserved such an honor. The information presented in the book is totally lacking in any technical detail with which one can determine if this guy Tesla was as stupid as it seems.  Granted he may have started off strong with his AC motor inventions-as presented in the bok the rest seems like it was hocum-a conclusion that is based on Teslas apparent inability to finish any working models of his subsequent "inventions" as well as to get anybody to commit any money to their developement.
