I really liked Dr. Wayne dyers 101 ways CD but this CD collection is out of focus. After spending 6 hours on this CD , I could not figure out his message !!.. 
It seems Dr. Wayne forgot that readers/listeners should get some advise when they hear this. He gave many examples and cases but some of them are really weak examples and weird and not upto his point at all. 
Dr.Wayne , We love your CD's but this collection is waste of money..
