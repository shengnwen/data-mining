I was really excited to get this book thinking it would talk about cellulite.  It didn't.  What this book does show you is how to build a really muscular butt and thighs.  Although Mrs. Reno says that women can't get too muscular by doing these work outs, you only have to look at the many pictures of woman in the book to see that you sure can!  I guess it's a subjective thing.  I personally like woman to have some fat and curves and most of the women pictured in the book (who are supposed to be examples) are too muscular for my taste and I would not like to look that way.  But from an athletic point of view, if you do want to build big muscles, then this is the book for you!
