Please take note of the publication date - 1997.  This means all the data is at least 5 years old (probably much older due to the time lag between gathering data and publication).  Therefore information such as housing prices, job markets etc are all woefully out of date.  It may have some interesting information, but don't bother using this book if you're looking for information on job situation, real estate or even taxes
