John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. I love Of Mice And Men, East of Eden, and The Grapes Of Wrath. But this 4-part story of a a boy and a horse (which isn't even about the horse that much) is pointless drivel. I'll admit, I liked the first part of it, which is great and good enough to warrant two stars. The rest of it feels disjointed. I couldn't wait to get done with it.

It isn't a terrible book, but it isn't good at all. It's below average, and below average is not what I expect from the writer of Of Mice And Men
