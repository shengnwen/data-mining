I have been a fan of LaBute for many years now and have yet to dislike any of his work, but this is not a very good play.  When I read a play, I try to envision how it would play out on stage.  This script has little potential for making a good production.  I guess this may be why it was published before anyone tried to mount a production of it.  I really feels unfinished.  The characters change their intentions throughout the play in an attempt to create twists and turns in the plot.  To me it all seems pretty contrived.  Since the plot is pretty much a mess, LaBute uses the convention of the main character breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the audience.  This results in some good monologues (possible audition material), but the play itself just kind of fizzles out into these kind of monologues instead of having a real arc to the story.  The dialogue is still good and there are some interesting scenes, but all-in-all it's just not a very good play.  If you are a fan of LaBute and have read/seen all of his other work it may be of interest.  If you are new to LaBute try The Shape of Things or The Mercy Seat
