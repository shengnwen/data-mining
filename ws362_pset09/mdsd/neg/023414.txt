Sorry, people. Look elsewhere for your "bible", your "holy grail", your whatever to see you through all the techno-babble. I found this hoping for a way to delineate plasma/LCD/DLP HDTVs. But the well's dry, folks. Out of print is out of luck.

By the way, why does everyone refer to all these copywriting books as "the Bible" of writing??
