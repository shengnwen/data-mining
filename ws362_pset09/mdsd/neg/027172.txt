Essentially the book is a rehash of the old creative financing techniques touted by the real estate gurus of the 1980's. And where are they now?
 
 With the exception of some updated techniques for the Internet, the approach is the same: 1. Find people with money. 2. Find sellers who want to dump their trashy properties, then put the two together.
 
 Since it always takes money to make money the whole scheme is dependant on your being able to find &quot;money people&quot;. 
 
 If there is any value in the book it is that it is a much cheaper way to get this type of info than having to buy the high priced infomerical stuff.
 
 True, there will be a few who will make their fortunes by buying fixer uppers at a discount but most copies of this book will end up with all the other &quot;real estate riches&quot; type books - selling for a buck or two at the used book stores
