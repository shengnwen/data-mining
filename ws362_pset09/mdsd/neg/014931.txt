This play explores the same old turf as "Death of a Salesman", but it does so with much less satisfaction and much less character development.  Eddie is no Willy Loman, though, and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central, driving force like Willy.  Parts of the play seem borrowed from Tennessee Williams, and they don't seem to work in this context.  There is some business about the romance of the Old World Italy versus the New World of Opportunity on the docks of New York, and it is the only topic that is at all explored well, if still unsatisfactorily.  Eddie's dreams are represented in his pretty niece, Catherine; and unlike Willy Loman's uncle, she is still an attainable dream. That makes Eddie's life seem all the more petty, in comparison to Willy's: he longs wearily not after what he could have had, but after what he can never have, as he is already married.  The death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced, tacked on ending, and Alfieri's entire presence is a more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick.  There are better plays by Miller, and many better plays by others
