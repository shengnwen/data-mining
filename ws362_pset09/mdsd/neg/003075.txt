Just finished this book last night. Skipped large chuncks of it, as the only reason I was trying to even finish the thing is to find out what it was that happened 15 years ago.

I got this book as part of a giftbag at a Shecky's NYC event, and it took me a while to get to the book. Unfortunately, it's not realy well written, and the plot is sort of contrived (hence, the vast skipping of whole passages). The whole book revolves around some mysterious thing that happened 15 years ago and is surrounded by chunks and bits of events leading up to it, but with no real value. 

While I appreciate Ms. O'Connor's effort at writing, for her first work she just doesn't quite pull through. The characters - while pretty well developed - were not entirely interesting and didn't conjure empathy from me. They were just a bunch of "messed up" girls due to "messed up" parents, suffering some "messed up" situations, and that's what the entire book goes on and on about.

Ms. O'Connor definitely has the potential to pull together something much better in her future work, but her writing style, use of analogies and similies, and descriptiveness, are all rudimentary still. It seems like she tried to add some shock and titillary value to the book by all the sex scenes, but that easily reduces it to the same levels of your average romance novel plus noir.

Anyway, the only thing I really liked about it was the Bay Area setting for one of the characters, because each mention conjured up happy memories for me
