I am a big Richard Laymon fan.  His writing was phenominal!  I believe that there were certain manuscripts he decided not to publish because they were not up to par.  Unfortunately this was one of those novels.  Long and drawn out with humdrum dialog among characters that are just plain out boring.  If your just getting to know some of his work, I recommend not to plunge into this until you've read all of his books that was published while he was alive
