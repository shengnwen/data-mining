Both the book and the film is full of exaggeration, revenge and hatred towards Turkey and Turks. Only 30-40% of the story may be true which I am pretty sure would also be the same in many countries 36 years ago. All the rest is full of lies. But portraying one of the worlds most interesting and beautiful city like it was is a real shame and pitty. I am a Greek living in Athens who visits Istanbul and beaches at the south of Turkey with my family at least twice a year and know what I am talking about. I don't know anyone who was in jail but dealt with police a few times and everyone was always nice and very helpful especiallyy to foreigners.
