I have a working knowledge of a lot of what's covered in this book.  The presentation is fairly elementary even for a novice. The level of expertise this book targets would be very hard to learn from just a book.  They are better off spending $20 for a pizza anad a six-pack and finding a friend w/ a free afternoon to walk them through explaining and installing Linux. This book is likely to be either too technical or not provide enough information.

On the plus side it comes with a copy of Fedora Core and Knoppix but...

...who's idea was it to cover Linspire instead of Debian.  Wait for the next edition which will likely cover Ubuntu, which is likely to become the new Linux standard
