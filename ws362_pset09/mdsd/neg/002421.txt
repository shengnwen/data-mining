I have waited with barely contained anticipation for this book, only to be disappointed.  The first half was mostly very wordy, minutely detailed descriptions of barracks talk, how to march in review, what they eat/drink, discussions between various officers, etc.  

When the story did finally get to some action, it wasn't much and not what one expects, even given the few hints in the first half of the book.  Also, I find it ludicrous that a government would try to keep the skinks secret from the governed.  I'm always very irate when an author or even someone in authority cites the possibility of "panic in the streets" as a reason for secrecy.  I doubt that very few of any populace would run into the streets, rioting and looting.  Rather, they would pull together to face this new threat to their collective civilization.  Throwing citizens into lifetime imprisonment, either military or civilian,  for knowing even a hint of these aliens existence, is a crime in itself.  That is totally outrageous government behavior  Not to mention letting their families and friends thus believe they are either dead or "missing in action".  That portion of these books is, I believe, very, very unbelievable.

It was a fair story, a somewhat quiet story, given it's military trend.  Even Sgt. Bass was treated as a minor character, once the "action" started.  

However, it is a part of the series, and as such, should be read by anyone who is following these marines.  I await the next book and hope for some more of the "skink war".  If the government insists on keeping the existence of the aliens such a secret, other vulnerable populaces and planets are left without a clue to even be looking for signs of a skink presence on their world, so as to defend themselves and/or be alert and prepared.

I love these authors works, and am sorry to be somewhat down on this particular book, and will happily await the next
