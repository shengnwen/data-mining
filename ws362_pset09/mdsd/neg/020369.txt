My husband and I recently bought our first home, so I ordered this book in the hopes that it would give us helpful details on how to maintain it, make minor repairs, and accurately troubleshoot.  I am very, very, VERY disappointed in the book.  While it gives decent descriptions of the various aspects of your home, such as heating and cooling systems, it does no more than that.  I thought I was getting something more in-depth than just descriptions.  For instance, how do I MAINTAIN my air conditioner properly?  I've heard that you should hose down the outside unit every so often, for example - yet there's nothing about that in the book.  I don't feel any more educated about my home and how to keep it safe and well-maintained than before I got this book.  This was almost a complete waste of money and I don't recommend it
