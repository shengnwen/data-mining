I understand what Barbara Walker is trying to do, but it really didn't turn out very well.  In an attempt to make classic sexist fairy tales more pro-woman, she simply turned them into flat, boring stories that follow a formula.  Basically, all the women are heroes and all the men are rapists. This book could have been a lot better if it was written more skillfully.
