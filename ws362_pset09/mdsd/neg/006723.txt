I read all of the Left behind series including the two prequels, and decided to read this series while waiting on the final prequel. I liked the first two books, and even this one until there is the problem with Bingman, or is it Bingham, who survived, and then was said to have died. Tim you said you were more excited about this series than any other, well it dosen't show in this sloppy edition. Somebody please read the next book before it goes to the printer, and I will read it also. Thank
