Alright, I am a big fan of the Left Behind Series but the prequels do not compare at all to the original series. The third installment was the worst of the three being used to push a certain religious belief. Personally I felt it was veyr preachy and did not emphasize on the story. The book went no where, it was dry and boring and i didnt even watn to finish it but forced myself to. It picked up towards the last 30-50 pages but thats about it. If anyone is to read the prequels, the first book was the best and half of the second book was alright. But sorry to say the third was a huge dissappointment. The authos were just using the book as a tool to spread their owns beliefs. But im not bashing the Left Behind Series because it was an excellent read of suspent and thrill which was not at all present in the Rapture
