I walk in to Barnes & Noble nad stroll over the Business section and there is a new book with a catchy title and subtitle; "Leading Leaders", "How to manage smart talented, rich and powerful people"

What you get is more of the Communists News Network (CNN) useless diatribe on how the war on terror and Iraq are failures and that the President can be held in contempt because we have the freedom of speech.

Mr Salacuse writing style is both reckless and irresponsile.
What a farce.
