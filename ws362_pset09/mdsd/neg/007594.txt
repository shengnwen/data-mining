I bought this book because it had a CD-ROM with NCLEX-type questions. Unfortunately, the CD-ROM can't be used on computers without Windows 98 or higher. I took the disk to my college library, hoping to use the disk on one of the PC machines there, but I discovered that the disk has to be installed on the computer. Installing software on public computers is verboten at my school. This means the CD-ROM is basically worthless to me. The book itself is basically an outline of a Med-Surg nursing textbook. There are surprisingly few illustrations for a study guide. 

Bottom line: If you like studying dry lists and you own a PC with Windows 98 or higher, Pentium 166 or higher, 64 MB RAM or more, and 8 MB of free hard-disk space, this book might be for you. However, if you like studying with memory aids, graphs, charts, drawings, and spoon-feeding explanations of complex concepts, don't waste your money on this book
