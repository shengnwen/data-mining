I purchased this book when my husband was diagnosed with kidney cancer last summer (June 2006). I was hoping for some real insight into the process of healing and opening oneself to the channel of healing. I found the book very disappointing. There was nothing in it that inspired my husband in any way nor gave us any insight as to how to investigate the process of opening oneself to the miracle of healing. I was miraculously healed of Multiple Sclerosis in November of 1975 and have conducted many retreats and workshops on "Self Awareness and Healing" across the United States. I had hoped that Adam might have some further insight into the healing phenominan and that I could gain further insight in order to help my husband and others. I read the book aloud to my husband and he,too, was disappointed in the content of the book. I learned nothing new from this book nor found it to be particularly inspirational. My dear husband passed away in October 2006 and received the greatest healing of all, death. He is now in the presence of our Lord and is where I want to be someday
