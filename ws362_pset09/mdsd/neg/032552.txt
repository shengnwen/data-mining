Actually I have not read this book and probably won't anytime soon.  I understand there is more than one side to everything but am totally offened at the response to Dr. Barach from ISSD.  The organization helped me tremdously when I first found out I had MPD/DID.  I could not find Dr. Barach's response anywhere on here but I would think that in defending the organization the Dr. is also defending those of us who have a legitimate diagnosis of MPD/DID
