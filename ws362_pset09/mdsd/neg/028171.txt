The Mysteries of Udolpho is beautifully written.  Ann Radcliffe writes page after page, after page...of picturesque descriptions of Italy and France's countryside.  
That being said, I found The Mysteries of Udolpho to be long winded and drawn out.  The first two volumes are rather mind-numbing and I skimmed over much of it.  I never felt a connection towards Emily and felt rather indifferent towards her well being.  I found her to be rather insipid and became tired of her constant fits of weeping and fainting.  Her servant, Annette, was more intriguing than Emily and her pathetic weakness.
I would personally recommend skipping The Mysteries of Udolpho to read Sheridan Le Fanu's novel Uncle Silas.  Young Maud finds herself in similiar circumstances but approaches them with not only grace and sweetnss but a strength that she "finds from a place unknown" to herself.  You will cheer for Maud in a way that seems impossible to do for Emily
