This book was the most difficulty, unfriendly read for me.  It's full of tables and scientific stuff that I couldn't read or refer to easily.  I ended up giving it away which is a shame, but what's the point of collecting so much information if it's so unappealing to read and ultimately unreadable?  They really need to work on improving this, then again, it's an almanac - perhaps the expectations for a pleasurable read should be dim.
