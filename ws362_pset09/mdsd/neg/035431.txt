(Small Bang) The Hour of the Star! Since my first and only reading of Lispector's final work, I have bought over three dozen copies, not for myself, but to hand out routinely to people I deem worthy of experiencing her words. I will usually write, with blue ink, on the bottom of page 70, "This has been a practical joke."
    (I'm having a hellish time writing this review... this review in itself is insignificant, it is the promise of golden rice at the review's end that prompts me to continue)
    I recommend buying a few dozen copies yourself, but not for the purpose of reading any of 'em, just to hand them out to people you don't like and say, "This is a very good book, I think you'll really enjoy reading it."  This also works great for an April Fool's Day "punk."
    Finally, as I fight off eight or nine urges to drift off into an incoherent tangent, stringing dozens of pointless philosophical questions together, I will recommend highly that all masochists purchase and treasure this book.
