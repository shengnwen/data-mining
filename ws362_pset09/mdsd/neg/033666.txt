Speaking of truth - the day before he graduated from Concordia Lutheran Seminary in St. Louis, Pastor Neuhaus was asked a question by his roommate - how can you attest tomorrow that Scripture is inerrant when you have told the rest of us that you don't believe that? 
 The issue in this case is not whether Scripture is inerrant, but whether a pastor or any man should be a truth-teller.
