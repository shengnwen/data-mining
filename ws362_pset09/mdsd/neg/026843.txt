It is a great idea to publish a book like this. When I received this book I was happy, but a few minutes later I was already disappointed. I own a few actual statistics from the same company (Moore Research Center) and couldn`t believe, that they have hidden the most important statistics. For example feeder cattle: in their statistic they published 2 trades with a winning chance of 100 %. In this book they published zero! For example lean hog: in their statistic: 9 trade-opportunities with a winning chance of 100 %. In this book: only 2! They filled this book with 80 % chances. I don`t know, why they have hidden the higher chances?! Somehow I have the impression, this company don't want to tell us the trades with the highest probability. What a pity
