I was disappointed by this book.  I read the first few pages and was fascinated.  The first story in the book had some great character pathology in it, telling the tale of an obsessed man from his point of view, but the rest of the book was literally nonsensical. It was like Dr. Seuss stories without the charming rhymes or colorful pictures if they had material unfit for children.  The plots were even less well-developed than that lesser of Seuss's classics, One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish.  This book is a bit like that New York art gallery that I once visited that had a jar of urine on exhibit as a work of art: the bizarre is being passed off as creative.  The first story is worth reading, but the rest can be skipped in favor of the more intellectually vigorous Horton Hears a Who
