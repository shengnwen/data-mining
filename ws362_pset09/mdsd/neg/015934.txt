[...] Actually if you have bought "Confused photographer's guide to photographic exposure and the simplified zone system" - you bought _MORE_ of the very same content, which is available in "The Confused Photographer's Guide to On-Camera Spotmetering". This book looks like a subset of the previous one, with very little additions, concerning the spotmetering. Please, don't get me wrong. It is not a completely bad book. It is acceptable as long as you haven't seen "The Confused Photographer's Guide to Photographic Exposure and the Simplified Zone System", where the content fits much better. Therefore simply be warned that if you have "The Confused Photographer's Guide to Photographic Exposure and the Simplified Zone System" you won't get almost anything new from this book. :-
