I bought this book because, yes, I'd like to be rich too. Unfortunately, the entire first two-thirds of the book is Wayne Root's self-appointed fan club screaming about how the only people who matter are Republicans, the rich, and the Type A personalities that often end up there. We've been hearing the rich and powerful claiming that they are better since pretty much the dawn of time. He also spends a great deal of time explaining why the Democrats are useless and will be out of power for the next century.

I'm amazed he bothers to take Robert Kiyosaki to task for his books because the two of them could trade covers and few would notice the difference. Self-promoters like this always claim that they did it all themselves (although he does claim to have a rich mentor), that luck had nothing to do with it, that it's all drive and determination and guts. He actually made it to the top through taking advantage of a few opportunities to promote himself as a "sports betting expert."

The saddest part is, there's almost no useful information in the book. (Of course, that's better than Kiyosaki's books which are often filled with miss-infromation that could land you in Federal prison.) It's mostly tired platitudes and denigration of all things Democrat. This is P.T. Barnum at his best
