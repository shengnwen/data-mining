I should have been suspicious since this book has hardly been reviewed in the press. After reading it, it's clear why it has been virtually ignored. In short, it is pure dreck. There is lots of sex but that does not make for  a good book. The author fails to develop any of the characters, choosing to  try to titillate readers rather than engage us emotionally
