I'm in a Ph.D. program, and this is the required reading for our psychometric test.  I was looking on the Border's web site to find a different book to read that would cover the same material, that would not be so difficult to understand.  Nunally has a nasty habit of poorly defining terms, which makes it extremely difficult to grasp what he is talking about.  It's challenging enough to understand psychometric theory, let alone with a practically illegible textbook!  This book needs rewriting!  I've given it two stars because supposedly the book contains a lot of valuable material.  Of course, this doesn't matter one whit when you can't even read the darn thing!
So professors, please, don't do this to your students!!
