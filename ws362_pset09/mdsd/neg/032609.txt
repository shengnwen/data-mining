If only Mollie Katzen's food was as feather weight as her gee whiz, Ma, tone. But is there anyone nowadays (short of people running a marathon) who can eat like this? Obviously, Katzen hasn't gotten the message that America's gone low carb. However what she lacks in recipes, she more than makes up for in enthusiasm. Back when she was leading the vegetarian vanguard, (look behind you, there's no one on that parade anymore), her hype convinced because all the world needed encouragement to eat veggies. But now we've heard that a million times. So she's turned her attention to breakfast (whoopee! it's breakfast) but this presents a major challenge, because eating French toast, porridge and the other foods she recommends more often than once a season will fatten you up real fast. I realize that recipe books like this one are mostly just fantasy reading as most people try to stick to the latest diet-- and usually people who write them don't pretend to be health conscious. But Ms. Katzen does. What happens when your healthy shtick is no longer healthy
