I was hoping for so much more from this book. There are little bits of wisdom, but otherwise, I think it's too harsh. I definitely got the vibe of what personality Tripp is--and it isn't mine. I have seen kids grow up who were treated in the way he suggests--and it isn't good. I'm not anti-spanking, but I sure am not for it on the level he instructs. I just think there is more of a balance in parenting. I wouldn't reccommend this book. There are better Christian approaches that are more loving without being too permissive. sure, we are responsible to God to train our kids to respect and obey Him, but I sure am not going to say that God wants me to discipline by spanking. I'm fallible. I want my kids to know that God is happy when they behave and obey and that he loves and forgives them when they don't.
