The thing to remember is that even though an author may be described as an expert with a kzillion honors, it does not necessarily mean they are any good at teaching (or writing). It's the same as having brilliant professors in college who can't teach. These are smart people but since they are already highly fluent in the material, they forget how to present the information to complete novices. This book is a perfect example of this.

The philosophical introductions and the interviews are excellent and worth reading. 

But the organization of materials could have been better.
For example, the bogu (armor) is introduced before any of the basics like etiquette or basic foot work are explained. Most beginners will not see a bogu for 8 months. What a typical beginner needs is buried late in the book in the section on technical kata. 

Drawings are ok but lack detail. In some cases a photo would have been more useful. Eg a photo of the shinai parts would have been better than the line drawings which don't communicate anything useful. The diagrams are labeled with numbers rather than names so you have to hunt thru the text to find their names. Why not just put the labels next to the arrows? This isn't a model kit! Whoever did the design of the visuals does not know anything about visual communication.

Worst of all some of the diagrams are simply wrong! 

This book is ok to fill in a few missing parts in ones Kendo instruction, but be careful of errors. The descriptions of the kata are in the form of sentences so you have to read several paragraphs over and over again to clarify what is in the diagram. It would have been more effective to have each step enumerated in a list and then correspond the enumerations with the pictures.

The coverage of waza is very small. There is a page on identifying openings but it is written rather confusingly. 

Also there is no index in the book
