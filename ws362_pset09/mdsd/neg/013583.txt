While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.

I'm extremely surprised this is a "best seller". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.

Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear
