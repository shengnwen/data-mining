Children are a gift that YOU brought into this world; they are people that need love, understanding and coaching. They are not CHORES to be reduced and put away with as little effort as possible so that you can have 'more time for yourselves.'

What an insult to parents and children this horrible man is. Childhood should not be filled with arbitrary rules, boundaries and fear of crossing them. Childhood should be enjoyable, fun and above all instructional. If you treat your children with love and  respect - yes respect - they will do what is right. They will do it because you do it, because they know it is right in their hearts, and because they love you and themselves. Not just because 'I told you so.' IF you raise a child to do what they are told, and just to obey and be disciplined, and not to think, not to trust themselves, guess what happens in high school or before. They do what their friends tell them and conform to their actions. Drugs, alcohol and sex - pretty hard to disobey your friends that are doing that when you have been told just to do what your told and that someone else is the 'boss.'

DONT BUY THIS BOOK. AVOID THIS NUT-JOB AND ALL THE 'DISCIPLINE' FREEKS.

Try, instead some positive parenting. Works for me. Such as: Unconditional Parenting : Moving from Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason, by Alfie Kohn.
