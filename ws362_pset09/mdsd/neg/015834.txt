Save your money, if i could get mine back i would want it doubled. Filled with spelling and grammer errors (page 27 "The Big Kahuna Burger" was not only eating in pulp fiction". I'm pretty sure that should be eaten, and a comma not a period at the end.), i run across several facts that are just plain wrong (page 17 "In Fairbanks Alaska a law forbids elks to have sex on the streets"... ok first off elks isnt a word, its just elk, and second off there are no Elk in fairbanks alaska, the law is about Moose. I live in Fairbanks, its a well known law from the early 1900s with a funny story about why it is a law, but there are NO ELK in interior of Alaska) Save your money and buy a book that at least went through a spell checker or a grammar check, and for God's sake, if you are gonna call them facts , at least make sure they are facts!
