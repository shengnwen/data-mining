For as beautiful and heartwarming as is The Road from Coorain, True North  is a pure disappointment. A good writer can make any subject a delight, but  Ms. Ker-Conway is not a writer, at least in this offering. Yes, she is in  total demand of her language but in True North she does not write from the  heart, she writes like a text-book author rather than as a story teller.  Fine if that is her intent, but she, and her publisher, should not try to  pass it off as an invigorating read. Further, her contradictory use of  sexism is disturbing. On one hand she condemns the male dominated world of  her era for their blatant discrimination of women, but on the other she  unabashedly uses her gender as a basis for the hiring of colleages. As a  highly educted historian it appears that history has taught her nothing.  She is repeating and coninuing a clearly defined mistake of our society. I  read Road From Coorain to learn more of my own mothers childhood, she is  also Australian from the same generation as Ms. Ker-Conway. My mother was  raised in poverty and had little oppurtunity for higher education. Yet  despite the lack of a formal education, my mother is very well read and has  a keen mind. Alert, inquisitive, always open to new thoughts and ideas. In  comparison, I sense that Ms. Ker-Conway has closed her mind to much of the  world, at least the uneducated world. If nothing else she comes across as  an educated snob, an elitist. A common delemna to a genius mind. Road from  Coorain is a delight. True North is a true bore
