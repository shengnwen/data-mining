Unless you are really into modern art, Picasso, and Guernica (the painting) you'll probably find this book a bit boring.  Not that it isn't well written and researched, it is, but for the average reader something more was needed.  I was looking for more insights into Picasso the man and a deeper look into those troubled times. About the only feeling in this book is a kind of leftist-elitist-snobbery. I'm about halfway through the book now and may finish it...
