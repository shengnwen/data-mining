I found this on the "new books" shelf at the local library and took it home for a look-see.

I must say, I was disappointed. This book will not help anybody build a computer. The information is superficial and dated. There is a shortage of illustrations (NEED LOTS MORE PHOTOS!)

Now, I have indeed built my own computer, but that project would have been a disaster if this book had been my guide. Instead, I heartily recommend "Building the Perfect PC" by Thompson. (Interestingly, the blurb on the front cover of this Dummies book says "Build the perfect PC..." Coincidence? I think not). Less than a year ago, the Thompsons' book WAS my sole source, my cookbook for how to put together a computer, and it covered all the gotchas encountered in the process. It has abundant photos, and they're in color. With the rapid pace of computer development, even that is showing its age, and the authors aren't updating their web site as promised, but it's still leaps and bounds ahead of this "For Dummies" book
