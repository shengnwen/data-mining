The idea is good. The characters are really good, with a few exceptions. BUT. 

1) This book's plot is extremely repetetive. "Oh my gosh, she's committed the unpardonable; they have not choice but to curse her with death." OVER and OVER again. Ayla breaking the "most sacred-est rule ever" and then mysteriously NOT getting in serious trouble for it consumes the entire plot. Well, not the entire plot. The other 1/4 involves how Brun likes his son, now he doesn't, now he does. Ad nauseum.

2) In addition to the repetitious plot, there is so much redundant text that one must wonder if ANYONE read the manuscript before it went to print. The author will write, for instance, about how the Clan was confused by Ayla's tears (since they don't cry), and then 10 pages later, she writes the same thing. I don't know how many times she wrote about Ayla's tears, Brun's worry about Broud, how intercourse is strictly a natural function, how they think she's ugly. Etc. Etc. (Etc. Etc.)

3. The "Be sure and purchase the next installment" ending in infuriating.

I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I see now why there are 5 copies of it in every used book store. That said, I read the whole thing in 5 days, so that must say something good about it
