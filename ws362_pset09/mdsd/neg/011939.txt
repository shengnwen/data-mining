If you have read Time And Again, you will be extremely disappointed with this sequel. In the first book, Si Morley traveled into the past and there were long passages describing a long gone New York City that were well written and absorbing. Jack Finney tries to duplicate that by again sending Si back and all it comes off as is long winded and boring: an excruciatingly boring buildup just so Finney can introduce Al Jolson; page upon page of boring descriptions of vaudeville, clothing, architecture and early flight are other examples. If I did not know better, I would say that the kernel of this book (returning to the past to prevent WW I) was originally lopped off Time And Again in order to shorten that book and Jack Finney decided to expand it into full book length just to make a fast buck. He would have been better off re-issuing an expanded, "uncut" Time And Again rather than putting out this drivel
