Building on "Running with Scissors" or "Dry," you could easily feel that this book might have even more to offer about this author's life.  However, while I felt the stories were mildly amusing and Burrough's has a talent for sarcastic writing (like Bill Bryson or Mary Roach), this book I found overall chaotic and without merit.  Why aren't the stories in chronological order at the very least?  What is the point of this book?  It seems almost as if you're listening to a friend talk endlessly about himself with no regard for what you might like to hear (or pay for).  There's no cohesive bond to hold the stories together other than they are about the author.  Perhaps it's time for time for Burrough's to show a little versatility and less self-indulgence.
