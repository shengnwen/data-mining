This book is terrible.  It does not cover many of the tools.  For instance, at the beginning of the book it mentions that a new tool is "Object Remover", supposedly to remove objects you dont want in a picture.  That is the last you hear of it, it's never mentioned again, and no hint as to how to use it.  The major tools are covered (sometimes in several sections), but many other tools are listed at the beginning of the chapter, then never mentioned.  I'm sorry I bought it and will try another book (Perhaps Paint Shop Pro X Digital darkroom by Clark)
