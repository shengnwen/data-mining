I've never written a review before. I love the Repairman Jack novels, but this was a waste of time. I'm glad it wasn't more than $0.50. Apparently, "electronic edition" means "no editor involved." For example, on page 3, Jack checks his appearance: "NY Jets warm up Jacket over a flannel shirt, worn jeans over tan, steel-toed work boots."  Only a page later, "Jack found himself on the move before he knew it, his sneakers whispering along the pavement." I guess I missed the part where he changed his shoes.

Beyond this and other distracting errors, there was really no story. I usually enjoy Repairman Jack because there's plenty of exposition of the secondary characters' motivation, and Wilson really ratchets up the tension in his novels. None of that is here, and I don't think that's because it's a short story. This whole thing feels slapped together.

Fianlly, I'm also disappointed because I think this plot (Jack being arrested) is worthy of being part of a longer novel
