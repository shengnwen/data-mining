I have just purchased and received Freundlich's book, James Earl Fraser.

The major complaint I have is that the black & white illustrations are among the poorest quality I have ever seen.  They are small, of low resolution and many have a fine grid of white diagonal lines running through the entire image.

Perhaps I received a defective copy, but as a collector of sculpture books I can tell you that this one is very disappointing, especially for such a pricey softcover.

I would advise potential buyers to be aware of the above especially if they are interested in BOTH a good biography as well as good illustrations (this is usually important to most sculpture lovers),  However, if all you care about is biographical text then maybe you won't be as disallusioned as I was.  Note: the only good illustration in the entire book is the cover photo of Fraser's American Indian bas relief (on the "Buffalo" US 5-cent piece).
