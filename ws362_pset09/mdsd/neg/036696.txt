I bought Salvation hoping Ms. hooks would give definitive ways to address the problems we are having in the Black community. It was informative and somewhat repetitive.  Her feminist view came through and in part I disagree with some of her feminist views. In our search for equality, we as women, black women are still left out. Just as the civil rights movement let doors open we closed doors on our own selves when it was unnecessary. 

Like any movement, there is a fallout and backlash.  Ms. hooks addressed some valid points, such as Love being the answer to our problems in the Black community. However, she gave no real steps, nothing concrete that can be taken into the community and used.  We have talked and talked out our problems and even addressed some solutions. Now we need definitive steps and even examples to lead us out of the sex wars between our people.
