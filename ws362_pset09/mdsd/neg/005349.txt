Just about everyone has known a woman like Ms. Headley.  (Insecure and dramatic, EVERYTHING happens to HER!) Ms. Headley tries to pass her self off as a madcap Lucille Ball type (Wah! My skirt ripped!!!) Instead, she comes off as "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" part II -- needy and promiscuous, willing to sleep with anyone. Her narcissistic navel gazing is tedious and the dialogue contrived.  Don't even bother taking this book to the beach.
