This book is partitioned into two sections: "Basic Narrative," which is a summary of antiquity from the agararian communities of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia and Egypt) to the fall of the Roman Empire and the emergence of the Christian community and; "Societies and Cultures," which is a more detailed look at those societies and cultures that fall within the book's qualifications and, to a certain extent, the relevance of those cultures to contemporary, Western society/culture. Every sentence if not every paragraph of the first section is a bold, arguable statement that begs further exposition, discussion or reading. Actually, it appears from the "Guide for Further Reading" at the end of the book, that the first section of this book may be a derivative summary of Cantor's readings of those materials. One might be better off reading those materials for oneself rather than relying on Mr. Cantor's synthesized book reports. Mr. Cantor's use of informal, laymen language makes this book further unsuitable for use as a reference or quotation within a thesis or other scholarly endeavor. The second section of the book loses some of the somewhat cavalier arrogance (which Mr. Cantor may have meant to come across as wit) of the first section but the disjunct writing styles within the section is perplexing. The created interview with St. Augustine is clever but the section on Civil Law lacks clarity and overall what has been cited as "authoritative insight" appears to be Mr. Cantor's ruminations or opinions. While the attempt to cover the breadth of the topic within a couple of hundred pages could be construed as either laudable or [a] folly, the result in this case is an embarrassing attribution to Mr. Cantor's erudition
