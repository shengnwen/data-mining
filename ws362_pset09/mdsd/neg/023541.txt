I used to live on Corfu (and it's an island; therefore, it's &quot;on&quot; Corfu, not &quot;in&quot; Corfu!) and first stayed there about 2 years after the author first set foot on Corfu.  I have been going back there ever since.  This book is a terrible disappointment if one is looking for plot, character development, reader involvement, etc.  However, it's wonderful if one is an architect, a civil engineer, and/or a horticulturist.  This is the first book I have bought in a long time where I wanted my money back!  I found myself skipping page after page after page, in sheer boredom.  One can read about lovely flowers and sea only for so long.  After that, it would be nice to know a little bit about the society, the politics, the people, etc., of which we get precious little in this book.  A horrendous waste of time.  And if I felt that way and know (and love!) the place well,...I can't imagine what a reader who has never been there would think.  A great soporific.  Please, don't waste your time
