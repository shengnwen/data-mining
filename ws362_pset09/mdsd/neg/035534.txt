A Love Noire does try to critically look at issues of Black identity and for that I commend Ms. Turnipseed.  Ms. Turnipseed does look at the complexity of relationships between different people of the African Diaspora and how there can be conflicts between the values of the different people of the diaspora.  In addition her look at skin color in the African American community as well as the issue of class is very interesting to note.  However, A Love Noire does try to look at too many issues and often places different issues in plots where they just don't belong.  For instance, she tries to look at bisexuality.  That would be fine if it somehow connected to the rest of the story but it doesn't.  In addition, she introduces certain issues which are worth looking at more than she does.  For example Jayna's interracial relationship with a fellow white dental student.  This would have fit into the story so well but she spends like five pages (if even that) on this potentially meaty subplot.  I think this novel is better than most of the trashy, nonstimulating novels that have become the norm for black literature today but it could've been better.  Still, for a first effort it wasn't horrible and I'm sure Turnipseed will produce better in the future
