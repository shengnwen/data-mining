The criticism that a lot of the perfume and aromatherapy community has leveled at this book has been that there is nothing in this book that is not already in print.  I'd be willing to agree with that.  Considering that Chrissie Wildwood is out of print, and that Arctander and Tisserand are hard to find inexpensively, this book is an okay stand-in for those which preceded it.  It is not the final authority however, despite the glowing reviews.  Get the original works from these three authors if you possibly can, if you consider yourself a perfumery scholar
