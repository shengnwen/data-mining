As many have noted, this book bears many similarities to the Da Vinci Code.  Both books contain elements that strain credulity.  In this book, for example, the heroine is a renowned archaeologist who participated in excavations in the places once called Alexandria, Phoenicia, and Anatolia but who doesn't speak a word of Greek.  In the Da Vinci code, the hero walks north from Sacre Coeur to reach the Louvre.  Unfortunately, Sacre Coeur is in Montmartre, in the north of Paris, while the Louvre is in central Paris, near the Seine.

On the whole, this book is probably more historically accurate than the Da Vinci code, whose "Prieure de Sion" documents in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris were proven to be forgeries several decades ago, with the perpetrators identified and admitting their guilt.

Sadly, as others have said, the characters in this book are one-dimensional, their romance is implausible, and the plotting seems forced.  At some points the book reminded me of Ayn Rand, with the characters "conversing" by inflicting multi-page speeches upon each other.

On the whole, this book might have been mildly entertaining, but the conclusion was absurd and utterly disappointing.
