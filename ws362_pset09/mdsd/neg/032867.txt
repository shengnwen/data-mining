This book is plainly boring in every way. The plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting. The first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars, and the second half deserved roughly one star. If you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart, then I suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting, like "Barney Goes to the Zoo". Do not, and I repeat: DO NOT read this book. If you would like to take interest in this novel, save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. You WILL be disappointed
