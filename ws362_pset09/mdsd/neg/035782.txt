This book is a waste of money for whomever buys it, a waste of paper, totally useless and offers absolutely no useful info beyond what any reasonable person does not know. The writer merely lives on a parked boat and might as well live in a cramped apartment from where he can write the same worthless stuff. There are no "essentials" in the book. Believe me, go spend your money somewhere else!
