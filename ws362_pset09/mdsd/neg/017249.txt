I agree with Sadie.  This book was terribly written and I actually felt that this author should definitely be writing in a different arena or maybe even not at all.  I noted several inconsistencies that made me go back and check to see if I had misread or missed something, so that was frustrating.  I already knew most of the details that this author included from Court TV and the news reports.  It did not seem that he had any inside knowledge or any inside connections whatsoever.  The book is an excellent resource if you are looking to learn about the Mormon faith and the layout of Salt Lake City. As a long time true crime book fan, I was very disappointed by about page 37 and I would not recommended this book.  OH, and about the "gripping" photos - not so gripping! The only photo of Lori was a picture of her missing person flyer.  I thought that was cheesy.  The only photo of Mark is his mugshot.
