Extremely disappointing.  This is one of the most boring little books ever written.  If you are from New Orleans, you already know about local po-boy shops and the Mardi Gras Indians, etc.  If you're not, Piazza doesn't do a good enough job explaining the background of New Orleans customs and cultures.  It's all bread pudding and no reality of Hurricane Katrina.  This is such a short little book it shouldn't even have been published except perhaps in a local magazine.  Don't waste your time
