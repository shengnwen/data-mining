George G.M. Jones knows not a thing about real history. Claiming that the Great Library of Alexandria is where Aristotle took his knowledge is ludacris because the library was built by Ptolemy II. The Ptolemic line was the successor line in Egypt. Alexander, himself was crowned pharaoh by the people because they saw him as a liberator of Egypt. The priests of Egypt viewed him as the son of Zeus. These priests were of the god Ammon who were told at his oracle. The Egyptian Mysterey System was a creation of white men and is a proven hoax. The first Greek philosophers most likely had some knowledge of Babylonian and Egyptian thought they added reasoning, something none existant in Egyptian or Babylonian thought. Even saying that ancient Egyptians were all black is wrong, as the people of Egyptian constituted a mixture of races. They were black and white. They were in fact Semites, like the Jews and Arabs, people who are Caucasian. Skin color alone does not tell a man's race. An Indian from India is in reality Caucasian, making him closer to Europeans than the Japanese or Chinese. Even most the languages of India and Iran are Indo-European, while the Basque live in France and Spain but speak a language isolate. If the Greeks stole anything from anyone it was the Phoneicians and their alphabet, something that is the ancestor to the Greek, Latin, Etruscan, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets. The name Kemet was a reference to the black soil of Egypt. Today it is called Misr anyways.
