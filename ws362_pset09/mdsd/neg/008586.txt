This is a prescriptive work aimed at helping church leaders focus on the right things.  As with any prescriptive work, how helpful the book is depends on where YOU are coming from.  If you are coming from the same place as the author (white suburban/rural America) then I think this is a helpful book with important insights!

If you come from an Urban area or a very multiethnic/multicultural city, then you should probably read critically, and with extra care.  The author's use of the word "culture" is broad and, in some senses, a bit uninformed.

The chapters are a series of topical sermons (even the chapter on the importance of expositional sermons!).  This is a format I don't particularly care for (unless the author is someone like D.M. Lloyd-Jones).  

Toward the end of the book it becomes clear that what the author is advocating is not so much the antithesis to church growth theology, but more of a wholistic model for church growth (ala Orlando Costas)
