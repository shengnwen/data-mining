I read a book called The Whipping Boy. It  was not very good. 
This story is about a prince who has a few problems. He is always gets in to trouble. Since the prince can never get hit, they have a whipping boy to get hit for him. The whipping boy gets hit about three to four times a day. The whipping boy's name is Jemmy. The prince's name is Brat. Jemmy and Prince Brat run away and get into a lot of trouble.

It was vary confusing and hard to keep up with. My mind was drifting around. I would give this book a 1 out of 5 because it was not very good. It was kind of stupid.

The only way you would be able to like this book is if you like stupid books. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It seems like a good book from the cover. The first few chapters are good. But then it gets really boring. After every chapter it got really confusing
