I bought this  book hoping that it would investigate today's financially status oriented world. In this task the book starts off quite well reviewing Nixon's visit to Russia.

The biggest problem I have with this book is that it drifts off the subject to look at how status has  been covered by other authors and artists.

To me, the book, particularly with its enumerated layout, reads more like someone who's written a ph.D thesis and desperately wants to cover those things that  someone reviewing it would be impressed to see, throwing in a few graphs for good measure. Unfortunately to the layperson it is very hard to get through. For example at the end of the section on philosophy it reads "To heed the misanthropic philosophical council we must surrender our puerile obsession with policing our own status..." Yeah, right!

De Botton doesn't really seem to be writing for the reader, more for himself, and a very intellectual audience, who probably will nod and agree with everything he says, because they too are impressed they know so much too.

It's a shame that the book has turned out how it has as I think the subject would have made an entertaining read if written in a different style.

I was going to give it one star, but De Botton has clearly researched his subject well whic earns it an extra star, but don't expect to learn anything you don't know already
