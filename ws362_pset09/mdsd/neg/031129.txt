I picked up this book because of the title alone.  I was interested in learning yoga, and this book seemed to be a good place to start.  Boy, was I wrong.  If you are new to the world of yoga and meditation, I do not recommend this book.  The first reviewer of this was correct in calling this book &quot;ancient.&quot;  This writing is from another world.  Foot notes on top of foot notes.  Definitions of words and phrases cram the pages, sometimes taking up half the page.  This book is written more like a text book than a how to book.  The author is more interested in presenting his research findings of the work, than helping to explain the text in language we can understand.  And you can not read straight through any of the so called instructions given in this book.  You get to a certain step, and you are told to turn to another page in the book, which in turn points you toward a footnote, which gives you a definition of a word from the original page.  The author was to busy trying to show all the research he did, he forgot to enlighten us as to the conclusions of his work.  Check out &quot;Integral Yoga Hatha&quot; for a much more clear and easy to understand way to practice yoga
