I purchased this sorry excuse for a guide book knowing full well my options for guide books to Iceland were limited, and a few kilometers outside of Akureyri I pitched it out the window of my rental car in shear frustration.  For such a tiny country with a population about the size of Anchorage, Alaska (approx 300,000) readers would think the book might be a bit more comprehensive and up to date. The most current edition is two years old, and apparently a lot has changed in those two years, i.e. the Icelandic Phallogical Museum has been moved from Rekyjavik to Husavik. I found more helpful advice and information from on-line encyclopedias, the tourist information booths, and from word of mouth from other travellers. This book is excellent if you want suggestions about what to see and do, but I suggest you thoroughly research your selections from alternative sources before setting off on an adventure. I repsected and even liked the television show Lonely Planet on the Travel Channel (now called Globe Trekker) but I will never purchase another guide book from that name ever again
