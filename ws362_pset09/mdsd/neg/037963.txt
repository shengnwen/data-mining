Having read books 1-6, I can confirm that these History books are quite terrible. Often events are told out of order, especially in the stories of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. The faulty chronology is very confusing when reading the books. Furthermore, the series are intended for elementary or middle school students, and making it available for such a wide spectrum makes it seem very condescending for those at the higher age range. For example, when describing latitude and longitude, she says to think of the world as a big fat man with a belt around his waist (i.e. the equator). Hakim weaves multi-culti fables, saying that the Americans got their ideas about what to put in the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation from the Iroquios League. That is absurd. Our system of government is based off of Athens, the Roman Republic, English law (minus that whole monarchy business), the republic of Venice, and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. She states that "some historians" think there may have been as many as 75 million indians (beg pardon, "The First Americans") pre-Columbus, but fails to give a bottom estimate, giving the impression that Europeans wiped out all the Amerindians. All in all, the books are inaccurate, misleading, and demeaning
