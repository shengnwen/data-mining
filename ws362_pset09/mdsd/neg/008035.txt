I had been using the 13th edition of Jeff Hermann's writer's guide. I found it quite useful and relied on the index heavily. Since 2002 many of the addresses were no longer up-to-date. I purchased the 2006 edition to get more recent information. To my dismay I discovered that the 2006 Edition has no index whatever! An 806 page guide with no index is of limited value to me
