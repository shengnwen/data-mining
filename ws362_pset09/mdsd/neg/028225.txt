Ryrie writes with zero academic integrity.  He proof texts throughout the book.  When quoting from his "go-to Covenant Theologian, Louis Berkhof, he twists his words to mean whatever he wants them to mean.  For example, Ryrie quotes Berkhoff as implying two ways of salvation in the OT, and when he quotes Berkhof, he quotes him in a section where Berkhof describes Dispensationalism.  A few sentences later Berkhof actually says "This representation is contrary  to Scripture, which does not represent fallen man as still on probation, but as an utter failure, totally unable to render obedience to God, and absolutely dependent on the grace of God for salvation" (p. 291).  This part of Berkhof's section was not quoted.  Ryrie also proof texts Acts 21:21 to back his claim of "the proper apostasy from Judaism to Christ".  You read the context for yourselves.  

Aside from these mortal sins of the academy, Ryrie's overall tone is one of condescension and arrogance, and his teaching is wrong and dangerous
