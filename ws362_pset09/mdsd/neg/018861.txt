I'm an architect and was very much looking forward to this book as I am a fervent believer that bigger is not better.  I am always searching for good examples of how to do things as efficiently as possible, which produces a better design and ultimately costs less.  People do not need 3000 square feet houses.

I got this book for christmas and am very disappointed.
First, the editing is terrible.  There are literally pages that are marked "lower floor plan" & "upper floor plan" which are blank.

Secondly, the majority of these houses are architectural follies.  They are not "houses" in the meaning that most of us mean when we say house.  They are playhouses - art lofts, guest houses, vacation houses, etc.  How we live in a structure for a few hours of pleasurable work each day and how we live in our actual house varies greatly.  How many of us recreate our same lives while we are on vacation?  That is the whole problem with this book.  It should rightly be called "Expensive architectural follies under 1500 square feet."

In reviewing this book there is nothing that will inform you how to live in a smaller space.  There is nothing that will redefine the idea of house.

That being said there are some very nice pavillions.
