J. Michael Veron apparently sat down to write The Greatest Player Who Never Lived in the same manner a trial lawyer would write a closing argument.  He tells us what he's going to say, then he says it, then he sums up what he just said.  There was very little tension in the story, only piles of documents to sift through along with the main character.  It is at times laborious reading with a pleasant twist at the end.  Golf fanatics and lawyers (who play golf) will enjoy it.  Otherwise skip this tiresome read
