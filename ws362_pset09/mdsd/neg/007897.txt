It's clear that Mr. Goldberg is hurt by his personal and professional troubles with CBS and Dan Rather.  It is made even clearer by the fact that he constantly brings it up over and over again throughout most of this book.  

This "book", for being written by someone who is outraged over the media bias, is incredibly unprofessional, full of hyperbole, personal rants, and very little decorum.  If Goldberg wants to convince us that the media has a liberal slant, he would be much better off keeping his own opinions to himself and write a centered book based on facts.  BIAS feels like a personal vendetta against Rather, against CBS, and I suspect that Goldberg had some aspirations for greatness in his return to CBS, was denied, and, in turn, wrote this scathing book as revenge
