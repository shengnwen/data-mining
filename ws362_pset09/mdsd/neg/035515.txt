Mr. Lomas & company takes another crack at the Hiram Matrix, among the trilogy of Hiram books he has written [The Hiram Key] and [The Book of Hiram]being the other two, this one is not as good as "The Book of Hiram" however it is much better than the "Hiram Key". I guess it comes down to opinion and conjecture with a dash of conspiracy, at best. Maybe Mr. Lomas and company would like to tackle another aspect of Freemasonry, perhaps with better results. Two recommendations on the subject would be "African Origins of Freemasonry" (2005) by Zachary Gremillion and "The Huevolution of Sacred Muur Science Past and Present" (2005) by Noble Timothy Myers-El
