  I'll start by saying that I am a huge fan of Fantasy novels, but this 'crux' of Fantasy literature really disappointed me.
  This book has a lot of faults. To begin with, it goes against the first basic rule of writing a book: show don't tell. As you start the novel, it tells everything and nothing has been shown. Tolkein has just narrated almost everything, starting from the history to the setting, and this gives the novel a feeling as if a child has written it.
  Secondly, the book is just too slow. I mean you just start the 1st chapter and you doze off after a couple of pages. The pace might have been fine for the 50's but it's just too slow for the double Os!
  I don't know why other people liked the plot so much, but I think the plot was really really weak. The causality in the story is almost non-existant and that is what makes the difference between a jumble of short stories joined loosely together and a good novel.
  Lastly, the characters could have been much developed with more life in them than mere puppets bound to do the author's bidding. The chracters are much more Archetyped than they should have been.
  Overall, I think that it has gotten more attention than it deserved, perhaps because of the movies, and that people are liking it because of some trend or the like
