It took me a couple months to get through this book.  Although there are many interesting clips [from the author's magazine interviews over the years], the book does not hang together.  It appears that the author attempted to weave the stories together into some kind of themes, by decade: but there is really no &quot;greater insight&quot; provided.  I would have preferred to read an anthology of more in-depth commentaries on a few female artists.  I also found Ms. Hirshey's ornate writing style to be difficult reading
