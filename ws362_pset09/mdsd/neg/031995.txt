After reading Clan of the Cave Bear, which was the best book we've read in ages, my wife and I were excited for the sequel.

We should have read the back of the book. Then we would have known that the series went from a historically intriguing social commentary to (what looks like) a completely cheesy romance with pointless archeological details wedged unfcomfortably in wherever they might (or might not) fit. 

I have to admit, we didn't get beyond page 29, where the improbably tall, hale male protaganists of the story (2 guys with names that would get any real cave man killed) were each trying to get some nookie.

The dialogue? It was horrible! In the first book Auel was able to convey the sign language of the neanderthals very believably. This book was ridiculous though. Every time somebody said something (and as far as we got, it was 99% witless banter between the male protaganists), he had to say the name of the fellow he was talking to first.  

On the verge of giving up on the book I read the back, looking for a scrap of hope. Hm the female protaganist captures and raises a pony. Okay I think I can swallow that. Wait, then she finds and raises a cave lion cub? What is this -- Dr. Doolittle? Maybe I can take it. Wait, then ... she finds ... Love! That nailed it. We didn't pick up Clan of the Cave Bear for its romantic potential, we picked it up hoping for a realistic fictionalization of a very interesting time -- and that's what we got. We were foolish enough to assume the sequel would be a continuation of that style. It really was like a different person wrote it. Somebody with much less talent.

To see how far this book has fallen from the first is just heart breaking
