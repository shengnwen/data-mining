This book is not a parody.  It is a waste of space.  I'm glad this was printed on recycled paper.  I was offended - as were most of the people in the counseling center where I work.  We didn't even want to donate it because someone else might read it. Men should avoid leather because people will think they are gay or mentally unstable?  Women must wear short skirts with a slit? Do not waste your time
