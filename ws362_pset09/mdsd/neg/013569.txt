This book presents itself as a "basic worldview catalog."  While it does cover many of the major themes it is heavily tainted by the authors inability to see things from anything but a Christian perspective.

A quote from the end of the book says it all in my mind: "In terms of possible worldviews, our options are numerous but, as we have seen, limited.  Of those we have investigated, all but theism were found to have serious flaws."

While no worldview is perfect, to not see the flaws in theism requires a very blinkered view of the world and this shows its self again and again through the book.

If you want to read something that tells you why Christianity is the best worldview there is - go ahead and buy it.  If you want something more objective I would look elsewhere.
