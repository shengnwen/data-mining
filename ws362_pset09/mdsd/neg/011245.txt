In 'Guided Tours of Hell', Prose provokes disgust at Landau and annoyance with his unreal pettiness and insecurity, somewhat interesting on its own merit.  She brings up much more compelling and disturbing concepts of  sensationalism and exploitation of an event like the Holocaust, which,  mixed with Landau's preoccupations, make for an interesting combination.    The second story was a disappointment.  Any interest lingering from 'Guided  Tours of Hell' disappeared once I started 'Three Pigs in Five Days'.   Prose, throw us a bone!  The idea of a man messing with his woman's mind is  interesting for a few pages, but our heroine is too abjectly pathetic.  A  joyless and tiresome read
