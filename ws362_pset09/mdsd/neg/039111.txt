I bought this book for a friend who is looking to buy her first boat.  My decision to buy this particular book was based to a large extent upon the positive reviews that had been posted.  Upon receiving and reading the book, however, I was fairly shocked that it had been rated so highly. 
I know how to sail, but even if I didn't, I would still be a little insulted by the child-like, basic level of the material.  I might buy this for my 9 year old son who is just being introduced to sailing - it would be appropriate at this level. However, I can't imagine this book being useful to anyone with any basic understanding of sailing, and certainly not useful for a person who possesses the necessary level of knowledge to even be considering buying a boat. If you need to read the part about "How do I make the boat go", save the $11 you would spend on this book and either take a basic dinghy sailing course or buy a truly educational book on the subject.  
I'm glad that other buyers were satisfied with their purchase of this book - however, I immediately returned mine
