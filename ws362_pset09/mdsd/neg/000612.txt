- Bentley's 'Programming Pearls' offers many programming techniques and design principles.
- But the text assumes that the reader is *extremely* familiar with C-style syntax and many advanced computer science concepts.

While Bentley emphasizes important fundamentals, his language is rather esoteric.

I bought this book because Steve McConnell ('Code Complete' author) recommends it for 'beginner' developers at his company (Construx Software); but I encourage 'beginner' developers (and even senior developers) to look elsewhere.

This book is meant for computer science graduate students. It incorporates more advanced math and more advanced computer science techniques than the average software developer will ever encounter.

Most of 'Programming Pearls' was penned before the widespread use of object-oriented programming; so Bentley heavily emphasizes code tuning. In today's world, most .NET and J2EE developers are likely to find greater efficiencies within their architectural design.

- Developers who need to either learn or revisit important fundamentals should read Steve McConnell's 'Code Complete'
