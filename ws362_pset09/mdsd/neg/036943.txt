Poorly edited book by an individual who is very knowledgeable on the subject.  Book would benefit greatly by the use of color photos (why black & white in this day and age?).

Fraught with misspellings and generally a good cure for insomnia.  The info is there, but it's not an enjoyable way to get it.  Book has interesting testimonials from famous Gretsch owners. As a reference work, it stops too soon.  Later company history and products not covered. The author obviously knows his subject, but a decent editor would have made a "ho-hum" book a real "Must Read".
