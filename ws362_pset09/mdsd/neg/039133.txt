If you want an excellent biography on Bill Evans, pick up a copy of &quot;How My Heart Sings&quot;.  This book pales in comparison, but it is not without its merits.  It has excellent photographs and is well-organized.  The analysis of the music is rather subjective and unclear.  The writing style is dry and does not flow well.  Others have found several factual errors.  If you're interested in good pictures and a rough overview of Evans, &quot;Everything Happens to Me&quot; is worth picking up
