I expected to find this book stimulating and informative, but came away feeling that Dennett is vastly overrated and quite ordinary in his thought process, logical skills, and writing.  This book does not explain or offer a theory on -- as its title promises -- what consciousness is; it merely offers a lot of random observations on and stories about consciousness.  Dennett seems to start everything he writes somewhere in the middle of a conversation he has been having with himself; he doesn't know how to properly introduce a topic to the reader.  He begins the book not with an overview of his subject or a presentation of a thesis, but with a chapter on hallucinations -- a very specific area of consciousness.  I indulged it with the expectation that it would provide an entry point into a broader argument he wished to advance; instead it was just the first in a random string of narratives.  

I suggest that in lieu of Dennett's writings on consciousness, one read John Searle or Robert Ornstein.  Or if you want an engaging, conversational style of writing on the subject, look into Oliver Sacks.
