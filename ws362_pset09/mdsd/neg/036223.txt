I will agree that this is good source of overall view of the certain aspects of art history--the western side. It's always been quite an amusement for me to see books claiming to be  a History of Art book and only include the WESTERN History of Art. It seems these historians have forgotten just how influential EASTERN art has been in forming these WESTERN artists. The Jansons book is no exception. Quite disappointment, and I wouldn't have had much to complain, if they hadn't started the book with a grand &quot;What is Art?&quot;, intending to quite obviously to include all arts.. oops, forgot to do your homework there Jansons
