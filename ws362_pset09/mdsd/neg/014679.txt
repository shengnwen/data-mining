The addresses and phone numbers in this book are handy, but this is not the way to find an agent or publisher. Instead, visit the largest bookstore in your area and take a look at the books they sell that are in your genre. Look in the "Acknowledgments" section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author's agent and the book's editor. Those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published. Find those people using an online white pages or yellow pages site (anywho.com, dogpile.com, etc.) and give them a call. If they are receptive to your idea, send them a formal proposal. 
I have to agree with those who have suggested that publication of a book like this by someone in the business smacks of exploitation. As one other reviewer noted, the author is an agent - call him up and see how receptive he is to you. You might as well try looking for Elvis in the supermarket.
