Honestly ladies, don't you think that most men know better than to stay with a "bad girl?" Sadly, Tuttle has given you the worst advice possible. 

The facts are these.  Your rights are guaranteed by the US Constitution...everything else you get is a privilege.  Your family has to put up with you--for everyone else, it's merely an option. Like "The Script" here is yet another tome geared to the women of the "chick lit" crowd who can host a dinner party and manage a career, but won't make a move concerning a mate unless they consult "Dr. Phil" beforehand.  Here is yet another excuse for the $1.00 remainder bin at Borders Books. 

Sweetness goes a long way...and using sex as an incentive to get what you want is fine, but don't be surprised when it backfires on you and you're burned.   

And one wonders why the author, slightly shy of 40, is still unmarried....I am not surprised.
