With the publication this fall of Koen's Dark Angels, I looked forward to reading the book that started it all, Through A Glass Darkly.  While this book is a fast, easy read, I didn't see what a lot of the other reviewers saw in this book.

Not that it isn't entertaining.  TAGD is a historical romance, but when comparing Koen to writers such as Phillipa Gregory and even Jean Plaidy, Koen's book seems transparent and fluffy.  Her characters are somewhat unsympathetic and seem to lack basic common sense at times.  Its hard to like anybody in this book as many of the characters seem to fall into stereotypes, i.e. the wronged woman, the doting matriarch, the wicked mother.  Also, some of the plot twists are so obvious in coming, i.e. "one man's dark secret."

Yes, the book is a fun beach read type of work.  But, don't be disappointed if you come to this book and realize that it just doesn't have the emotional connectivity to character like other books, such as The Constant Princess or The Other Boleyn Girl. Read it for the intrigues, like an episode of Dynasty, but don't expect to come away feeling for the main character
