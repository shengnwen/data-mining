I suppose some people think that one can write anything in a book and call it "history."  But I think Smith's portrayal of the conflict is just too misleading to be called history.  Real people in real life do real things for real reasons.  But after reading this book, I had an image of wicked unarmed Zionists maliciously stealing land from hapless heavily armed Arabs.  It wasn't exactly what Smith had said.  But it was close enough to make me realize what was wrong with the book.  The constant whitewashing of Arab misdeeds and criticism of reasonable Jewish behavior had simply erased the motivations for the two sides in the conflict.

Are there books that do a better job?  Oh yes.  I'll give you ten examples of books that are far better, and there are many, many more:

The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Middle East Conflict (Bard, 2003)
A History of Israel (Sachar, 1996)
The Siege (O'Brien, 1986)
A Young Person's History of Israel (Bamberger, 1985)
The Rape of Palestine and the Struggle for Jerusalem (Casper, 2003)
Atlas of the Middle East Conflict (Gilbert, 2002)
Islam and Dhimmitude (Ye'or, 2002)
Right to Exist (Lozowick, 2003)
A Place Among Nations (Netanyahu, 1993)
From Time Immemorial (Peters, 1984)

Try one of them.
