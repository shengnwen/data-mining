Well, I have never been too impressed with this atlas. I fell in love with the beautiful Benchmark &amp; rarely look back. The dirt roads in Delorme look like hiking trails, the book splits California into 2 sections, paper is weak quality. It will do in a pinch, but I would rather have my 'REAL map book'
