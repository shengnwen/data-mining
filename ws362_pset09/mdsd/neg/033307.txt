To me, this book is the work of a bitter old man. He seems to be making a pointless argument -- his vision of class struggle anarchism is outdated. Further, it reads more like an extended diatribe that latte-chugging cafe  radicals could snap their fingers to, rather than something for outsiders.  The strident tone of the book doesn't help, either. I give it two stars  because it does help you realize why anarchists devote so much time to  in-fighting. But Bookchin's age, this may be the last book he churns out,  and it's an unfortunate note to go out on
