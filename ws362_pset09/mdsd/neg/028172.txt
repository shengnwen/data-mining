The best part about this book was the intro.  In fact all you need to understand what the late Mr. Bloom was trying to put forth is in the introduction.

The rest of the book is  a chore to read.  The confusing and tedious writing  style leads to a lot of re-reading of sentences to figure out the point the author is trying to make.  Someone should have counseled Mr. Bloom that "Brevity is the soul of wit."
