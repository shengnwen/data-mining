I had read glowing reviews of this book and expected more than I got when I read it myself.  Disappointment is often a function of expectations and reality being out of synch and I think that was the source for me here.  It's not that it's a bad book, but I didn't get the DEPTH of information I was expecting.  After going through the design and build process a couple of times, I felt as thought I already knew what was broadly covered in this book.    Also, I was disappointed in the photo layouts.  Like another reviewer here, I found the spaces to be pretty impractical for living in
