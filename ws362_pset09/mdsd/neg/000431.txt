I am a family member of one of victims and I am offended by the inside thoughts into the crimes and the personal thoughts of the victims and of the offender. There is NO way that the authors could have privy to the thoughts and feelings of the victims and am offended by what was written about our loved ones.  Mustasfa did not speak and obtain permission from all family members to be included in her book. I find the publication to be offensive to all of the victims and added unnecessary stress to those close to the victims.  I would not recommend purchase of this book
