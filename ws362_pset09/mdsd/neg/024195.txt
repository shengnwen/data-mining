In my opinion this book is very inappropriate; especially since it is geared towards 9-12 year olds. It is condescending towards Nirvana. It is biased and states mostly the problems of Kurt Cobain. As it says on the back of the book, "Stories of the ups and downs of rock music fame will intrigue rock music fans." The only thing that intrigues me was that there were no "ups" about Kurt Cobain in this book
