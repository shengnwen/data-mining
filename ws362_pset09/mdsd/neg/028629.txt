All you need to know about this book is that Alston Chase has a vendetta against the Park Service.  Chase is correct that the Park Service's vision of, and policies for, Yellowstone have changed over time, and have  frequently been inconsistent, sometimes silly, and sometimes destructive.   But he doesn't grant any leniency for the fact that the earlier, most  destructive, policies occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.   And after all, the Park Service is a government agency - who in their right  mind could be surprised that they've made mistakes?  Most important, he  damns both the early policy of active management and the present policy of  letting most things happen naturally.  It's clear that no action of the  Park Service could ever satisfy Chase, because he doesn't really know what  he wants.  Chase has no substantive alternative management policy to  propose - he's simply one of those annoying people (and we all know some of  them) who never have anything helpful to say but are always quick to  criticize
