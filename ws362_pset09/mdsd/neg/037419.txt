Photography is gorgeous, however, do the recipes work? I've tried the "Bouchons" (chocolate corks), a simple recipe: they were worse than  mediocre and looked nothing like the photo (I am an experienced baker, BTW). At least they were edible. Which recipes have the other reviewers tried and had succes with? I would like to try more of the other recipes, however, do not want to waste my time...it is interesting that several reviewers admit to having not even tried the recipes and one reviewer pans three of them!
