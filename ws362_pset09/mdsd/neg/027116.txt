This is one of my favorite PKD books, so as far as a review of the story itself, it is incredible.  A must have for every seeker in the cosmos.

Now, having said that, I bought this edition, and was saddened deeply that it is unreadable.  There is a huge portion of the story which is missing altogether, (perhaps 10 - 15 pages?), and in it's place is some modern political essay about the European economy.  A publisher's mistake, I'm sure, but I can't have the only one like this.  If you can find a different edition or version of this book, then by all means buy it.  Then it would be 5 stars rather than 0 stars.
