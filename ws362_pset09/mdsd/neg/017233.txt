I don't believe that God would have anything to do with this man. It's time to get un-programmed, America. Start thinking outside of your cage and see this man for what he is - a patron of evil. Mr. Bush has successfully passed the so-called "Patriot Act" that can and eventually will take away your God-given unalienable rights. How many rights will you loose before you draw your line in the sand? He has no regard for the Constitutional Republic that this country was founded on, instead he insists on a Democracy. Spying on Americans is OK with Mr. Bush. Our borders are left unguarded while our children die in a war for oil. Mr. Bush has said that "it would be easier if this were a dictatorship, as long as I'm the dictator". That statement when heard is chilling to say the least. Would God inspire a man to say something like that? I strongly doubt it. Wake up America! We're being led down the road to tyranny by this man! Don't support him by buying this book. Buy a bible instead.
