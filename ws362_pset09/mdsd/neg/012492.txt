I truly cannot tell you how much I wish I'd read more reviews before buying this trash. 

I, like other reviewers, love zombies.  I'm talking classic zombies, lumbering around moaning and searching for brains.  When a book says to me, "hey buy me I've got ZOMBIES!  Come on you love zombies, look at me I've got like 300 pages and they're PACKED with zombies!" and then 10 pages in I get "lol surprise we're talking and organizing and SHOOTING GUNS AND DRIVING CARS HURRR" it's unforgivable.

The book is an interesting read (for trite, contrived writing that's not even up to the 
"standards" of S.D. Perry's Resident Evil books, which is pretty shameful) but...ugh I want to slap Brian Keene.  Brian Keene, you owe me five bucks, and I'm not kidding
