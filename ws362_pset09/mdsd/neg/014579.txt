A perusal of this book reminds me of a UK television show on which James "The Amazing" Randi, pretending to be a "medium," brilliantly and devastingly showed just how easy it is to be fooled by those who claim to talk to our dead relatives for us.  It seems that the need to believe, the craving to hang on and not let go, is powerful enough to bypass logic and rational thinking in our poor benighted species.  I would urge anyone considering laying out their hard-earned money to this or other "mediums" to do a little research into the "cold reading" trick and how it works.  There are many ways to deal with grief and loss that do not involve superstition, credulity or hefty amounts of cash.
