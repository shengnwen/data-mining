This is a beautiful board in theory.  I like the concept of the angel markers in various colors, along with the crystal dice.  Therein lies the problem. I don't see where tiny dots on a pair of dice can ever correspond to an honest answer, unless of course one knows how to divine with dice.  Divination with dice should be the ultimate objective of Angel Guidance, with a transition to oracle cards or some such for additional clarification if need be.  Unfortunately, this board is not designed this way.

This board fails the moment the holder of the dice is meant to use the number of dots to move the marker several paces up a chart of words and phrases.  Divination then becomes a game, and that game is not always fun.  The answers do not always fit the questions.  It can be like forcing a square peg into a round hole.  Some answers may be too general or too sugar coated.  The holder of the dice may have additional questions, or may find the need to problem solve.  The author has left no room for any additional clarification on issues that may arise after a marker lands on any word or phrase.  Unlike tarot, there are no symbols or pictures to interpret.  It's just simple words that fall flat.  The provided guide book is of little help either.  Yikes!  I will give this two stars, only because I like the crystal dice.  My advice?  Learn how to divine with dice and go from there.  Toss out the so called board.  It's crap
