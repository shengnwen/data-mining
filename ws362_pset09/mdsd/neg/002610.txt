Now, I'll admit to leaning libertarian myself, but I really really did try to give this book a chance.  But at the end of the day, the book is an attack without an argument, and with very little analysis.  The book is premised on the idea that practically everyone in the tech industry is a "libertarian"... which, in the author's caricature, means some sort of selfishness-celebrating Ayn Randroid.  As far as I can tell, she's not very familiar with libertarian ideas (against which there are various good arguments to be made... but she apparently didn't care to learn enough about the ideas to make them) and mostly resorts to amateur psychologizing, and insinuating that libertarians are just nasty people.  What facts do make it into the book aren't even very carefully checked (she says something about the Cato Institute having been around since the 60s...)      So I guess if you already dislike libertarians and want something to chuckle along to, this is OK.  If you want a serious critical examination of (and attack on) libertarian ideas, though, try Will Kymlicka's "Contemporary Political Philosophy" which has a chapter on them.  This little tome is about as reasonable as a Rush Limbaugh screed.  Or maybe those Jack Chick religious pamphlets which show liberals scheming about how to destroy Christianity through satanic rock music
