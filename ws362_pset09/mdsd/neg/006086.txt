This is very strange stuff considering that this should have been a self-serving vehicle for Moose, but time and again he portrays himself in the worst possible light. He describes himself as being impossibly oversensitive to handle the stress of his job or even daily life, with a history of hysterical screaming public outbursts over the slightest frustration. Plus, he seems endlessly disillusioned, bitter, and strangley surprised about how routine functions of local government don't live up to his idealized visions. Not someone I'd want to work for or even be around
