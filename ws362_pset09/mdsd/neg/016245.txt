Hello to everyone who reads my review of this book. First of all for those of you who will need a TI-86 calculator which this book calls for, dont worry about because doesnt even tell you how to use it for certain applications such as Super Mesh, Method Analysis and so on. I had to go to a student who was in a College Algebra class to learn how to use this calculator for this book! Second my professor shows better examples on solve the problems in the book which the book makes it so confusing. You have to ask the professor to show several examples to learn what the book is covering. I would suggest to professors and the Director/Chairman as a student, look for a book that you can use in the class other than this where students can learn from and not become so confused over the material to where almost every student in the class has to ask the professor several questions about the topic and meet with him one on one. I am speaking for other students by the way. I am also helping the professors also. Get a book that students can learn from instead of a one on one discusssion with the professor. Some thing else other than this book! Thanks for your time reading my review. ~Scott
