My mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into Christianity. 

I tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible. It was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book. In my personal opinion, the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on many occasions, this seems to be his only method of proving that the "Bible Code" does in fact, exist. 

Not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in God or prophecies.' This gets very tiring. Drosnin does not provide solid evidence, no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms. The author kills his credibility on repeated occasions. 

Overall, I found this to be an interesting read, but the author's arguements were not convincing enough for me.
