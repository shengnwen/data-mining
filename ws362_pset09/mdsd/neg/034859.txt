While the subject matter was good, the writing style was lacking.  Plus, I don't think she applies the same level of high-mindedness to herself as she does to other people.  She seems to like to cut down trees but then complains later about flooding from upgradient homeowners that have cut down their trees.  Also, she drowns possums.  She complains that she raises her food to live on and she can't spare any to varmints.  I'm not sure what she thinks the possum was eating the food for.  I suspect to live on.  And some of her arguments don't hold water.  Like the vegetarian argument mentioned earlier.  THis book could have used better editing.
