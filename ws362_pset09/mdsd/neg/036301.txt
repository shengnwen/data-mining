It is apparent that the first premise in Peck's book is that in order for humans to be a whole being, one must grow through spirituality (or enlightenment) attained through "grace" with the main purposes of gaining "capacity and understanding of serendipity" (309) and through "spiritual evolution, whereby people grow towards godhood" (270) and "become God" (283).  

The second premise is that if a person is to be a complete being, one must possess a certain amount of "freedom" and grow in the capacity of love.  Freedom can be through several avenues such as sexual "self-expression and exploration" (147).  

Peck's premises are secular in nature, mainly concentrating on one's self.  He confuses the true God with a man-made form of a god.  Peck instructs readers not to conform to a particular religion, but inundates them with own "religion," which is a mixture of pseudo-Christian philosophies, Eastern mysticism, and post-modern thoughts.  One of the ways he does this is by quoting Bible verses out of context.  

Peck's version of love is a free-for-all deficient of morality and decency.  Sexual intimacy is devoid of commitment through a covenant marriage, and reduces it to a spontaneous animalistic act.  In fact, love is his excuse for sexual transgression of the therapist-client relationship.  

It is a sad situation in our society when Peck's book becomes a bestseller.  A "road less traveled" offers what the general population desires to hear: find your own way and do as you please.
