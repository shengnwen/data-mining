Ok, so I figured that a book called "Secrets of Halo 2" might be cool, and show me some secrets that I haven't found yet (there are a lot out there). Instead what I got was this piece of ....

First off, out of the whole book, only about 6 pages are actually about Halo 2, and those are just a walkthrough of campaign.  The rest of the book contains a history of first person shooters, and, get this, hints and cheats for OTHER games.  If I wanted to know about Half Life 2, I would have bought a book on Half Life 2. Oh, and for those really old school fans, there's a quick walkthrough of Halo as well.

Even if I knew what this book was going to be, I would say avoid it.  It has more crappy screenshots, and over used strategies (example: Remember that you can duel wield in Halo 2), then you can shake a stick at.

Avoid buying this book.  Save your money for Halo 3
