Unfortunately, I am beginning to see the results of Miss Liedloff's views on raising children in my grandchildren. I feel sorry for them.

Miss Liedloff was ashamed to admit to the Indians in South America that where she comes from 'women do not feel capable of raising children until they read the instructions written in a book by a strange man.' She does, however, want you to accept the views of a strange woman who has never had children and whose only direct experience comes from 'parenting' an anteater(!) and allowing a small monkey to sleep with her. She assumes that her views derived from analyzing mentally disturbed patients can be applied to all mothers in this country. 

Modestly, she lets us know that Dior wanted her to model - but she refused, although Vogue also managed to snag her for a short period. The idea of the 'jungle' fascinated her, and when she arrived in South America she observed a perfect, primitive society not as an anthropologist, but rather as an impressionable tourist. In this perfect society when things go wrong people laugh. The only people who cause problems are those who stupidly have left the tribe and have had contact with civilization. Unfortunately, they even learn a few words of Spanish. Children, even when they are old enough only to crawl, understand danger and do not need supervision. 

Miss Liedloff knows why people take drugs, what causes homosexuality, and of course how to raise children.

Please look elsewhere on how to raise children
