a friend of mine recommended this book a while ago and i decided to give it a try. what a waste of time! after a so-so start it dissolves into a silly, improbable, absolutely unbelievable mess, the conclusion being particularly stupid  and unrealistic. if you want to do yourself a favour, stay with patricia highsmith instead
