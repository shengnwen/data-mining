Maybe it was the editing or the translation, but this book was a long and frustrating waste of time.  

There was no spark in the writing, plot or characters.  It was as if everyone was either on Prozac or needed it!

I was really let down because the middle started getting more interesting so I kept reading, thinking it would finish strongly, but was disappointed.

Actually, the only reason I am writing this is because I was taken in by the many 4 and 5 star ratings and am pissed off that I was duped!!
