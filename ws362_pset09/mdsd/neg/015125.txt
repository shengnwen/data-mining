I was very dissappointed in this book.  I rec'd it for Christmas and actually asked my wife to send it back.  It a pictoral of 'showrooms' (not garages) of the filthy rich.  Cars that nobody but the owner can afford. Hardly a tool can be found.

I was looking for a book that would help be design or build a very 'usable' functioning garage for the space I had.

There is nothing normal or useful in this book.

Sorry
