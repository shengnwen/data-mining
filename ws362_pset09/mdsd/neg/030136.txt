If I could give this book a zero instead of a 1 I would happily do so.  It is a rare thing that we buy a book so bad that I would happily return it, were that not such a hassle.  This is one of the few.

Fisher's "The Great Wall of China" is a very poorly done book.  Rather than present a true history of the wall, Fisher invents a dialogue, one that is full of anger.  The illustrations are extremely dark.  The emperor looks like Mr. T, the people's expressions odd at best.  To make already bad matters worse, one illustration shows wall-builders being whipped.  On the same page, Fisher's states:  "Workers who complained or who ran away were caught and buried alive."

Absolutely unsuitable for children of any age with virtually no redeeming value
