I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please
