Fortunately, it has been a long time since I read anything this sappy, sophomoric and/or senseless.  Frankly, I'm amazed this series was published.  Adriana Trigiani is a harlequin romance writer at best (i.e. fabio visits the farm), and it's unlikely she'll ever produce literature of quality.  I left this book in a Portland coffee shop (on purpose), and it was still there when I returned two weeks later!  Go figure, eh?
