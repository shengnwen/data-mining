I just hate it when I spend money for a book that's had all kinds of glowing reviews and in no way lives up to the hype. Yes, Cornelia Read can write. No, this is not a book that deserves the praise that's been heaped upon it. Aside from the lamentably slow pacing, the book has such a weight of anachronistic dialogue that for anyone of an age, with a reasonably good memory, it's excruciating to keep coming across these clunkers. Dude! dates back to the 60s/70s, then fell out of use until recently. It certainly wasn't commonly used in the late 80s (when this book is set). Freakin'--as a substitute for a four-letter word I cannot write here did not come into popular usage until the 90s. The heroine's "voice" changes, depending upon her conversational partner--to such a wearying extent that it was painful to go through the changes. Madeline goes from sounding like a world-weary dowager, to a Valley Girl (like, totally!) in her exchanges with friend Ellis, to tough-girl shots with cousin Lap. Change after wearying change. It's one thing for a first-novelist to stumble, it's quite another for her editor, the copy-editor, and the proof-reader all to stumble with her. The blame for the endless discrepancies cannot be laid entirely at the author's feet. The lack of narrative drive and a likeable heroine ... something else again. It's a self-indulgent book, with clanging overtones of "clever me," and a lack of tension that makes the entire effort rather flabby. The author definitely has talent. It will be interesting to see if she can gather the discipline and determination to marshall her skills in more productive fashion next time out. For now, I'm like totally bummed, dude, that I spent my freakin' money on this book
