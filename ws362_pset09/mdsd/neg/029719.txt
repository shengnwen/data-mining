I really wanted to like this book, but could not stand the depiction of women. The wife is a real ball-buster, the lesbian character is basically insane, and the one female with a heart is constantly being mistreated by the main character -- an alcoholic with the emotional depth of a high schooler. He's a nasty bit of business, not someone I enjoyed spending time with.
