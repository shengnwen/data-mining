After reading this book I can only say that the author is selling something unreal , the figues he uses in the book are totally unrealistic . talking about 10 and 12 to 15 percent returns on investment , like they are the readers just for the taking .his advice reminds me of the old Steve Martin shtick on how to become a millionaire , Steve says " O.k. first you get a million dollars then..." 
This is basically what the author is saying, This book has no real pracital advice , It is just another author getting rich telling everyone else how to.Very disappointing , I would not waste my money if i were you .
