I have read many of Davis's other books (history, bible etc) and enjoyed them.  He combined homor/wit with useful and interesting insights and still managed to make each book educational. His writing was entertaining and I was inspired to investigate each topic further.   So, it was with great anticipation that I approached the mythology book, I have a long standing interest in archealogy and mythology, and was sadly disappointed.  I "don't know much about" what happened to Davis in this book but his writing seems to have lost along the way the very things that made him different.  This book was very dry and difficult to get through with little humor or novel insight.  If you want to read something this tough to tackle, try Bullfinch (still dry but more info).  Maybe he thought he needed to be a "serious" writer ... I don't know but I hope that whatever ails him is cured by his next book
