Dr Sears completely ignores the HUGE population of working mothers!  The book goes on and on and on about attachment parenting and how you should allow your child to disattach from you and not the other way around....well, the majority of the mother's in this world do not have this choice!  Furthermore, he made me feel as though I was a selfish mother for not carrying my daughter on my hip for the first year of her life.  My daughter is very attached to me and we have a very close relationship....yet I started back at work full time when she was 8 weeks old.  I feel that Dr Sears only addressing those mothers that stay at home full time and even then he cautions about leaving your child!  Easy for him to say!!!!
