Goodrich claims that Merlin was a Celtic Christian scientist, political advisor and religious leader. She may well be right. Indeed, I would like to think that she is right. But if I disagreed with her conclusions, her  arguments would not convince me. As other reviews of her writing have said,  it is full of non sequiters. I have a Ph.D. in religious studies, and teach  religion and philosophy. But I could not explain to a third party her  arguments for her conclusions. If you want some exposure to  ancient/medieval texts that bear on the identity of Merlin, this book might  be useful. But don't expect to come to any clear conclusion (for or against  her views) with the help of her writing. She mixes textual exposition and  argument without stating where one leaves off and another begins. The  reader is constantly wondering: is this what her sourse says?  Is it what  Goodrich THINKS it says? Is it evidence for her point of view? If so, how?  A tangle of confused writing
