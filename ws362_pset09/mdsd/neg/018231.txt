Seeing a few of the unrealistically rave reviews of this flawed novel reminds me to remind everyone how tainted the amazon reader review process is.  When anyone can review a book there's the chance that the authors publicist, best friend, next-door-neighbor, and even mother can write a glowing review.  I'm always suspicious of "best novel ever" reviews..
