The one thing I would say about the author is that I like the method of how he teaches: his method of tablature, etc. It is very easy to follow and so forth. However, what he teaches is a different story. As another reviewer noted, there is a LOT of 'filler' and stuff that don't much apply to learning the harp, and you learn so-callled 'popular' riffs that don't sound like anything. I honestly don't feel like I've learned much at all from this particlar book.
