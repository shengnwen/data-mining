Not only do the authors rant on and on about the demise of discipline in our society, they write as if they were still in junior high!  There were lots of little suggestions about what the authors do to be disciplined but they apparently grew up this way and have no idea how to explain this to others who've been less than disciplined most of their lives.  I also didn't like the bashing of the undisciplined; I thought the authors' mission was to teach discipline - they sure don't think much of people who don't have it.  Overall, a poorly written, negative, repetitive, uninformative book.  Just goes to show that anyone can start their own publishing company in order to publish their own propaganda!  And a tree was killed for this
