Paula is a woman who is way out of touch with reality and is just really looking to sell her own products. She does say that these are her opinions. A person's opinions mean very little to me because like rear ends everyone has one. And in Paula's case, her opinions mean nil. I tried some of the products from her line and found them to be quite blah. She really needs to tell people in her book not to buy the garbage she sells. The only way to find out if a product works for you or not is to get some samples and try it out. There is no mass recipe for skin care, it is trial and error. All skin is different and no two people are alike. Just because something works for a friend, doesn't mean it will work for you. And Paula ain't your friend so I don't know why anyone bothers to listen to her. She has drummed a nice profit out of her little books, emerging into her own website with products she has for sale. Wake up people
