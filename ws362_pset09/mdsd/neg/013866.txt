I have been studying Abraham Lincoln for nearly 40 years.  Burlingame is inaccurate in many of his statements about Lincoln and Mary Lincoln in particular and does not present all of the information about both of them.  Possibly his most faulty act is using William Herndon's information about Lincoln and Mary Lincoln.  Herndon and Mary Lincoln hated each other.  After Lincoln passed away, Herndon may have very well said things about Lincoln and her to hurt, degrade and disgrace Mary Lincoln.  Herndon is NOT to be trusted to be accurate much of the time.  Other very poor Lincoln authors are Weik, Sandburg, Gore Vidal, Lerone Bennett, Jr., Thomas DiLorenzo, Vincent Harding and Barbara Fields.  Their accuracy, interpretations and images are usually wrong and at times even bizarre.  If you want to read professionally researched, much more accurate material about Lincoln, read books by David Herbert Donald, Stephen Oates, Frank Williams, Mark Neely, Jr., Edward Steers, Jr. and Allen Guelzo
