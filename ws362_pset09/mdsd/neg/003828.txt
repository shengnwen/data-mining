Oh, my word, this book is simply terrible. We read it in my English class during my senior year of high school, and I absolutely hated it. I read it merely for the sake of my grade. It was difficult to visualize half the book, and the parts I did understand were just horrible. I hated how the boys shifted to such barbaric behavior on the island. And the author's writing style, no offense, was awful, with a capital "A". I sure was relieved when my class finished the book, and I made a vow to never read this book ever again, if I could help it. If you haven't read this book yet, then take my advice and stay far away from it. Don't waste your good money on such a shoddy product.
