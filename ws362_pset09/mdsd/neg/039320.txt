How Does Catherine Coulter continue to get these awful books published?  Does ANYONE read this stuff before it goes into print?  I've been reading historical romances for 20 years, and this is, without a doubt, the worst reading experience I've ever had!  The flat characters and convoluted story line were bad enough, but the ridiculous, dithering, twit headed dialogue that has become Ms. Coulter's hallmark of late, aggravated me so much that I read not even half of this book before I threw it across the room in disgust!  Mad Jack is much worse (if you can believe it) than Coulter's recycled regencies that she keeps revisiting on the world, and quite frankly, I feel that this book is not worth the paper it's printed on
