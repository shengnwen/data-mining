Lawrence Otis Graham has a tremendously rich vein of material here in his study of the preferred social and educational venues of the African-American upper crust, from their history with traditionally black colleges (Howard, Morehouse, Spelman and Fisk), social clubs (the Links, Boulé, AKA), and even their children's groups (Jack and Jill). Graham relates many fascinating anecdotes about this social set that are often extremely telling both their pride in their achievements and the cruel snobbery they inflict upon one another and others excluded from their set: his story about asking his brother and his bride to "jump the broom" (an old wedding tradition dating back to slave days), and the horrified fury it inspires in the DC social set, is particularly remarkable. But Graham seems almost entirely unwilling to do any actual analysis of his rich sociological material, or follow up on the many questions it seems to provoke about why such communities have been formed, what and whom they exclude, and what has been the effect of such studied exclusion among Americans of all classes and races. Unwilling to be a Thorstein Veblen for this social set, he instead becomes its Ward McAllister, making list after list of names of prominent African-Americans both living and deceased who belong to this set. (There is, of course, a helpful and extensive index, so anyone who might wish to see their inclusion in these lists might easily find the correct page.) The richness of the material makes you mostly sad for what an opportunity Graham has thrown away by refusing to analyze the causes and effects of the set from which he comes
