I was thoroughly impressed with Mr. Buchanan's witty prose and charming dilect. He is obviously skilled in "spinning a good yarn" for his audience. The dangerous thing about this book is that it provides a platform for all who subscribe to the idea that patriotism and nationalism are one and the same. For instance, I love my country but I think nationalism leads to racism and oppression of other cultures. America is great because of the people that live here and the freedoms we enjoy. It is not great because we have imperialistic attituedes around the globe and enjoy our capitalistic greed. Those are not requirements of our country only offshoots of our ego's. Democracy is what we are founded on, not capitalism (in my opinion). Freedom must be enjoyed by all, not just the rich elite. Someday their will be an uprising of the lower class and people like Buchanan will be the instigators. People that have everything, yet demonize those who are trying to get their voice heard by any means necessary are only showing their ignorance. How did the anglo-whites get the power in this country, by taking it rudely and loudly. That is what minorities in this country need to do - speak loudly and make the country hear their voices. Just like whites have done for centuries
