This book is geared towards people who are unaware that they came from disfunctional families (with emphasis on alcohol abuse).  If you have already come to the conclusion that your family was disfunctional and begun the healing process this book is remedial.  There is a large emphasis on alcohol dependancy and abuse which I could not relate to.  The book should be retitled "Healing The Child Within: Discovery and Recovery for Adult Children of Alcoholic and Dysfunctional Families"  I felt that the book "Getting The Love You Want" by Harville Hendrix was more interesting and provided additional opportunities for discovery and growth
