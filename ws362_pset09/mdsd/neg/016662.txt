It's funny...all of this antipathy towards the public education system without the assessment of the fact the the RELIGIOUS RIGHT has taken over many of the country's school districts (and city councils) in their efforts to control what kids learn.  Their takeover's benchmark is moving the system itself towards utter bankruptcy, thereby leaving a huge hole for the corporations to fill.  This has led to the problem of, frankly, stupid children who are crass, mindless consumers who also have 30-second attention spans.  Perfect for the church that wants humans who are easy to control (hence, the lack of ability of these young people to think for themselves), and for corporations who want unquestioning consumers.  Shame on this author for exclusively blaming teachers and other "lobbyists" -- they are a part of the problem, but not the instigators/creators of the problems
