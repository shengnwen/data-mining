Shoemaker tries to sell the idea her book breaks new ground by looking at the ways Indians and Europeans shared similar cultural constructs throughout the 18th century.  For instance, both groups used gendered language to call the other "women" as a form of insult.  However, Shoemaker's analysis never goes beyond description and the vital concept of change over time is lost in a book too full of description and woefully lacking in critical analysis.

I suggest saving your money and reading Richard White's The Middle Ground, which is a much more nuanced argument about Indians in 18th century North America.
