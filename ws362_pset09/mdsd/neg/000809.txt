I bought this book to try to get over a paralyzing fear that I felt about a big commitment step that I was sure, in the long term, I wanted to take. I was hoping it would provide me some insight into why I was afraid, and how to get over it. It did provide some small comfort that other men seem to have gone through the same stuff, but on the downside, the whole thing reads like a Cosmo article. It is punctuated with silly lists of things to always do or never do (which is great, because all relationships are the same, right?), it actually advises you to keep certain things secret from your potential life mate (wtf?), and if I could boil it down to one sentence, I'd say this book essentially says, "Don't worry, don't worry, it's going to be fine." Well that may be true. But I was hoping for something to help me feel better in the long term, not to give me upbeat liquid courage to accidentally make the right decision.
