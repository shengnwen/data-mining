I am about one-third into this book and I don't feel the desire to finish it.  In my opinion, there is a lack of development of the main character, and very little back story.  It's for this reason that I don't care about Cornelia's relationship with Martin.  I feel that the author uses far too many adjectives and descriptives which, while they are rich and poetic, do not provide enough substance to the plot.  I was also a little more than annoyed with the repetitive descriptions of how petite Cornelia is.  I got the picture the first, second and third time it was mentioned.  Beyond that, it seemed like filler, which only made Cornelia seem vain and that did not endear me to her character
