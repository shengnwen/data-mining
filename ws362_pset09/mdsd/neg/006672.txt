The story of a model whose looks and identify are severely transformed due to a car crash is intriguing and beautiful at first. But instead of focusing on her, Jennifer Egan throws in a strange Internet company, an ambitious homeless, a terrorist, the family of an ex friend, a kid with cancer -- everything but the kitchen sink. The result is bizarre and irritating and by the end, I totally lost interest.
