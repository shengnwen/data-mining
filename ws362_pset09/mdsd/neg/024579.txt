This book is for people who never read poetry or "just don't get it" when they do.  

The author focuses on why he fell in love with each poem, information that I found boring because of the way it was delivered.  He then picks apart the poems (sometimes cutting out every line, sometimes grabbing at random bits).  It takes away from the magic of a poem when someone uses pages upon pages trying to explain why it is beautiful or moving.  Those things must be felt - gained from the poem itself.  

There are so many ways in which this book could have been written that would have made it uplifting, touching, or, at the very least, not boring
