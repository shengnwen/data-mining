This book was recommended for me to read by my husband's personal therapist.  He's in anger counseling, after coming back from Iraq, and I'm the one reading about six books right now.

While it was worth the read, I need MORE:  More instruction, more direction.  More getting to the point!  Lerner goes on and on and I found myself bored with the stories.  I'm reading for answers.  There are so many stories and you really have to hunt for clues as to WHAT TO DO IN YOUR OWN LIFE.  If you're reading a self-help book, then obviously you just may need some help now.  And fishing for "what to do" isn't productive.

I just didn't like the flowy, story telling way of writing.  To me, she spent a lot of time writing the history of a problematic relationship and then what the patient WANTED to achieve and then not so much as to what was needed to fix the problem for a positive outcome.  Too many times I read the phrase, "we'll get to that later."
