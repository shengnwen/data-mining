This book was beautiful to look at as most Chronicle Books tend to be.  However as an organizing tool it was a bit too simple for me.  I think it would be encouraging for those just getting started or feeling a bit intimidated by their clutter. The flip tabs are nice so you can jump to the room you want. The serene colors and pictures are soothing for the eyes. The short quizzes help you focus on problem areas and what to do about them. The short "clutter busting projects" take a few hours at most. The book does not have a whole lot of space for adding your own notes and does not provide LOTS of information, but it would be ok for those looking for something at the introductory level or easily overwhelmed.

For those more willing to just jump in but wanting similar "clutter projects" outlined for them,  I think The Life Laundry: How to De-Junk Your Life by Dawn Walter, Mark Frank would be a better choice.

And then for those ready to take it all on and not needing a whole lot by way of "checklist" type cleaning, Donna Smallin's Organizing Plain and Simple: A Ready Reference Guide With Hundreds Of Solutions to Your Everyday Clutter Challenges is probably the way to go. It really does touch upon everything and gives several ways to solve problems
