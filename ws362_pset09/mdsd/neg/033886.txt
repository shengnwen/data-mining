While the premise of the book caught my initial attention, exploring the pages of the book partly bored me, caught my attention and revolted me.

What bored me: Two things. Firstly, we never hear anything from the aliens themselves. No extraworldly knowledge, no complex or philosophical reasons for going to earth and no details about the alien races. Why were there three races mentioned in the book when only one race was explored? Secondly, there were just too many Carmichael children popping out of the women on the ranch. A Carmichael family tree in the index would have been appreciated!

What caught my attention: There was some good detail and explaination about the forearm implant and cyberpunk fun.

What revolted me: At the time of printing (1995) the author was 60 years of age. Within the book, the author mentions breasts and nipples at least six times. If a women is mentioned in the book, so are her respective bosoms. It's entirely unnecessary, entirely perverted and entirely sexist
