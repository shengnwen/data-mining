this lady talks about her wedding and how it was sooo inexpensive. umm..yeah b/c SHE INVITED 50 PEOPLE. hello?!?! anyone could throw a wedding for cheap if they invited 50 ppl. she still spent a lot of money per person on their food. whats the point?!?! i can't afford to spend $20 a plate for the my wedding like she did.

i, (unfotunatley) and goign to have a larger wedding. nothing in here was insightful to me. having a friend taking the pictures or baking the cake..are you serious. i would not dream of having a friend to bake a cake for 400+ plus ppl (even if they offered.) that would literally be suicide. plus i my maid of honor is into photography and she said to never have someone who doens't have wedding photography experiance b/c apparently is harder than you think. 

if you are lucky enough to have a friend or family member who can provide thier services for you that would be nice..but you don't need a book to tell you that. those friends and family members will volunteer their services. i would think it to be rude to ask them for their help straight up. 

overall, you could change the title to "how to save $ by mooching off your freinds and family." b.c that is pretty much all she suggests. do yourself a favor and buy "bridal bargains" from denise and alan fields. well worth the money.
