This novel didn't work well for me.  I agree with the other reviewer's praise for Thomas King's great way with language and description.  We do indeed get the picture painted of the towns of Truth and Bright Water.  The incidents in the story such as the buffalo run where tourists shoot buffalo with paint pellet guns on motorcycles are interesting.  I failed to connect with this book because of the lack of resolution in the plot.  Tecumseh's mother keeps disappearing for days on end, mysteriously and without explanation.  At the end of the book, the only explanation I could come up with was that she was in play rehearsals for Snow White.  The irony of Snow White as play produced by Indians is wonderful, but what play rehearsal lasts days; and what mother wouldn't tell her son where she's going?  Throughout the novel, we wonder whether Tecumseh's mother and father will reunite.  At the conclusion of the novel, this relationship is as fuzzy as it was during the novel; so why did King repeatedly bring it up?  We also wonder at the mystery of Aunt Cassie and the suitcase with baby clothes.  Is she pregnant?  At the end, she burns the clothes and that's all we know about that.  Cousin Lum is kicked out of his house by his abusive father Franklin.  Neither his aunt nor uncle go and help the boy.  They leave him to live under a bridge with wild dogs.  Like King, I'm also a Native American hybrid; and I seek out good Native American literature like Eden Robinson's first novel Monkey Beach.  This book has great characters, the incidents are interesting, but the plot is like a train that goes nowhere.  Was that the point
