The hullabaloo surrounding the book will lead one to believe that this is an epitome of all adventure/suspense stories. In reality, the book is nothing but a wanderings of a disturbed mind, disillusioned with life and suffering from abnormalities of mind - so common among soldiers after attending a bloody war. Those readers who praise the book sky-high must have some ulterior motive in mind; otherwise this is a shoddy piece of work and written obviously with a film script in mind rather than a book, which anyways what Hilton was, scriptwriter in Hollywood!  His other tiny book  Goodbye Mr. Chips is a better read and doesn't pretend to be something else or is it we who label a book. No wonder Lost Horizon is out of print and should remain so. I don't blame the writer as much as the so-called critics, readers and other writers for whom the world begins in Western Europe and ends in North America. A very myopic view!
