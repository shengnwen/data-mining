If you are doing ethnographic or ethnological work regarding Yucatan, then this book does contain some information that is helpful and I have not seen spelled out elsewhere, so in that case I would recommend it. However, this ethnography does not really offer an image of life in the Yucatan. His descriptions of life in the pueblo where he was working are lacking. Instead, he spends (too) much of his time complaining about a particular folklorist, one of his ethnographic subjects, and the outside world's perception of "the Maya." The latter is an interesting topic but he doesn't really tie it in well with the overall work. He then tries to develop a theory of ethnography which also does not seem to fit into this work
