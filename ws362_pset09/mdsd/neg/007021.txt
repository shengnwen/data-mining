Written by Herge in 1929 (when he was in his early 20s) in episode form for Le Petite Vingtieme, the children's section of a right wing Belgian newspaper, the first volume of Tintin (shown in facsimile form) has some interest mainly for historical reasons. The drawings, for one, are extremely crude. Many eight year olds could have drawn it better. The story's visceral anticommunism is also over the top (though it includes an interesting subplot about the struggle between the soviet regime and the kulaks, which would end tragically in the early 30s in Ukraine with the man made famine or Holodomor). A good scene showing english communists marveled at the achievements of a potemkin soviet factory pokes fun at the naivete of the European communists in regard to the Soviet Union - a naivete that would last decades. The story is generally clumsy, with Tintin having hair rising escapes from sure death in almost every page. This was the only Tintin's story not to be redrawn in colour, and it was out of print for more than 40 years, so clearly Herge was somewhat embarrassed by it. By his next volume, Tintin in Congo, Herge would have developed his trademark clear line style, though the story of that book remained clumsy, not to mention its ardent pro colonialism. I think it was only by his fifth book, The Blue Lotus, that Herge's work rose above the crudity of his early books
