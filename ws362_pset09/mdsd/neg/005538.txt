For heavens sakes, how does a sappy book like this get such glowing reviews!  There are certainly some interesting plotlines and characterizations (although none of them exactly "deep"), and Jones is bold in portraying Polly's life with some stark details.  But most of the story takes place while Polly is about 14-16, and it's asking a lot for an adult to put up with the insipid voice of Polly for so long.  There are some humerous moments, and Jone's entertaining style compels the reader to keep turning the pages, but there's no satisfactory ending that makes you glad to have spent the effort reading it through.

The ending is nothing but sloppy.  It's as if the author spent all this time developing the story at a fairly plodding pace and then was told to finish it in a weekend.  Several reviewers seem to be trying to fill the gaps but frankly there's just a bunch of stuff that has no explanation whatsoever.  The ending has all the satisfaction of a Star Trek episode defeating a robot with "This statement is false", and even that is delivered about as crudely as imaginable.

Jones is better with lighter fare where she can make us laugh our way along and not expect too much of the ending, like "Dark Lord of Derkholm" or "Year of the Griffin".  But she completely overreaches in this one.  I'd have given it 3 stars if it weren't for all the overblown reviews - expectations need to be lowered in this case to counteract the hype.  I do wonder what she could have done if she'd focused more on the ending to provide a satisfactory conclusion, instead of leaving me feeling cheated
