Not only are the other comments on the printing quality correct, but the EXACT SAME BOOK EXISTS in a 2006 EDITION!!  The "Science of Sex" is the original(?) 1996 edition.  The 2006 edition of the VERY SAME BOOK is titled, "Sperm Wars: Infidelity, Sexual Conflict, and Other Bedroom Battles".  Explain to me why the author would reprint his original book under a new title?  Anyway, I'm returning this one, since I bought both books at the same time, thinking they had entirely different content. Furthermore the new edition is of much better printed quality, with none of the problems mentioned about this edition.  One more thing of note...the new edition is HALF THE PRICE of this crappy version!!!  Can't wait to actually read it
