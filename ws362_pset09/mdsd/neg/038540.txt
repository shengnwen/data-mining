I tried to stay focused on this book.  I even read every single page to make sure that I didnt miss anything.  This book was absolutely HORRIBLE.  I think this book was published just to get money from people who actually believe in this author.  I dont think many people have done research on this women.  First of all she comes from a family who was not rich but had enough money to help her get started.  Then with her divorce I'm sure she was taken care of financially to get her businees up and running.  My main problem with the book is how poorly it related to the so called "Black Woman".  Me being a black woman myself  I can tell you first hand nothing she dipicts in this book would be helpful in getting yor money straight.  She mentions how knowing the way your elders handled their money would help you to get your money straight.  I just dont get how the way my grand dad, and grand mom, handled their money then would relate to me getting MY money straight now?? Then she mentions something about having to give money to the church to be a more rounded person? Well if you barely have enough money which is why your supposed to be getting your money straight in the first place, how on earth are you supposed to have enough to give away to the church? I thought the book would deal with more REAL PEOPLE with REAL SITUATIONS.  This book might be beneficial to someone that makes alot of money and just blows it away on stupid things.  I know the author sure makes a REAL NICE SALARY
