This is by far the most poorly written book I have ever read. Ever. It reads like someones fragmented thought pattern...if that person had shoveled enough cocaine to kill a horse up their nose. She's the most insecure person in the world, and this book is merely her trying to fill some Freudian void, since she doesn't do drugs anymore and she's too old to sleep with every guy who moves. Seriously, every bad thing that's ever happened to her is simply because she is such a twit. Her desperation is almost understandable, being that she is a middle aged single women in a career path that is only for 18-year olds. She is viciously past her prime and all the surgery in the world won't change that. Maybe she could just take up knitting or something. Models are valuable people in our society, as long as they don't attempt to write or talk, and Janice proves that they really shouldn't
