This book belongs to the George Steiner school of writing - extremely pretentious, aggressively obscure, frustratingly allusive, barely grammatical. (How can Cambridge, home of Russell and Moore, I. A. Richards and Wittgenstein, tolerate, let alone produce, this kind of pseudo-erudite claptrap?) Here is how Derrida would write if he wrote in English. Fortunately the virtues of clarity and solid, plain-spoken prose are more celebrated among English speakers than French, so Dunn is hardly likely to assume the mantle of public intellectual he so evidently craves. Move on: you're not missing anything here
