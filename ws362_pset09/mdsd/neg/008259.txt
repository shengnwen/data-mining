Let's see, besides our protagonist being a nominal Milton scholar (though like all the other literary lights cited in this book, there is no real connexion with any of Milton's works in this book), we have the following names dropped, seemingly gratuitously throughout this opus: James Joyce (5 times), Yeats (5 times), Thoreau (3 times), Bertrand Russell (2 times), Ezra Pound (2 times), Wordsworth, Emily Dickinson (at least 3), Matthew Arnold, Jack London....and I stopped counting after that.  Come now, does anyone save a literary groupie really appreciate all this display of superficial literary knowledge? Is it really intrinsic to the story? ---Here: My favourite example of the inanity of these quasi-literary speculations by Ray-" `The drop that wrestles in the sea/Forgets her own locality' was from Emily Dickinson, a poet he hadn't read attentively enough, since clearly she had something to say to him.".....And, well, what is it?  Never mind, no time for serious pondering.  It's on to more Yeats among others before the paragraph ends (p.351).  - The one exception to all this name dropping is Ray's recital of Matthew Arnold's "Dover Beach." to Morel.  But, as is commonplace, the exception proves the rule here. - I could go on about how disappointing the meretricious scholarship is in this work: Is Morel serious about citing Matthew 15:24 as proof that Jesus came only for the Jews?  Is Rush?  Anyone who has read the whole chapter knows that this is where Jesus turns to the Gentiles and heals the Canaanite's daughter because the Jews have rejected him.  Is Rush trying to show that Morel's idealism about a non-Christian Africa is superficial and misplaced?  Or is Rush simply showboating himself---I very much fear that it's the latter.  2 Stars for the few poignant passages on conjugal love.  But, in the end, I would have come away much more enriched had I spent the time reading actual literature: Joyce, Yeats, Wordsworth, Dickinson........Milton
