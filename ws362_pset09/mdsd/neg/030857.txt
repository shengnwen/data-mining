I found this book to be offensively un-American.  The characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts.  The best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises.  I think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters.
