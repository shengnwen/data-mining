Smith's book is a classic, and it is cheap - so those are some benefits.  However, the book is poorly organized.  It does not give you a clear outline in each chapter, and instead bounces around a little too much.  The most frustrating part of the book is Smith's clear intention to make all the religions seem as similar as possible.  Therefore, I think he sometimes does not give a clear picture, but instead describes the lowest common denominator.  

Finally, some knowledge of Christianity will be helpful in reading this book.  He uses allusions from the Bible in every chapter.
