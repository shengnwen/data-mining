The theme of the plot & story are very good, but after reading Rattlesnake Crossing, this was a disappointment. Maybe Jance is trying to develop her characters & their relationships here. But there is so much superfluous dialogue it becomes boring. A couple pages later you get lucky & she returns you to the story. A previous reviewer stated his least favorite chapter was #20. I agree. Unfortunately Chapter 20 is where the book's climax takes place. More superfluous nonsense in the middle of the story with the introduction, ever so briefly, of another character & a dog. Unneeded fluff. The book falls flat on it's face in it's ability to tie the story together well at the end. Possibly Jance was so distracted by other dialogue. Save your time & money unless you need a sleeping pill. Dead to Rights will put you out in short time
