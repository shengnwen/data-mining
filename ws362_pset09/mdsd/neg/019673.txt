Historically inaccurate, a painfully rushed third act, and not up to the high standards set by Philippa Gregory's other Tudor novels. It reads like something written by a well-intentioned romance author. What amazed me was the author's decision to write a Katharine of Aragon that bore absolutely no resemblance to the historical figure. I've found all her previous Tudor character studies to be incredibly believeable(notwithstanding Elizabeth I's excessive randiness in The Virgin's Lover). Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Henry VIII himself, all seem to come alive. Why then is Katharine of Aragon groping her husband on her wedding night, dressing in the Tudor equivalent of a naughty negligee, and seducing her father-in-law for the sake of politics?

This "racy" view is completely at odds with every historical source which portrays Catalina de Aragon as a intensely religious, reserved woman who would never repeatedly perjure herself. For a rigorously devoted Roman Catholic to live such a lie her entire life (to say nothing of the sexual politics she is depicted as playing) would be live a life of sin. There is nothing in the historical record to ever suggest Katharine would choose that path. 

If Philippa Gregory wants to write a purely fictitious re-imagining of Katharine of Aragon, that's fine (I've always wanted more exploration of what her life might have been like if Prince Arthur hadn't died). But to claim this character is based on fact is both laughable and insulting to all authors who strive for historical accuracy
