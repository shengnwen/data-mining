This book is a tool for the author to market his service.  I cannot get much insight nor technique out of this book.  John Mauldin's Bull's Eye Investing is selling for $17 and it's packed with all the information you need about investing.  For trading, I would turn to the all time classic: Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.  Human behavior hasn't changed much in the past century
