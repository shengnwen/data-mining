Being a Cussler fan for quite some time, having a first edition hardcover of "Raise the Titanic", I dutifully purchase and read every Cussler, and Cussler collaberated, piece of fiction and non-fiction. This title is a predictable read with only the names and places changed from previous reads to protect the innocent.
Granted it's interesting and all that, and some of the scientific stuff is momentarily thought provoking, but in the end you already know the story  Bad guy going to take over the world, world in enviromental danger, good guy gets girl, car chase and everybody saved.
Maybe I'm just in a cranky mood today, but thats what I think of it, and I'll probably buy the next one
