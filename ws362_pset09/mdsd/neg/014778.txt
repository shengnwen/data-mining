And I don't mean Al.  I was not all that aware of this sub-genre of the cop novel.  If lovingly described tableaux of decomposing bodies on the autopsy table or in the field is your favorite dish, then you've found your author.  Tess gets right in there with the stench of corpse gasses and the dribbling, squirting liquified putrefaction.  You may need a barf bag near to hand when you read this one.  What is the deal, people?
