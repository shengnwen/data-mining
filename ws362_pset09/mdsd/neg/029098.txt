Wasn't going to write a review of this, but I felt compelled. The author gave himself 5 stars for a book that I felt was a waste of my money. If you have any higher education or management experience, you need to look elsewhere. If you truly are an "idiot" it might be a good starting point for you. Why would a true idiot need a HRM book, though
