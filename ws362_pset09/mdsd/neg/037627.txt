What the hell is going on... I wonder wich rich royal family in the mid-east has funded this unbeleivable mistake!!! 

For your info, The Persian golf has existed for thousands of years up until your 2004 Edition.

What happened ???  Are you taking advantage of the last moments in mullah history before they are overthrown to clinch a deal with the Arabs ?????

I am really disapointed, and did not think that a non-for profit organisation like yours would do such a mistake.
