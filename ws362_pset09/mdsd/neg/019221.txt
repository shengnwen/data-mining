I read the Subjection of Women for my 17th Century Philosophy class.  I found it interesting, but hard to read.  Mill tends to be repetative and wordy.  He is very much the early feminist until you get to page 86 or 87 when he tells you that for all women can do, they should stay home and care for the family anyway.  I would suggest that others read this book, but give yourself time, because about 20 pages a night was all that I could muster.  At 100 pages it's not too long, but could have been said with more clarity and organization
