While I found a lot of the material in the book very interesting, it is put together in such a muddled way that it is very difficult enjoy reading it. The book seems to be composed of a number of previously written (and in many cases overlapping) articles joined together with fairly boring 'filler' to try and present a 'complete' view. 

I would suggest buying the book if you're interested in reading about early colonial life in the vanilla industry in Papantla, Mexico. Most of the other information can be easily found on the internet
