The author of this book claims to be a converted atheist asking tough questions from atheist perspective in forms of interviews with experts on Christiannity.  However from the onset of the first interview it becomes very obvious that the whole thing is a pretense.  After asking initial question (challenge to faith) and receiving first answer, any answer, he immediately assumes the role of wideeyed student and fails to give any real challenge in the follow up questions.  Any freethinker could do much better job making those "experts" to work a little harder. The whole scheme resembles a martial arts movie where cohorts of opponents run towards the hero with thieir guards down only to be knocked down.
The book really insults the readers intelligence by assuming thier lack of critical thinking.  Some of the arguments for faith go something like this:  "Bible prophecies prove to be accurate because it predicted coming of Christ", or "Jesus is better than other leading man of other religions because he performed more miracles which is documented in the Bible" or "Eternal hell is humane and is expression of God's respect of human dignity because those that go there make this choice themselves by not accepting Him".  In case you wondered about sensless deaths of millions of children from drout and famine- that is just a result of God's perfect plan that we cannot comprehend because our minds are so inferior to His".
By painting himself as convert from atheism the author attempts to misguide more gullible reader into thinking that these objections are the strongest that a freethinking person could give.  The book aims at the audience that only read books written from christian perspective therefore lacking any knowledge and background in history of religion, mythology, historical background etc.  It truly is a propaganda.  Want a real challenge and like to make up your mind by yourself- read these authors that really mean what they write insead of using cheap tricks.
