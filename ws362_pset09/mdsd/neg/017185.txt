Maxwell's concepts of what a leader is is quite accurate.  However, I don't think he needed to spend over 200 pages to define what a leader is.  That's what this book came to be: one long, repetitive, obvious definition for leadership.  I didn't see these as laws so much as nuances of what he'd already said.

As a woman, reading this book was made more difficult with his overwhelming use of sports and male leaders.  The few examples he uses of female leaders are the few and the cliched (ex., Mother Teresa and Princess Diana).  A nun and a princess.  How many women in business are either of those?  Where are the examples strong, successful, inspiring female business and sports leaders?

I also found his use of his religious roles and examples tiresome.

What I felt that this book lacked most was more suggestions to improve one's leadership skills?  He suggests training, but not what kind nor does he provide exercises for developing oneself as a leader.

Another failure of this book is how he rarely addresses how a strong leader should deal with situations that aren't going well.  A great leader's abilities are best exemplified and most apparent in times of conflict.

I also strongly disagree that a positional leader isn't necessarily a true leader.  A positional leader is in nature a leadership role.  What isn't inherent in a positional leader is her or his ability to lead *well*?

One of the elements of this book I did appreciate were the pictures and quotes and the fact that the book is a quick read.  Other than that, I don't feel any more prepared now than I did prior to reading this book
