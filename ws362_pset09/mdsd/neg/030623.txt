This book has been in my library for about 20 years. When I first read it, I was very impressed and went on to read Waddell's &quot;Makers of Civilization in Race &amp; History.&quot; More recently I have been doing a lot of research into the Eddas, copies of which I have in the Old Norse as well as in the best English and German translations. Compared with these, Waddell's translation, if that's what you want to call it, of the Eddas is full of rubbish that he, no doubt, invented in order to promote the stupid Aryan racist agenda, so fashionable among certain members of the British aristocracy in the 1920s. It is very unfortunate, mainly because he does touch on the thesis that the Norse material originated in the ancient Middle East, something not entirely at variance with Snorri Sturluson's Ynglinga Saga.
