Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome.  For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as "life-like" or "beautiful."  For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: "He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen."  That's it.  The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes.  If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you.  If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway.
