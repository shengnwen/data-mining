I had to read this book for school this week. The first 20 - 30 pages were very slow and boring. In the end, the book was a slight more interesting. I would not recommend this book to my peers. I did not enjoy reading A Gathering of Days.

Some of my ideas of how the author could have made this book less boring:
1. Added more suspenseful climaxes
2. Taken out unimportant information
3. Wrote this book in regular format, not journal format
4. Used better word choices throughout the context of the book
