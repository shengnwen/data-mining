I'm currently working through these books with my children, one of whome is in Kindergarten.  They made me long for the days of the "Tip and Mitten" and "Dick and Jane" readers.

The drawings are of poor quality.  I could draw better myself.  And, more frusterating to me, there is no attempt at any kind of story.  What there is consists of random sentence fragments concentrated around certain phonetics.  The sentence fragments get longer as one progresses through the book. 

What does work in these books is the progression of usage of words from very simple to slightly more complex by the end of the book, and the series concept allows the child to slowly build competence in reading as s/he works through the books.  

So, they're not all bad and I am working with them, but do yourself a favor and unless your local school system has you roped into using them at home in conjunction with the child's schooling, look around and see what your other options are.
