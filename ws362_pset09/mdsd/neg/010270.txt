Disappointed.  This book is worthless.  The author should not try to write a book while smoking dope.  The first half of the book is a Mac-is-great commercial.  The last half of the book is a Mac-is-great commercial.  Yes, I know the Mac-is-great, I love the Mac, Macs are cool, Macs are usefull, rah rah rah.  Unfortunately, the book is content free.  No actual developers were involved in the production of this book; no actual developers were informed by reading this book
