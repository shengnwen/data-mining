Hank Hanegraaff, "Bible Answer Man," is reduced to little more than a Christian typist in this ultra-thin (in pages, scope and intelligence) collection of misinformation, out-of-context quoting and outright duplicity. Having no coherent theories of his own, Hanegraaff's book is nothing more than endless citations of Christian "scientists'" published, absurd evolution-bashing hypotheses. He cites renown pseudoscientist and creationist idiot Duane T. Gish (universally disputed, debunked and disregarded in the legitimate scientific community) no less than 25 times. And Hanegraaff's references to actual scientific theorists, such as Gould, et al, are constantly filtered through Gish's and other Creationist morons' truth-concealing works. Let's leave science to the scientists.
