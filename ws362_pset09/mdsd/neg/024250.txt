Garbarino studies sociopathic boys,then purports to impose these &quot;Lessons&quot; on all of our sons.  This doesn't answer questions posed by Columbine, etc., it exploits them, cashes in on them, and adds to the anti-boy, feminist hysteria that has come from them.  Garbarino's not quite as bad as William Pollock, but it's time to shut these gibberish peddlers down
