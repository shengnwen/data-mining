The beginning of this book seemed promising. Minyon, a young African-American girl leaves her family in 1929 South Carolina in order to work for "Mizz Addie". What Minyon doesn't realize at first is that Mizz Addie's house isn't just a home. It's also a brothel. During the course of forty years at the house, named Hazelhedge, Minyon deals with prostitutes of all types, family troubles and a few possibilities of love. What started out good however, started to get depressing as the reader realizes that all Minyon does is tell us the exploits of the ones around her. All she seems to do is change sheets! I must say, I was disappointed
