this book has alot of tables that are usefull but it is not very clear on the trinities between certain dieties. She begins telling you that negitive magick is not good but goes on to give you information on curse and that type... I have read another one of her books and found that she puts her own spinn on history and does not approach writing with a proffessionalism that most readers require. The only reason to by this book is for its tables on dieties and magick... not a good book all togethe
