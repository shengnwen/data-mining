I bought Zig Ziglar's book Raising Positive Kids in a Negative World, and had many problems with it. I am an Northeaster Illinois University student majoring in early childhood education, and I know a LOT about children. I thought this book would give me more insight on how I could help other parents raise positive children. Throughout his book Zig Ziglar constantly pats his self on the back/toots his own horn for all his accomplishments and "parents he has reached". He might know a thing or two about writing books on how to sell things, but he should leave raising positive children to the professionals. Yes, at the beginning of the book I was hooked and thought this man knew it all. I only got half way through the book when I realized that he knows nothing. I did not enjoy some of his ideas, for example if you and your children are not religious then they will be terrible people. I know plenty of wonderful children who do not believe in god. It made me sick to hear how he feels about working mothers, and women in general. Zig(what kind of name is that) is extremely sexist! Don't waste your time on this book. YUCK! If anyone wants this book(as a coaster of course) I will very happily send it to you
