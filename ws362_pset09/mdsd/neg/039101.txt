I have no doubt Will Eisner's intentions were noble in writing this book. I'm also not here to disparage a widely acknowledged great in the comics industry. And yet...
  It comes as no surprise that this emanates from a series of academic lectures as it smacks of a non-academic striving desperately both to sound learned and informed and to give serious academic weight to a subject generally percieved as throwaway entertainment.
  Will Eisner was a great, but a great of a very different era and as such he has very little relevance visually to the world of comics today. That's not to say he's inferior to a lot of the hacks passing themselves off as 'cartoonists' these days, but if you want to work in that industry as an artist (thus producing sequential ART) then this book is a fraction of the use of the superior (that's right SUPERIOR) Scott McCloud book "Understanding Comics".
  So do yourself a favour and buy that instead.
  Oh, and using lots of big (and inappropriate to the medium) words doesn't make you sound smart, either.
  Sorry
