     Although I agree with several of Mr. Stamper's recommendations (legalizing prostitution, decriminalizing drugs), many of his assertions are straight out of the "I-Hate-America" handbook.  All white, male cops -and even many black ones - are racsist, homophobic, women-hating thugs.  What we need is a kinder, gentler way of policing.  
     Mr. Stamper had a brief career as a police officer before his real career of supervisory bureacrat began.  He "confesses" that in his rookie year he was on his way to becoming one of the bad cops before he was set right by a straight-shootin' DA.  It was apparently then that his liberal sensitivities kicked in, and soon he was a supervisor (all the better to control the average Joe).  
     The unfortunate thing about this book isn't the stories he relates, or even his recommendations (some good, some not so good), but the haughty way in which he relates it.  Conservatives, Republicans - BAD! Liberals, Democrats - GOOD! (except for unions - bad!)  If this book were written with respect not only for the majority of rank and file cops, but for the other half of Americans that Mr. Stamper obviously disdains, it may have been worth the money.  As it is, if you are to the right of Hillary, take a pass on this one
