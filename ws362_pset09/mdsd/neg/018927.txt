The book was about a girl named Jennifer and a toad that she bought from a magic shop for a school  project about pets.   The only thing she did not know about the toad was that the toad,bufo, could talk.   I would recomend this book to people who like Fairy tales , or books with  magic. The characters in this story are Jennifer ,Ellen, Mr Elives, Sharra, Skippy, Brandon,Mrs.Murdley, and Bufo the toad.   My opinion of this story was that it was not so good but ok. I thought the book was boring
