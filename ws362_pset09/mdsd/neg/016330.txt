At the present time I am being forced to read this book in my Honors Seminar class, and for the life of me, I cannot find why I should enjoy this book as much as my professor does.  This book is incredibly boring.  My eyelids are heavy and if I did not have a paper to write on this thing, I would throw it to the bottom of my bed (never to open it again) and go to sleep.  

For me, this book reads like a transcribed tape.  Of course it has an editor, but I really feel like I'm listening to this man talk---which is not always a bad thing. Some [read: better and more interesting] books work well that way, but not this one.  This book has me wondering, "why do I care about this?" and "who are these people?" These questions signal that it is very easy for a reader to get lost in the jumble. 

Wow, just writing a REVIEW of this book is making me sleepier. Read this if you must.  If you have some burning desire to learn more about Russell Simmons, then enjoy.
