If you want to get introduced to the radical conservative concept in plain english you can probably read the book. The book, quite disappointingly, doesn't present logical arguments which is quite putting off for a rational reader. I'll quote an example from Chapter 9 (Why Government Is The Problem): 

"It is one thing for the government to provide the basic necessities of life to the "truly needy," people, a group that would include the poor, the sick and the disabled. It is another thing for government to take resources from one middle-class family and give them to another middle-class family. This happens when, for example, the government builds a mass transit system. People who prefer to drive cars must prefer to pay for the transportation preferences of the people who prefer to take the subway."

Now from above argument it seems that people driving cars are doing some kind of charitable favour to people taking the subway. But how about people riding in subways paying for the freeways/highways other people drive their vehicles on.

And similarily all over the book the arguments are pretty loose and unappealing. Another example in chapter 14 (Why Professors Are So Left-Wing): 

"Conservatives tend to go to business because they care more about money; liberals tend to into the academy because they care more about power".

I am not sure if I understand the above argument but it seems illogical for people to join academia if they are hungry for power - don't know if there is a "How to become a US Senator for Dummies" but I don't think it would recommend becoming a faculty member in an Ivy League school if one is looking for a seat in Congress.
