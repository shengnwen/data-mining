My greatest problem with this book was it's appearence of blaming America for the woes of Japan and excusing excesses in time of war.  The author gave me the impression that he was more willing to forgive Japanese excesses in battle while condeming America for it's methods to end the war.  I grant the author's expertise in the access to a personal source for the battle of Iwo Jima near by but I cannot accept his rationalization of Japanese atrocities as a cost of war then condem the Americans for their bombing the enemy homeland (fire and nuclear) to destroy their will and ability to wage war.  Overall the book is well written and provides an insight to the mentality of the Japanese military during the war.
