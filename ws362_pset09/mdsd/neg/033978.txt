I bought this book wondering if it would show me any tips to improve my running technique. The book does serve as a good introduction to running technique and I would suggest the book to a person who knows nothing on the topic.  However, the book left me more convinced than ever before that one cannot improve technique from lessons in a book.  Coaches exist for a reason and this is one of them.  Runners who have great body and muscle awareness are not going to have major problems and thus are not going to need this book.  On the other hand, runners who have poor body awareness are going to need a knowledgable person (a coach) to watch them run and identify the problem. So they don't need the book either and are better of spending their money on a coaching session.  This book might be useful for a student taking a college course in coaching running but that is about it.

Beside this general complaint the book itself leaves a lot to be desired.  The photographs in the book are rather poor.  They are simply clips from a video and suffer from all the problems that causes.  It was really mind boggling to me that the publisher was so cheap as to not pay for a still camera to take photos.  The poor quality images make it difficult at times to really understand what the author is refering to in the picture.  It is most unfortunate that the authors obvious knoweledge is hindered by this  problem.  Further, there isn't a modern fad (running barefoot, neuromuscler training) that the author doesn't fall for.  It used to be "muscle memory" was all the rage.  The book would have been stronger if these issues were left out as the author comes across as pandering.   

All in all I think this is a book that might serve some useful purpose for a person who knows little about proper running technique.  But for a person with difficulties it is not a substitute for a some sessions with a good coach.
