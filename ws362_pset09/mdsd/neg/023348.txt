This is a terrible book. I am a total novice in FrontPage and web page creation but have lots of experience in computers including programming years ago. 

Usually I am the one everyone asks questions of with computers.
I was unable find the Button she talked about on the 3rd page. I searched everywhere for it and asked Microsoft and HELP and still haven't found it.  She assumes you know where things are but we DON'T.  very frustrating experience
