Having enjoyed some of the author's previous novels, I found Pure Poetry to be very disappointing.  The story centers around the main character who is incredibly annoying and doesn't seem to ever get it.  She is not likable, nor is she even interesting.  When the reader does not care one whit about what happens to the main character in a character-driven novel lacking any cohesive plot, the result is a mess.

I recommend A Disturbance in One Place instead; that is a much more enjoyable read
