I couldn't wait to get this book. I really like this groupf of bulbs and I wanted to learn more about growing them and the varieties I could grow and the work being done with them. Well I was in for a surprise. this book does little of that. What it does do is give the reader the history of the plant and its introduction into horticulture. The work that went into it is staggeringbut nothing for the gardener. Infact after reading it I don't think the authors even grow the plants it is treated as more of an object than a plant. this was made worse by no color photos just illustrations. now don't get me wrong they were nice illustrations. but would it have killed you to include some photos.  I can onot reccomend this to any gardener unless you are really into botanic history.
