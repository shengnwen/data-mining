When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful
