I think this book is worse than the others written by Savage-Weiner, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately, most reviewers never bothered reading this book.

On page 2, I am reminded why I hate this guy. Observing "while I'm no military tactician," he forgets to point out he was dodging the draft picking flowers in Hawaii while I and others were serving in Vietnam. He then states, "we still had to fight the real war, a guerrilla war--something our nation does not have the stomach for." Oh, please dude, people like you and your followers don't have the guts to serve. Like on page 10, where he forgets that people like Ted Kennedy at least served in the Navy during WWII. You may disagree with his politics, but at least the Kennedys had the guts to serve.

Skip ahead to page 172 (you ain't missing much) for more of his idiocy on Vietnam. He states, about the Vietnamese, that "in the sixties, no one really knew who they were." Well, he didn't, but 3 million Americans who served in the Vietnam War did. That's what happens when you sit out the war of your generation. He also erroneously claims that Vietnam "was a civil war." At the time of the war it was considered communist aggression. Conservatives of the sixties, like me but not him, knew about the communist threat. This is also the same page where Savage-Weiner claims "Iraq was not a civil war." Where have you been lately?

The "Afterword" really says it all. On page 203 he claims, about liberals, "for far too long you have lived in a cage where liberal ideas--and only liberal ideas--are expressed." He is really talking about himself and his followers. At least liberals, by definition, read and review all points. 

For all those who hate "liberals," I would like to remind them that our Founding Fathers were the liberals of their day. A real Patriot of our Revolution (one of my real ancestors in Virginia) would have burned his house down and sent him packing on his big honking yacht.
