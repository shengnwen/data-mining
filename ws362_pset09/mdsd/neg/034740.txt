Since so many popular chick-literature focuses on the privileged, glamorous lives of beautiful Manhattanites, I was curious to read this book which focuses instead on the lifestyle of women in Hollywood and suburban New Jersey (especially since I am former New Yorker, who lives in the New York suburbs and works in the New Jersey suburbs).  

However, I was left disappointed and annoyed.

Compared to other popular chick-lit, the author's characters are fully-dimensional and likeable (compared to say Plum Sykes' inanely vapid and selfish characters in Bergdorf Blondes). It was for this reason that I finished the book, and other readers will want to as well, since the author excels at making the reader care about the characters.

However, advertised as a book about "friendship", this book is no different than any of the NYC-center chic-lit narratives which center on a have v. have not lifestyle. The problem being that in works such as "The Devil Wears Prada" or "The Ivy Chronicles" which are a humorous look at the lives of the haves, they make no particular moral statement about the class differentials of the have-nots. 

Suburbanistas, on the other hand is infused with a subtle brand of class issues, and populist, democratic socialism and anti-corporate message which in my opinion has no place in chic-lit. What makes this subtle moralistic message annoying, is that in the end the glamorous, thin, beautiful woman from Hollywood continues to be fabulous and continue her acting on Broadway, while there is no Cinderella ending for her childhood friend from New Jersey. Since the author took it upon herself to promote a socially democratic message throughout the book, suggesting that at the end, both characters will achieve equality, to end the book with this obvious contraction is frustrating and annoying.
