Being a lover of love, the arts, Florence and tales of strong, discovering women, after reading the description of this book, I was very excited to begin!

By page 20, I started feeling misled.  By page 100, I started wondering if I was reading the right book.  By page 200, I was debating whether or not I cared enough to finish.  

This book is barely about any of the subjects I mention above.  Moreso, it includes a few drawn out parts about book conservation that, well, just weren't that interesting.

I'm just glad I bought it used.  And back to the used book store it shall go
