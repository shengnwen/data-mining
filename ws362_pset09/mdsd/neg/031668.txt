This book goes against everything my pediatrician and allergist recommend as far as introducing nuts to a child's diet.  Half of the recipes call for nuts of some type for babies from ten months on.  Everything I have heard from the Dr's or read says to wait at least one year and until two or three years if you have a family history of nut allergies.  Very disappointed in this book.
