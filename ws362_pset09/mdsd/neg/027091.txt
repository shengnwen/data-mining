I got this book hoping it would reveal "the weight loss program to transform your life etc."  I found the book to be pretty light on the program part.  There are a lot of tips from the contestants and from the trainers, but no real solid weight loss program and no logic or reasoning behind the tips that are given.  Overall, I would only recommend this book is you are a fan of the show looking for contestant anecdotes.  If you are serious about weight loss this book is not for you
