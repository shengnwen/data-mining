That Hal Lindsey write how my people, the Jewish people have survived for millenia the attempted destruction and the abuse and humiliation at the hands of our enemies. That our survival is Biblical prophecy and that our ingathering is a millenial sign. Yes all this is true, it cannot be doubted. But what hurts me and hurts every Jew that I speak to, it the fact that Xians speak of all these pogroms and murders as if they were looking from the outside. If they only looked down at their hands they would see the blood of my people staining their finger nails. The fact that they so easily cast it off and give no second thought to their barbacity, and the murder and hatred of their ancestor is insulting. A fell good book for murderers and oppressor as so how all this was ment to be and the world is good. Yes we have survived the murders and the attempted conversion to a pagan heretic false god, and we have maintained to believe in the G-d of Israel, but no thanks to you and your people
