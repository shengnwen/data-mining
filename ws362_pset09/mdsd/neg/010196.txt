The different authors write different chapters defining some things differently.  

The material is outdated, you'll constantly have to update their junk to make it work.

Way too verbose and bouncing back and forth within an individual chapter (just try those two early BMP/CMP chapters).

It's just not worth $1.

Use the sun tutorials for a much better and much much clearer start.
