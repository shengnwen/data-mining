Not really thrilled with this book -- don't think it's the strongest example of what Emma Holly can write.
  
Loved the story when it involved B.G. and Eric, but given what I've read of E.H., Charity is not such a great heroine.  This is strictly personal opinion; obviously plenty of other people found alot to admire in this book.  I'm keeping it, but only for the Eric & B.G. interactions.  

Too bad Emma doesn't write a real love story strictly between two guys, because she really has a knack for those scenes.  In this one, the Charity character was just interference.
