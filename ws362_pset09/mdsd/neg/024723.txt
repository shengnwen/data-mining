I have done it again!  I swore I would not buy any more of Ms. Small books but I did anyway.  I became a fan of her books with wonderful stories as the Skye O'Malley books, Love Wild and Fair, and The Kadin.  Those books were wonderful.  I could lose myself in the wonderful descriptions of the locales and the well thought out characters.

It seems that now Ms. Small has gone the way of too many writers--they must write a book every year, whether it's good or bad.  It seems that she sketches out a plot and then rushes through the story to get the book out.  The only time she takes her time is in the sex scenes.  And since I think those scenes are boring, they do nothing to make me like the book better.

If, like me, you are looking for the "old" Bertrice Small, this is not it.  Reread the books you enjoyed and hope that one day she will take the time to actually write a book instead of retreading the same old, same old
