I am a fan of John Bogle's so I bought this book.  I was impressed by the strength of the reviews.

However, I now realize that most of the reviews were written by friends of the authors.  Take that into account when buying the book.

The first review of the book by V. Martinez (who apparently is not a friend of the authors) is dead on.  The book is somewhat disorganized and hard to follow.  The writing style is dry.

I think there are better books out there for investors
