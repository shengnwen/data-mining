An anthology of this type should capture representative selections of all worthy poets; given that personal bias, I find this to be an unbalanced treatment of American verse.  Walt Whitman gets 68 pages (as though his work is not readily available elsewhere), while the entire contribution of Stanley Kunitz (just to note a single example) is reflected in one short poem--and many other fine poets are slighted in this lamentable fashion.

Glance through the table of contents and browse the volume itself, and you'll find tiny snippets of some of our best poets, engulfed by huge selections of the few that this editor considers laudable. 

It's unfortunate that Oxford should have issued a biased and arbitrary selection of this sort, which is of very limited use to those interested in the breadth of achievement of American poets. Many other anthologies offer more generous selections of accomplished poets, and will, one imagines, be much more frequently consulted by readers looking for a favorite poem.
