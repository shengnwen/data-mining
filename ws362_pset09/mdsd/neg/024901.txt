Having played chamber music as a seriour amateur most of my life, I recognized with a smile some of the anecdotes which the author recounts of his musical evenings.  This is 5% of the book.
The rest is overblown pretentious musings on the nature and value of amateurism with a watch-me-go display of unpersuasive humility and academic erudition about other irrelevancies. 
If you've played, you know the few charming parts already.  If you don't, this book is largely filler
