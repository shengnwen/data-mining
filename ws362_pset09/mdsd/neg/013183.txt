I have to agree with the many who did not like this book. I got it from the library and tried to read it, but couldn't get past the self-indulgent writing style. It almost seems like someone was too lazy to edit this book or make it readable for the reader. Any writer can put down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but it takes hard work and effort to edit and revise with the reader in mind. A writer should want the reader to enjoy the process of reading a book. A book is written to express oneself, but also for the reader. Without the reader, the book is nothing.
