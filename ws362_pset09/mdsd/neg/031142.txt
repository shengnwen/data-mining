If you're not offended by the contents of this book, there are three possibilities: 1) You live in a compound prostrate to a tyrannical religious leader who allows you little to no access to the outside world. 2) You're regularly featured in D Magazine. 3) You sustained a serious brain bleed while concentrating on 33 Down in National Enquirer's weekly crossword puzzle. 

The main character, never named by the author, takes us along on her daily travails that involve such hardships as agonizing whether to turn down a flight on a private jet with a married man or fly commercial, considering whether to become friends with a woman who wears last-season's Manolos, and debating whether it would be really wrong to sleep with her best friend's boyfriend multiple times since she already slept with him once. 

The sad thing is for a book that chronicles the lives of young, New York socialites who have everything and want much more, it doesn't offer its readers much of anything. The plot never thickens. The characters never take on dimension. We just end up following no name around to her parties, showers, waxing appointments, shopping expeditions, and boyfriends' bedrooms (hers or someone else's). While some might consider the ride fun and the vernacular (totally beyond, moi, tres chic, etc.) cute, most readers will tire of it by the end of the first chapter. 

The only thing the book offers of any value is an insight into a twisted subculture of totally selfabsorbed, impossibly superficial, anorexia-endorsing ninnies who make us feel much better about springing for that new pair of shoelaces when we just could have laundered the old ones
