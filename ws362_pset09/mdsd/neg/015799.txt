I ordered this book twice. Each time it came missing about 30pages and a reprint of another section instead. I'm still waiting on Amazon to contact me regarding this as they were going to contact their warehouse about it and get back to me in two days. It's been atleast four days now and I still haven't heard anything about it. So make sure you check your copy for missing pages, I believe around page 120
