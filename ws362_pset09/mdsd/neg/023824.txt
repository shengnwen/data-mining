Bill Holm's book sits among the many I've read during my consistent and methodical research of China, and embarrassingly so.  I struggled greatly just getting through the opening and could not help becoming irritated at Holms' seemingly pompous and egotistical views of Chinese culture.  I've traveled to China and other parts of Asia and have managed to keep in mind that if one travels to another country with expectations born out of their own culture, they end up making sarcastic, pessimistic, negative remarks about their experience. Not all of this is true concerning Holm's work.  Some parts of the book were fairly accurate, but nothing that in my opinion deserves a second glance.  He appeared to sprinkle a heavy amount of egotism and fluff into the mix, regurgitating much of his past knowledge and studies in response to a culture over five thousand years older than our own.  This left a very bad taste in my mouth and especially the fact that he has taught ESL in the country for only a year.  I personally think that this book simply served as a stage on which to act out his superior attitude and like some so-called educated individuals, simply regurgitate memorized facts in which to impress his audience, adding rote references to his own egotism and clumsy, rude American ways, which do not make up for this embarrassment. I would not recommend this book to someone researching China culture but possibly to someone looking for entertainment by a pseudointellectual keeping the seesaw of low self-esteem versus ego balanced with his attempt at humor
