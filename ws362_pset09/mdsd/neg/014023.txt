Granted, italian history is not one of the easiest histories to understand, but the geniuses at oxford could have done a better job bringing the history down to a level us mere mortals can understand. they talk about the stuff like I have already studied it, like its just a review. In my opinion, in order for this book to be better it would need to be much, much, longer in length with more clear details, especially about the politics. however, it does cover everything, so its not a one-starer. rock on
