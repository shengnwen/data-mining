I don't understand the motivation of authors that claim the USS Liberty attack was anything but accidental. Sure they'll get some sales from the neo-Nazi conspiracy nuts, but isn't being honest more important?  In short this book still can't answer the $64,000 question of why ISrael would purposely attack their ONLY ally in 1967.  If this friendly fire incident were something else, the US would not have begun giving military aid to Israel, (they started this policy in 1968) Israel and the United States are 2 of a kind, they have the courage to fight terrorism, and this book is simply making up a conspiracy that never happened.  Don't quit your day job Anthony Pearson, whatever it is
