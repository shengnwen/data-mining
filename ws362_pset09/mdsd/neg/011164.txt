I teach a computing ethics course at an area University.  I did not select this book as my text when I reviewed texts for use in the Fall 2004 semester.  I did choose Spinello and Tavani's new reader; but this book--like most of the predecessors Spinello has written--would drive my students nuts -- and they wouldn't know why. Bottom line: poorly written and not easy to read -- lots of tough sentence choices made.  However, as with Spinello's other books, there are some points he makes that no other computing ethics texts' authors do make!  So, I'll glean those points out of his text and present them to my students rather than force them to work their way through and around his prose
