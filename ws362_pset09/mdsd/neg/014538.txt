After reading Angela's Ashes and Tis by Frank McCourt, I was looking forward to reading more about the McCourt family's lives from the perspective of another member of the family but Malachy McCourt definitely does not have the talent of his brother, Frank. He focuses too much on himself and I could sense his ego becoming more and more inflated as the story progressed.  I'm sure he is charming and witty but an entire book by the author telling us just how charming and witty he is does get to be tiresome.  And the fact that he is so proud to be such a total scoundrel is not admirable.  I also read Malachy's book, A Monk Swimming: A Memoir, and in both books I was hoping to read more about the entire family instead 95% about Malachy himself and how pleased he is of his escapades.    

The book became tiresome to read and I had to force myself to finish it
