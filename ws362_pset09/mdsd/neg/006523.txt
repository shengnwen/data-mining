Just a rehash of the current fad thinking on compensation. Got to question the credentials of the author---PhD in sociology,  background in social work, never worked in the field, yet is on the b-school staff? With this social work background, one can see the roots for the bizarre "stretch" idea here---assign every employee a compensation case worker??? With its  outrageous tuition , the b-school students deserve someone with an apprpriate background. I liked the large font and graphics
