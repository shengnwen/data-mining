I would have rated this book with no star if I could. Severin was such a horrific character. Forget about the rape scene, what about the one where Severin punished Hastings for being jealous of Lady Marjorie by tying her to the ground and made her eat on the floor with his dogs in front of everyone in the dining hall????!! Is that supposed to be romantic? This is suppposed to be a romance novel, not strictly historical fiction. As such, there has to be some romantic element to the story, but I found nothing romantic whatsoever between Hastings' and severin's relationship.
This is definitely the worst book I've ever read bar none!
