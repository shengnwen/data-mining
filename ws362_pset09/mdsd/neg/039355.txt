I had purchased this workbook intending to use it to help study for the PMP Exam.  Although the workbook does contain over 300 pages of sample  questions that might be helpful in studying for the exam, it does NOT  include answers to any of the questions.  Therefore, there is no way to  verify that you've answered the questions correctly, which made the  workbook of very little value to me.  I decided to return it to Amazon  unused
