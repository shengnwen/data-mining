I started out an avid Eco fan. I read Focoult's Pendulum. Twice! Name of the Rose, Island... and Misreadings. Loved the first two, learned a lot from all of Umberto's books. Brilliant man and tireless writer.

But when I read The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, I kept glancing ahead to see if it would get better. Quite a bit went into the pictoral essay of 20th Century book art. I gave Eco the benefit of a doubt; after all, when has he ever let me down before? Though I commend his errudition...isn't it dreadful when the word comes up in a review? It isn't enough to bring a promising premise out of the flatline of death (no pun intended). The final act of the book just plunges into an absurd pagent of kitsch, that must have been a tribute to pop-culture icons, but in the end the payoff was miniscule. 

My overwhelming aftertast of The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana was disappointment. It seemed the book had promise to deliver the kind of excitement and intrigue of Focault and Name...but instead, ended up reading like a bibliography catalog of Out-of-Print/Permanently Discontinued books that died on dusty shelves, now long forgotten
