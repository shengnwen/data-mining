The book cover tells us that Wagener was a journalist for 30 years.  This book makes me wonder what kind of journalist he was.  The book is full of inaccuracies.  Some examples:  he calls cosmonaut Alexi Leonov Alexi Leonor; he states that Christa McAuliffe was selected as the Teacher in Space because she won a "Why I Want to Go Into Space" essay.  (cheapening her hard work and ultimate sacrifice); he writes the shuttle's solid rocket boosters fall into the ocean and are never used again even though they are recovered, refurbished, and reused.  There is no documentation for statements he makes that contradict other records.  This is poorly written and researched book.  I have told my wife, who is the director of our local library, not to waste money buying the book.  I won't donate my copy to the library.  Ignore the book and read the books written by those who were a part of the effort of going to the moon.
