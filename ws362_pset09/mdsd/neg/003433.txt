This book has some good information on what to look for during growth spurts and developmental leaps however, I can not believe some of the comments they published in this book!  It really upset me.  One stated how the mother gave her baby a "good shake".  New moms read this for advice!  There is a box on the page that says "shaking CAN be harmful".  Can???  Shaking IS ALWAYS harmful and NEVER ok.  The very next page begins to describe how a mother admits to SLAP her baby not because she doesnt like him, but because she wants him to be happy and she feels alone!  What a horrible message to give to mothers.  I am not even finished reading this book not even halfway done, but I don't know if I want to now!  Im afraid that someone will read this at their wit's end and think its ok to do these things
