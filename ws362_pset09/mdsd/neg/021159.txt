While this book is very well written & has a plot that holds together well, I was very disappointed in its content as contrasted with what I anticipated based upon the jacket description. While I know you cannot judge a book by its cover, I was surprised to find this book was a tragedy of monumental proportions. As a sensitive person, it left me depressed in the extreme. In the end, the heroine is left with nothing and no one (except a maid), but her revelation about God's "love" ("his/her" love??? - how can that be when there is so much hopelessness & suffering!) is supposed to be enough to sustain her through the rest of her old age & life. The poor illuminator Finn gets a granddaughter, but he is such a broken man at the end that I didn't believe he would be around to raise her for very long. And Kathryn finding comfort in God after all the horrors of medieval society just seems repulsive to me. I believe jacket descriptions are getting way out of line lately, as this book was nothing more than a RELIGIOUS (RAH! RAH!)tome, cloaked in a medieval setting w/ romantic cover art. You better like religion & the teachings of God if you are thinking about reading this book. I didn't enjoy it, as there was nothing much to enjoy except the writing, since the plot was nothing short of a confirmation of the hopelessness & joylessness of much of human existence. (Thought the way the characters spoke seemed way too modern, inconsisent, & somewhat cheesy for my tastes too!). I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless they were searching for God's love & were already true believers in the wonderousness of religion
