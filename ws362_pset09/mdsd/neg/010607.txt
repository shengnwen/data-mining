Although this book has a lot of interesting information and photos, it it so tediously written and so focused on specific archeological finds that it was very disappointing overall.  There was very little "overview information" about the Celtic lifestyle.  If you want a lot of archeological detail this book is for you.  But if you are looking for a more general book with information about the Celtic lifestle you will never make it through this textbook-like work
