Very disappointed in this book.  Contrary to it's description, it does not help you develop a specialty of your own, but describes a bunch of pre-existing specialties.  The book is really just a collection of magazine quality articles covering the only the very basics of each area.  There are entire books written about writing in the subjects of the various chapters that are far more useful as books about writing than is this one.  This book could only be useful to somebody who needs the obvious pointed out to them
