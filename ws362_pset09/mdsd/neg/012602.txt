I have to start with the fact that this is, in fact, an outstanding story and concept. The idea and plot are solid and the characters interesting. However that is where the book falls apart. The Story is great but the writing is atrocious. I have seen better writing from kids in the 6'th grade. Either Mr. Swanwick is off his A.D.D. medication or he needs to get on some, and FAST!. The storyline jumps around frantically, there is virtually NO character development short of the main two and even they are pathetically "explained". The "species" and "Classes" are left to be assumed as to their place in the world woven for us. Unless you are a fantasy "buff" you would never understand 3/4 of the phrases used. The mix of lower level writing interwoven with PHD level words and explanations of scientific theories interwoven with magical power is beyond mind bending when you try to shift gears between S.A.T. words and ideas of scientific theory and fantasy troll vs troll with arms getting ripped off as insane porographic sex with some pedophile overtones is occuring right next to it. 

My review is hard enough to follow, the book is 5 times worse. I will never disgrace my expansive library with a book of this authors again.
