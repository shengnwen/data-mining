I feel compelled to write a review to warn people that this is a pretty disturbing book.  I thought the back cover was completely misleading.  The book is about cat death - tons and tons of cats die in horrible ways.  The descriptions are graphic.  There is not a normal relationship between a woman and her cat wherein the woman loves and grieves the cat - it is written with complete emotional distance.  If the author wasn't famous for other work I can't imagine any publisher publishing this book.  Awful doesn't do it justice.  If you want to read about cats dying, written in a completely dispassionate, matter-of-fact, &quot;oh-well&quot; way go for it.  Otherwise, SKIP THIS BOOK
