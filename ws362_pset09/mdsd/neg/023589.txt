I bought this book on a whim because an Amazon dealer had a used copy at a low price. I would have never bought it if I had browsed through it in a store. This book is a spoof but the problem is it just isn't funny. Period. I remember years ago Mad magazine had a piece on Yellow Pages for superheroes--companies that made secret lairs, costumers and so on. That one article had more laughs than this whole book.
