Thank God I didn't have to pay for this book. It's overloaded with information that I didn't find helpful in actually learning to speak Spanish. Even a retired person, such as myself, began to grow impatient with the abundance of information that was not directly related to speaking Spanish. If you really want to get to the "meat" of Spanish vocabulary and grammar, you would do much better by purchasing "Spanish Grammar for Indepedent Learners." It is expensive but I think it's much better than Spanish for Dummies. 
But even with Spanish Grammar for Indenpendent Learners, you will still need private lessons or a good Spanish course. If you like learning on your own, Pimsleur is excellent. It's my favorite because the Spanish is very formal, you'd have to go to Spain if you wanted to learn Spanish more formal. If you don't like the formal Spanish and just want to learn Spanish for communicating with employees, customers, co-workers, or for dating, then you may prefer Learning Spanish Like Crazy.
