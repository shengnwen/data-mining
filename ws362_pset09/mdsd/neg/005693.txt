Everdell does a  competent job of arranging what is essentially a series of essays on a variety of Modernist thinkers. Unfortunately, I believe his book is too specific for the general reader and does too little with covered ground to interest the scholar. By focusing on the person rather  than the subject, the book fails to say much when taken as a whole.  Everdell gets bogged in the minutia of each thinkers' work without really  exploring the connections between them and this prevents him from breaking  new ground on the broader historical understanding of Modernism. In the  end, a lamentable flaw but not a fatal one and for the reader somewhere  between generalist and scholar, this book should offer something of  interest
