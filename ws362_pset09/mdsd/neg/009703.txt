Uh oh.  The remnants of the Empire are gathering together to form a threat to the New Republic.  Uh oh.  There is a giant superweapon being constructed using the original plans and scientists who worked on the Death Star.  Sigh.  Out of all the possible stories that able to be told in the Star Wars Universe (see the Medstar Duology and the  Republic Commando novels for examples), this is the story that Darksaber tells.  For Star Wars, one must say "how prosaic".  It's all been done before.  Two movies and danced around in the novels.  This is the best that Kevin Anderson and Lucasfilm could come up with for the novel?  

Oh, well.  Here's the deal: The Hutts are gathering components to build said superweapon, the title weapon.  Remnants of the Empire, Admiral Daala and Pallaeon (second in command to Grand Admiral Thrawn) are pulling together various warlords to strike at the heart of the New Republic and hurt the New Republic bad.  Luke Skywalker is seeking to find a way to restore the Jedi Powers of his love Callista.  Leia, Han, and Chewbacca are investigating the Hutts to find out what the Hutts are planning.  This all comes together with a major threat to the New Republic.  

If it wasn't for the fact that this book is much of the same old same old for Star Wars fiction Darksaber wouldn't be that bad. Kevin Anderson has crafted a fast paced classic feeling Star Wars novel.  The word "classic" is used here in the sense that the style is reminiscent of the original Star Wars trilogy.  So, the action is fun and there are quips and back talk and little guys vs the Big Bad, but the novel just felt like a retread.  It is a tired story.  Anderson's writing isn't strong enough to overcome a story that does not add anything significant to the Star Wars Universe.  It's middle of the road Star Wars.  Nothing special to see here.  Not truly worth the effort.
