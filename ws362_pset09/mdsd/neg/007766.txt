I am conservative on most issues but I do have some problems with our strategies in the Iraq war.  I have a very liberal friend who is in love with the term "Neocon".  He is constantly critizing me for reading "right wing" propaganda so I said I would give his idea of a great book a try.  I read a little over half of the book and I couldn't take it anymore.  I found myself dreading getting back to the book each day, to me this is just a liberal antiwar hit piece.  There are some good questions in the book on our strategies and troop deployment.  But the author's hate of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Rice take over and cloud every chapter.  He makes the Neocons sound like Dr. Evil's Chamber in the Austin Powers movies.  His referencing was always from the far left blogs and publications, he constantly referenced conversations that could never be substantiated.  My friend told me this was a historical book, apolitical, I think not.  Read it if you want to, I couldn't get through it.  Ann Coulter is an idealogue, but at least she is funny
