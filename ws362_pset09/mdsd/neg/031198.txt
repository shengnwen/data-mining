I had high hopes when I bought this reproduction cook book, based on my memories of my mother's (1947) edition of this famous cook book. However, the '47 edition was much better. This one is full of '50s-era recipes, with lots of canned food, gross casseroles made of Spam, etc. Plus the pages are "browned" to look like the book is aged, which just adds to the yucch factor. The food looks icky and the layout and illustrations are charmless. Want a retro cookbook? Buy the 1950 Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book (it's great!) or haunt the used bookstores for an old edition of The American Woman's Cook Book. Both are superior to this one
