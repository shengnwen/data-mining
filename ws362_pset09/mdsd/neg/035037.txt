I had fond memories of this book from years ago, so I used it for my creative writing class. I was surprised, upon revisiting it, to find out how little it offers in the way of actual terminology, which is pretty important information when you want to talk about parts of poems or parts of fiction. If the parts don't have names, it's hard to have specific conversations about pieces of writing. Also, I and my class were turned off by the long lists of what NOT to do. My students found this to be somewhat patronizing and definitely an introduction to writer's block as that list of negatives rang its little list of 'not' in their ears. Further, Minot places a lot of emphasis on writing about family and the relationships therein. Most writers know that relying on the familiar is not always a good idea, as it can result in the trite, the sentimental, or the overly dramatic. It takes a long time to learn how to control the elements of the familiar to make it &quot;fiction&quot; that can be talked about with others, so this does not seem a good approach for beginning writers. Minot does not seem to like writing as an exploration of writing. He seems to favor it more as a means of exploring personal relationships. He does present many good ideas in the book, but they are good in the way that most obvious information is good--great to have, but irritating to receive
