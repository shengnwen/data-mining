I just purchased three different 50 State Quarters books to try as the quarters fall out of the one I have.  The other reviewers who weren't happy with this item are spot on.  This is the worst of the three. 

It looks great and has a lot of useful information about each state and the order of release.  But the holes are too small though I didn't need a hammer to push the quarters in.  It's clear given the tight holes and the force needed to get the quarters in that it would only be a matter of time before I ripped through the paper thin cover.

This is personal taste, but I don't like that the P and D are in totally separate groups rather than having both coins for each state together
