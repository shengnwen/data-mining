If you're an armchair general who never served in the military and who believes that professors know more about war than soldiers, this is the book for you.  If you love dreary writing, buy two copies.  If tendentious history is your thing, buy three.  This is campus arrogance with little sense of the complexity, confusion and danger of battle.  But if you're just aching to believe that generals are all dummies, and that anybody with a doctorate in international relations could run our wars better than the men and women who sweat, bleed and die for our country, this is the perfect book for you.  Good trees died for this
