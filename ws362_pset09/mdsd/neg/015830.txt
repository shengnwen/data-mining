I can understand the enthusiasm behind this little tract (it's not a book, though it costs a book's ransom).  I can understand Timothy Freke wanting to reach out and offer his insights into the true nature of reality.  But this just doesn't give us enough.  Wake up?  Yes, he's right.  Most of us are sound asleep.  But yelling wake up! is no more helpful than telling someone in crisis to "pull their socks up."  Meanwhile, there's so much out there that offers truly stunning glimpses into the nature of consciousness...and I don't mean the desperate brain scientists who keep trying to convince themselves and us that all things wild and wonderful are abberant chemicals gone awry in the brain, very much including after-death experiences.  I noticed one reviewer mentioned Seth.  If you can get past the fact that it's "channeled," a real voice that will turn your world inside out is Seth.  Jane Robert's Seth.  I was a Catholic, but I'm still a philosophy freak.  Read it all my life.  And no one and nothing touches Seth for a cohesive and utterly convincing glimpse into reality as it is/isn't...not Plato, not Socrates, not Plotinus, not the Epicurians, and certainly not the later Gnostics.  As for Lucid Living, well...nope.  Not enough for serious, or even not so serious, seekers
