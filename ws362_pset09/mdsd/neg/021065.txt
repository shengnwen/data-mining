This is a decent collection of tales.  All the popular stories are included; however, there are some tales that didn't make much sense.

Readability is average.  I wouldn't recommend giving this book to a child to read.  As for a parent reading this book to his/her child, the overuse of colons, semi-colons, and commas can make for difficult story telling.

Overall, if you're looking for a good collection of tales by Hans Christian Andersen either just to keep or to read to your child, you may want to pass on this book
