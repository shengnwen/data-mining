I had what is like an allergic reaction to this book.
I have this fear that if I don't say something this might be mistaken for a great novel...
there is no great poetry here; just fascination with death and death.
My reaction was like litmus paper:
this is a disgustingly self centered book about:
1) suicide
2) homosexuality
3) " painfully susceptible sensibilities"
" Virgina Woolf put a stone into the pocket of her coat , walked into a river and drowned."
Over and over and over...
It makes you afraid of reading Virginia Woolf.
Well, the book made me want to read Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf anyway
