I thought this book would provide information (it does, but very little) about the lazy scholarship and outright denial that many leftist, particularly, in academia have about communism.  The book ends up being a whole lot of name calling, and very little presenting of actual facts.  

I recognize the schizophrenic love affair the left has with communism and am always looking for more and more (as if it was needed) facts to show how evil and devestating communism is.  Instead, this book belongs on the bookshelf next to Al Franken and Ann Coulter and more ideological shrieking. 

Don't waste your time, this book is so much fluff.  I only gave this book two stars because, it rightly points out the state of denial someone must still be in to think communism is a good government system
