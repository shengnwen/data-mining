This book has its good points, particularly where McGee is talking about how we got to where we are today, or analyzing the forces that make self-help what it is. But I don't really understand how that's supposed to help us find our way out of this mess, and to me, that's the crux of it: Okay, here we are, what do we do now? Really, the amount of practical advice in this book is nil. I realize that in a way if the author gave advice she'd be in effect writing a self-help book of her own, and that was not she set out to do. Still, you'd think that at the very least the book would help you understand which self-help program is better than which other program, where to go for real help if you need it, etc., and that's something McGee never gets around to doing. So in the end what's the point? Just to tell us what is? Anybody who's ever put on Oprah or Dr. Phil knows the score there without needing somebody like McGee to tell us
