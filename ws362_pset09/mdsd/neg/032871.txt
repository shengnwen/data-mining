well this essentially an exceprt from the much larger story of my life.   it is essentially the autobiography of a self-absorbed ladies man.   womanizing, debauchery and what seems to me to be pure boasting fills the  book. i found it to be ok but definately felt i could have been doing  something better than reading this
