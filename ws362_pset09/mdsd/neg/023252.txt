I am a beginning student of Islam.  I am also American.  While initially excited by Immam Rauf's insights, they began to unsettle me in terms of their apologetic and overly simplistic tone.  In trying to present a one-to-one correspondence-type analysis between Islam and American democracy, much of the complexity of Islam is either lost or ignored.  America, in a sense, becomes the yardstick by which Islam is explained.  I think this is a very dangerous approach.  It gives people-Americans, especially-the impression that they understand Islam when, in fact, they do not.  Islam must be explained on its own terms (complete with its profundities and its limitations), not the terms of an other political system and culture.  While certainly not as harmful and aggressively wrong headed as Irshad Manji's, &quot;The Trouble with Islam,&quot; I do not recommend Rauf's exegis as a place to begin the study of Islam.  A far more productive and insightful book is Carl W. Ernst's, &quot;Following Muhammed.&quot
