The protagonist in Cosmopolis is Eric Packer - a 28 year old billionaire who spends a day crossing a gridlocked Manhattan in his cork lined limo to get a haircut. Eric is one of the 1990s Masters of the Universe - his life is ruthlessly pared down to ensure maximum efficiency, regular meditations ensure an icy calm, he ensures his body is kept in check by having a doctor give him a rectal examination inside his limo and he gets his mistress to pour chilled vodka on his genitals for kicks, he has also taken a reckless punt with his fortune on the fluctuations of the yen. In other words, a raving lunatic. 

As other reviewers have noted, Cosmopolis seems icily detatched from any realistic paradigms. The characters are so freeze dried that any sympathy for them is nullified, the action takes place in a hyper-croweded Manhattan filled with a Sufi rapper's funeral, pastry assassins, political protests, a Presidential visit all on the same day. Even pre 9/11 New York didn't have days as insane as this. The dialogue is coldly intelligent, like in White Noise and Underworld, but at least in those novels the ideas espoused were interesting. In Cosmopolis the central themes of capitalist uber power and rampant technology seem dated and the pared down Delillo style seems almost android, as if his characters were computer generated rather than homosapien.

It is funny, several major authors have tried to cover the overdrive atmosphere of New York circa 2000 (Fury - Rushdie, The Diviners - Moody) and all seem to be terrible novels. Perhaps this era doesn't lend itself to good literature, perhaps it is too recent to be made into art, or perhaps this pre 9/11 golden age only existed in the minds of wealthy US based writers
