MY DAUGHTER IS TWO AND WE HAVE BOUGHT MOST OF THE &quot;POTTY&quot; BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE IS MY LEAST FAVORITE.  THIS BOOK MAY BE FINE FOR AN OLDER  CHILD WHO IS LEARNING ABOUT HIS OR HER BODY, BUT FOR A TODDLER WHO IS  TOILET TRAINING.  MY CHILD LOST INTEREST IN THIS BOOK ON THE THIRD PAGE.  I  AM A FAN OF THE WHAT TO EXPECT SERIES, AND I HAD HOPED FOR AN EQUALLY GOOD  CHILDREN'S SERIES, BUT SADLY THAT WAS NOT TO BE
