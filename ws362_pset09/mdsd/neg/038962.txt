 I FOUND THIS BOOK HARD TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE WORDS THE AUTHOR USED, IT WAS NOT A GOOD READ, IT TOOK ALOT FOR ME TO GET THROUGH IT. SHE REPEATED HER SELF SEVERAL TIMES AND SOME THINGS DID NOT MAKE SENSE. I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WOMEN VOLUNTARILY WENT TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMP WITH HER PARENTS AND CHILDREN. IF SHE WANTED TO BE WITH HER HUSBAND WHY DIDN'T SHE GO AND LEAVE HER CHILDREN WITH HER PARENTS. ALSO THE ENTIRE BOOK WAS TO CLINICAL. I HAVE READ SEVERAL  BOOKS ABOUT THE HOLCAUST AND THEY WERE REMARKABLE THIS ONE WAS NOT , I SHOULD HAVE SAVED MY MONEY
