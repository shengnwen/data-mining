Unfortunately, Mr Bickle's book is little more than unauthoritative ideas taught with authority.  Many of his statements of truth begin with, "I belive that" and "I am convinced that" followed by teachings that cannot be proven in the Bible.

He lifts up Paul Cain as a prophet equal to Old Testament prophets. Hmm.  Cain has claimed that Jesus rode in the car with him one day and in order to discourage his upcoming marriage, placed his hand on him and removed all sexual temptation from him for life.  Of course, Cain would later fall into sexual sin.  Old Testament prophets aren't what they used to be.

Bickle is the prophetic movement's damage control arm.  He is there to do the PR when things go wrong. For example, in this book he relates that one time a prophecy happened where a man told another man he was to have a music ministry.  Bickle says that guy blew the prophecy because what he really saw was musical notes surrounding the guy.  He interpreted the prophecy wrong. Oh, if only God would stop being so unclear!

I could go on, but I don't want to take the time. If you are a believer, pick read ALMOST ANY book on Bible interpretation and learn to discern truth from falsehood.  If only Bickle had done so as a young man, we wouldn't be subjected to such nonsense
