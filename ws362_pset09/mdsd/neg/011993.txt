I'm astounded that this appalling and dangerous book is still in print; the publishers should be ashamed. This piece of fiction was dredged out of the mind of a disturbed young woman by her psychiatrist. Dr Pazder encouraged Michelle to believe her fantasies, thus damaging a disturbed person even more. 

(They married after he was cited in divorce proceedings. In Britain that would be called professional misconduct; I don't know if that applies in the States.)

I call this book dangerous because it almost single-handedly sparked off the urban myth and moral panic of so-called "Satanic Ritual Abuse" spread by a small number of Evangelical Christians in the 1980s. Parents were falsely accused of abuse, and children were torn away from their families by over-zealous social workers who had been taken in by this dross, some not being returned for several years.  Almost no one in authority has ever apologised.

If you want to know the truth about "Satanic Ritual Abuse", read Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism by Gareth J Medway, or Speak of the Devil : Tales of Satanic Abuse in Contemporary England by Prof Jean la Fontaine, who researched and wrote the British Government's official report on the subject.

Then throw Michelle Remembers in the rubbish bin where it belongs
