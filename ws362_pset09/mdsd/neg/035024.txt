This was probably the worst written book I have ever read. I only had to read it because I was doing a repport on child abuse. The author only said one paragraph on the abuse. It was incredibly unreal and reading about  Chip's boring life was like a punishment. The author skipped around too  much and had no real sense of time. It was confusing, since it made no  sense. Do not read it! Pick another book! Anything is better
