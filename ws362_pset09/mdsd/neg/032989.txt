I have taken several courses on public relations in school. Most of what Michael Levine teaches is totally opposite of what several of my professors have taught me.  In all fairness to Levine, perhaps the practices described in his book were sufficient way back when the book was written, but the world has changed quite a bit since then, and the pace of Public Relations has changed along with it. I understand he wrote a follow-up book called Guerrilla PR Wired which pertains to using the internet as a valuable PR tool, but I know that using his outdated techniques, even with the help of the internet, would still not be the least bit helpful. I certainly would not recommend this book to other students who are preparing for a career in the field of PR
