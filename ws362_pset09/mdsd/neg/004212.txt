This book was required for my MSME applied thermodynamics course. I was very disappointed by the layout, style of writing and even the content of this book! As an example, chapter 1 deals with the First Law of thermodynamics. It takes 45 pages to state 1 equation...the rest being useless information such as Poincarré's lesson at the University of Paris. 
Every single student in class with me wished they had not bought this book. I would recommend for engineering students, "Fundamentals of engineering Thermodynamics" by Moran and Shapir
