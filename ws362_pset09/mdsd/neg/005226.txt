I was attracted to this book by the lovely illustrations. I foolishly chose to read it to my 5 year old at bedtime, without reading it to myself first. He found the story frightening. I found little redeeming value in  it-the lesson appears to be &quot;Fear strangers, especially if they look  different from you&quot;
