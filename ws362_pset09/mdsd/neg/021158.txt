After posting a so-so 3-star review of the first book in this series "Babylon Rising," I really hoped that "The Secret on Ararat" would show the author's ability to better develop the lead characters a bit further and to make Dr. Murphy in particular a stronger, cool character. It didn't. If anything, Dr. Murphy showed on several occasions a recklessness that put his team in danger.

Predictably enough, Secret on Ararat picked up where Babylon Rising left off. And the story of finding Noah's Ark definitely piqued my interest. But within about 30 pages the author blew it. I mentioned in my previous review that Lahaye had a tendency to get a bit preachy, but this book takes that to the extreme. 

No less than two-thirds of the book involves Dr. Murphy giving lectures (both figuratively and literally) to various people he encounters about Christianity, his love for Christ, and why we should take the Bible as fact. Regardless of my own personal beliefs, I didn't appreciate Lahaye's attempts to shove it down my throat.

The bottom line is I picked up the book for the subject matter and because I was hoping for a rousing, fast-paced biblical adventure. Well, there is some of that, but only a small portion of the book and mainly in the last few chapters. I was thoroughly disappointed with this sequel.
