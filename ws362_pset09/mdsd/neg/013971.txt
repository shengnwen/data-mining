As I have mentioned above, do not under any circumstances read (or even worse buy) this book. The layout is abolutely terrible and does the book no favours whatsoever. As indicated by previous reviews most of the proofs are completely glossed over with little or no mathematical rigour in sight.  The appendices for the selected chapters are pretty much void of any use, and I can't see why the contents of these appendices could not have been included in the chapters in the first place (not that it would of made much of a difference). Hardly anything is explained with much clarity here and I don't know about anyone else out there but I would consider a one line example not much help at all. Everything right down to the way the index is presented is substandard in this book and the authors "attempts" at humour constituted the proverbial last straw for me (I find the assumption that all mathematics students like Star Trek  somewhat insulting). In short this book is ABSOLUTE RUBBISH
