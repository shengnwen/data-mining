I'm giving this book a generous rating of 2 stars because I did read it at one sitting.  But I read it at one sitting because I saw a lot of potential to discuss the issues at hand - the examination of your motivations, relationships, wasted opportunities, etc. when you're coming to the end of life's road.  But the discussion was trivial and ultimately didn't work because Ms. Dean gave us characters who, after 304 pages, I didn't really know or care about
