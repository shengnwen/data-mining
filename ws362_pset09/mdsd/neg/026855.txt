It was simply to frustrating a read, bear in mind that I've read all the 8 other books. Now I didn't mind Mr. Goodkind dabbling with philosophy in Faith of the Fallen, as long as it supported the plot. 

Sadly this book is philosophical propaganda disguised as a fantasy book. The universe being used as a vehicle to prove Mr. Goodkind's pseudo intellectual philosophies. 

A character like Richard simply disgusts me now. From being a boy with strong beliefs, he has been molded into a righteous tyrant, who enforces his beliefs upon everybody and everything. Its sad to see. 

No. I really recommend anyone to stay clear of this book, its not worth the read. Its an insult to the reader, with endless monotonies and weak philosophy
