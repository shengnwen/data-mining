Before embarking on a 2 month trip to Italy a friend let me borrow Rick Steve's guide and said that it was better. I was skeptical but took the book anyway figuring it might come in handy on such a long trip. She was right. Rick Steve's organizes information in a much clearer and more intuitive way. This comes in handy when you're standing in a busy square, you haven't eaten all day and everything you've tried so far has been a jip and you just want someone to tell you where you can find a good deal. Flipping through Lonely Planet you might think you've been handed a manual on how to overhaul an engine - overloaded with information poorly organized. Rick Steve's book on the other hand is a breath of fresh air or, to put it more tritely, a helping hand. Not to mention that his guides have a personal touch and some of Rick Steve's own character sewn into them. After some time you really get the sense that he's there with you, helping you along (- now isn't that sweet!).
