I read this book after reading a number of books on simple living, particularly from a Christian perspective, and perhaps that's why I found it less compelling than the other reviewers. I really felt that this book only skimmed the surface of the value of simplicity, so for me, was not a helpful resource at all. I became annoyed at the way the author endlessly quotes brand names (did he get commissions from Best Buy stores?) and relied heavily on a theology of a highly interventionist God. 

It's easy reading thouh, almost like a sermon series, and if you are caught in a busy, materialist lifestyle it would be helpful, and fun to read. However, if, like me, you are already living simply and are looking for something to give you further inspiration, this is probably not the book for you
