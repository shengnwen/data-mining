i've read this entire series, which is quite fun.  At the same time, it's getting very annoying to read about the main character's weight.  The author states that Skye is satisifed with being a size 12 and then bemoans the fact that she will never be a size TWO.  Honestly, who is?  Does so much time have to be wasted on the character's weight..Get over it already or slim her down to an eight or a six.  Jeez
