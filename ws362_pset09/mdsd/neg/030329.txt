I may be in the minority, but I think these books are absolutely horrible. My twin's teacher reads them to the kids at school, and my daughter loves them. She brought one home to read to me, and I was appalled. I think they are tasteless and have no redeeming value to them at all. The grammar is horrible (this is how Junie talks), and although I know it is suppose to be funny,  I just don't get it.  The subject matter is even worse. I think kids are too young to worry about boys, and I do not believe I want my kids reading books that are so mean spirited. With all the wonderful choices in children's literature, why choose this
