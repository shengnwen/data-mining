Well, I read this "gem" because my 8th grader had to for class. Was the pig-rape scene or the graphic butchery of a beloved pet the most disgusting part?  I guess it's supposed to show  historical life in rural Vermont but I sure could have lived without it.  "Becoming a Man"?? There are far better books out there than this that can fit that bill. Long before my daughter remembers any "lessons" of this book, I'm sure the lingering descriptions of the rivers of blood and stench will stick with her. Plus, inbetween the great lessons we got about pig farming/butchery it's a pretty dull story.
