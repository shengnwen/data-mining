I have to admit I was sorely disappointed with this book. The author pitches female Dominance like she is a member of NOW; the objective, turning men into "sissy maids" that will do your every bidding.

Female Dominants need to respect and honor the gift of their pet's submission. For example: perhaps scene-oriented individuals enjoy forced feminization or cross-dressing because it involves some element of humiliation. But that is not what submission is about for everyone. Those of us who are D/s 24 x 7 focus far more on trust and developing the relationship. This book does not even come close to addressing the many challenges related to fear, communication issues, etc.

I found this book to be generally lacking in good taste. Its only redeeming value is that it covers several basic items about SS&C, but so do many other books on the subject of BDSM. I'd recommend finding an alternative over wasting money on this
