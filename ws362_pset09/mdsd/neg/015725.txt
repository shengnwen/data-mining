Sometimes one sees a book and struck by simply the title itself makes an impulse purchase.  As a "Westerner" living in the East, I purchased this book thinking it would provide more insight into the phenomenal Christian activity and growth that I see regularly here in the East.  The title, I would soon discover, is not the most accurate description of what the book entails.  

The book's primary interest seems to lay in a discussion of the vernacular translation of the Bible, and even that is focused especially on the African continent.  The non-western movement of Christianity is much broader than Africa, yet this is mentioned only as a side note in this work.  

The format of the work certainly is a love/hate item for myself.  Largely presented in a question and answer format ('interview format') that ranges from comical to frustrating to at times interesting.  I have found this kind of format, before as with this text, helpful at first but soon quite tedious as it plods on and on page after page.  When the author is not giving incredibly leading questions, his questions present the biased extreme of the 'enlightened' view.

These criticisms aside, the book did present some great insights.  I appreciated the response to questions on judging an individual's response to the Gospel and conversion.  Also appreciated is the presentation of the strength in the 'Designer's hand' of including all cultures and languages in His ultimate saving Gospel.  A person involved in Scripture translation would also find great encouragement in the author's high praise and respect for translation to the 'mother tongue.'

A cumbersome presentation (Q&A format), misleading title and bit wordy discussion of  the main topic (translation of the Bible into the 'mother tongue') cause me to give this book only 2 out of 5 stars
