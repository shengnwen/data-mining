I picked up this book not only for Smith's reputation, but b/c it seemed odd enough to fall in love with.  It was odd.  And although I can appreciate the lack of energy/motivation the main character possesses as a general stereotype on the new English generation, this book fell extremely short of readable.  I haven't read White Teeth, but I did see the short series that came out and if anyone is wanting to read Zadie Smith, stick with that and steer clear of this book
