This book attempts to emulate The Elements of Style by Strunk and White but it doesn't even come close. It is poorly written and organized and is likely to confuse its readers. It fails to provide good examples in many cases. Explanations which should be simple are often quite complex.

I minored in English and am an experienced well published writer but I found this book of little assistance. It is not particularly useful for teachers. I can not think of anyone who would find this book useful.

For anyone trying to improve their grammar or even learn it I would suggest Checking Your Grammar by Marvin Terban which is a superb book
