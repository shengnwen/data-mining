This book is an overly-detailed, almost academic discussion of organizational theory.  Some of the basic organizational principles include listing a project's &quot;processes or system[s] into manageable parts&quot; , breaking down projects into  prioritizing projects by how aggravating they are, tackling the #1's first, etc.  Her discussion of how to compose and analyze the daily to-do list is overly-detailed -- for example, calling a student's mother to determine why he didn't show up for class yesterday is an immediate task that just cropped up, while getting in touch with an equipment supplier is &quot;a basic, medium range task.&quot;  What does that mean??  And I don't think most of us struggle with figuring out what is really important and what isn't; what we need is something that will help us accomplish what is most important.  The financial planning section is overly detailed -- assess income, analyze fixed expenses, prepare a budget, etc.  I'm consulting a Getting Organized book because I need to get motivated and empowered to plow through the pile of clothes on the floor and the pile of papers on my desk -- This book is better-suited for folks who are already organized and want to be even more so.  This book might be a good choice if you are already reasonably organized and are looking for detailed discussions of the processes that might enable you to become more organized in all aspects of your life.  If you are currently at a lower level of organization, I recommend Don Aslett's books on clutter; for me, they have been much more readable and useful
