I was a bit surprised to see that there were so many glowing reviews of this book. I felt as though I must have read a different novel, as I found very little to like about it.

I found the plot tiring and tired-- a beat-down simple man swept away by a crazy damaged woman, and I found most of the plot elements (the abduction of the child, her emotional abuse) to be rather clumsy attempts at emotional manipulation rather than moving or hard-hitting. Dotty and Aubrey are some of the oldest characters in the world, and I found nothing particularly new in her treatment of them.

I was pleased to discover that it was her first novel-- the writing itself is skilled and it gives me hope that her work has improved over time. Still, I'd skip this one
