Maybe this book picks up later but I'll never know. God what a disappointment, this book is nothing but procedures. "I went to this office for this..", "I had to fill out the correct CIA form for that..", "I had a meeting with so & so...", geez. what a snooze-fest, I put it down under 50 pages, I can't take it, unless I need something to put me to sleep. I guess if your career is management, you'll find all this terribly exciting, for the rest of us, there's nothing here but bureaucracy & utter disappointment
