I am lawyer from Brazil, and wanted to get real information about the green card application process (without having to go through the dry explanation in the INS website) and was completely disapointed and upset when I received this book.  It does not cover anything in depth, and wastes a lot of time talking about temporary visas, fiance visas (I thougt it was supposed to explain about greencards!), special greencards for amerasians (which is not a very common situation)...    
As for what I was really interested in, which was the green card application process for work-related reasons, there is a small, incomplete paragraph and a suggestion that I find an attorney!!!!
Waste of money, useless -- if you want to get a green card, either find another book, check the INS website, or hire a lawyer, this book will not help at all.
