I think Eggers is a really good (sometimes fantastic) writer, but I also think he needs some help paring things down and coming up with a book that doesn't grind you down.  I've read both his books and scanned them at the end.  I sometimes think he's playing games, seeing what he can get the critics to buy into.  I can't believe the hype surrounding his books, the awestruck accolades.  I doubt that half those critics ever made it through the books.  I'll leave it at that, because I agree with most of the negative commentary on previous posts.  Eggers is an excellent writer in spurts, but I think he's a bit (ok, a lot) arrogant and needs a good editor
