Much as I admire Judt's writing and breadth of knowledge, I'm appalled that he allowed this book to appear without source notes and bibliography, which are relegated to a website. I imagine this was a compromise he reached with the publisher to enable the publication of an overly long manuscript, but it renders the work largely useless to serious readers
