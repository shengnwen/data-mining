Everyone keeps telling me this is a classic.  I think it's just awful.  It reads like it was written: a rambling, unedited, ill-considered, weakly plotted piece of whimsy jotted down by an ailing old lady... was riding her reputation here - Macabea is just someone who comes and goes.  This novel just isn't finished
