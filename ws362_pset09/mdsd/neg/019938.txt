After reading an overview regarding the plot of this book, I decided to give Ed McBain's latest novel a whirl.  After 20 minutes into the book, I had the mystery figured out.  Okay, I was a little off on one of the characters (I surmised it was a girl in the Caribbean and actually it was a black girl who worked at the local ice cream depot, but still...).  I read the entire book in one day and while enjoyable, it is predictable even to the politically correct Bush bashing (bad economy and he stole the election from Gore, dag-nabbit) which has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot.  If you want a mindless, easy-to-put-down and finish quickly book, "Alice in Jeopardy" is for you.  If you want a novel full of surprises and twists, amazing characters and an author who leaves his personal politics out of the story, pick up a Harlan Coben novel
