A nice book for the uninitiate, boring for anyone else. This is a very,very basic book on military hand to hand combat which reads more like a Readers Digest article than a true handbook. The martial arts heritage spiced with some photos of military units training in hand to hand combat and some big size drawings of basic strikes, throws and some disarming moves taken from military manuals and martial arts books makes up most of the content. If this would truly be the &quot;Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat&quot; than give God that our Green Berets never run out of Ammo. If you want something for real life buy the Krav Maga book
