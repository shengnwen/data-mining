The novel features totally unbelieveable plots, cardboard cutout figures whom it is hard to identify with or sympathize with, the strangest motivations masquerading as realism and an off-the-cliff ending that is not satisfying. The sex is near-pornographic and not believeable to the point of being almost funny. The main character has the behaviour of a robot and seems to have no inner life or feelings.  The author hates liberals so badly I think he would personally like to go out and kill them bare handed; this axe to grind gets in the way of the development of a coherent plot. On the other hand, much of the writing is good in a technical sense, in spite of the often angry and sarcastic tone.  Many scenes are very interesting and well-written; the whole work just does not hang together, especially when you consider it is written by an experienced writer with a background at the CIA. This is not Ludlum, or Le Carre and I enjoyed Clancy more.  I like being entertained and told a nuanced story, not beat over the head by a heavy-handed piece of agit-prop so favored by the late unlamented Soviet Union.  However, the author does manage to tell what is on many levels an interesting story. He needed an editor to intervene
