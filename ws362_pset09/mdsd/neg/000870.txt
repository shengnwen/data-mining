I read the reviews of this book and made the mistake of buying it based upon them, but this is really a very superficial book. From a historical point of view, it shows us how the NSC was created by Truman, primarily because he was so out of the loop while Vice President that he didn't even know about the Manhattan project to build the atom bomb, but as the book moves into more current events, political slants take over the turn the book into a very one-sided view of the US options available in today's world. Rothkopf is a "pragmatist" in the Kissinger mold, which I guess he would have to be since he ran Kissinger's shop, but his opinions really show very little depth, and really no historical perspective of options available in dealing with bin Laden and terrorism back when it could have been much more easily dealt with. There are some insights about how Clinton seldom attended NSC meetings when tectonic changes were taking place as he dallied with Monica, but this book isn't really a very sophisticated examination of the world today and how we got here, other than to criticize W Bush for the state of the world today without looking at the limited hand he was dealt by his predecessors when it came to Islamic terrorism. I would have given the book one star but the book's history of the NSC gives it some redeeming social value, but the last half of the book is really pretty worthless because it is so unbalanced and political.
