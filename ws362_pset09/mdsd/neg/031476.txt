Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.

The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.

If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club"
