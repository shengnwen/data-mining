I had high hopes for this book, but after reading it I realized how I got fooled by Peter Montoya's marketing plan for himself. He has branded himself as "the" guru of personal branding so that he can sell whatever he writes. In that regard, this book is a living example of how to manage a personal brand; however, in terms of substance it is quite a dissapointment. It is full of superficial observations and suggestions that even my mom could come up with. Peter, thanks for teaching me that if I want to be a successful brand I need to differentiate myself by being indispensible expert. That was such a revelation. But if you like Anthony Robbins, you might also like this. I am so glad I bought this used.
