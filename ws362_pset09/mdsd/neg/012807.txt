I purchased this book based on the posted reviews.  While I have immense respect, admiration and envy for what they were able to do, the book is very nearly unreadable.  The author writes in short, simple, dull sentences, that become irritating after a few pages.  I tried a number of times to read the book, because I am very interested in what happened, but I can't get past poor writing and (apparently) no professional editing.

If you are planning to purchase this book I have a request.  Please go to the option that lets you see inside the book and click "Surprise Me".  This will give you an random page from the book.  Please read this page and ask yourself if you would enjoy reading over 300 pages in this same writing style.  I wish I had done that before I ordered the book.
