Henig admittedly takes creative license to fill in some historical gaps, but she goes too far in propagating the misconception that Mendel sent a copy of his paper to Charles Darwin and that Darwin never read it. This urban legend (also brought up by other authors, such as Philip Kitcher) has made its way into newspaper articles and even textbooks. Catalogs of Darwins library in the early 1900's and later made no mention of Mendel's paper.  Instead, a secondary source by Focke that mentioned Mendel was in Darwin's library, with the relevant pages uncut. See Andrew Sclater's 2003 article in the Georgia Journal of Science
