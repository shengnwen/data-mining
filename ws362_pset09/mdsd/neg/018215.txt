As I read each "chapter", I find that I can see her punchline coming a mile away. Notaro does a great job painting a picture of herself with these stories and I feel like she's sitting there next to me telling me how her visit with Nana went or how she's landed a job to get her mom off her back. But it's like you're listening to the loud girl at school. The one who wants every one to hear her funny story, but we're all kind of bored with her tales by now. Because she tries too hard and she's predictable. I can also tell by the gleam in her eye she thinks she's creating a hilarious set-up, but I know what she's going to say before she says it and. I really wanted to like this book, and I feel bad writing a negative review. Usually I just wouldn't say anything, but I'm compelled to let people know I'm underwhelmed. 

It's not something I won't finish reading. But I wouldn't recommend it either. There are a couple of gems, and her subjects are all situations women in their 20s-30s can relate to (being the butch protectress of your hot friend at bars, using public restrooms, trying to get male attention, how to get drunk faster (skip dinner)) but for the most part, Notaro is trying to be really clever, but has taken a long leap past the clever line and landed just shy of annoying and blatant. If you want self-depricating humor and amusing family memoirs, spend your money on David Sedaris instead. It's not from a female perspective, but it's laugh-out-loud entertaining
