This method is what Chinese farmers have done for eons (4000+ years).  Every letter of W-O-R-D is a componenent of Chinese deep bed agriculture.  I find it shocking that someone can reinvent the wheel and proudly trumpet the reinvention.  I suspect he has read "Better Vegetable Gardens the Chinese Way" by Peter Chan with Spencer Gill(1977) and ripped it off.

I have a copy of this book and the parallels are too obvious.  Mr. Chan and his wife won Sunset Magazine's Best garden award in 1976 and the book was the result.  The unbelievable lack of intellectual honesty on Ed Smith's part offends me if no one else.

By the way, Peter Chan's book is worth getting.  It is short, succinct, to the point and very honest, plain, matter-of-fact.  Odd that the concept thief takes three-four times the space, but then liars often get more convoluted than the people they are plagiarizing, perhaps an unconscious attempt to obfuscate the theft
