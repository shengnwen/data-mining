I am a big fan of nostalgia and the early televison shows of the 50's and the 60's and love to gobble up books and information related to these great eras of tv. I purchased this book and found that there was very little to like about it, even for a fan like myself. I found the book boring and shallow. Very little of the book covers the popular tv shows. What happened?
