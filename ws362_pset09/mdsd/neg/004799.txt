I found some gems in this book but I don't recommend it. The authors should learn to write in English and the Publisher should learn the art of copy editing. Otherwise, this book could have worked.

Whoever wrote Chapter 15 did a good job and wrote the best material in the book. But, he/she still didn't give the reader an clear understanding of SASL. 

The authors attempted to tie everything together in Chapter 19 - A Company Mail Server. But, you literally cannot get it to work. I doubt anyone ever tested it. The LDAP setup is out of sequence and obliterates the directory. If you try to make this work - and I image people would buy this book for that reason alone - you might just wind up shaking your head in defeat. 

In summary, I see some lousy writing, a serious lack of editing and a book with incorrect information. It's difficult to recommend
