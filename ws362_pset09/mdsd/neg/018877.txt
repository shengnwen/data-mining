I read a lot, and this is one of the worst books I've read recently and certainly the worst "historical novel" ever.  It is neither historical nor deserving of the title novel.  It is comparable to a romance novel, however, the reader never gets invested in the characters and the sexual tension is non-existent.  Don't bother with this one
