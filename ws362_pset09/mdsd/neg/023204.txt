I have read Schoenfeld's book in an attempt to understand where and how anti-semitism sits within today's society, as part of some research work I have been conducting.

To be honest the book has disapointed me greatly. I have found the book full of half truths, missing counter points, which I feel completely insults the intelligence of the reader, assuming they have never performed any winder reading on the subject of the position of judaism and israel within today's world. In fact Schoenfeld takes the un forgivable position of actually wanting us to confuse anti-semitism with feeling against israel's political position.

For example, on page  29 Sheonfeld tells us, without any references that Palestine was nothing but sand and swap before the arrival of israel (already he is asking to consider anti-semitism along side the issue of palestine and israel). In these remarks he shows either his lack of research, or his desire to lie about the history of Palestine. We just need to look at the poster of franz krauz or look at books such as "Before their diaspora: A photographic history of the Palestinians, 1876-1948 (Unknown Binding) by Walid Khalidi" to see this is just not true.

Nowhere in the book does Sheonfeld address the anger people have towards the way israel has acted to it's neighbours, or the propoganda machine that tries to deny and rebrand the 1996 massacre at the Qana UN post. In fact it seems he doesnt care about exaplaining the reason why people may be ant-semtic/anti israeli, he just wants to cite and fabricate incidents of it.

This book seems to address more the rise of anti-arabism, and seeks to promote it. I would recommend this book only to people wishing to journey into the worrying fantasies of a very racist individual
