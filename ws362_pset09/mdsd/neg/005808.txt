I bought this book in anticipation of learning some new techniques with Photoshop CS2 with my digital photography. I am by no means a professional photographer. The book has great color examples and covers most of the areas that a photographer would need. However... the information has been covered before and in a more simple way in other books. I found it annoying trying to view the photo examples while reading the text as the examples are not on the the same pages as the text, I was constantly having to flip the pages to find the numbered example and then go back and read the text. Yes, there were quite a few color examples and like in the first review above, you cannot readily see the "changes" that were made because they are so subtle. I for one want to be able to "see" the changes that I've made. After spending the time working on the photo in photoshop I want to be able to see what I've done. The book does cover most of the aspects (workflow) of fixing a digital photo with Photoshop CS2 but there are other books that cover the material as thoroughly but more quickly with as much good color examples, i.e, Scott Kelby's Photoshop CS2 For Photographers. Also in the first couple of chapters, it tells you that you should take better photographs using the proper techniques in the first place so you shouldn't have to modify or fix the photo in Photoshop, well, duh? We are all not professional photographers and we want to be able to fix some of the problems we have with our photos and/or enhance them to make them look better. Other books cover the subject better than this one
