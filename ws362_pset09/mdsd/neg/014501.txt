This book is good if all you want is an overview of WHAT you CAN do, but is nearly worthless if you are a do-it-yourselfer and want to know HOW to do it. It has almost nothing about the nuts and bolds of how to pre-wire or connect components for any of the systems. Every time it almost get into a &quot;how-to&quot; paragraph they tell you to buy &quot;Home Improvement for Dummies.&quot; Hmmm, they get to sell two books instead of one... they're not dummies
