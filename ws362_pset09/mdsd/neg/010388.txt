First of all, I read a lot of motivational books - from Covey to Robbins to "Message to Garcia" to One Minute to Rhino Books to Michael Jordan to "How Full is Your Bucket" to Atilla the Hun to Moving Cheese. I read them all the time. It's a great thing to be able to pick up a small book like this one for the quick flight or the train ride home and use it to sharpen your sword. Its even better when you can get them on CD. Yes, I am one really motivated guy. 

I liked the book enough to read the whole thing. I don't like it enough to have to read it again and again like I tend to do with other motivational books. Plus I don't like it enough to buy multiple copies of it to give to poeple who work for me. 

The main reason for my take on this book is the extreme simplicity of the Fred Factor message. Be good and good things will come to you. Other than that, it was a quick read and it does have a few strategies and tactics, which did work to sharpen my own sword, but not very much. You should read this book and then pass it off again to someone you know who could use it.

By the Way - Check out the Rhino Books and Message to Garcia
