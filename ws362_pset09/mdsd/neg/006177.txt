This book provided little new or insightful information on the subject.  There is very little research provided, and many of the exercises I found to be forced.  There is nothing here that any well-read parent with common sense can't naturally figure out on their own.  I got the sense that the author was cashing in on Daniel Goldman's seminal work on Emotional Intelligence
