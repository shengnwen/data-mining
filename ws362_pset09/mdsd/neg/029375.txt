The novel was recommended in a Swiss newspaper and it sounded like an interesting book. However,  I found it rather disappointing. The plot is weak and the ending contrived and implausible. To my mind Sharpe didn't succeed in mixing satire, social realism, psychological insight and fantasy into a literary satisfying text. There are some real highlights, individual scenes and descriptions and dialogues, in which the author shows talent. But there are not enough to create a great novel
