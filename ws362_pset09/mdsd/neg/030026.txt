The Kite Rider. A book centered completely on the importance of obedience. A small boy living in a small village of 13th century china has to overcome everything that is taught to him and above all from the importance of obedience to the importance of respect for your elders. Through being strapped to a kite and being used as a wind tester for a merchant vessel, Haoyou's father, Gou Pei, is brutally killed by first mate Di Chou, and that sets Haoyou's life in for a whirlwind of events he could not have imagined possible.
After the horrific loss to Haoyou's family, Di Chou even tries so marry his mother -Qing An- an ambition he has long had. When Haoyou's greedy, gambling addicted uncle agrees immediately, Haoyou and his cousin Mipeng know they must do something. They send Di Chou (completely drunk) on a vessel, but to do that Haoyou bribes the seamen by being a wind tester. This brings The Great Miao, circus master of the Jade Circus looking for Haoyou to be one of his acts. Once again, Great Uncle Bo agrees for the money that he knows he can make out of it. Haoyou's kite riding act does well until the Jade Circus reaches the court of Kublai Khan, ruler of Cathay in 13th century china. There Bo challenges the Mongols to a kite ride, where the first person to come back to earth lost the bet. Haoyou wins, but he also happens to land in the Khans place of worship, a wagon full of grass and earth from the Mongolian steppes. This infuriates the Khan, and Haoyou is almost killed for his crime, had he not been offered as a secret weapon in the Khans moving army. 
This novel was really not that great a book for me personally. It was just too short and lacking that factor that makes me want to read more of it. It was far too simple a plot too. Its like a ten page book with 250 pages of vague details scattered in between the words. This is the first book I have read by Geraldine McCaughrean, and it is not inspiring me to read the second.
