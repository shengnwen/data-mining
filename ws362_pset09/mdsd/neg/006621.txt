That one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book.
This book is not meant for kids aged 4-8. It is well beyond what they understand. Frankly , i don't even think a 4 year old can even read this. Nice pictures. But unfortunately , i don't enjoy buying a book for pictures. I can get pictures anywhere. I didn't need to purchase this book to get them. Anyway , don't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures. With regards to the age group. Unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her
