I just threw this book away.  Not even worth trying to re-sell. Wish there were negative stars for ratings .... 

I got this book when we decided to give IVF a try and maybe my mistake was getting this book after 1 1/2 years of infertility treatments.  The information in the book was very dated.  Reading through the author's experiences was extremely traumatic for me, but after spending a day upset over 'how bad' the book made the IVF process seem, I realized that a large part of the author's bad experiences came from her having doctors who might have been the best medical doctors ever but who had little compassion for their patients.  And then reading through her incessant whining about how much she hated needles .... Infertility is a medical condition, but no one was forcing her to take shots nor was her life riding on that medicine (unlike many people who have to take shots of life-saving medicines every day).  

Even her bluntness was annoying sometimes.  Her "sorry, but that's the way it is" writing style might truly reflect her experiences, but my 2 years of infertility treatment experiences have not been like that.  There are many different types of infertility treatments and many different styles of REs/doctors.  You do not have to put up with competent but uncompassionate medical care.
