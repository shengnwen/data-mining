I bought this along with the hardback text (which I love) and find it next to useless. It's set up to coincide with the text, so you go to the chapter you've read, and it just has you fill in the blank sentences right out of the text. If you're into rote learning where you write or say something over and over, maybe you'll like it. I was hoping for something that would add to the book and help achieve greater understanding, or at least challenge me. Also, some of the parts are out of line with the chapter, like they must have updated one of the texts and not the other. The chapter review questions in the hardback text are MUCH more helpful, as is the website that goes along
