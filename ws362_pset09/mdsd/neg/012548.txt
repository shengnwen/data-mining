I'm not usually a fantasy reader, but I picked up The Summer Tree hoping to try out something different for a change.  I wasn't that impressed.  In summary, I found that the plot unraveled much too slowly, the author's writing style was way too overblown and many of the character's actions were simply unbelievable.  I did finish the book (hoping that things would get better later on) but I was extremely tempted to call it quits several times during the reading.  If you enjoy books that spend the majority of their time introducing you to an intricately developed fantasy world (and not necessarily driving a compelling plot), this novel may be for you.  However, I found it really difficult to get by the overly discriptive and dramatic writing style.  (Too many lines like &quot;the water lapped the shore gently, like a lover&quot; make me gag.) Now that I really think about it, I couldn't stand this book.  It's only for regular fantasy readers
