Having read Dan Jenkins' other works, I began this one with considerable  eagerness.  But it was soon obvious that the author was pushing too hard to  be funny.  In his other works the humor seemed to flow  effortlessly--especially in &quot;Semi Tough&quot; and &quot;Baja  Oklahoma&quot; and &quot;Dead Solid Perfect.&quot;  This isn't to say that  the current work isn't without its moments.  It's merely that it isn't up  to Jenkins' own high standards.  That's the sad part of a book that is  supposed to be funny. Ya gotta play hurt, Dan.  Ya gotta take chances to be  funny.  The only thing in the middle of the road is a yellow stripe and  dead armadillos, as a Texas politician said
