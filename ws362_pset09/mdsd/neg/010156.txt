I owned this and threw it out recently. It was an embarassment. Do not buy it. If you must see it, visit your library. The only thing that's good about this is the descriptions of fashion personality types, which is a fun read. Other than that, save your money and buy the Lucky Manual or Pocket Stylist instead.
