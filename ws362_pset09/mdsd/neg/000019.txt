In the foreward the author states that she was inspired to write this book by the birth of her first child. This should have been a tip-off. I was very intrigued by the concept of this book and deeply disappointed by the shallowness and subjectivity of the content. This book is a classic example of an author thinking with her glands instead of her brain. There is no scholarship here, no research, just a lot of breathy pnuematic opinion stated as fact and dressed up with charts that assign Goddess correspondences in a more-or-less arbitrary manner. It isn't even feminist in the true sense, merely an emotional cathartic spew. It's fine that the author's new status as a mother inspired her to explore the feminine divine. It's too bad she didn't just keep a diary instead of inflicting her unsubstantiated theories on us
