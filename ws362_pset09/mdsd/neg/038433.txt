Williamson seemed to be coasting--just slapping this story together  without really putting any serious effort into it. The hackneyed plot was a rehash of the elements of many plots in books I have read over the last 50 years--nothing new or exciting.  The characters were never really developed to the point that I cared about what happened to them. Definitely not a page turner
