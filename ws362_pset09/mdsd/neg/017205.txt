This book is awful.  The writing is bad, the plot is thin, the characters are underdeveloped.  Synners had potential, but ruined it with pages and pages of dream-type sequences and unexplained ramblings.  There were so many characters that it was ridiculous to keep track of them all.  Important events were skipped over and not explained at all, substituted with phrases resembling &quot;a few days later...everything was fine.&quot;  I do not recommend this book
