I stopped reading Ludlum stories years ago, as I found his books to be so similar to each other as to make them boring.  I also had to deal with a regular feeling of deja vu... didn't I read this passage before, or, this setting or person seems familiar.
Those issues did not creep into my reading of this book with great frequency, most likely because I kept thinking, "There is NO way he'll get out of this" or "That would never happen."  I realize that reading a good novel, and especially a "spy" novel requires a fair amount of suspension of belief.  However, this one passed those limits
