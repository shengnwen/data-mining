My daughter is "into" the Civil War so I bought this book for her.  I read it first and am glad I did.  I cannot recommend it.  It is boring and has very little suspense.  I know the Civil War was a sad and serious time, but familied still had some happy times in the midst of it!  Cass, the main character's younger sister, has visions and all sorts of weird things.  I do not want to expose my children to that. Another character also reads cards and supposedly has second sight.  These things are occultic to me.  Therefore I cannot recommend this book at all
