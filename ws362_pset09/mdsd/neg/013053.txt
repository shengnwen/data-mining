This book has an interesting premise, adventure journey in the depths of winter into the harshest gales with the most foolhardy of fishermen on the North Seas. It's not an easy read, the narrative is disjointed and erratic.  It's difficult to comprehend the purpose of most of the author's rambling passages other than to give you that woozy sense of nausea.  At that, it succeeded. Like some of the other readers, the most pleasure I had from this book was realizing that I did not have to finish it
