I recieved this calendar as a Christmas gift after raving about the book.  When I opened it at work I was very disappointed to discover that the the quality of the calendar was so poor.  I expected it to be in color!  The book was in color, the box was in color and nowhere did it let you know that it was in black and white.  Also the pictures are washed out and the paper is of a poor quality.  This was not worth the money my husband spent on it and I'm sorry to say that I'll have to buy a calendar because I can't stand looking at this one
