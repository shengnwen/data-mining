I've owned both editions and I totally agree with previous reviewers about preferring the original version. The older version analyzes one book ("The Accidental Tourist") that is easy to get new or used, and won't eat too significantly into time you should be writing instead of reading. The newer version analyzes several books which starts to look more like a book on literary criticism rather than on the writing process. The original is much more process-oriented, since the goal of the reader of this specific book is to get words on the page, not just broaden the amount of novels on the shelf. 

Overall, I was disappointed. I thought the newer version was long-winded with lots of unnecessary filler that hindered more than helped. Get the original. It's worth it
