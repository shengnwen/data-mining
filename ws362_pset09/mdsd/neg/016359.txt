Though I don't agree with some other reviewers who believe that narrators or main characters need to have redeeming qualities to be interesting or engaging (read the short story "Rock Springs" by Richard Ford), I found Chippering to be just plain annoying. His voice was too silly to keep reading for 384 pages. Maybe it's funny the first time he tells us something that obviously isn't true, but after 300 references to how attractive he is to women when the women he's with clearly despise him, the story gets to be a bit trite. Had this book been a little shorter, maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. I don't know, though, because I never got to the end - and I'm usually the kind that can't leave a book unfinished.

The most interesting part of the story is one which is left almost completely untouched. I kept wanting to read more about Chippering's betrayal of his Green Beret buddies and what they were going to do to him, but after 280 pages of the same nonsense with Lorna Sue and Mrs. Robert Kooshof, I gave up. Okay, maybe Tim O'Brien has been type-cast as a Vietnam writer - but really his best work revolves around the war. Hopefully (ha ha) he can break out of this label, but if he keeps writing GOOD fiction about the war instead of this garbage, I'll be happy
