We have been "unschooling" since birth- not radically, but very child led.  I was disappointed in the broad generalizations made by this author seemingly based on her expierience with her one female child.  Having 4 children, 2 boys and 2 girls- I just don't see her particular method of unschooling working for every child or all families.  It seemed to me that nearly each chapter had some sweeping statement about "all children" "we parents" etc.  I'm glad it worked out so well for her and her girl- but I'd love to see her take my 3rd child- a boy and have it work out just the same.  She seems to not recognize that all children are different and while her radical unschooling and unparenting worked for her-  it is not as one sided as she presents it to be.
