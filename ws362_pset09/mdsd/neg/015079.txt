As the last story in this book proves, Rick Moody's stories are always about, you guessed it, Rick Moody.  Even when they're not explicitly about Rick Moody, the prose is screaming out, &quot;Look at me!  Look how brilliant I am!&quot;  Here's what I don't get about his most &quot;experimental&quot; work in this book: What is it that he's doing that's any better (or different) than what John Barth (and others) did in the '60s?  I can tell you: Nothing.  I'm not a big fan of Barth, but Barth, at least, is a very smart man, and his experiments are multi-layered.  They're also fun, by comparison.  You get the feeling that Rick Moody either hasn't read any of the postmodernists or that he doesn't understand that writing a story about writing a story really needs to do something that tops, say, John Barth's &quot;Lost in the Funhouse.&quot;  David Foster Wallace, another writer I'm not keen on, at least understood this, and he used Barth's &quot;Lost in the Funhouse&quot; as a spring-board for the final story in his collection GIRL WITH CURIOUS HAIR.  And Wallace, at least, IS smart.  I suppose my main complaint is that Moody is writing in a historical vacuum, and yet he continues, in both his fiction and in interviews, to pat himself on the back.  My question is this: If Moody hadn't gone to two Ivy League schools, hadn't worked as an editor at FSG, hadn't lived in (or around) NYC, would anyone have published him?  Absolutely not.  Step outside of Manhattan, and you'll find Rick Moodys scribbling away and chuckling in Starbucks all across this country.  They're dime a dozen
