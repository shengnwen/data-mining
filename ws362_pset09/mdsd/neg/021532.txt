May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.  

It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.  

Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).
