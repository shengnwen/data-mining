George Soros, one of the greatest speculators of all time wrote this book which is an ode to govenment and bureaucracy intervention. It seems at first sight that Soros realized that true liberalism (not the liberalism of the left wing in America) was wrong and thus the Estate should intervene to fix the market's problems.

Now you may be asking, How come a guy who made 1 billion dollars in one day thru speculation against the british pound in the 90's is now a critic of the system that let him speculate and get rich?. Well, Soros changed his mind about capitalism when he lost 2 billion dollars during the russian crisis. He tried to convince the World Bank and the IMF to save russian markets like they did in Mexico in 1995, but no help was approved.

So, what's the solution according to Soros? Easy: create new bureaucracy. He wants a Global Fed, Government intervention in the markets and a more robust and strong Estate. If this solution were to be implemented, Soros would be denying to others the opportunities he had to get rich. I think what Soros wants is to prevent others to compete with him perhaps because he is tired of today's competition.

If you are into Mises, Hayek or even Friedman, this book will only be useful to show the clichs that the left wing repeats over and over against capitalism. It doesn't add something new to the debate, just shows us that Soros is a great speculator but a poor economist
