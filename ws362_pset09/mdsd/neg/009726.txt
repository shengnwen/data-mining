A very repetitive collection: about 80 % of the stories are about stereotypically "gay" boys and the Liza Minelli shows they do, or about how they get beaten up by their parents. Nearly all stories are set in the 1960s and 70s and read like some kind of childhood/youth recollection. 

There was nothing original or significant about this collection and I think it stands for what's wrong with a lot of "gay" literature: too much stereotypes, whining and sex; too little originality, masculinity and positive thinking.

The back cover says to give this collection to gay youth. I think this might be a very, very destructive and dangerous thing to do. Instead, let them read books like "Clay's Way" by Blair Mastbaum, "Boys on the Rock" by John Fox or "Metes and Bounds" by Jay Quinn (whose work has significantly deteriorated since).

Don't waste your time or money on this book
