If you're searching for a CCNA study guide, I'd advise looking elsewhere.  While reading, I've noticed many typographical errors, poor editing, and in one case, an entire paragraph repeated for no apparent reason... and I'm only up to chapter five.

Many of the explanations are difficult to understand at best.  I frequently find myself searching other resources while trying to make sense of the incomplete and often confusing material.

If you must get this guide, wait for the sixth edition.  Hopefully, it will have gone through a more thorough proofing process
