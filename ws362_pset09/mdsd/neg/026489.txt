The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to "preserve the life that is dear to him."  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of "24," but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write "Sunday," we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne
