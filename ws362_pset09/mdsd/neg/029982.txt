I bought this title, as well as "Upside-down Brilliance.."

I could not find my child's traits in the "RBCIALBW" book because he does not meet the criteria for ADD.  

However, when I opened the "Upside-down Brilliance" book, I discovered "him" (and me!) on nearly every page.  This book does include a section on ADD and the right-brained child, but the "RBCIALBW" does not separate the two.

Had I not bought both books, I might not ever have discovered that my child is a VSL (Visual Spatial Learner), which is helping us a lot!  

These are two very different books
