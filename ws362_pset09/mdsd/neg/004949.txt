The text is a decent introduction to the basics of Biblical criticism and is fairly readable for first-time students in the field. That said, the author is given to overstatement of his case, often failing to recognize that the theories he espouses also have had some criticisms by other scholars. This leaves open the very real possibility of biasing new students against other theories prevalent in the field without giving them an option of weighing the evidence for themselves. So it's good, only as long as you remember that what is reported in many cases is simply the opinion of the author. (As a rule, whenever somebody says "modern scholars say", look to the evidence they provide, not the blatant appeal to authority).
