It's a very boring book trying to explain what real estate career is all about... One will get better understanding by interviewing brokers and reading other books by Tom Hopkins, Danielle Kennedy, Carla Cross, Mike Ferry etc. 

 I saw the ratings and bought the book. Don't make the same mistake and waste money with this book..
