I bought this book based on the review of others.  If this is really the best out there, somebody new needs to get started writing Excel books.

IF you already know some programming concepts and IF you are willing to spend alot of time combing through the book, you might find what you are looking for.  I found just enough to put my old programming experience together with Excel's built-ins and alot of trial and error to get what I needed.

The index is pathetic, clearly put together by a computer rather than a knowledgeable human being.  The examples are all focused on the formatting of cells or cutesy message boxes.  Message boxes can be useful, but if I only needed Excel to format data, I wouldn't need to write code
