The articles in this book are great reading.  They provide thoughtful insite on many different topics.  The cases, however, are completely useless without the instructors' manual.  As best I can tell, the  instructors' manual is not available for purchase unless you are using this  book for a class.  Therefore, in my opinion, this book is a poor value  outside the academic world
