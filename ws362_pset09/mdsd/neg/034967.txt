There is actually a lot of interesting historical information for the right-of-center reader who wants to learn about the right-wing/Republican successes in bolstering its face time in the American media. 

But it's a tough read because Brock is obviously extremely skeptical of pretty much everything that comes out of the mouth of anyone who votes Republican. 

Brock hurts his credibility early on when he states flat out that his early conservative writings were actually literary regurgitations of the right wing party line. But what's to keep a reader from viewing this book as just a left-wing version of the same?

I think he could have balanced the book by discussing more specific left-of-center successes. Whenever he does mention the left-wing in the media, it's usually in lofty platitudes about their objectivity and non-partisanship (trust me, Brock really believes this). 

He seems to think the left-wing is totally helpless in the face of the right-wing media juggernaut. Does anyone in America actually believe that?

This book has the potential to be an informative read (it's over 400 pages), but it too often lapses into name calling, unsubstantiated generalizations, and conspiratorial excess. 

Leave the wild rhetoric to Michael Moore and just give us the facts
