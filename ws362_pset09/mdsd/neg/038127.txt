I have NOT seen the movie, so this review is only based on the book.

This book was highly regarded by a few family members as a beautiful read.  Sure, the descriptions are lovely and well written, but the whole idea of a memoir is suppose to be interesting--this is not.  I love travel memoirs, reading peoples travel stories, but this was like reading a guide to restore a house--very dry.  Ms. Mayes writing reminds me of David Sedaris mocking a wealthly tourist, "My home, well... ONE of my homes".  

I have decided to give the book another try. XM Sonic Theater is playing the book and it is being read by the author.  However, Ms. Mayes monotone voice and lack of live storytelling makes the story even worse.  I understand why authors have voice actors to read the books.  

The book is written lovely, but does not exceed the expectation I was excepting.
