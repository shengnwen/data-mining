This book gave me an insight into the creative process that I had never experienced before.  It was just as Gloria Steinem said "...how to meditate our way into our imaginations & to give our thoughts & feelings visible form" this book gave me a new found way to discovering my self and the artwork I produce. Thank you so much Nancy, I really appreciate what your book has done for me and hope that others find it as rejuvenating to the soul as I do
