This book dishes out a lot of information in the small space between it's paperback covers.  I read it looking for film lighting basics, and had a tough time grasping some of the more technical language involving exposure, T-stops, etc, even though I have a decent background in photography. The book does a poor job of addressing and explaining these key concepts.  I gleaned a decent amount of information from the pictures and diagrams, but they were poorly aligned with the text, requiring lots of flipping back and forth. All in all, I would reccommend this book only to people with a fair amount of knowledge of the physics behind photography and/or film.
