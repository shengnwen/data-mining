Let me start by saying I had no less than 4 books I consulted on a regular basis during my pregnancy and my favorite was the week to week guide.  This book was a huge disappointment.
Not only do the weeks not always correspond to the age of the child (weeks vs. months), but I  found that a lot of the milestones were a little ambitious as well.  The book also comes across as very judgemental (baby swings are known as neglect-o-matics & cosutmes can scare a baby so keep him home on halloween) and gives you things to worry about without telling you why (to soothe a baby you can swing them, but don't bounce!).  I think the book should offer advice and then it's up to me to figure out what to do. 
At first I thought it was just me being post-partum and sensitive but my baby is 13 weeks old now and I can see, the book is just not helpful.  Buy "What to Expect the First Year".  It gives enough information without making you worry about every little thing and gives you enough information to make an informed desicion without telling you what to do
