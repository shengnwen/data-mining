I'm not sure how many "Complete Guides to vampires" the world really needs.  I'm pretty sure we didn't need this.  Most of this stuff is available for free on the internet, or on Wikipedia or similar sites.  It's pretty much a rehashing of what most people with an interest in vampire legends already know.  Probably of some use to folks just developing an interest in the mythology, as it is pretty easy to follow.  But there's nothing new or groundbreaking in the book
