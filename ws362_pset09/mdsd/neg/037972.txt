Fiction doesn't get any more shallow than this, and don't let anyone kid you that it's a satiric comedy of manners. Gossipy name dropping and bed hopping may entertain Grazer's crowd but anyone with a brain is going to get turned off quickly. The book is a complete waste of time and money. I stopped reading after the first 10 pages. Yuck
