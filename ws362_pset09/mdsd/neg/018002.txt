I am an AP Calculus teacher and was collecting materials to use in my classroom. This book is fine in the information it presents and does have 5 sample tests (3 AB, 2 BC). But the book is lacking in worksheets (only 3 for the whole text). It has a chapter in the table of contents (Annotated Solutions  to Past Free Rsponse Questions) that is nothing more than the URL of the companies web site, which in turn just provides a link to the college board web site. The overall production quality is mediocre. I would recommend the Princeton Review book over this one by a wide margin. Maybe if you want another source of sample test questions this book may be worthwhile
