I feel like I completely wasted my money.  I read all that I can find on Arthur and Guinevere and have done extensive research on the Arthurian legends and tales.  I find the use of modern twentieth-century slang distracting, offensive, and extremely inappropriate.  The phrase that reached off the page and slapped me in the face occured when the Lady of the Lake makes the remark that "it works her last nerve." I literally cringed.  I wish I could get my money back!!!
