I wanted to like this book, but I guess I'm not down and depressed enough to relate to it. It was just so much of the same miserable life page after page after page.  Oh wait-- there's good reason: she was never hugged as a child, therefore can and will be a depressed alcoholic loser for her entire life.  I don't mind some "loser-lit" but there has to be an evolution or an awakening or some kind of lightbulb to keep me interested, otherwise I lose sympathy and figure, well, if that's your attitude, you deserve what you get.  I can relate to the "hard times-hard life" theme-- everyone's faced some dark moments-- but I can't feel much empathy when it becomes a choice, a lifestyle, an escape, and just a jerky way of behaving.

Normally I'd give this a higher rating because the "writing" was  more or less technically correct, but I, for one, am getting tired of "I Suck" books that ramble on without a point, without a story, without any real skill in creative storytelling. 

I did not find "a character who is endearing because of her flaws."  She was a jerk.  I didn't think they were "some endearingly horrific blunders at work."  She was stupid. I didn't find it "enlivened with refreshingly unsentimental humor." It was pathetic.  There was nothing "charmingly original." Charmingly??? If this is an example of an author who "manages to keep the tone hopeful" - I'd hate to read something really depressing
