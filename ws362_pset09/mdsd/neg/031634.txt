Well, I read through about 60 five and four star reviews before I gave up on trying to find somebody who was willing to tackle the problematic ending of this novel. Let me start off by saying that I was loving this book all the way through Part 5. The cliffhangers were great, I loved the authentic Southern voice King breathed into each of the characters. He had crafted something so good. And then he didn't treat it with the care it deserved. Part 6 was weak, seeming inconsistent with the characters and the tone of the book.

The problem is you have characters that have displayed heroism in every other circumstance suddenly choose cowardice. Paul, Brutal, Harry, Dean and even good John Coffey all decide there is nothing left to do but go through with the motions. Is it their failure in this decision that leads to Paul's unhappiness, his "damnation" as he states?

This book starts with a message of tremendous hope. There are miracles. God works through the most unlikely of instruments. But the book concludes with near despair, that God permits all the bad things to happen and responds that "He doesn't care." What a careless way to conclude-completely sapping out of us the hope that the rest of the book has enfused us with! It is affronting to a spritual mind. Obviously God does care, pouring out grace and miracles so often that we've labeled them commonplace, and commissioning messengers that mankind kills. Paul Edgecomb is such a great heroic character throughout the book, King treats him so poorly in the denoument. It pains me to say it, because I feel like I am chastising a wise old friend. Yet he need not look to the heavens for the cause of so much suffering, but deep inside for his own shortcomings in saving an innocent life
