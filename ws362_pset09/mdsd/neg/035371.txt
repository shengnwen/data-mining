I cannot for the life of me understand how this thing ever found a publisher.  The prose is flat and insipid; the characters unexciting and drab; the pace leaden.  Reading this is slightly less exciting than watching paint dry.  The author has done some historical research and can't just use it; where he pops in an historical detail he elbows you in the ribs to draw attention to his cleverness.  I had a very hard time dragging myself to the end of this book (first one by Mallon I have read) and would not recommend it
