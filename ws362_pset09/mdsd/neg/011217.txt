Hi I'm Steven, I disliked this book for a number of reasons. It changed chapters to quickly, so it is hard to understand the life of Vinny and Li as a child growing up.  Once you start to uderstand what Peter Dickenson is talking about, he changes the chapters, so it makes it very very coppy, and  then you get annoyed becuase it keeps changing chapters, from Vinny's life  to Li's life, then back to Vinny's and then Li's you get the picture. And  Li changing evolution in about two years.(what I call the quicky  evolution)Li shouldn't think she is so different, all that happened was the  shark thing in the biginning of the book, and then the thing with the shell  at the end.  The Then story of the book ended really poorly, with she  turned the rock with the shell.  And the Now chapter cocentrated mostly on  her relationship with her dad, and not digging for bones and more important  stuff like that.  Actually I thought the Now chapter ended much better than  the Then chapter with Vinny finding the bone that Li had squished into the  end of the book, to end the Now chapter.  And that is my review of Bone  from a Dry Sea By Steven H
