Although this book is a detailed, if overintellectualised, account of the Sex Pistols' short career and the ludicrous media games of Malcolm McLaren and Glitterbest, It is not by any stretch of the imagination, a book on U.K. Punk. It completely bypasses England's second generation of Punk (1981-1983)out of which sprang many of the Greatest Punk Bands Of All, such as The Exploited, Discharge, Vice Squad, Chaotic Dischord ,Disorder, The Anti-Nowhere League, Chaos U.K., G.B.H., and The Insane! None of these bands are even briefly mentioned in this book! It's As If Jon Savage,poncey journalist that he is, is afraid to acknowledge their existence! Instead he wastes page after agonizing page reading overblown hippie-like ideas into the useless New Wave bands he erroneously believes to be punk! The one or two lines about Crass don't even begin to make up for this pompous smokescreen. Worthless, Stalinist tripe!!!! Save your money and save yourself a headache! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
