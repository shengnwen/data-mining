This is an interpretive book, written and presented by Gary Gagliardi, loosely based on Sun Tzu's classic material. 

Mr. Gagliardi attempts to apply the lessons of Sun Tzu's The Art of War to business practice and corporate thought, based on his understanding of the work, as well as his background in sales, marketing and management theory. 

The book contains what the author asserts is the most accurate translation of Sun Tzu's work ever attempted. This description of the text is highly debateable, based on the merits of the text itself. Mr. Gagliardi achieved his translation using an internet encarta program, in which you can do a simplified character search in Chinese, and see some of the interpretive meanings of each pictogram. Based on Mr. Gagliardi's word choices, the author appears to have selectively chosen what he believes to be the correct English terms, and these results are often wrong. Since he has no formal training or background in reading / translating Chinese, this comes as no suprise.

This is certainly not a definitive work.
