I cant imagine any one accepting this unbelievable story line. It's garbage, probably one of if not the worst I've ever read. I made it through 30-40 pages before it ended up in the trash.

So much for this author, he may have had a winner or two but from this point on he's on my "do not buy list"

I gave it a one star because there was nothing lower
