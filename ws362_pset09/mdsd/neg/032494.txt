A disappointing package of disjointed material and a lot of recycling of standard leadership theory. The old theories are repackaged in heavy academic jargon to make it seem that something new is being offered. I am  sorry to report that I gained very little from the enormous effort that was  involved in reading this book.  It was disappointed that so many well-known  academics and experts in the field allowed the publication of such  disjointed ramblings under one cover. If you are having difficulty getting  to sleep at night this book is for you
