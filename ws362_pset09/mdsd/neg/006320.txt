The activities in this book were nearly impossible to put together.  We bought this for our [...] who loves the movie, but there's no way he could have done this alone.  In fact, my husband and I could barely put the piece together neatly.  It took superglue to hold the hold thing together.  And although some pieces were made so you can punch them out of the book, the more difficult shapes, like the people and parts of the boat had to be cut out by hand.  Needless to say, our end product didn't look all that great, and my son lost interest in the process as soon as he was unable to participate.
I wouldn't recommend it at all
