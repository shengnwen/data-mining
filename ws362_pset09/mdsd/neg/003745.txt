Boy, someone should write a song with those words in it.

I don't doubt that Jodee was tormented throughout her education.  I wish she had used that experience to create a book that provided better advice to young readers or an honest and circumspect recollection of the events.

Instead, her work comes across as artificial (particularly in the dialogue) and self righteous.  Because of the over-arcing prose style, this is a hard book to take very seriously.  I certainly wouldn't recommend it.

I would, however, recommend an editor who knows the difference between a region in France and the location of a Big 10 University
