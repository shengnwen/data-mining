First of all i was looking for a book that describes each super heroe's style, character, super powers in detail, even i expected a scala or a chart showing his/her powers, intelligence, agility, dexterity out of say, 10 or 100 what ever. But none is available, just a brief explanation of how he /she is created, and etc. No description of his/her adventures, friends, the very popular speciality etc. 

I bought this book with 2 other books "The superhero book" (visible ink production) and "500 comic book villains" (Baron's production) and none of them satisfied me. 

However this book is the only one which provides all superheroes with "pictures" other books doesnt even provide picture for all characters but some mostly known ones. 

i dont recommend this product for those who is familiar with the super heroes but to those who knows nothing about comics
