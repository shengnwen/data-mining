This 7th Edition was published in 1999, but a good bit of the material seems to date from an earlier era.  Remarks about 35mm photography, for example, refer to a level of technology that prevailed much longer ago.   The photographs (none in color) are very, very dated in style (were they made in East Germany?), and in fact many of them are held over from the 1st edition (1967).   Worse, the pictures are disturbingly bizarre and creepy.   I ripped page 78 out of the book to avoid having to see it again.  This may the most comprehensive work available on the subject, but let's hope the 8th edition is a thorough revision - and please include a few marvelous color landscapes and fine B&W portraits that are the reasons we love the LF format.... and lose those awful distorted photographs of 1950s mannequins.  Luckily, though, a lot of things about view cameras are the same as they have always been, so the basic content of this book remains altogether usable.
