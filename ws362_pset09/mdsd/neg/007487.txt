'Gin' Sanders gives some good advice in this book but there is also alot of fluff and just plain nonsense about why one should eat healthy. For instance she continually writes about how certain foods and ways of eating are 'tacky'. While that may be true, real data on the health benefits of the French diet is probably more helpful than being judgemental. I would recommend Clower's The Fat Fallacy over this.
