"The Devil and Sonny Liston" is so shallow that it can be read in an hour. Be forewarned that it would be a wasted hour. The book rambles and meanders and ducks down many a rabbit hole with the end result that the public perception of Sonny Liston as nothing more than a cloddish, criminal thug remains unchanged. There is no depth here at all. Stale rumors, recycled innuendos, and anecdotes by Liston flunkys hardly add up to a serious character study.

Much of this book deals with the mob's influence on professional boxing during the Liston era and mob-groupie Tosches is not above flat-out invention to move his narrative. He blithely claims that Rocky Marciano's last fight, against Archie Moore, was "fixed" by the mob, that Moore took a dive. What nonsense. Moore was a 4-1 underdog in that fight. The whole point of "fixing" a fight is to get the favorite to agree to lose and then clean up by betting on the underdog. It makes no sense to pay the expected loser to lose. Moore took an incredible battering in that fight and it never appeared like he was looking for a comfortable place to flop.

Sonny Liston here is more of a lengthy footnote than a biographical subject. He's not so much elusive as he is MIA, lost under a welter of trivialities. At one point Tosches waxes poetic about the length and girth of Liston's manhood. Testimonials are included.
