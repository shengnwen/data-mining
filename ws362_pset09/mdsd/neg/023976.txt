The subject of this book is relative of the author who back in the 1840s, converted to the faith of LDS and moved to "Zion" (Utah) where she met with hardship and situations that did not meet her expectations. The book proves to be well written but poorly researched. It doesn't help that the author's objectivity was compromise because she was the author's grandmother, several times removed.

In this book, it seem like Sally Denton is going out of her way to slam dunked the Mormons. Obviously, Jean Rio was misguided or misled about what the LDS was all about. Her ignorance seem to be classical that its based on blind faith and once she awaken to it, she discovered much to her dismay that her new church may not be all that she thought to be. The author stated that the Mountain Meadow Massacre was the cause of her defection but it seem all to pat to this reader. There seem to be a lot of mountains made from this molehill.

I don't think her researched is all that well done. The author depends too much on diary left behind and make several conjectures which are not fact based. The book feel more like a personal biography of author's grandmother (several times removed), its short, readable but ultimately unimportant due to lack of depth to the research. While the subject person was important to the author, its seem like a story of dissatisfied customer.
