When I bought the book I was hoping that it would contain some useful information for me as a first time owner of a Harley-Davidson Sportster. I guess I should have done my homework better because this book did not contain anything useful for me apart from some nice pictures of Sportster models thru the years. So it is a nice coffee table book for people to browse through. I guess I should buy the service manual instead so that I can get some useful info if I want to get my hands dirty working on the Sportster :-
