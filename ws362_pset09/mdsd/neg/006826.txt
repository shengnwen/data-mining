Edward Lee is one of my favorite horror authors.  I had just finished "Flesh Gothic" and was looking forward to the same chills and stomach-turning images in "Monstrosity".  Unfortunately, I spent the majority of my time flipping through the pages thinking, "What the *%^$ is going on?" and then when all was revealed - let's just say the ending was a major letdown. Definitely not your typical Edward Lee.

I gave it two stars because the side bits with the 'necks and other minor characters were rather good.  Mutant roaches?  Giant eels?  Loved it!  Too bad the rest of the story flopped.  

Needless to say, this will not keep me from reading another Edward Lee novel
