I gave up counting the mistakes and misunderstanding after I reached 100 - and had only reached the third chapter. The author opposes every major medical advance of the last 200 years: X-rays, vaccination, pharmaceuticals, blood tests, antibiotics, contraceptives, surgery etc etc  etc. Although couched in terms of &quot;patient empowerment&quot; this book  is, in reality, deeply reactionary. The author imagines a &quot;golden  age&quot; (in medaeival times) when humans and nature lived in perfect  harmony, a friendly local white witch brewed magic herbs to cure all your  ills and the sun always shone. In reality, life was nasty, brutish and  short. Life expectancy was about 30 years, 75% of children died in infancy,  50% of women died in childbirth. The advice given is particularly damaging  to women. Any woman who followed this book would end up continuously  pregnant (no contraceptives)with breast/cervical cancer (no screening)and  smallpox (no vaccination) living in a hut with no TV/telephone/computer (EM  radiation) and, in fact no electricity (radiation from cables). She  couldn't leave the house (pollution) and certainly not use a car (fumes,  toxins etc) and would only eat what she could grow in her own back yard  (organic food). Ms Heimlich seems rather irritated that people (in the  West) live longer than ever before and are healthier than at any time in  human history - since this contradicts her basic premise. If you want a  good laugh, read this book and make a list of all the things you have to  stop doing in order to stay &quot;healthy&quot;. I find it very disturbing  that people are prepared to exploit the fears of the vulnerable in order to  line their pockets with cash
