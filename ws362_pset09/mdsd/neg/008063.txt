I just spent the afternoon reading this after feeling mesmerized by the first one, Mote.  It was terribly disappointing.  OK, perhaps not a pure commercial potboiler, but vastly inferior to the mysteries and utter fascination within the first one.

In this, you know the problem:  the aliens, by their biology of uncontrolled population increase, are a terrible threat to mankind.  But ah, humans have been able to experiment with some of them for decades; the deus ex machina solution that emerges after some spectacular fighting is, to say the least, a letdown.  Everything else is needless detail.  That makes this a profound scifi dud, lacking the magic of the original.

Not recommended, except for uncritical cultists
