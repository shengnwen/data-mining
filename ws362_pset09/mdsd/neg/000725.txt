From what I noticed, this book comes with few examples, which I need to learn well. However, I learned the same topics originally with Calculus by James Stewart (fifth edition), which comes with very clear explanations, diagrams, and examples. Then the practice problems start off easy and then gradually increase in difficulty. Instead of Kaplan's Advanced Calculus, the James Stewart book is highly resourceful and I would recommend it to any student in calculus, because it can work for practically anyone.
