I have been a witch over 13 years and I am a big fan of Charles Leland. This book I am not. It has very little truth to it. Mr. Leland got the text from someone who wanted to abuse the craft with lies. This is a Christian book. That is put in a way to please the church. Witches do not belive in satan, though to this book. The horned god is satan himself. Aradia is said to make comments that would have gotten her killed on the spot. I NEVER threaten the goddess. Again we have many areas saying we do this. There is not enough room to go through it all. You can get free copies from websites all over if you must read it. If you do think about what it is saying and you can easy see it for what it is. A preverted vesion of what should of been sacred
