I bought this book because I really like fashion and I can (barely) fit into some of the sizes that author lists in this book.  However, by appearances, the author must have targeted 10% of the population that have a 24-28 chest size.  And, one must wonder of the 10% of the population who fall into that category, how many of them actually knit? Come on, the average American female isn't a 24-28 chest size!!!   With that said, I also believe that the author also targeted this book for clairvoyant knitters because the instructions are vague, the details are missing and she assumes that you know when she asks you to M1, you know which type she's referring to.  And, when you decrease, you know which type of decrease is required.  While I'm not a beginner knitter, I like explicit, detailed directions.  This book lacks all of that.  This is a definite PASS for anyone who is thinking of actually knitting from this book.  You will end up frustrated and disappointed.  Don't waste your money
