ive read dozens of reviews for this book.  the great reviews are the reason i bought the book in the first place.  they are all FALSE! this book is BORING.  i dont see ANY reason to compare this book to the harry potter series.  other than the fact that they were written by brittish woman, they're not even in the same category.  ive read more fantasy novels than i could possibly count, and this was the worst by far.  the greatest magic the magicians in this book perform are spells to "make it rain" or "make the statues talk". if your looking for a good fantasy novel, try R.A. Salvatore or Weis & Hickman.  this just isnt worth the time. i honestly would'nt have anything to say to the public about this book if it werent for all the reviews i read about what an AMAZING book this is. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i actually read the book from start to finish.  for some reason, i just wanted to know how it ended.  i normally read about 2 books a week...this one took me over a month to finish.  its just so boring, i couldnt read more than a few pages at a time or i would just fall asleep in my chair.  if you want real fantasy, try something else. please.
