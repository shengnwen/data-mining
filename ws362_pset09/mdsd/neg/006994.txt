It is frighting that any one would find anything real about the family in this book. Rosie the witch, Chuckie the night of the living dead. I found the whole thing so boring. Just because it took place in the 50's does it have read like a book from the 50's. This is 2001. Who talks that way? Pease, more life like chacters. Could have been great....I come from a Irish, Catholic family with many of the problems faced in this book. But, I just thought the book was insulting
