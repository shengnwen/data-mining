My son loves his bath! My mom and dad bought him two bathtime books (not aware of the dangers of pvc) and I was shocked to see that Baby Einstein was still using this product. The smell of the book when removed from its casing was so toxic that we had to throw it away immediately. I am taking the suggestion of a previous reviewer and writing to the company. I may even have to go as far as boycott their products, as the dangers of PVC are VERY documented and for a company to use them in children's products is inexusable.
