I thought this book might be interesting for my class (I'm a Geography High school teacher).  Now, I've read many a dull tome on Geography in my many years.  At least they were informative, mistake free and educational.  Unfortunately, I cannot say say the same for this drivel.  Not only is it dumbed down but, it is still dry and boring.  I was drifting off while reading it (and I love geography - can't get enough of it!).  There are mistakes a plenty.  Not only the ones mentioned before, but I found 'facts' cotradicting themselves in the same chapter.  In short; dry, boring, mistake ridden and dated.
