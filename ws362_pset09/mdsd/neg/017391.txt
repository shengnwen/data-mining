This book was a selection for a book club I am in. I honestly couldn't get past page 152. The dialogue was phony and unrealistic. Conroy tries to set the stage for the revealing of some hidden secrets (allusion to a crime committed by one of his high school friends, causing the friend to flee the U.S., for example), but I just didn't care.
