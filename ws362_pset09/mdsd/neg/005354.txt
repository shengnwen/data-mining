This book was downright awful. I was not able to even finish reading the last few chapters. It is really frustrating that the books (after Obsidian Butterfly) have a crime scene at the very beginning of the book, which misleads the reader to believing that there is going to be an action-packed, rich story with amazing characters to follow and mysteries to solve. Do not get your hopes up !!! Anita is so busy having sex with anything with a pulse , that there is no space for anything else. The woman is sexually frustrated.

I truley miss the "old", the real Anita Blake series. She was such a strong character, taking no nonsense from anyone. Someone who had her priorities fully sorted out.
The main men characters were strong-minded and actually had a personality. Now they are only lining up to see who is going to get jumped next, when she gets "hungry" again.

Even after reading these last horrible books, I am still hoping for a miracle to happen...... book 15, The Harlequin is going to be published soon, and I am hoping that the author at least tried to save the series !!
