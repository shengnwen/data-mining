I was dissapointed with the patterns, they were all very interesting and the pictures were beautiful but the yarn use for the patterns was ridiculously expensive. I made a pillow and it ended up being $65.  The patterns also had several misakes in them, I made the slippers and the pattern was incorrect, I brought the book into my yarn shop and they said they do NOT recommend the book to newer knitters due to the multiple pattern errors. Great pictures and good for ideas but not great for a newer knitter
