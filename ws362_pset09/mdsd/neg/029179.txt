I can't believe how many people rave about this book. I just finished it today and it was probably one of the most shallow, superficial books I have read in a very long time. New York women all acting like spoiled little girls, the whole story reminds me of the Barbie phenomenon. It they were to make a movie out of this book, they should use all the Barbie characters and let's nor forget about Ken! Such a waste of time
