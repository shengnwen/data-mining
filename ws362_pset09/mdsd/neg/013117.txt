I was looking for this binder to really help organize me and I didn't feel like it did so much.  It is just a binder with some pockets in it, but it didn't give me any ideas on how to organize.  If you're one to go through magazines and do a lot of clipping and searching of pictures, this binder might be great, but I already had a good idea of what I wanted so I didn't do all of that.  I had a good idea of what I wanted, i just needed help organizing everything
