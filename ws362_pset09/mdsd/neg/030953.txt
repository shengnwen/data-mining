I'm not arrogant enough to say a certain thing shouldn't be held in high regard just because I don't like it. Everybody has varying tastes and different opinions. And since opinions and tastes can't be proven true or false or right or wrong, what does it all mean anyway?

I will say I definitely didn't like The Thirty-Nine Steps. Why?

1. How can an adventure story with chases and disguises be so dry and drab? I stopped caring about what Hannay did by the third chapter. I just kept on reading because of my "must finish all books I start" policy. Plus, I wouldn't have had any credibility to judge this book had I stopped.

2. The Plot. I still don't know what the whole thing was about. Either the reason these spies were chasing him was for the most convoluted reason in the world, or the thinnest, near nonexistent reason. There is a reason why I avoid espionage, Tom Clancy-like books. This one just happened to sneak up on me. Why did every man Hannay bumped in to just happen to be about his size?
Who buys that you wouldn't be able to recognize someone just because they were in a different surrounding? Buchan used these two devices to help his hero even though both are improbable.

The book is short, therefore my pain was short. If you want a really, really good mystery, I suggest The Red Right Hand by Joel Tinsley Rogers, or even some Hercule Poirot books by Agatha Christie.
