"Another such Triumph and we are ruined." Pyrrhus 279 BCE

Update added 9-7-2006. I am delighted to see that my review has inspired an army of Hutton-devotees to slap together substance-free positive reviews in order to try to counteract my negative review of "Triumph of the Moon" (see below). Prior to my review there had been only two reviews posted in the previous two years - but since my review there has been at least one a month! It's nice to be noticed. Thanks everyone! Now, on to the review itself.

If Pagans are a little vague about exactly how our religion has survived, and a little awkward about exactly how our rites and rituals work, and if we sometimes make up stories to fill in the gaps in our history - maybe there's good reason for that. Maybe our sacred books were burned, and our Priestesses and Priests murdered, and our sacred places desecrated and destroyed. Maybe our Religion has been the target of a sustained campaign to destroy it!

The simple fact is that Religions are very resilient things. They do not die easily. And when they are forced underground they sometimes change in strange and unexpected ways. Does anyone deny that Paganism was forced underground? Many religions have survived under similar circumstances - why must Pagans accept the triumphalist conclusions of our enemies that they succeeded in destroying our Religion? Why can't we just say "we're not dead yet"?

Well, we're not dead. So there. Any person of good will would be sympathetic toward a Religion that has suffered so much persecution - and would be willing to give the benefit of the doubt to those who claim to be its continuators. And a good historian would much more carefully consider the evidence of Pagan survivals found in European intellectual, literary and artistic history, as well as in phenomena such as Alchemy, Qabalah, Magia, Astrology, the Tarot, etc.

Here are some authors to read instead of Hutton:
*** Pierre Hadot: Especially his "What Is Ancient Philosophy?" and "The Inner Citade". Hadot is a serious philosopher who knows how to write about Ancient Philosophy for the intelligent non-specialist. These two books offer an excellent introduction to Pagan Philosophy!
*** Perez Zagorin's "Ways of Lying: Dissimulation Persecution and Conformity in Early Modern Europe" on the phenomenon of underground Religious movements under Christendom. Also by Zagorin: "How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West" on the violent repression of intellectual and religious freedom under Christendom.
*** Julia Annas: "The Morality of Happiness" and "Platonic Ethics Old and New". Whaddya know? The Christians didn't invent morality after all! 
*** Michael Gaddis: "There is No Crime For Those Who Have Christ" - sometimes a title says it all.
*** Ramsay MacMullen: Especially his "Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries". This is THE book on the question "what happened to Paganism?"
*** Pierre Chuvin: "Chronicle of the Last Pagans" - this comes right after MacMullen's book as among the most essential things for Pagans to read about our history.
*** Lynn Roller: her "In Search of God the Mother" is a meaty tome covering the three "incarnations", so to speak, of Cybele: in Her native Anatolia, in the Hellenistic World, as lastly as the Roman Magna Mater. Roller also includes a fascinating and devastating critique of the scholarly research on Cybele.
*** Antonia Tripolitis: her "Religions of the Hellnistic Roman Age" provides an accessible but also reliable overview of the Religious landscape in prior to the suppression of Paganism. 
*** Sarah Iles Johnston: her "Religions of the Ancient World" is a coffee-table book that covers a very broad range of Religious traditions in the mediterranean world prior to the suppression of all other Religions by the Christians. Also by Johnston: "Hekate Soteira" is an essential scholarly reference on Theurgy and the role of the Chaldean Oracles in Late Antiquity.
*** Philippe Borgeaud "The Cult of Pan in Ancient Greece". Few aspects of Hutton's book demonstrate his ignorance of Paganism like his dismissal of the God Pan. Hutton ridicules the idea that Pan ever played a significant role in traditional Paganism. Hutton's theory is that Wiccans elevated Pan to a central role solely because of Pan's prominence in contemporary English language "romantic" literature. But of course Pan was a "major player" in Greek and Roman Paganism from the time of the battle of Marathon - as Borgeaud shows in this beautiful little book that every Pagan should read.
*** Fraces Yates: Especially her "The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age", "The Rosicrucian Enlightenment" and "Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition". 
*** Gregory Shaw: "Theurgy and the Soul: the Neoplatonism of Iamblichus" Neoplatonism was the "last known address" of the classical Paganism of Antiquity - and it is the form in which Paganism begins to resurface during the Renaissance. Any genuine attempt to investigate whether or not Paganism managed to survive would not dismiss philosophical Paganism (and Platonism in particular) as a side issue, as Hutton does, but would make it a primary focus.
*** Lucas Siorvanes: his "Proclus: Neo-Platonic Philosophy and Science" is another excellent book on Platonism as a Pagan philosophy in Late Antiquity.

"Triumph of the Moon" is an anti-Pagan book. It has enjoyed a free-ride from Pagans because the vast majority of Pagans have never read a book with footnotes before. After having their brains addled by the works of Scott Cunningham and Silver Ravenwolf, Pagans have eagerly acclaimed Hutton their favorite "scholar". But what is Hutton saying in this book? His main argument can be stated in five words: Paganism is a made-up Religion. If you believe that, then you'll love his book.
