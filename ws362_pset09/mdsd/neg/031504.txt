STOP...IF young love manking advice isn't what you want. RUN AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. The fact that I only see this book attributed to Starhawk alone is enough to make you wonder why you should by this book. I like Her as an author and person, but only her Name could sell this book. And that is the only reason we purchased it. My wife and I were hoping for something to fill the void of Children inclusiveness....We've since concluded that 98% was filler work while the other (some stories, ritual idea, a couple songs) were USEFUL and the rest...BS.  Whoever authorized or had any association to a 14 year old boy writing his "opinion" about LOVE should be canned and banned from ever writing a childrens book. Yea, it was for adults but if your so nieve that teens aren't reading it your out of touch. I've considered riping this page out but I'm torn I don't like sensorship so what's the answer.....put it in a balefire
