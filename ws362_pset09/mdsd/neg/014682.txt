Funny how an author can go through the Cointelpro's vicious tactics on the Amercian Indian Movement and only briefly mention the Bellcourts who were instrumental in the AIM Movement. Why? Because they say Ward Churchill is  not Native American. Obviously, the full story has not been presented to  the public due to his personal reasons. Read &quot;In The Spirit Of Crazy  Horse&quot; if you want an informative non one-sided book on the vicious  FBI. I will say the info on the Black Panthers was quite compelling. That  is the reason I gave it 1 star
