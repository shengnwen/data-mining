I'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing The Horse Whisperer a couple of hours ago.  I'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  Not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  I'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character "can not control," "just feels right," etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.  

I am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  The pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  I'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  I think that all I need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift I can give them is to love their father.  

That is all.  My vent is over.  Thank you.
