This revision must have been specially produced just to include all the anti-Bush rhetoric.  In nearly every chapter, responsibility for the current state of the environment is laid squarly on President Bush's administration.

In addition, there are no references given for any of the information presented in the book.  As a student, we are expected to take this author's word for it that everything he has presented is true and accurate, and that he is simply a repository for all of this accurate information.  In fact, the lack of references is absolutely striking when you consider this is a textbook that is supposedly presenting facts.  The only references given are those for photo credits.

Unfit as a college textbook
