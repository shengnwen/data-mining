This book lacked a lot of focus in what it wanted to accomplish.  Was it trying to give tips on how to win at Monopoly or trying to show how the game teaches lessons to be applied to real life?  In both cases, it came up lacking.  The tips it gave were rather common-sensical, the stories it shared didn't really give any insight into how the game applies to business, and to top it off, it didn't not give accurate rules to the game.  For example, the book said that you couldn't collect rent while in jail, so you should always try to stay out of jail and in the game, just like in life.  That's a nice maxim to live by, but you CAN collect rent while in jail and every good business person knows that there are times to be aggressive and times to be conservative.  Overall, the book was very disappointing and I hope only to spare others from making the same mistake of wasting time reading it
