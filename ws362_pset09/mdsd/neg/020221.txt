I am a huge Mary Balogh fan.   I loved No Man's Mistress, and the Slightly series, Wulf was my favorite.  But this story was awkward and slow.  The background was revealed too slowly, so you sit there wondering why is she responding to him like that.  Within the first 25 pages, I hated the supposed heroine.  Her love interest appears to be a shallow wastrel who's afraid of his mother.  Who want see someone fall in love with a character like that.  I don't think this will be my last Mary Balogh book, but if the next book is like this, it will surely be may last
