Lisa Endlich, formerly a trader with Goldman Sachs, has written a book on Goldman Sachs' history and corporate culture.  As a former employee, she, like every other former employee writing about her employer, must have been torn between loyalty to her old employee, and wanting to write a truly dispassionate history.  One or the other must give.  The one truly interesting tidbit in this book was that Goldman, the founder, refused to support the British during World War One, as did John Pierpont Morgan and almost all others, out of loyalty to his German roots.

Goldman Sachs was and is undoubtedly an extremely interesting and extremely accomplished partnership and now company; this book however, is little more than a summary of discussions held around water coolers.  If you're interviewing for a job with GS, already have a job with GS, or merely looking for a good bibliography of this history of various Wall Street firms, this book is definitely worth reading, otherwise I do not know what purpose reading this book would serve you
