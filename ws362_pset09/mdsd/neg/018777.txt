I am expecting a baby in June of 2007 and ordered this book to assist with picking a baby name. Unfortunately, something I didn't notice when ordering is that the book was published in 1999. The book includes all sorts of lists of names - such as most popular baby names - however, the lists are all from 1998 or before. Trends in names seem to change, and since this book had not been updated in nine years it was of very little use. I have found the internet to be a much better resource
