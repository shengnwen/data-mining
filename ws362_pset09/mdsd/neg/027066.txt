Roberts Ridge is a great story ruined by bad writing. The events of Takhur Gar could easily have been the next "Blackhawk Down" but poor writing and lackluster prose actually separated me from the characters when I found myself wanting to bond more with them. It seems this book was rushed into production in the hopes of the public latching onto it as the first great story from the war on terrorism, but it falls well short of that pinnacle. Overall it's a story worth telling, but it would have been better told by someone else.
