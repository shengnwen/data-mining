After those 18 years are gone, we will never again have the chance to be someone's mommy.  The 50+ hours we spent at work and commuting, we will never be able to have those hours again with our babies.  What is life all about?  What makes it worth living?  Is it only money, fame, and fortune?  OR, is it people, FAMILY and life experiences?  ARE WE HAVING CHILDREN, AS IN POSSESSIONS, or having children as in TO BE A FAMILY, as in MAKING SACRIFICES.  Or maybe, we are just to selfish to realize that we are hurting ourselves as well, as we miss out on sweet memories from a child that WE created and birthed.  

If my life is cut short, I will be proud to say that the part of my life I missed was the big corner office.  I will be proud to say that the part I never missed was my two children telling me that I am their best friend (sure, they have plenty of other friends, but, "mommy you're the bestest one").  If my life is long, I will continue and attain a Phd (I already have a BA and MS), and am quite sure, being the capable woman that I am, that I will get the corner office too.  But, the corner office is second on my list of priorities.  Do you know why?  It is because I AM SELFISH, I am PUTTING MYSELF AND MY HAPPINESS FIRST.  And I am happy when my family is happy.  It makes me feel happy to know that I -- I alone, am the source of warmth and happiness for my children and husband.  I -- I alone CANNOT BE REPLACED BY ANYONE -- not so with the CEO.  The CEO dies, the CEO is replaced, not much REAL mourning -- the MOM goes, the mommy is not able to be replaced, no one else quite fits.  

There is no risk in relying on my husband, because if you treat your husband CORRECTLY, you could not entice him to leave (he may die, but that is called LIFE INSURANCE, combined with my TWO degrees).  Ms. Bennetts may indeed have a real concern for her own husband desiring to leave, but I have none.  I take GOOD care of myself and am STILL my husband's GIRLFRIEND.  My husband knows how important he is to our family, and he is PROUD to care for us; just as I am PROUD to care for him.  You see, my husband takes risks too.  He is risking that I MIGHT LEAVE HIM, and then sue him for alimony as well as child support, as well as his sizeable 401(k).  But he trusts me, and he is not concerned.  You can reduce risks through careful planning -- planning which includes adoring your spouse so thoroughly that it becomes an effort for them to notice anyone but you.  He married me because he thought I was the cutest, sweetest, hottest thing -- it is my pleasure to make sure I remain that way. ;-)

There ARE some very real risks associated with everyone being busy with their careers . . . How about no one being home when your pre-teen and teenagers arrive home after school?  Do any adults remember whose house the alcohol was drunk at, or the pot smoked, or the hook-ups happened at?  Oh, that's right, those really nice homes, where the only person who was ever home was the KID -- plus about 10 buddies.  Now that is a very REAL risk (REAL is different than IMAGINED FEARS).  And when the kid gets into trouble, this does not cause marital conflict?  And because mommy and daddy rarely see one another due to their fast track careers, do they have the strength to work through this conflict?  As if dual-employed households NEVER seek a divorce?? Hmmm . . . . very strange assertions indeed.

Yes, we ARE giving up too much -- when we give up happiness and enjoyment of life, our babies' childhoods, and OURSELVES -- out of FEAR of what 'MIGHT' happen -- not what WILL, what MIGHT -- and if we are thinking this way, and making choices based on the expectation, might we not be ENCOURAGING and ushering in-- the very feared event?! (Oh LOOK, it happened!!! Surprise, surprise -- after all, you just got what you PLANNED for!) 

DECISIONS MADE OUT OF FEAR ARE RARELY GOOD, AND RARELY WISE.  Use Your MIND as well as your HEART -- LOGIC and LOVE work BEST when USED TOGETHER.

Those who leave their children out of REAL fears (like apartment evictions, no food or heat, etc.) need feel only pride, as they are PROVIDING FOR THEIR CHILDREN.  Those who leave their children out of IMAGINED fears of the unknown need feel only shame, for they are themselves cowards, PROVIDING FOR THEMSELVES -- they who sacrifice their children to sate their fears.  Cowards who have yet to become adults -- because adults think of others first -- especially when the 'others' are THEIR OWN CHILDREN.  

Who cares what happens to my child . . . as long as nothing happens to me . . . 

Are YOU giving up too much?  It is not too late to take back what is yours, to care for your own, and to revel in the pleasures of the children you bore . . .  WORK will always be there -- CHILDHOOD will not.  WORK only PAYS for life -- CHILDHOOD is the FRUIT of life.

Choose wisely, treat kindly.  Kids don't need more stuff -- they need more YOU
