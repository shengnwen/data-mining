I had to use this book for cryptography class, and would not recommend it to anyone.  The book was very math intensive, which I wouldn't mind if it weren't for the fact that there are no explanations in plain english to follow the math.  This book is basically just a bunch of theorems and proofs.  Also, there is no cryptanalysis of any of the algorithms included.  There are much better books out there, I don't know why anyone would want to get this one
