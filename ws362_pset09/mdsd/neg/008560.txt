I just finished up taking a Probaility course which utilized this book.  Over-all I found this book to be terrible and even our Professor had some guarded comments about the quality of the book.
   The first few chapters ( 1-4) are straight foward but once i got to chapters 5,6 and 7 I felt like the author was simply rushing through the material in order to get it published as soon as possible. The examples are so so and the author skips large numbers of steps in almost all of the examples.  This books assumes you know probablity, it does not teach it.  I also felt that for the price ($100) the author could have spent more time in chapter 6 and 7 working through all the material in greater detail. I ended up buying 2 additonal Stat/Probability books to find additional information.  I have yet to find a good comprehensive book on the subject, but I am still looking.  I have heard that Ross has a monopoly on probaility book and I'm not sure why but I and my fellow students were not happy about that fact.  Hope this helps
