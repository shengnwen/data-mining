I really didn't like this book.  I bought this and what to expect when you are expecting.  I prefered the other.  I found this lacking in concrete developmental info about the fetus.  There were too many "write in questions" and personal anicdotes and not enough facts.  I will probably sell this book in my yard sale or send it to goodwill as I really didn't find it helpful at all
