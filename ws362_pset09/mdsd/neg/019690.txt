Although the information in this book is useful, it is not the activity book that the shopper might be expecting.  The fluency passages are too few, and the lower-level passages are reapeated twice on the page.  While this makes duplication easy, it sacrifices additional fluency passage inclusion. Although some of the speed drills and word activities are useful, this book is a little light on content.
