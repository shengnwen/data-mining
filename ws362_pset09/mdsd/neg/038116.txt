I read this book and it confirmed my feelings that USA, as the only super power, should ALWAYS remain STRONG. 

The book is composed of some 400 pages full of critiques as if the author wanted America to be the haven of saints when the world has been full of crocodiles, for instance the introduction brings about a fair resume of the author's intentions

How!
 
In the Introduction I came across a passage which I hereby quote `''It was in the early days of the Vietnam War that a Vietcong officer said to his American prisoner _' You were our heroes after the war, and a common phrase in those days was `'to be as rich and as wise as an American'' - What happened `''.
 
The title `Killing Hope' - updated edition 2004 - by William Blum, and many of the contents are indeed offensive to the USA because it speaks about U.S military and C.I.A 'interventions' since World War II and endeavours to portray them as the bad guys.

C.I.A (USA) intervensions? 

Didn't such 'intervension' save many countries that now live under the 'shades' of democracies, in Europe and the Far East (Japan) enjoying unprecedented richness and prosperity, with a high standard of living for their nationals.

As one individual out of six billion living on this planet, do I blame the USA for protecting the interest of its citizens.

USA is The World Giant and one has to learn how to convince them of one's view points , rather than garrulously defy them with boring speeches and  empty written words.
