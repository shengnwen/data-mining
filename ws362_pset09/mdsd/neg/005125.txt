I read the first 5 series and loved it, 6 and 7 was ok but was getting a little tiring.  Now that I've read 8, I am just going through the motion of finishing out the series (I have a thing about finishing series).  

In the first 5 books, Stephanie's bumbling and misadvantures seemed cute and believable.  But by the 8th book you'd think she would tell her cop boyfriend about people threatening her, notify the proper people for help at the appropriate time, and for christ sake don't go into the house the mob boss tell her not to go into!  I honestly don't blame Morelli for not wanting to marry her, and I don't see what her appeal is to both men like Ranger and Morelli.  This almost reinforces the stereotype that men, even smart men like Morelli and Ranger, likes ditzy bimbos.  

I have never seen anyone so stupid and so lacking of survival skills.  You'd think after all the death threats and close calls she's had in the first 7 books, Stephanie would carry her gun and not leave it at the cookie jar.  If she hates guns so much, quit being a bounty hunter.  I find myself screaming in the book "move you dummy", this has gotten irritating and annoying to read.  

And the love triangle between her and Morelli and Ranger is just unbelievable.  Why would they men want her?  She's a mess and she lacks any real charm that I can see.  She hides secrets from them and I find the way she lusts after one guy soon after the other leaves the room to be dispicable.  If she loves Morelli so bad she should quit all the kissing and petting (oh and having sex) with Ranger.  When Morelli doesn't give her the time of the day because they broke up she goes all pouty and make it sound like it's Morelli's fault.  Hello!  If Morelli found out she had sex with Ranger she'd never see him again
