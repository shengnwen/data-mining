With the exception of sometime employer Paul McCartney, no one escapes Emerick's petty, self-serving tirade.  At times you almost get the impression that Emerick thinks that he and McCartney could have done as well without those other pesky people.  Let's see, George Martin was a scene stealing sop who took credit for all of Geoff's wonderfulness, John was a space cadet, George was a subpar musician and Ringo was unfriendly. (In Ringo's defense, if Emerick is as graceless in person as he is on these pages, I'd avoid him too.)

Emerick had a wonderful opportunity to pen a truely insightful book on a grossly overwritten topic.  Instead he let his ego and vanity dictate what is no more than a transparent tribute to his mentor, friend and meal ticket, Paul McCartney.        

Frankly, the Beatles and McCartney deserved better
