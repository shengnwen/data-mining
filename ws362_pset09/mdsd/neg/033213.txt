Of Rick Moody's books, I've read &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; and &quot;Garden State.&quot;  I liked both of them, although I prefer the film version of &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; to the novel.  So I picked up a paperback copy of &quot;Demonology,&quot; thinking that it would be equally engaging.  I was wrong.  I couldn't make it past the first few stories, they were all very thin and flat, and as I was reading, I couldn't help but think, &quot;Who cares?&quot;  The first story, &quot;The Mansion on the Hill,&quot; was unbelievably slow and tedious to get through, the same was true as I gave him another chance and started reading the subsequent stories, hoping in vain that things would get better.  A real disappointment.  I would drift off as I was reading, and could have skipped pages and still known what was going on in the plot.  A very empty, unsatisfying read.  Like expecting a steak dinner and only getting a rice cake
