To start, I admit that I did enjoy reading this book overall. However, this text is just as biased as the object of its accusations, the (rest of the) media... While I don't doubt that the author has a firm grounding in the subject matter, I do wish he'd left out a few pot-shots at subjects that are irrelevant to the subject at hand, such as:
- a disavowal of the current AIDS epidemic in the U.S. (p.9)
- stating as fact ("a truism" in his words) that news reporters are all liberals (p.10), a topic which is hotly debated at present and not found to be "a truism"...
- a strangely out-of-place jab at President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinski (p.144)
- stating that West Coast police departments tend to have "higher moral standards" than others (p.128)
- delineating why "fag murders" (his words) are different from other types of murder (p.39)

Also, the author's excoriation of the news media is not followed up by any substantion discussion of their errors; nearly all of his anecdotes deal with written fictional works and movies. While he does sufficiently recount a laundry list of errors in books and movies, he rarely returns the issue of the news/"press" media after the first chapter. Finally, he uses too few citations for sourced material, and of those he does attribute, most are from articles published in the Southwest U.S., or listed as "personal communication with the author" from an unnamed person. As another reviewer recommended, I'd visit the publisher's (Loompanics Unlimited) website, but not only because they offer other interesting books, but also because it will give you a very clear picture of the audience this and other of their books are aimed at. Or, in their own words as found on their site, "we are the lunatic fringe of the libertarian movement." Not necessarily a bad thing, but worth keeping in mind while reading this book, which I would still recommended for an interesting and informative read. But, have your salt-shaker nearby, because you'll need a few grains during the reading...
