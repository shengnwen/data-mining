Redundant, redundant and redundant.

I bought this book and sent it back almost immediately.  It has a handful of recipes which are repeated over and over and over.  Some of which no matter how often you use them do not work.  If you want a true bible of clean green cleaning turn to "Better Basics for the Home : Simple Solutions for Less Toxic Living".  It is a MUCH better book
