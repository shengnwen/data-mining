THIS BOOK READS LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY A MATH LAWYER!!!

The text is confusing and way too redundant.  The sample problems are well-explained, 
but they're a setup for the homework problems to make you feel stupid.  
I bought this overpriced book, the solutions manual, and the study guide...I feel screwed.

If you are taking a class that requires this book.....DROP IT!!
