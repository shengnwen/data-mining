So far I have read all of Danielle Steel's books and have kept every single one of them in hardcover.  I look forward to reading Impossible and Miracle soon.  But I just didn't care for the character of Fiona at all.  Not my type of person so I didn't care for reading about her at any cost.  I loved the character of John; he's a doll!  Fiona was nothing but a self centered, self absorbed woman who thought only of herself and how she can constantly benefit herself.  I have no idea what John saw in her; I guess it was her beauty.  Talk about total opposites!  I don't blame his daughters for disliking her! The other women in Danielle's books were much nicer and had much better personalities.  Because of Fiona, I didn't enjoy the book at all.  I couldn't wait to finish it.  I was hoping that he would leave her altogether and find someone more to his liking.  Unfortunately he stuck by her.
