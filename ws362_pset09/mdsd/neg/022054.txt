I'm not particularly a Gore supporter but in my opinion this is a "hatchet job," done with a dull, rusty hatchet.  Not worth the read; surely not worth the price.  I give it one star only because there is no provision for giving it none...or "negative" stars.  I'm sorry I bought this, didn't check it out of the library, wasted the money
