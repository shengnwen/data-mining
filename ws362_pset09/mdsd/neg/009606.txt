Tamora Pierce is one of my favorite YA authors -- I own and have reread "The Song of the Lioness" series and "The Immortals" series countless times.

Let's be frank: I *love* Daine. I think she's creative, intelligent, compassionate, imperfect -- everything a person wants in a heroine, really. And I like Numair. I enjoy every aspect of that pair's relationship as student as teacher, as friends, and, I hoped, as lovers.

However. I don't know how, but Tamora Pierce managed to completely botch the entire "lovers" thing. "Realms of the Gods" is both hurried and plodding, both too detailed and too vague, both attentive and dismissive, and the dialogue is atrocious. The enmity between Daine and Ozorne is impossible to take seriously; the Daine/Numair scenes are trashy and trite; the battle scenes are confusing and too fast. Most of the standard secondary characters we've come to know and love -- all the humans of Tortall, Kitten, Cloud -- are almost entirely absent. We see almost none of the promising characters from Emperor Mage, like Lindhall Reed and Prince Kaddar. Daine's shapeshifting and Numair's magic are both unremarkable.

Tamora, Tamora, what went wrong? 

Perhaps she was hurrying to reach a deadline.

Anyway, my recommendation is to read the first three books of the "Immortals" series, but just get someone to summarize "Realms of the Gods" for you, because it's not worth the time and disappointment it takes to read it. I've reread it several times over the last, oh, six years, each time hoping it's not as miserable as I remember, and it's always worse. Spare yourself and skip ahead to the first book of "Protector of the Small"
