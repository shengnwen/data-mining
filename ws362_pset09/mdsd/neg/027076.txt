It seems clear that much research went into this book, unfortunately with very little visible editing.  There is much tedious repetition of the same point. Extraneous information peeks out at us without elaboration. It is true that New York emerged as the center of American publishing, but why tantalize the reader with this fact by means of a single sentence in the midst of several pages about the garment industry. The treatment of the 1911 Triangle fire is far too minimal, and suggests, erroneously, that this was a solely Jewish experience.  This is most emphatically not the case, either in terms of the victims or the long term political consequences both for Jews and the Democratic party.
