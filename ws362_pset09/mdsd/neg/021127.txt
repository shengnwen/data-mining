Someone should notify Ed McBain that Mary Higgins Clark has written a book called ALICE IN JEOPARDY and put his name to it.  I couldn't believe while reading it that hardnosed Ed McBain, author of the 87th Precinct series, had written it.  The plot is absurd, the character treatment unbelievable, and anyone who reads it through without knowing halfway through who the kidnapper is must be looney.  I had to run to the library as quickly as I could, return ALICE, and pick up a good 87th Precinct story to remove this one from my mind
