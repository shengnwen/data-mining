I think the Advocate had every right to discriminate against this book.  Clearly this guy was trying to sell this book based upon his so called "porn career".  However, he obviously didn't make an impression in that arena because there is no mention of who he was in porn in any of these reviews. So I'm guessing he made 3rd rate films for a no-name porn company.  You would think since he is hawking the book by way of his prior porn-status, he would have been "named".  Pass this book up guys, who really wants to read another sob story of a loser?  He gives all gays a bad name.  Not all gays do drugs and are alcoholics.  Just the low-life ones
