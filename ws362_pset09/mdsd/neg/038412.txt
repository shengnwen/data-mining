I believe this is the second worst book I've ever read, although having not bothered to finish it, it had potential to rank higher on the list.  The concept, the characters, the plot and the writing were so far fetched that it was too difficult to suspend my disbelief long enough tolerate reading it.

I never give up on books; I read them to the end, no matter how much I dislike them.  Leaving a book unread haunts me; throwing out a book is a Cardinal Sin in my mind.  I made an exception in this case and tossed it in my garbage can and felt no guilt. 

The writing is poor; there is no eloquence, no wit, no attempt at a remotely believable plot.  The humor is not humorous; it's an attempt at slapstick comedy that falls short of its goal.  It is too obvious, too tiresome, and often just plain bizarre.

The book was recommended by a close friend who enjoys award-winning books; I assumed she'd be on target with this one.  She obviously likes Hiaason's books and find them funny and involving, but simply put,they're not my taste or to my liking.

Find something else to do with your time, something more satisfying and  mentally stimulating than reading this book.  I've never dared to try another of his books since being so annoyed by Lucky You, so I cannot speak for them.  This one might have been an anomaly in his body of work, although I honestly don't know.  But I feel like I wasted my time with this, and to be honest, if I were given a choice between reading this book and snorting dirt, I'd choose the latter.
