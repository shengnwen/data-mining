This book would do well to advertise itself as a series of articles about topics and people related to chocolate and chocolate production, but marketed as the story of chocolate it's needlessly boring. The chapters are about the length of an article and don't seem to be interconnected except in subject matter. The first few chapters were very interesting, but around the chapter "The Chocolate Coast" I realized that these were the longest 140-some pages of my life. I would be more interested in the history and lore of chocolate, rather than chapter after chapter of how he followed someone around, was almost denied access to their secrets/factory, and then talking about the different fermentation processes and what the machines look like. He may fare better to talk about wines, because that's how the subject is treated and somehow it just doesn't fit. He becomes haughty about the inferiority of american chocolate, treating his audience as a oenophile would speak to someone who drinks wine coolers. As for the writing, it seems to steer wrecklessly between very dry and excessively nostalgic. 

This book would be a winner with people interested chocolate economics, how different people use difference processes, and how chocolate is used in foods around the world. Unfortunately I wasn't looking for any of these things
