I got this book based on the overall good rating it got and the fact that I like romantic supsense type of books. This one, however, didn't make the mark. The romance portion was barely there and seemed far-fetched. And I wasn't the least bit afraid while reading this book. No good suspense factor for me. I also found that I could put this book down for long periods of time and not be compelled to pick it up again. All in all, I found it to be a waste of my time...I don't think I would try to read another book by this author again
