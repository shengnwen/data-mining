I personally think that there is a little more to me than  my sexual organs.  I enjoy my body and my husband enjoys my body as a gift from God in our private relationship together.  In my opinion, those who have to scream out loud about it in the vulgarest terms possible aren't in healthy and satisfying relationships.  Lesbian relationships involving little girls certainly aren't healthy or good (make that 24 year old a man and see what you think then) and while it is important to protest the abuse of women in war situations, don't bring that into your life with all the fear and mistrust women like Eve Ensler want to promote against good, loving men.  You'll end up alone realizing that a sex toy or your fingers (or another woman) is not very fulfilling, not only in a sexual sense but in terms of what you get emotionally and spiritually in a relationship that deals with you as a whole person
