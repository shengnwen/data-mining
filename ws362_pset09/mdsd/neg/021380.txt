Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.  

I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.

I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.

Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.

I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.
