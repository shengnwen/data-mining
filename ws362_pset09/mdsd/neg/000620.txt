Books and the appreciation of the written word is an intergral part of my profession. So,both for work, and for pleasure, I read avidly. The joke is that I, personally, keep amazon in business.  When I heard of this book, set in the Alentenjo, I hurried to order it. It arrived yesterday, and here I am , done already and feeling it was a TOTAL waste of time and money.

Ali has no clue how to create a story-  oh sure, the novel begins intriguingly enough with João finding the man he had craved for years hanging from a cork tree, a suicide at age 84, but then NOTHING is ever developed with this story line. João shows up again as a blithering old man with a pet pig, and then again drinking a toast to Rui, but it does NOTHING to help connect the myriad of other characters and their "stories"(term used loosely!)who pop up out of nowhere with no tie in to anything that has already happened, save for the fact that they all live in Mamarrosa!
I read the first 120 pgs (already struggling to do so) but had to fight to finish the book for the remainder.
I have never said this about a book, but will say it here and wish I could use a stronger adjective (read: "expletive"). Alentejo Blue is a piece of TRASH. 

Please do not bother!!
