Over the top ... 

Kurzweil's enthusiasm of writing style exceeds the logical supposition. Take what we know ... then divide it by the sqrt of 2, multiply by pi, raise to the power of n ... there you have it ... bio-transcendence. You gotta have Kurzweil's imagination to extrapolate, then accept the premise that computational evolution can, and will, transcend biology based on a premise that high speed computational machinations will outstrip the machinators.  

Only since the advent of advanced medical scanners have we seen meager clues of the architecture of human intelligence. An intelligent response to complex stimulus in the human neo-cortex looks like a 200 neural connection effort.  So it may be amazingly, and incomprehensibly  simple. We probably don't even know 1% of what we don't know. All that grey matter between our ears is mostly of unknown utility and some relatively small percentage is memory being accessed by the processing architecture in that ever so thin laminate of neo-cortical cells. Our only clue about what is going on up there is when something goes wrong and we can observe it being fixed or not. 

Kurzweil's brute force approach to breaking the  bio-transcendence barrier has no evidence in the cumulative science of all the labs working on leading edge computation put together, then cubed. Becoming  unshackled by computational  limitations to deliver billions of lines of algorithmic, self modifying  code executed at teraflop speed seems a bit like doing the wrong thing with great precision in the greater scheme. Predicting weather is a number crunching fiesta with the best computational science we have. Let's face it, the predictions aren't operationally all that much better than 10 years ago in my humble opinion. 

Admittedly, the fact that Asimo didn't fall at the CES this year was perhaps a landmark in our quest for  bio-transcendence, however ... I think my Roomba has more personality and better judgment.
