I am sorry to say that i was greatly disapointed in this book especially after having read most of the reviews on this site. Dr.Richie tells a dramatic tale that contradicts the bible. To most Christian readers the following visions of the heavens Richie describes should set off some red lights. There are people that have died that still walk the earth not knowing they are dead and are stuck in patterns of behaviors they had on earth such as drug addictions. There is also a level of heaven where people work in laboratories to help better the universe(richie also states we are the universe)these people are hard at work researching to make things better. Its hard to understand this one when biblically it is stated that to be absent from the body is to be present with the LORD? Oh yes, Richie saves this last level of heaven for only very special beings it is the heaven we all know and long for.   I was expecting much more from this book or atleast something that agrees with scripture. This book CONTRADICTS scripture not interpretations of scripture but orthodox truths. Richie even believes in REINCARNATION how this fits with JESUS" death and resurrection is not even thought of. As with "embraced by the light" biblical truths are thrown to the way side to introduce an all incompassing god that judges no one. Christ's death on the cross is not even mentioned and its purpose and necessity to be born again actually flys in the face of Richies christianity. He goes so far as to negate Jesus' great commission as we are not to judge other religions for all religions are a path to the father. There are some interesting perspectives and reports of healings in a more traditional Christian fashion and i am sure Richie as a physcian has done very good works but as a theologian he is ...and I am very sorry to say this. It saddens me that i first heard of Dr.Richie on an evangelical christian tv show on life after death. ....GOD bles
