It has been decades since I've read anything so vacuous. It is a sales brochure trying to convince you to invest in their mutual funds. The authors started their careers in marketing/sales and this book cries for an editor to cut the sales schlok out. It seems that, in authors' minds, they thought if they'd replace the word "idea" with "spark", and "hard-money loan" with "orchestra loan", that it would be a big enough gimmick to sell a lot of books. Please help prove them wrong.

This book bounces among three styles of writing:

1. Kindergarten statements about real estate loans (lenders are knowledgeable in their local real estate arena; now, as in the future, loans will spark new office and resudential spaces).

2. Side-bar filler with irrelevant facts (it took 467 concrete trucks to form the base of Seattle's Space Needle; the vagaries of war lead to periodic bursts of rebuilding projects).

3. Ridiculous editorials (revolution brings about change, usually for the better; publications like Barron's and the WSJ provide a wealth of general information).

Here is the actual substance of the book that I paid for and waded through all the sales nonsense for: "Steps to Success: This industry requires a phenomenal amount of research and diligence, not to mention real estate expertise. If you feel you have those qualities and talents, then by all means go for it." Yes, that's all of it. The authors teach nothing about how to become a hard-money lender in this book, nor do they offer any place to educate yourself further. Although the authors have impressive resumes, after reading their book, I no longer believe their claims of success.

I highly recommend you do not purchase this book. But, if you insist on buying it, don't complain that you weren't warned
