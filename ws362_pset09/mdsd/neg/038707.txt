Like Carpenter, Ballard suffers from poor execution of some good ideas. John Carpenter may or may not have been a good director once (depending on your point of view), but for the past 20 years he has consistently put out movies where the premise looks engaging on paper (Prince of Darkness, They Live, etc.), but quickly fall into a semi-coherent mess. Likewise Ballard, who is at best coasting on the reputation of a 30 year old book. Ballard has had some great visionary ideas, but his sad insistence on overfocusing on sexual perversion as a compelling/repelling drive for his characters got tired a long, long time ago. If Tom Robbins was a humorless German surgeon instead of an aging hippie, you'd get a close approximation of Ballard's hang-ups. In Ballard's world, all forms of sexual expression are deviant, creepily desperate, and universally abundant. Ballard no longer seems like a literary provocateur, but more like a pedophilic, self-important older uncle that your family would rather not discuss. "Super-Cannes" is Ballard's rewrite of "Fight Club", with the rich and powerful assuming the roles of the disillusioned and powerless
