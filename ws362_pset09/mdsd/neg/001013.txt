...if you really hope to live anything like a rural, pre-industrial life.  Do not, for one minute, underestimate the incredible difficulties you must overcome to leave modern life and begin living in the ways illustrated in this lovely but basically useless book.  John Seymour is a global treasure, his books are wonderful and insightful, but I think this one was made mainly to sell.  

If you really want to learn to work wood, read the books written by Roy Underhill.  If you want to learn to work iron, find a blacksmith and ask for some lessons (books will not help you there.)  Learn to cook and can and bake.  Learn to sew.  Then inherit money or win the lottery because you won't have time to earn a living if you do all these things.  

These books are a lovely diversion from the cares of modern life, but they won't take you there any more than a book about the space shuttle will put you in orbit.  The simple life is attainable, but it will be the hardest thing you ever do, and this book won't help you one bit.  But the pictures are lovely, and if it inspires you, then it's worth the price
