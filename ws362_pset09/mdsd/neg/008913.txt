It is not my intent to write an unhelpful, "bashing" review.  I have a decade of management experience, and this simply is not a good book.  Why?  Well, the great religions of the world use short parables to teach lessons, and this book also operates in parable form (the people and situations in the book are made up).  Instead of delivering the message of the book in one or two paragraphs in order to teach the lesson, which is entirely possible for the lesson being taught, the lesson is drug out for about 180 pages with the express purpose of selling books and delivering a feel good message.  Many of the other reviewers here who also did not like the book point to many worthwhile references that I will not repeat here.  Overall, the lessons in this book are equivilant to those learned in a a high school Introduction to Business class.
