Butterfield is not a bad technician when it comes to playing the harmonica (assuming the accompanying CD is him).  There are several riffs that are very impressive and entertaining.  But when it comes to trying to provide the listener with instructions, he falls quite a bit short.  

I found that he tends to speak in generalities and makes some assumptions that, had he clarified, would have added volumes to the listener's understanding.  I listened to the CD several times and never could find an instance where he actually indicates where he is about to start on the harmonica (4th hole draw, 6th hole blow, etc. . .)  It is this lack of clarification that I found very distracting, and often downright frustrating.

The turnaround riffs starting around track 45 are excellent.  But they require the student to have mastered bending.  A tough task for a newcomer.

He almost has a great teaching tool here -- but I was hoping for a little better than almost. .
