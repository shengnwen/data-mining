Recently, I purchased this item, as well as two smaller Dover sticker booklets.  I was disappointed with them.  They are only somewhat reusable.  As another letter-writer noted, they lose the stickiness.  They also are flimsy, made of paper with a coating; they tore easily when handled and curled up when removed from the first place where they were placed.  I hoped to purchase a product similar to ColorForms of years past.  Not the case.  While the idea is a good one for play and learning, these just aren't sturdy enough for rehandling.
