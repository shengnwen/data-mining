This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life
