To provide a truly useful and in depth survey of Zen in the West - especially since this book was written by a practicing Zen teacher - more thought and care should have been given to producing it.  For those of you who have been practicing Zen for some time, you may notice a lack of balance in terms of the detail including the praises, criticisms or suspicions that Ford levels against those he includes in his survey.  On the other hand, for those of you who are new to Zen and perhaps interested in finding a bonafide Zen teacher, I would not be surprised if you got to the end of this book and decided not to pursue Zen at all.  Where Ford seems to praise ancient or recently dead masters, his persistant criticism of contemporary leaders and centers makes Western Zen as an institution appear largely disfunctional and/or suspect.  Furthermore, very little reference material is provided within the book which at the very least might make one wonder where and how this Roshi obtained the information he used produce it.  Finally, the last chapter of the book, which includes recommendations on how to find a qualified Zen teacher, seems ill-placed considering the book's hidden thesis: That there are maybe one or two Zen teachers and/or Zen centers in the United States that are not marked by some scandal or question surrounding the authenticity of this or that teacher's dharma transmission.  Curiously, James Ford appears to have survived his own survey completely unscathed.  But don't take my word for it, find out for yourself
