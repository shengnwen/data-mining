I've lived in London my entire life and you might say that I'm a typical Londoner. So when an American friend asked me to have a look at this book, I was intrigued.

What I found was a lot of nonsense. So many of the "insider secrets" are simply not true.

For example, not a single Londoner would ever call the royal family 'The Firm'. Cheers doesn't normally mean goodbye, but is instead used to say 'thanks' (e.g. "cheers, mate - it's just what I needed") - oh, and mate can be a female friend too. Nobody - and I mean nobody - says 'kew instead of thank you. It's either thanks, cheers, ta or thank you.

The book may be fairly useful for finding cheap hotels etc, but I really wouldn't put much faith in some of the other 'facts'. 

If you are visiting London, why not use the guide that we English rely on, "Rough Guide". It's written by people who actually live here, and is also likely to be much more up-to-date. When you arrive, pick up a London A-Z, which is FAR, FAR better than any fold out map or street plan in the back of a book. And finally, buy a copy of "Time Out" magazine. We use this to find good restaurants, shows, cinemas etc and it comes out once a week.

Sorry this has been rather negative, but I thought I should set the record straight.
