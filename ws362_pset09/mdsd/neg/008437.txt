This book would be useful for someone who is starting a prayer group or for people who are new to (protestant) Christianity and (protestant) Christian prayer. The chapters are short and this is a quick read - good thing because people who are too busy to pray are probably too busy to read a lengthy book about prayer. Religious scholars will find this book too elementary. The language is largely simple, conversational, and accessible to a wide audience. They support their material with stories from their personal experience. It reads like a long sermon. While Hybels and Neff loosely support their material with biblical passages, they do not demonstrate how these ideas are linked to Christian tradition and liturgy
