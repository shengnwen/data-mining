I am really impressed with the good ratings this book has gotten so far. I hate it.

The authors incapability to explain the multinational context in simple terms, his approach to pack every little, tiny detail that somehow might correlate to the overall subject into each chapter, and his inability to use formulas and graphs in an understandable way, makes me wonder if the author actually knows what he is talking about. I find this financial book the worst I had to deal with so far. As an honor student with a finance major I feel like Shapiro is trying to hard to create a book that covers all. His examples and illustrations are somewhat interesting since they provide some information on how things work in the real world, but they lack something really important that I personally find essential for demonstration purposes: clarity and comprehensiveness. 
Additionally, I find his approach to verbally describe his calculations in huge paragraphs disturbing. As disturbing is his way to create his own symbols and acronyms and not using those other financial books use. When studying you therefore need so much time in figuring out, what his symbols actually mean, that you would rather read another book. 
I personally doubt that Shapiro has actually understood the subject himself. He is using the trick I always use when I do not want my professors to notice my lack of understanding: verbosity. Quantity is not always good. 

I would definitely simplify the book and use clearer formulas, a more mathematical approach, better graphs, more information on how these formulas could be derived, less words, fewer sub-chapters,  more interesting case studies at the end of the chapters, more problems for self-evaluation at the end of the chapters, clearer examples and illustrations....

There is so much room to improve that it might be better to rewrite the whole book using a better author.
