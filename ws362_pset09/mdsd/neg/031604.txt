75 five-star reviews??? And all of them from first-time reviewers, many of whom seem to be struggling with english and making the identical mistakes, and each of them writing reviews of roughly the same length, and most of them reporting miracle cures for some ailment of other??? Puh-leeze. Instant healing just does NOT happen with Qigong. It's not supposed to.

The story available in the "Look Inside" link on this website is ridiculous. Did Deng Ming Dao write this book as a ghost writer? 

If you want a reputable, reliable Qigong book, look to Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming or Roger Jahnke. These very excellent, well-established, highly esteemed authors don't have as many reviews combined as the unknown Luk Chun Bond has for this one book! Believe me, that reflects more on Bond than on them. 

The excersises in this particular book, judging from the table of contents, may be good, but the insecurity demonstrated by the bogus reviews here and the make-believe story in the introduction cast a poor light on the book from the get-go. If the "sixteen secrets" are just sixteen basic Qigong excercises and some diet tips, then where's the secret? 

And to think, I *almost* ordered it
