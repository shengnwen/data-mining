Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you
