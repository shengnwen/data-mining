I've been a fan of this series for years, but this one was really disappointing. One almost gets the impression that Braun herself has lost interest in the series...(IF she even writes the books anymore!?) Of course, the books have always been slow, but they did have a certain charm to them, making them the perfect bedtime material...but, boy, did I sleep well,when I was reading THIS one..
