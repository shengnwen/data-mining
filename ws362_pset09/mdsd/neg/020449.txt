This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next.  However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives.  A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband?  It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research.  That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book.  I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it.  It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure
