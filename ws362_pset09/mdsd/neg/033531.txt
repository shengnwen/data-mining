I bought this book hoping it would give me some guidelines for evaluating art at auctions. The guidelines it gave were so vague and general that I learned nothing new. Most of the information in the book was common sense. The majority of the book was listings of artist's names with wide ranges of values, such as Thomas Kincaide $400-$5000. Nothing was mentioned about lithographs, seriagraphs or other types of works. This book hasn't been helpful to me at all
