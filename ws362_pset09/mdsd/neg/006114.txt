This book was not good.  The information in it was very basic and not insightful at all.  This is my husband's first deployment and I already knew everything in the book.  The DVD that goes with the book is very bad as well.  There are two movies on parenting from about 1970 and the book was published in 2005.  I would look into another book if you're interested in learning about the reunion phase of deployment.  Don't get this one
