OK, first off, I bought this full price($27+) at a local independent bookstore. So you can get it here instead and that price savings might be more worthwhile for what you get.

It's really sad but I just didn't find it funny enough. I bought it for a gift and after reading it, now will return it and spend my 30 bucks on something actually worth $30. 

Don't get me wrong, parts of this are absolutely hilarious, but not enough parts to make it worth the price. I wish it were shorter, because such a big book should be jammed packed from start to finish with rib-splitting humor. Instead, I felt like I really had to look for the funny parts. The photos are amusing - all 60's & 70's retro stuff. The recipes are out of the same era - good housekeeping influenced etc.

I think it fails because it is too much in the middle of the road. There are actually recipes and hostess tips you can actually use in this book but you have to sort them out of everything else(all the humor/irony/retro stuff). Or if you're looking for the humor side of it, then yes, the humor is here too, but you have to sort through all the actual practical mundane tips & recipes as well.

Here's my tips: Look before you buy - and this might be a really good gift item for those under 30?  And here's my favorite tip from the book: "A good trick is to fill your medicine cabinet with marbles. Nothing announces a nosey guest better than an avalanche of marbles hitting a porcelain sink"
