I was so ready to love this book.  As a teacher with predominantly Mexican-American students, I am very concerned about their success and I hoped to learn and understand.

Instead, I was exposed to shoddy research and theory.  Valenzuela's agenda was so upfront throughout all her research and analysis that she never paused to consider other explanations.  In the words of Non Sequitur comics of late, she is a "preconceptual scientist."  She makes sweeping generalizations and accusations which are not supported in her data.  She leads her informants' answers, she jumps on the anti-school bandwagon, and she doesn't do her background research - such as developing theory of caring.  

I like the premise, which is why I was so very disappointed at the extremely weak scholarship that this book represents.  Her heart is in the right place, and it's where my heart is, too - but that is never an excuse for such sloppy research and theory.
