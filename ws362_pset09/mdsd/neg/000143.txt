I bought this book because it was advertised as Bob Harpers book.  Needless to say, it's not.  It isn't Jillian Michaels book either.    The book is fun and there are lots of pictures of Bob, but no real weight loss advice that amounts to a program of any kind.  I like the book because I am a fan of the show and it does have some motivational anecdotes, but I wouldn't recommend it as a weight loss plan.
