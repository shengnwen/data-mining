Let me admit up front- I'm a techie, and I'm a libertarian. That being said, I've always been interested in geek culture and _why_ there are more libertarians in the techie community than in the general populace. When I heard this book was coming out I really thought I'd enjoy it. I expected a book about libertarians in the technical community written by an outsider (Ms. Borsook isn't a libertarian). And I expected it to be an unbiased, thoughtful examination of this phenomenon. Boy, was I surprised. The book is one, long slam against libertarians. Ms. Borsook obviously has a bone to pick and pick it she does. She makes lots and lots and lots of unsupported statements about how libertarians are wrong about almost everything. She makes no attempt to hide her bias against the libertarian view. The book might have been better titled 'A Critical Look At Those Complete Morons Who Call Themselves Libertarians In The High Tech Community' because that's the attitude she takes. This book is the intellectual equivalent of a Bill O'Reilly or Michael Moore book- if you want to read a book slamming libertarians and don't care for well constructed arguments or even a very good book structure this is your book
