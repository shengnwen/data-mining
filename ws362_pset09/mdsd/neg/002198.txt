I'm sorry, but honestly, I bought both of her books, read a few chapters, and I just don't like her approach to food.  Food is an addiction, yes, but I think it is unreasonable to live the rest of your life without some flour, some sugar, some good fat, and boiled meat!!!?? jesus, the day I have to eat boiled meat, just put a fork in me, I'm done and on my way to straight up deprivation binge cycles or anorexia. eating is a privelage and one of life's great pleasures, people who are healthy are priveleged to have this pleasure but life needs balance. I think of the my many relatives that have had cancer and could not eat.Even though I think Sheppard has some great connections about food and addiction, I think her approach is too extreme and not mind/body focused enough, and frankly I just didn't like her. Kudos to those she has helped, get it where you can! But, I don't think this is a five star book - going back to Geneen Rot
