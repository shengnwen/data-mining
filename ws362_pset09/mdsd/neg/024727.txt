Simply, a terribly written book.  It has a shallow plot, flat characters and no style.  His descriptions of people are often late, and tend to consist of someone's skin colour.  And that's all.  The story moves ok at first but degrades into the most uninteresting chase/camping trip in the history of the world.   The ideas presented are soft, touchy feely sort of &quot;the soul is love&quot; type crap.  Seems like it's a rip off of The Celestine Prophecy, which isn't something anyone should want to rip off in the first place
