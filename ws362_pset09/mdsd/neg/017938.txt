The essays were moderately amusing, but not a good use of my time. If you want short amusing essays, go for something like Gig or I Thought My Father Was God instead.  The advice given is often too general or too pointless to be useful (e.g., To Keep Warm -- eat right, keep your body in shape, have the right equipment; To Conduct a Background Investigation -- hire a private detective).

Maybe two of the essays were valuable if you really don't know how to tie a Winsor knot or a bow tie, but this isn't really the best way to find out because you'll never remember that the information is here and that's what the internet is for anyway
