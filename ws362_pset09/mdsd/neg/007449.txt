My amazon record shows that I actually bought this book. I had forgotten, and 'returned' it to the public library, which is where I wish I'd gotten it to begin with. The story is strained and not very informative. Great math books worth buying to read to your child include Math Trek, Math Trek 2, G is for Google, and especially, the Number Devil - reading great math books has been wonderful fun for my family - but not Sir Cumference
