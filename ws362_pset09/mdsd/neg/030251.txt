I thought this book was about the rivers themselves--perhaps she had floated these rivers and was writing about the sights and scenes.  My mistake.  The essays are very well done and I appreciate her sincerity and insights. Although there is not a description of the Brazos River in the essay about the Brazos. I enjoyed the human interest but was left wondering how the daughter's relationship turned out!
