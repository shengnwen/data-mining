I was disappointed in this book/tape.  I thought it would give me some real insights into life and spirituality, as alot of good books have.  But this was just nausiatingly gay, hopelessly drippy, and not insightful at all.  I didn't want anyone to read poetry to me or ask me to notice what a peach looks like.  I wanted something different.  I give it two stars because I know other people liked it, and others may find it nice to read/listen to
