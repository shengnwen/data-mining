My mom knows how much I enjoy bargain shopping & refinishing furniture, so she bought me a copy of this book through the mail, as well as a copy for herself. Well, before I received mine, she called me to apologize for how horrible the book was. She told me that she had received hers & was promptly returning it. In advance, she welcomed me to do the same. I received mine last week, & I have to say that I share in her disappointment! Here are the real questions: Do you like vests with doilies stitched on them? Do you like pencils holders made of soup cans with lace glued on them? Ok, if your answers were "yes," you'd love this book, but if your answers were "no," then don't waste your time or money on this book that shows you how to make lamp shades from used coffee cans & VESTS with fabric panels, lace & such. It really is an embarrassing book. Now, to give credit (& the only reason this book even deserves a "1"), there are a few cute ideas woven into their disasters of projects, but you have to have an eye to pick those things out. For example, their ivy made of pop cans & craft wire was cute, but you have to see that past the end table made of coffee cans, garden hoses, & swimming pool play toys. Their denim bolster was cute, too, but there is no excuse for filling a bolster with a 2 liter bottle! One could certainly afford a $1.50 bag of stuffing at Wal-Mart! Anyway, there are, like I said, a few notable ideas, but be ready to reinvent them with your own creativity; otherwise, people will smile at your projects through clinched teeth & say, "That's nice."
