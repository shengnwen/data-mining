Mostly a very flippant, merry tale that could have been better - or much worse. It did not elicit strong opinions in me either way, in regard to style or substance. The story is very post-modern, a little beat and, yes, quite drunken in parts. The form is distractingly lazy and light. If there is a charm or allure of this book, it would stem almost absolutely from Hunter S. Thompson's later fame and cult status and the romantic idea that "The Rum Diary" represents some kind of "lost" work. Those are interesting angles, but this novel is not strong enough to merit loud praise where literature and storytelling are concerned
