I really loved the first two books in Fforde's Thursday Next series.  Therefore, I was extremely disappointed in "The Well of Lost Plots."  I literally could not finish it.  I always have a pile of books by my bed and the call of another author was just too great.  I abandoned this book on about page 150.  I was mired in cleverness and inside book jokes.  Other reviewers have noted that this book takes place almost entirely inside the world of books.  I think that may be the problem. There's no connection to the characters in the Outland or the previous storylines.  Also, I began this book within a day of finishing "Lost in a Good Book"; maybe I just needed a break.  Thursday Next is my hero and I wanted to read more about her.  I just couldn't maintain my interest in the plot -- or lack thereof. I'm going to try the fourth book in the series, upon the recommendation of one of the reviewers, but I found this book to be considerably less satisfying than the first two. Be forewarned.
