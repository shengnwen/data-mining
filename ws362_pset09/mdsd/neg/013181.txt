This is an overly simplistic and poorly written introduction to the Arthur legend. If there weren't many better presentations of these tales for young readers, there might be an excuse for such a substandard rendering. Unless you want your kids to think that writing sentence fragments is preferable to constructing clear complex sentences, you might want to stay away from the entire &quot;Bullseye Step Into Classic&quot; series
