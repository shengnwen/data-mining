This is a poorly written, textbook style book.  It is an extremely boring read.

The book focuses on the sources of information used by historians as much as the history itself.  The large amount of text dedicated to the early (pre-historic) history was not made meaningful in the context of how Rome developed.

If you want an overview of how The Roman Empire developed I would suggest you search elsewhere
