At first you think that this book is going to give you insight into the stardard language as spoken in Britain, Australia, and so on. There is a lot on diversity but we never quite get to the practical side of things and it is all left a bit unclear. What I needed was a straightforward guide for my work, when I travel on business, so I avoid misunderstandings and get the language right when I talk. It would be really helpful if this author could write a book with a description of the standard language for each country and vocabulary lists for the most usual words. You could then look across. I am going to Australia, then I say this, I am going to Britain, then I say this, and so on
