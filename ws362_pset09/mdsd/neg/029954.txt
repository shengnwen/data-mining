Dave Barry's Bad Habits has comedy fiction writer Dave Barry trying his hand at the non fiction market.  Although he achieved quality work in this genre with later attempts such Homes and Other Black Holes, this book was clearly just cashing in on the success of his fiction with little effort put in whatsoever.  There's lots of references to Commies which either means Barry was extremely paranoid and brainwashed by his government of the time or he is retelling the same joke over and over again throughout the book, a joke that isn't that funny the first time and is really irritating when repeated and repeated and repeated.   Barry also insists on telling us his personal stories in this book, obviously the publishers had a word in his ear with future non fiction books as these stories are hardly evident in those books but unfortunately they are here and aren't that interesting.

Dave Barry can write some really good stuff, both fiction and non fiction.  Dave Barry's Bad Habits unfortunately is not one of those occasions.
