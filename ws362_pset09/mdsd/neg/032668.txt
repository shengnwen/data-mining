I hate this book.  It only gives a few solutions, maybe 5 out of a 100 (if your lucky).  I don't know if I am doing my work right or not.  There is no way to check.  Every math book I have had gives answers to odd# questions in the back, this is very helpful to see if you are going in the right direction.  Not this book.  You can spend hours and not know that you are doing it completely wrong. This does not help if you have 300 problems to do, and a week before class meets
