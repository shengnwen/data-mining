I like reading.  I am a literature snob.  I put down poorly written novels (even though I can't write well myself!).  But, I think I've met my match in this novel.  I recognize the style is something unique, but I just couldn't grasp the rhythm.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down.  I really want to be in the group that appreciates this Plitzer Prize novel, but I don't make the cut.  
     HOwever, I'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because I just couldn't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring 40-something man whom I would't enjoy spending a 3-day-weekend with at all.  
     I've persistantly struggled through 180 pages, but now will surrender!
