I've taught "conceptual" (fundamental) physics from this text at two universities and one community college.  I have never liked the text - and this later edition has not changed my mind.  (Don't let the catchy cover photo fool you.)  Fortunately I no longer have to use the text.  It is just too long and filled with too many topics for a one semester college level "conceptual physics" course.  I don't think most college instructors who use this text ever make it through half the topics.  

This text isn't adequate for even a high school physical science course, and certainly not for a "college bound" physics course.  I can't imagine using this text to teach high school physics.  If it is routinely used to do so, that may partially explain why Americans lag so far behind the rest of the world in science at the pre-college level.  The text is really intended for (college level) non-science majors to give them some exposure to physical principals without a lot of "heavy duty" math.  Unfortunately with over thirty (30!) chapters it takes too long for them to get through much of it in a semester.        

If you want to "teach yourself physics," there are better, cheaper and clearer texts and books for the novice available.  I wouldn't recommend spending the money for this text when you could buy a small library in paperback on physics for less.  If you have some algebra and trig and have taken some science before, don't bother with this text and it's outdated gimmicks and anecdotes.  (If you've had some calculus, don't even consider this text.) The teaching materials that "complement" the text are also very sub-par and amount to little more than advertisements for the author, and are just unusable in a modern class room.
