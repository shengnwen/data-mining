Similarities: The cover looks exactly the same, the main character goes by "Lang" (Lang Reilly - Robert Langdon!!), it takes place all over Europe, the storyline also has to do with the Knights Templar, people die, etc. (Seems as if the author doesn't have very many original ideas...)

Differences: The main charachter is not likeable, many many spelling mistakes (??), the last page is uneccesary (in my opinion), and it seemed like important parts didn't get the attention to detail that they deserved.

I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because it held my interest enough for me to finish it, but it's not something I would read again
