Almost every character in this book is unlikeable, unbelievable, and leads a life of unremitting misery, to no end.  Morris gratuitously gives even her most minor characters sickening motives and gross stupidity.  Morris writes well, but her vision of reality is badly flawed.  The book is a mess, so depressing that, thank God, by the end it's almost laughable.
