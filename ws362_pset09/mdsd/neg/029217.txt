Backhouse tries to give a brief, accessible summary of the history of economics, but the book is so dry that it is almost unreadable.  Although Backhouse brings in some social and political background, for the most part he's just listing people and theories.  His explanations, designed for non-technical readers, are not mathematically complex, and do avoid unneccesary terminology.  But they're written in a choppy, condensed style, without illumination from real-world examples.  The result is just not compelling reading.  And his decision to take his history back to Greek times doesn't really work: the pre-modern thinkers omitted from most standard histories aren't consciously writing about economics.  Rather, Backhouse is inferring economic assumptions from literary or ethical discussions.  This discussion is potentially interesting (although it suffers from the same flaws as the rest of the book), but not really the same subject-matter as the conventional history of economics
