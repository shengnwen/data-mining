I had the hardest time not picking up a pen to grammatically correct this novel--there were even times when the characters' names were misspelled.  Also, the inconsistencies in the plot just about drove me nuts.  For example, Katherine has Thomas meet &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; at a luncheon and then arranges for him to have private social time with each of them.  Although only a few days had passed since the luncheon, Jasmine greeted Thomas with &quot;You must be Dr. Baker.&quot;  Oh please.  The maturity level of this novel is that of a middle schooler, who has never experienced first love and has no real idea of the challenges it poses.  Do not waste your time on this novel.  There are too many others published by Arabesque that are much better
