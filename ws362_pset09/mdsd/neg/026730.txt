I have been a Learning Specialist for nearly twenty years at the high school and community college levels.  When I read "Engaging Autism" by Stanley I. Greenspan, I was anticipating a book filled with fresh information, scientific validity, and ideas that could be realistically applied in a variety of classroom settings.  Instead, I read page after page of disappointment.  DIR/Floortime is an interesting/innovative approach for helping individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and other developmental disabilities.  However, this book was extremely weak in the following areas:  repetition of the same ideas/concepts throughout the work, reliance on anecdotal information, no scientific validation of information, absence of an in-depth bibliography, frequent reference to products written by Greenspan and his team, and lack of organization throughout the text.  DIR/Floortime is presented as too simplistic when in actuality it appears to be extremely time consuming and labor instensive which is impractical in contemporary public education settings.  The author recommends homeschooling and intense family involvement as though this was a simple solution.  However, parents uusually do not have the extensive time or expertise to devote to the DIR/Floortime approach.  If you are interested in learning what DIR/Floortime entails, I recommend researching Internet sources or consulting works by other authors.  This book is largely a waste of time for professionals in the field of special education.  Unless you want to read a rehash of ideas over and over again, I would not waste my time with this book.  I was going to order another book by Dr. Greenspan entitled "The Child With Special Needs:  Encouraging Intellectual and Emotional Growth" but will not be doing it at this time.
