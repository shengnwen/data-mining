I can only imagine that this book was written for the sole purpose of making money off of poor schmucks, like myself, who bought it thinking it might have some useful information.  It doesn't, save your money and look elsewhere on the given subject.  Example information conveyed in the book includes, in essence, such helpful hints as don't buy rental homes next to slums or trash-dumps.
