I have to agree that it can be condensed a lot....  He comes off as all knowing and we should listen to his every word. Real estate is where to put the money, well my IMHO I think the housing market is about to crash, so does Greenspan, why do you think he's getting out while he can.  I bought the book used, for the one or two nuggets it's ok.  Ok, prepare for the crash that everyone knows is coming anyway, and with Katrina, Rita and Iraq you don't need to be a prophet. CASH, GOLD, I recommend, not property, free, enjoy
