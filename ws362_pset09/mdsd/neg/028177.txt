I expected this book to be much better than it was.  Brooks tries to be too &quot;cool&quot; while writing this book, and the reader often struggles just to identify who his audience is, whether it be adolescant boys or grown fathers.  The chapter on bullies was highly ridiculous.  I've seen plenty of bullies in my day that would love to fight rather than just ruffle someone's feathers.  Overall, the book is entertaining but is surely not one of those books you can't put down before finishing
