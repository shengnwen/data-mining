I had to read this book for school, and that is the only thing that kept me motivated to read it!  It is informative, but extremely boring!  I have read many text books and this is the second worst I have been forced to read, the worst is also by White, titled Advancing Family Theories. This man knows his stuff, but he can not write.  The book outlines family theories in a way that makes a visit to the dentist look fun.  He covers the subject he set out to do that is the only reason I gave him two stars.  If you are a professor considering this book please reconsider, if you have any compassion for your students, however, if you are basically EVIL and want to make student suffer this is the book for you!
