I have not read the other books in this trilogy - in fact I only learned it was a trilogy by checking the reviews here on Amazon. 

The book starts out in the middle of a thought, then before finishing the first one, proceeds to drop us smack in the middle of many other thoughts and conversations. Not nearly enough context is provided, so the reader is left trying to peice clues together, trying to decide whether there's anything here worth getting involved in.

I couldn't make the jump. After 64 pages, I have given up. In fairness to the author, I'll look for a copy of Hammered - maybe it works better if you start at the beginning
