I have read many of Koontz's books and I have got to say that this is the worst one that I've read to date.  For those that have yet to sink their teeth into some of Koontz's better work, I would suggest Mr. Murder or Intensity.  Leave this one on the shelf to collect dust.  Or better yet, throw it in the trash with the rest of the garbage.
