I just want to let everyone know right now that this is not a good biography.  I'm all for the Bio that only concentrates in the career of the person in fact I prefer it to reading about their personal life.  but this book was just horribly self- indulgent and     un interesting to read even if you are a big fan of Johnny Depp's work.  so I would recommend saying away from this one cause there are plenty better bios than this
