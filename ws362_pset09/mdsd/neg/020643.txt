So far I've seen 67 out of 68 positive reviews for this book, and I say "Hurrah" for Richard Russo for all his positive praise. However, I disagree. The book has a flimsy to nonexistent foundation, that being backstory which takes circuitous twists and turns, and those turns take further turns.. So far I'm averaging 3 to 4 pages a night, and I'm a prolific reader. Why is Russo so fearful of forwarding the plot? Why the back and forth, the past histories upon past histories of every minor character? Just too much "muchiness" as the Brits would say
