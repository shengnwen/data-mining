We live in a man's world. Women are raped, abused, beaten and generally regarded as objects for male gratification. This is an epidemic problem, and Christian men are just as great of offenders as the general population.

So here comes another book on male sexuality, for Christian men. The idea is good: rein in the beast. But the major defect, which sinks the book, is the self-centered nature of the remedy. 

Christian men are given a toolkit to not look at booty. What we are not given is a concrete understanding of compassion. It's all self-centered. Who cares if the world is just as dangerous for our wives, daughters, and loved ones? At least I'm "sexually pure." 

Surely sexual purity includes overthrowing the sexual aggression in society at large? This is a life and death situation. We will be successful according to the goals we set. It is not enough for men to stop lusting. We need to fundamentally change the sexual ethics of our society - ethics that aren't greatly concerned with women's well-being. 

If you're only concerned with your own thoughts, this book could be useful. But what about the sense of security for the women in our society, who have to live with sexual aggression, cat-calls and "hey-baby"s? This book sets shamefully low standards for the church's role in reshaping society, even as it sets admirably high standards for individual men's thought-lives
