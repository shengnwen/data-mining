Racism is not the problem with this book - sure...5 Chinese brothers look alike -maybe they look alike because they are brothers, not because they are Chinese.  I bought this book because generally I love the books written in earlier times - they have a quaintness about their stories and illustrations that can transport you and your child to another time.  This book does have engaging illustrations.  What I find disturbing is the fact that this is a book for children yet:

(1)	a little boy drowns, never to be seen again
(2)	one brother is tried, arrested and sentenced to have his head cut off
(3)	the people of the village assemble in the village to witness the execution where the "executioner took his sword and struck a mighty blow"
(4)	the next brother was sentenced to be drowned and was thrown overboard from a boat
(5)	the next brother is sentenced to be burned alive - he was tied up to a stake and set fire 
(6)	the next brother is sentenced to be suffocated - he's shovelled into an oven

This is no more appropriate for a child (or adult for that matter) in 1936 than it is in 2005.  Now, a lot of you are probably thinking I'm one of those mothers who just needs to get a sense of humour and lighten up.  I'm not...I love the Giving Tree, and can put naughty Eloise (and the smoking nanny) in context, as I can many other books that polarise readers.  I really wanted to like this book but trust me....if you buy it, you will have lots of uncomfortable explaining to do to a young child.  An eight year old may be able to put it in context, but there is no way you should read this to a four year old.   If you want a great book written in the 1930s, buy Ferdinand the Bull instead.  It's a fantastic book.
