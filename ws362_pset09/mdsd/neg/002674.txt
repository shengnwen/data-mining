I won't be as kind as some of the other reviewers who were disappointed in this edition.  It's a load of crap!  Back in the 80's it was the only thing going, but each successive edition has gotten less and less helpful, until it's finally degenerated to a great big commercial for What's Playing On The Radio.  Hey, if I needed to know what was playing on the radio, I'd turn on the radio!

I just saved you thirty bucks.  You can thank me later
