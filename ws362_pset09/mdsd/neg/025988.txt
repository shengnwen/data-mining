Halliwell's is maddeningly opinionated and uneven.  Anyone with a passing knowledge of movies will find much to infuriate him.  For example, it dismisses James Cagney with 4 lines and Edward G. Robinson with 3 but squanders 11 lines on Jennifer Aniston and 12 on Winona Ryder. Here's what the author says about Gene Kelly, who just happens to grace the cover of this book:  "...his acting and singing abilities were minimal and his 'good guy' characterization wore a little thin."  It has a knack for finding the nastiest, cattiest quotes about the victims listed.  For example, one actress is called "a vacuum with nipples."  It tends to dwell on the more salacious personal details of the actors lives, much of which is of questionable veracity, especially gossip dealing with actors sexuality.  Also, I found many problems with the information listed such as the same quote attributed to two different people, no ending date for TV shows long off the air, and incomplete credits trailing off with "etc."  It does give helpful lists in the back of the Oscars, BAFTA, and AFI but anyone looking for a straight reference guide with dates, places of birth, complete credits, and unquestionable facts should look elsewhere.
