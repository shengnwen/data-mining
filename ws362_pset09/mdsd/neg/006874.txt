A little disappointing after reading Barnyard Dance, but a good rhythm none the less. I don't like the "ew" in reference to broccoli stew. I guess I'm for encouraging kids to eat their vegetables. Also, the small animals tell large animals to go do big guy things because they're too large. I don't like the implication there either (no, I'm not large)
