This is the first Jonathan Kellerman novel I've ever read, and only because it was a loaner. But, I ended up enjoying it. 

The story is about Alex Delaware's quest to find out who murdered a former patient of his, and why. The patient was Lauren Teague, whom Alex had only seen for 2 sessions when Lauren was 15. Then after those sessions, she never returned, and Alex didn't give much thought about her until he encountered her 6 years later. After another brief session with Lauren, she disappeared again, and 4 years later her mother, Jane, contacted Alex, frantic that Lauren was missing. Therefore, Alex becomes enmeshed in the hunt for her killer or killers, placing his own life at risk.

I thought the basic plot itself was good. However, the story got a little bit convoluted at times, what with Alex's list of possible suspects changing on a constant basis. Plus, each suspects connection to other people in the story tended to get a little confusing as well. Nevertheless, you're still kept guessing as to who really perpetrated the crime. 

As for Alex's personal life and his relationship with Robin, I didn't really find that very believable. I am sure their relationship has obviously been built up in prior novels, but since this is the only one I've read, that's what I'm basing this on. And the book's description said their relationship was being strained due to Alex's involvement in the case. Yet, from my perspective, it didn't seem like much of a relationship to begin with.

At any rate, it was a good story, and I would probably read another book by this author
