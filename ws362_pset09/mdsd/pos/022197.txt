In the second book of the Sally Lockhart trilogy, Pullman again treats us to the adventures of the Victorian gal who operates more like a woman of the 21st Century. She is independent and wily and doesn't give a hoot for convention. The menacing villain in this episode is evil but doesn't know it. Once again, Pullman never insults the intelligence of his readers. Things complicated by design are left complicated. No simplification here. No sentimentality either. The characters are bright and real or really nasty. All around a very good read. It's very refreshing to read a good mystery by an excellent writer
