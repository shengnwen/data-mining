Overall, this is a great insider's view on CIA work in East Asia against Osama.  Mr.Scheuer does a great job explaining the in's and outs of whats going on, being careful not to divulge classified data, but at the same time, paint an open picture of whats going on.

  I found the research well done, but the analysis off by a ways.  Chapters on the ineptitude of the FBI, were funny, and did nothing to break the Stereotype that the FBI doesn't like the CIA, and vice versa
