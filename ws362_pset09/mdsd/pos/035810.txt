Coming from other roleplaying games I have not been in contact with Dungeons and Dragons since 2.0, and that was ages ago, so I cannot reflect on the amount or quality of changes between 3.0 and 3.5 which seems to be a big debate in reviews for the 3.5 core books. All I can say is that this is an excellent resource for D&D players!

Creating a character is a fairly straightforward process. What I would have liked is a simple cheat sheet at the beginning of the book for creating a character. That would have made the process easier for new players. With the current layout of the book there are tables strewn over three different chapters, and in order to complete your character you need to touch all three chapters. For instance, race modifiers to statistics, age groups, and other common characteristics would have been excellent to have right at the start in an easy to find section. These tables can of course be found by looking in the table index at the end of the book, but that can prove difficult for a new player.

As far as I am concerned, the artwork and layout is great and the Player's Handbook provides an easy-to-read source for all ages.

Touching on classes and balance, I think that the book provides a good set of guidelines for any type of campaign. If a class seems overpowering, modify it. These are not rules written in blood. I consider them guidelines, not law. If I want to tone down the cleric or the druid, I will do so if I see fit. I might just leave them the way they are and have everybody in my group play a cleric to send them against a humongous horde of liches that cannot be turned on top of being immune to magic.

Having said that, I think that this book was well worth the money I spent on it and the other two core rulebooks. I treasure this tome and its siblings and heartily recommend it to any player of D&D, beginner or expert
