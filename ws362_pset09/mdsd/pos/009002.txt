This book provides some excellent rules to implement and develop weapons and items of legendary proportion.  I have seen many different rule sets from various sources that create "leveled" items that a PC can use throughout their career.  Most of them end up creating unbalanced situations.  These rules seem to be thoroughly thought out and well balanced.  We have already implemented this book into our current campaigns
