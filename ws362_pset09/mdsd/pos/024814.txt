This novel is no less than an epic minus the length. The potency of the novel will stir even the most insipid soul. It revolves around the central character Bazarov, a nihilst, who stands in sharp contrast with the traditional values of Russian society. Bazarov views everything with his scientific lens this draws a duel between him and the other characters, mostly the elders. As the novel progresses the gaps between the characters widens but beneath this there is a torrent of emotions that binds them together. 

Also, the characters are explored in detail which creates a sense of intimacy and a feeling of sympathy. Again Turgenev is a master here with his impeccable narration. 
In short, 'Fathers and sons' captures the generational gap that exists and will continue to exist between the younger and the older generations.
