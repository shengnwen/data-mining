If someone could be described as deliciously evil, I guess it would be Constance Blackwood -- never eat her food if you reviled her good nature.

The central characters are Constance -- a late 20's spinster matriarch -- who tends to a few surviving relatives. Before the times outlined in this book, a meal Constance had prepared poisoned her mother, her father, her aunt and her uncle. Her uncle lived, but extremely infirmed. Her teenage sister Merricat (Katherine) lived without infirmity -- for reasons we learn later in the book.

The people are polite in a Victorian way. Merricat is tomboyish like Scout of "To Kill a Mockingbird." With the vast land holdings, Merricat's world is her "Secret Garden."  Their world is brilliantly innocent in the land and home provided by their dearly deceased parents. Yet, their poisonous meal is complicatingly ferocious and conniving.

Constance's inner feelings about her place with the family are slowly revealed to us. But, not entirely. Much like the painting movements of the middle 20th century, this 1960's novel's minimalist disclosure of the girls' characters and reasons for Constance's murderous  actions are the mastery of the art to which we view.

Many of the items herein may be symbolism at its sublest. Written post-McCarthyism era, the rioting judgmental crowd may symbolize more than small people with small minds. Constance may be more than a young spinster who is tired of parental pressures. 

This is a page-turning book. Short in length, and fast in style, Jackson delivers a ghoulish, eerie, and creepy experience to us. Oh, what a great black and white movie this would make.
