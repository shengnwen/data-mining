I'm guessing Lynda Barry and I are about the same age. I found her dark novel hard to stop reading. I have no doubt there are people of all ages who lived such frightening times in there lives. The world isn't peaches and cream. Still, there is something about Ms. Berry's writing that grabs the reader. 

Not for the squeamish
