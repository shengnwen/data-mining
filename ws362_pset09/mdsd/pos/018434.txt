How many books are there that you pick up to read after dinner and you are still reading in your room at midnight and you haven't even gotten up to go to the bathroom?  Life in the Fat Lane is one of those books. It starts with a beauty pageant resume for Lara, and it ends with her almost a hundred pounds fatter. It is one of those books that make you feel all kinds of emotions. You are mad at Lara for her attitudes at the beginning, and then you kind of feel bad for her, and then you are so happy at what she has learned because you have learned it too. The book is very easy to read and doesn't have the kind of flowery stuff that you find in so many other books that might be assigned in school. It is all about Lara and all about the story. I have just started to read it again. That is how good it is
