Well, after reading a few chapters I looked to see who the publisher was because I knew few publishers would take this one on. Well, shock- shock, the Pearls had to publish it themselves. The book is hard to take-and this is coming from someone who loves the Lord and follows His Word. I read and prayed about what I'd read. The book is filled with Bible verses not taken out of context. It explained the whole submissive thing so very well. 
My marriage is a wonderful one already, but there were a few things that bothered me. This book takes on all the difficult issues. I had decided to change and did what it said and WOW! I've grown up amongst feminist stuff and just needed to hear the Truth. I have changed and our marriage is even better. Absolutely no one who is not born again will agree with this book. I, however, am profoundly grateful to Debi for writing it.
