There is nothing remarkable about the literary style of Butler's book; it reads like a million and a half other 19th century British novels.  What distinguishes "The Way of All Flesh", however, is its honest and at times funny portrayal of Victorian society.  With great wit, Butler's narrator, Overton, and main character, Ernest, expose the stuffy, staid, hypermannered, insipid Victorian middle-class mindset.  

What is especially nice is that Butler doesn't take too many cheap shots.  The characters here are very well-drawn.  Ernest's father, Theobald, though clearly representing all that Butler seeks to skewer, is enough of a three-dimensional foil that I could feel some sympathy for the poor old man.  (He's not evil incarnate, just a sorry product of his time.)  The same goes for the rest of the supporting cast.  I like the narrator's voice; it's distinctive and wry enough to be unique, but not so intrusive as to distract from the plot.

Parts of the novel are funny; parts seem to drag.  I don't know that I liked the end of the novel--everything seems tied together a little too perfectly; but an explanation may be found in the fact that Butler did not edit this portion of the novel before his death.  

This is a solid book.  Give it a shot
