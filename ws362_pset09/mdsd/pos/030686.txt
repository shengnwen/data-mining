In my opinion, Minirth and Meier have written a helpful book on helping people deal with depression.  While the authors certainly allow for heredity and other factors as causes of depression, the main focus is for the reader to take responsibility for his/her own life.

The book is divided into 3 major sections:

1.  WHAT IS DEPRESSION?
2.  WHAT CAUSES DEPRESSION?
3.  HOW CAN ONE OVERCOME DEPRESSION?

I particularly enjoyed reading the last section as it is full of practical suggestions for dealing with and overcoming depression.  Although I do not consider myself as someone who struggles with depression, I found the book to be full of practical suggestions to keep me from approaching the brink of depression.

Again, the authors' focus is for the reader to take responsibility for his/her own life rather than to just let circumstances dictate one's response and approach to life.

While not probably the final authority on depression, the book is still a helpful aid to fighting depression.  While the authors are Christians, anyone, non-Christians included, will benefit from the suggestions.

Read and enjoy.  Recommended.
