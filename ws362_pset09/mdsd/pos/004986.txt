I truly feel that the author was only looking out for the next guy when he wrote this book.  People go into business every day and business' fail everyday just because if people knew better they would do better.  And as a  striving young business owner myself I truly appreciate someone who has  maybe already experienced this type of behavior keeping it real for someone  just starting out or who maybe can't afford high tech security systems.   Thanks and I look forward to reading more books by him
