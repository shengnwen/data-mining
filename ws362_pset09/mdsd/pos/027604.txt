Thus begins the seventh book in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Baudelaire orphans have escaped the evil Count Olaf once again and are back with Mr. Poe who is looking to find a new guardian and home for the three children.  Where six previous guardians have failed the children in a variety of ways it is decided that a village will be able to do a better job raising the children than an individual.  Following the clue "V.F.D" the children select the village of V.F.D. to make their home and hopefully rescue the two Quagmire Triplets.  The Village of Fowl Devotees is, of course, nothing like what they had hoped and does not obviously hold the clue they need to find their friends.  The village immediately puts the three children to work and Violet, Sunny, and Klaus struggle under the restrictions of the village.  

Those familiar with the series (and anyone reading the seventh volume should be) will be immediately familiar with the language and formula of The Vile Village.  Snicket has a good thing going and he sticks to what this series is: A report from a fictional author named Lemony Snicket on the series of unfortunate events which befall the Baudelaires.  It is written in a very kid friendly voice, though one which repeatedly warns the reader from reading on about the horrible events which are to come.  It is a perfect formula which serves the series well.  If, at times, the books sound and feel like every other book in the series, it is only to be expected.  But the younger readers will certainly love the Lemony Snicket books and the adult reader can enjoy them just as much.
