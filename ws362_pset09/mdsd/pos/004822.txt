This is a great book.  At the start I thought I was headed into a story of good versus bad, where nature played the good guy and man the bad.  As if things could be that simple.  Instead I found an honest well-balanced story that centers on a young boy's efforts to save his home in the rain forest. Ms. George provides fascinating descriptions of the many layers of animal and human life that are engaged in the same struggle for survival.  All is brought to a satisfactory conclusion with the hidden acknowledgement that it still takes one kind of green stuff to save another kind of green stuff
