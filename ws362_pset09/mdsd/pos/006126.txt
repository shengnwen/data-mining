Graham Hancock has studied the subject of ancient cultures and their roots far more thoroughly than most archaeologists. Underworld is a huge undertaking as it is not bound to a particular dig or single marine area - but focuses on a number of intrigueing sites around the world that all converge to paint a picture of a vast and incredibly old civilization. Graham's use and analysis of myth and folklore as well as religion and linguistics - and willingness to look beyond traditional paradigms - all help to bring a refreshing new perspective to the archaeological record. His detective work is to be applauded. If one will take the time to read the complete book (700 pages!) and check out many of the footnotes you cannot but help arrive at the conclusion that there was once a very large and relatively advanced culture that goes back much farther in the archaeological record than heretofore accepted. This book has vast implications and is important piece of baseline research that will no doubt be increasingly appreciated as new terrestrial and offshore finds are made in the future.
