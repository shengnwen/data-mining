This is the second Coupland book I have read (after JPod) and found this book, although difficult going at times, ultimately rewarding.

For quite a bit of the book, I didn't think it was going too well. Clear plotlines and stereotyped, easy to understand characters are not traits of this book. It's not a super action packed book and generally it isn't an extraordinary tale. It's a lot more realistic and closer to home, but does that make a good book?

Once complete, it becomes clear. The author's vision needs to be taken as a whole and, as a complete piece of work I think it's outstanding. The more I think about it, the better I think it is!

There was a lot of hype about this book, so some may be disappointed. However, it's quite short, it's unusual and I thought it had a great ending
