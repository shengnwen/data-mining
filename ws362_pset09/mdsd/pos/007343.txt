This is the first book of Leiber's that I have read and I am very  impressed.  Though the book was written in the 1950's it is able to  transend 40 odd years and still be relevent in todays thinking.  The most  interesting twist is how Leiber moved away from science explaining the  supernatural to science using the supernatural to maintain control on an  ignorant society of peasents.  Another impressive twist to the book was  Leiber's ability to move the focus of the novel from between three  different, yet important characters, without any interuption.  I can not  wait to read more of his books
