My 5th graders enjoy this book.  After &quot;reading&quot; this wordless book, we tour our school and observe the &quot;alphabet school.&quot;  It is amazing how many letters they find in the most obscure locations.  The search continues for weeks.  This is a great way to hone observational skills and attention to detail.  Wonderful book
