Jo Freeman has authored a multifaceted memoir of her years as an undergraduate campus activist at Berkeley.  She entered Cal in the fall of 1961 as a 16 year-old from the San Fernando Valley and graduated in the spring of 1965 after the Free Speech Movement had shaken the Berkeley Administration and energized not only activists but seemingly an entire campus.  It is part the story of a teenager growing up quickly, making dumb mistakes and surmounting them.  It is part a story of civil rights activism, including the truly difficult decision of whether civil disobedience is justifiable when the conduct one is challenging is not illegal.  (Freeman was arrested and tried three times, being convicted twice, and causing a split with her mother.)  More importantly this is an insider's acccount of the Free Speech Movement, its politics and personalities.  Freeman also strives to take account of the FSM's opponents: the Berkeley Administration, the Regents, the press, and, of course, politicians.  It is no easy task to weave so many stories together in a coherent whole, and Freeman has done a fine job of bringing her knowledge as an adult to bear on her actions forty years ago.  This is a terrific look at the optimism of the 1960s before Vietnam, summer riots, and drugs intervened to scar the decade
