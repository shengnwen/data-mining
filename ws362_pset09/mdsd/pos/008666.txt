Davia Frawley says in foreword: Practical Ayurveda is an excellent  introduction to the system of Ayurveda and one that is concise, direct, and easy to understand. The book meets these observations. It is written to normal educated western audience. The author introduces the reader to the  three humors ( three kind of bodies  - Vata, Pitta, Kapha). He gives  directions to identify one's body type. He explains how ayurveda views  disease as imbalance of humors. Food is recognised as medicine. A chapter  deals with herbs. ( Appendix gives  the terms in latin, indian context). A  separate chapter on weight loss and beauty care, which are concerns of  modern human being.  He has written a chapter on sexual rejuvenration  methods. He points out from Ayurvedic point of view, sexual pleasure is  postively viewed. The author is a spiritual seeker. He talks about his guru  Poonjaji's a visionary trip to Himalayas where he observes that a sadhu cut  off from all human contacts has a girlie magazine under his stone pillow.  The author point outs that celibacy and brahmacharya are not one and the  same. He also provides another woman seeker's personal observations in this  context. Yet, the chapter is not balanced; A good bibliography is given,  which referrences to scientific journals. A ideal book for marriage gift
