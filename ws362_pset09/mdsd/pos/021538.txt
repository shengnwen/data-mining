I enjoy reading mysteries and have read quite a few in my time, but I've never before come across anything like "The Woman in White." I'm always a little skeptical when I hear a book being described as a page turner but that description fits this novel to a tee. I found it very hard to find a stopping place each evening and lost more than a few hours of sleep, but it was definitely worth every minute! 

I don't want to give away too much of the plot but here is a very brief overview. Walter Hartright is a drawing instructor who has been engaged by Mr. Frederick Fairlie of Limmeridge Estate to tutor his niece, Laura, and her half-sister Marian Halcombe. On his way to take up this appointment Walter encounters a woman along the road, a mysterious woman dressed completely in white. He offers his assistance to the woman and soon after they part he discovers that she is an escapee from a mental asylum and is being sought by the local authorities. Walter travels on to Limmeridge but his experience with this mysterious woman is far from over. Upon his arrival he is surprised to discover that Miss Laura Fairlie bears an uncanny resemblance to the woman in white. This amazing story of deception and mistaken identities takes off from there and the suspense doesn't let up until the final pages! 

One of the things that is so gripping about this novel is the way it is written, in the form of a narrative told in turn by each of the major characters. It is almost as if they are giving their testimony about the incidents to a jury in a courtroom. One character narrates the story to a certain point and then the next person takes up the story from there and so on and on. It's just such a good book and so hard to put down. Mr. Collins was a genius in the way in which he brought everything together. The ending is terrific! This is definitely one of the best mysteries I've ever read. Don't miss it
