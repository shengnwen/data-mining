My daughter (2 1/2) is a huge fan of Karma Wilson books!  This one is no exception.  It's a fun read, it's the perfect length, and the illustrations in it are fun and colorful for the kids to look at.  This has quickly become a huge favorite in this house. If you like this book, you'd love, "Hilda Must be Dancing", "Bear Wants More", "Bears First Christmas". There are all must have books in our kids library at home.
