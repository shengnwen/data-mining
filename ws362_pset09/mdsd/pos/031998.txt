This is the defining book on the man who defined the game that defined America in the early 20th century.  The Big Bam is a wonderful set piece about Ruth and the times in which he lived (and shaped to a large degree). The anecdotes about the Babe are insightful and entertaining, the narrative is lively and lucid, and the whole is greater than its parts.  I came away with a keen sense of the man--that he was a perpetual adolescent whose enormous talent helped transform baseball from "chess on grass" to the modern power game via the home run.
