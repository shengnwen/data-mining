This book presents manners in a fun and familiar context for little  readers. My kids already love Huckle and Lowly, so it was easy for them to  enjoy this book. My favorite story is Pig Will and Pig Won't. At my house,  we need constant reminders on good manners, and this book makes it fun.  Parents will enjoy it too
