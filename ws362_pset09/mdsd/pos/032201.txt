A very insightful and readable biography
of American perpetual Presidential Candi-
date Pat Buchanan, who used to be very
good on the McLaughlin Group. Buchanan
got my vote in 2000 when he ran on the
Reform Party tix and I was 4th District
Delegate in Ches., VA. Buchanan's troops
marched off with the matching funds, Buch-
anan started a silly Newsletter and a new
Third political party of hacks and started
using that stupid 'judeo-Christian' moniker
again. I threw in the towel on him after
trying to talk sense into his brainwashed 
followers. His sorry Newsletter was always
late and I ordered a bumper sticker from
his website store and got his Amer. 1st
Party Newsletter instead. What a bunch of
idiots he has working for him! Poor old
guy. His follow-up books are not very good.
They all leave out the United Nations /N.W.O
connection to everything. How the mighty have 
fallen. I can't beleive a man this intelligent
is involved in the Knights of Malta and his
heroes are Reagan [one of the worst Presidents
of all time] and Nixon [one of the worst men
ever in the Whitehouse. Can you believe that
Nixon had Joe Namath on his enemies list? JOE
NAMATH?!] What could have been...Sigh
