I was introduced to Alexandre Dumas' Black Tulip in the 1950s via the Classics Comics adaptation. A few years later, I read an English translation of the novel, which may or may not have been complete. One current paperback edition says with honesty that they have chosen to reprint an abridged translation. But Penguin gives it to us complete, in the translation of Robin Buss.

Buss restores passages that others have omitted, such as a two-page description of the city of Haarlem in Chapter 31. Although he tries to give us a complete, authentic text, he does introduce modern colloquialisms. One translation says that Boxtel "scolded" Rosa's father. Buss's says that "he told him off." This may be anachronistic, but it does add to the effect and does not compromise the author's intentions. Unfortunately, I do not have access to the original French text at this time.

I usually have to read novels in English, either original or a translation. I seek out complete, unabridged editions. I figure that I want to be the one to decide what to gloss over or read superficially. I don't want the translator to make the decision for me on what to cut out. Vive Robin Buss
