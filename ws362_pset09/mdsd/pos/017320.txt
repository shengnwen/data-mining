The Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo is about a mouse that falls in love with a princess named Pea.  Despereaux is different from the other mice because he reads books and talks to humans.  When Pea is kidnapped by a servant named Miggery Sow, Despereaux tries to save her.  Despereaux is a brave mouse.  The book is interesting and I read it two times! Well, my teacher read it once and I am reading it again now.  I like the characters because the do and say funny things.  I like it when Miggery Sow answers everyone with "Gor!"  
The book teaches an important lesson.  Even though Despereaux is a mouse and Pea is a princess, they still love each other.
