This book is just SO GOOD.  I have been using it for over 35 years now and every time I pick it up I am reminded, with pleasure, of how much it has helped me parent, grandparent and now professionally "parent" as a nanny.

There are many excellent parenting guides out there but this is the true original.  Some of the examples are a bit dated and reflect a less complicated time but the PRINCIPLES of effective parenting are well in place.

I have taught parenting classes for 30 years and always have parents tell me that when they read it they feel like the author must have been looking into the windows of their home because he knows just what goes on.  What's even better is that he tells you what to do about it.

The chapters on Encouragement, Natural and Logical Consequences and The Child's Mistaken Goals can't be beat.  Even if you just read those chapters you would have your money's worth.

This isn't a 'fast read', but is one that you will turn to again and again because it explains the principles of rearing children so well.  Wonderful examples.
