Residents of New Chapel, Indiana enjoy the annual Pickle Fest though Abby Knight considered skipping the gala this year so that's he could sleep late.  However, needing rest is not worth the cost of the wrath Maureen "Mad Mo" Knight, her mom for skipping the event.  Thus Abby, owner of Bloomers Florist and her best friend Nikki Hiduke are watching the parade when Snuggles the Clown threatens her.  Abby's boyfriend former Army Ranger and ex cop Marco Salvares joins them and her family, but abruptly leaves; Abby fears he will beat up Snuggles for his snarling comment.

Marco fails to return to the festivity; soon afterward, Snuggles is found literally picking daisies as someone murdered him.  The police think Marco killed the clown as a witness insists they saw him leave the deceased's home just before the murder occurred.  Though he had motive (insult to his girlfriend), means (his military experience), and opportunity (last seen in the victim's house) Abby knows her Marco, man of mystery, did not kill Snuggles though he behaving suspiciously.   Not trusting the police to look beyond her boyfriend, she makes inquiries that place her in danger.

The fifth Flower Shop mystery (see SNIPPED IN THE BUD and DEARLY DEPOTTED, etc.) is a delightful lighthearted cozy that unlike its predecessors, which had a myriad of suspects, there is only one contender this time around.  Thus Abby feels she must uncover a different motive as that seems too weak for a professional like Marco and once she finds the reason for the homicide, she assumes she will find the real culprit.  Amateur sleuth fans will enjoy ACTS OF VIOLET, as Abby picks petals asking herself if he killed him; he killed him not.
