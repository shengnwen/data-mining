A beautifully illustrated book with great instructions, but I found most projects were created with no budget in mind.  When I think handcrafted I think of saving money on the project, I didn't think that was the case with this book.  Great traditional ideas and instructions for decorating from cakes to veils but not with a small budget in mind.  Well worth buying if you are looking for the personal touch of doing it yourself without being on much of a budget
