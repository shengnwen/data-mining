I ORDERED THE WRONG BOOK. I THOUGHT THIS WAS A REGULAR BOOK TO READ - BUT IT'S A GUITAR MUSIC BOOK. IF YOU PLAY GUITAR - THIS IS THE PERFECT BOOK FOR YOU!!! IT HAS ALL HIS SONGS FROM THAT ALBUM TITLE IN IT. I DON'T PLAY GUITAR. I SENT IT BACK. THAT'S ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE TO MENTION: THEY REFUNDED MY MONEY WITH NO PROBLEM AND NO WAITING. AMAZON'S THE BEST PLACE TO DO ANY KIND OF SHOPPING!!
