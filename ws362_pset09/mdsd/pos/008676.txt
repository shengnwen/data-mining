This book touches on so many wine-related topics that it could probably replace three or four books on your shelf. I like that it is designed in such a way that you can flip through any section and get the info you want without having to read the whole book.

I do think the book is a little "old school" as far as wine education goes and tends present information as rules as opposed to presenting the topic wine as fun. But if you want to learn about wine, the book is packed with info to help you sniff, swirl and sip like a pro.
