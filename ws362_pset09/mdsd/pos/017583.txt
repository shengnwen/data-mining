"Good to Great" by Jim Collins is a must read for any serious leader in the profit or not for profit sector.  This books shows how others transform their companies.  The ways we teach people to get ahead are in no way indicative of true leadership -- servant-leaders who put their company and people ahead of their personal goals.  Jim Collins' nails it with his research of good companies who have moved to become great companies.
