A funny surrealistic portrait of a man who's committed to a Lewis Carroll-esque journey through a insane asylum when he expresses his desire to quit drinking.  In his world-gone-mad satire where people who fail to  embrace the nihilistic escapism of the bottle are sent to the sanitarium  for treatment, Daumal blends his poetic wit with striking hallucinatory  imagery to create a novel which defies rational explanation.    Unfortunately, I lent this book to a close friend a long time ago, and have  since lost touch with him.  I was so pleased when I'd found this book at a  local public library (as you can see it's out of print) thinking I would  finally have a chance to reread it after all these years.  I got halfway  through it that day, but unfortunately when I returned to the library to  check it out (it seems you need proof of address to get a library card, I  had just relocated. . , anyway), well, their copy had been stolen.  Hmm.   Sad?  Well, It's a book that's definitely worth snatching up if you happen  to run across it (note, however:  stealing from public libraries is  shameful and wrong)
