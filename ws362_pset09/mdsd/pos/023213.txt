I've read so many opinions on redemption - I wonder if we really think unbiased about this topic prior to understanding it; because we need to. Redemption is something we strive for every day of our lives....and Stanley Tookie Williams was no exception - he was striving for redemption twofold - to redeem himself from the gangsta affiliation, which he achieved whilst in "the hole," and the striving towards redemption so long as we live and sin. He is truly redeemed now sitting at the right hand side of the Father; he completed his mission on earth; and that's what I focussed on when he was executed - murdered by the State of California - Tookie was set free!!

Two months after his execution, and I grieve for someone who could have set a lot of our chlldren and teens on the right path...it is great to see his son, Travon, continue the work of encouraging peace between gangs.....Barbara Becnel, Tookie's greatest supporter, mentor and advocate - all those who fought for clemency for Tookie - you are beautiful people, and this world needs you!! You can be sure Tookie is with you all.....

May God keep you in the palm of His Hands Tookie
