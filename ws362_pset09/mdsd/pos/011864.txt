Margaret Coel is one of the more talented mystery writers out there, but what really makes her stand out is her ability to write with sensitivity about life among the Arapaho.  She manages to avoid stereotypes both of  &quot;the drunken Indian&quot; and &quot;the noble Indian&quot;.  But she  is also excellent at her descriptions of setting, and gives you a feel for  Wyoming.  When she described the snowy wind-swept winter landscape of  Wyoming, I could see it all clearly in my mind and wanted to turn up the  thermostat.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, and that is the  only reason I wouldn't give this book five stars. But if you like reading  about Native Americans, you will love this book
