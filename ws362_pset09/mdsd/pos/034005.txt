I actually have the audio version of the book and found it to be both broad and in-depth. The author dispels many of the credit myths, and examines exactly how credit is established, rated, and how it can be used in both good and bad ways. He spends a lot of time reviewing the subject of "credit repair" explaining how scammers (especially on the internet)operate. He focuses on what you can do legally to improve your credit. I've read most books on credit and debt management and found this to be a welcome addition to my bookshelf.
