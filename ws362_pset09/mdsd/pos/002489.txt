the author reveals the work and task at hand involved in castle building ( and a small township nearby).... i loved following the progress of the construction from the chosen site... to the tools used... especially the fortificatons and defense structures... its as close as i can get to actually living in the ages of castles... a highly recommended read!!!!!...
