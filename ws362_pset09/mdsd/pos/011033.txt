An excellent book about my favourite all time drink!  That's how I would describe this well written, beautifully photographed and intricate journey through Scotland, describing its whiskies.

Working together, Jackson and Wright have put together a combined piece of verbal and photographic artwork.  The information provided is very educational, but enjoyable, with historic and technical information entwined with Jackson's fireside conversational style making this a pleasure to read.  I can't reproduce the photography but I can give you a sample of the style of writing from page 63:

"After I had breathed the air of early Christianity and Celtic myth, the journey back was slow.  It was not just the two hours' drive from Fionnphort to Tobermory, the main town of Mull, but also the otherworldliness of the landscape."

This book has been broken up with the chapters as follows: Overture; The Islands; The East; Coda; Directory of distilleries; Glossary, Index and Acknowledgements.  I liked the maps each section had that showed where distilleries were either operating, operating with visitor centre, mothballed or operating intermittently; or closed. This information would come in handy if you are planning on visiting the areas yourself.

`Scotland and its Whiskies' is the perfect gift for that special person who has everything (including you!).  It is an informative and enjoyable read; while pleasing the eye at the same time.
