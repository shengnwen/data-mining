I got this book shortly after coming out to myself ..................and it helped more than you could imagine. In that situatoin, hearing about the stories of other like you is the single best thing for you; It helped me overcome those feelings of being &quot;the only  one&quot; (along with the internet, which gets most of the credit... I also  acredit the internet for my still being alive; it is also how I found this  book.) It contains the touching and highly varied accounts of around 20  teenagers. Some get a happy ending, some end in tragedy, and many fall  somewhere in the middle. This should be read by everyone just coming out or  still coming to terms, as well as educators and anyone else that has to  deal with youth from Middle School to High School. Read it then pass it on  to someone else who needs it when you're older. I cannot thank Ann Heron or  Allison Books enough
