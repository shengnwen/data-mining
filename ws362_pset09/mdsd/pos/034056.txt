This is not a novel in the most strict of sense, but rather a collection of vignettes of various people and events within the same family loosely strung together. Because of this type of format, the book really does read more like a non-fiction than a fiction novel.

Either which way, the story is compelling in that the reader is shown a glimpse into a life otherwise unknown to western society. The harsh and unequal treatment of women is infuriating in itself, and to realize this continues now only intensifies the drama. This is a book that will make women appreciate where they are and what they have.

The only fault I found with the book (and thereby giving it 4 stars) was that the characters were not as cleanly fleshed out as I would have hoped. We are introduced to a variety of people, but we are not really intimate with any of them to the point where we truly understand their motives. Perhaps that might explain quite a bit. 

Overall a good book, and as most reviewers state: a very good book in conjuction with THE KITE RUNNER
