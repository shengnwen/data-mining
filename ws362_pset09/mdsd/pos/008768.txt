 Though this is a very nice book, I prefer the old version of Cassell's to this one. The Cassell's version had a lot more examples of use in the translated terms.The Cassell's version also seemed a little more "user-friendly" in terms of the layout of the book. I purchased this for my high school daughter and middle school son to use in their French classes. I also highly recommend the 501 verbs book for anyone studying French at those levels. (I made it through 3 years of college French with 501 verbs and the Cassell's books)
