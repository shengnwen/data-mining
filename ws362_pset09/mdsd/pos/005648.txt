Reading this book was a delight.  What got was that Buddy was nobody special at first - just another guy in the American collegiate system.  Nonetheless, he took a risk, went to England to train with and compete against the best, and it paid off with a marathon world record.
The glimpses into Buddy's mind are great, especially the narrative portion about the Olympic trials at Yonkers.  You can't read this book and not love Buddy Edelen
