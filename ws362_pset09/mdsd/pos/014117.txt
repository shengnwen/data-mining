Alas, Tarkington is probably doomed to become a literary footnote. And that's a very sad thing. His characters are memorable, and his writing is charming, witty, fun, and speaks directly to the heart. But his easy use of words like "darky" and the "n-word" almost guarantees that only the most committed readers ever hear of him and seek him out. And that's too bad. Because he's one of the Great American Writers. 

Seventeen is about William Baxter, a seventeen year old boy who is smitten with the lovely Lola, a girl from out of town who is spending the summer with a neighboring family. William his head over heels about this visionary beauty, with her pastel dresses, her omnipresent lap dog, and her saccharine baby talk. The book chronicles his misadventures as he attempts to woo her and one-up all of the other lads who have the same intentions. 

Naturally, William is self-conscious and impatient, as all seventeen-year-olds are. He is constantly worried that his mom, this younger sister, and the family's black workman are going to cramp his style. Briefly, the book is an engaging and hilarious tale of how William tries to put on his best face for Lola, while attempting to minimize the "damage" he thinks his family is doing to his style and reputation.

I believe Seventeen was first published in 1915. It's tempting to think of that time as simpler and more innocent. Perhaps in some ways it was. But reading it now, I was struck with how the concerns, turmoil and awkwardness of youth haven't really changed much over the last 90 years. I definitely found it taking me back to the cares and embarrassments of my own teen years. While Seventeen is not one of Tarkington's most relevant works, it is still the work of a master and certainly worth a read.
