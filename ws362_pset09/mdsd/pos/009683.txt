The Cousins' Wars has helped me to understand and appreciate my adopted country, the United States of America, more than any other book or teacher. Phillips's insights into religion, culture, politics and economics as causes of conflict are clear and incredibly revealing. His intertwining of the three great civil wars in terms of these and other factors is a tour de force. I would love to hope that a condensed version of this book would be required for High School History, and that the subject be taught in College courses on American and British History
