Alfred North Whitehead once said that philosophy consists of footnotes to Plato. I would argue that modern philosophy consists of footnotes to Descartes. He threw down the gauntlet with his method of doubt, and you have to become reasonably familiar with the major philosophical systems that were created in response. This book provides that much-needed survey. 

The failing of the book (if you would call it that) is that it does not really describe the Big Picture. For that you need a book that directly focuses on philosophical ideas rather than the philosophers who have them. Some books in that category that I recommend are 'Think' by Simon Blackburn, and 'An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis' by John Hospers. For a more challenging treatment I recommend 'Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview' by JP Moreland and 'Modern Philosophy' which is also by Roger Scruton
