This book is an amazingly comprehensive overview of all aspects of atomism.  I was quite surprised to see sections on Hindu and Arab atomism, information which I didn't even know had existed.  Historical analysis is  excellent, although Pullman seems to insert his own opinions inconsistently  and sometimes inappropriately, and tends to be (perhaps somewhat  unjustifiably) hostile to Christians and the later antiatomists.  However,  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a precise historical account.   Any information that cannot be found in the book itself is referenced in  the large Notes (bibliography, footnotes) section
