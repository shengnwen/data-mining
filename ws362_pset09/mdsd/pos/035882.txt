From an evolutionary standpoint, it is reasonable to ask why we are plagued with disease, both physical and "mental", and why we age.  It is not so hard to understand if the disease is due to viruses or bacteria, which evolve along with us in an evolutionary arms race.  For this reason, some scientists have postulated that many illnesses ranging from heart disease to schizophrenia are also due to living organisms, and certainly there is increasing evidence for the importance of this viewpoint.  Nesse and Williams provide other answers.  Some of these answers - changes in environment and habits, rare mutations - are straight forward, others are more subtle and interesting.  More than anything, there are inevitably tradeoffs. The gene which causes sickle cell anemia helps protect against malaria.  In a few instances, an evolutionary perspective provides immediate suggestions for changes in medical practice, in the care of newborns and in the treatment of fever.  More significantly, it has a role to play in the guidance of future research aimed at specific diseases. The book falls somewhere between a popular explication, and an original contribution, the contribution primarily being  that it organizes many separate findings, and sets them out in a more general framework, while posing a host of possible PhD research questions. Much of the background information in Why We Get Sick is of great interest, and I only wish there was more background on the immune system. The writing is competent, and almost always clear
