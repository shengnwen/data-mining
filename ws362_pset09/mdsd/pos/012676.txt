This is generally a great read.  However, I find the quantitative examples in Chapter 6 very confusing to follow.  In addition, as a financial analyst, I feel very insulted for being called &quot;bean counter&quot; numerous times in the book.  The author should be more aware of this demeaning attitude he carelessly imbedded in this otherwise great book
