How often does a teacher find a book that is written totally on the level of their students?  This is a little anthology of essays and poetry written by Native American students.  It gives such insight into what these young people feel and think.  The thoughts are contemporary but show us the heritage and its importance - but also the struggle it can cause.  These selections range from third grade through high school.  I consider it a must for teaching multi-cultural lit.  The thoughts can be compared to what the students feel - especially when it comes to heritage.  Some are sad - some defiant - some confident and joyful.  These will get students thinking and discussing.  A treasure
