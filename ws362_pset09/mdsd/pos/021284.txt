Here's the rub - the author throws so many terms, phrases, abbreviations, ideas and jargon at the reader that at times I found myself asking not what was going on but what the heck he meant.  Altered Carbon was one of my top sci-fi books of all time, just incredible.  Broken Angels was not quite as good but still a superb read.  I like the Kovacs series - very punkish, depressing although the science may be behind the times.  I fully expect the stuff he talks about (nanotech, smart matter, brain downloads, imbedded "stuff") to arrive in this century - some of the first inklings are already around.

Once again, Morgan excells at character.  When the book ends you can almost believe that he and Sylvie will walk through the door, arguing and then kissing. The whole idea of the "sleeve" was such a good plot device it can be recycled over and over. Still, the pace is challenging, as others have noted.  It seems to slide around rather than jump but that only increases the darkness and languidness of the mood.
