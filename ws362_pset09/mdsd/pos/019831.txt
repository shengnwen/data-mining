	This book is about a girl named Ruth. She returns to her home town after WWII expecting to find some of her family members. Instead she finds a guy named Saul who wants her to lead a group of 20 orphans to Palestine. She accepts and the adventure begins. By reading this book you learn about what children who were in the Holocaust had to go through and what is was like trying to make the journey to Palestine as illegal immigrants. Ruth goes through many adventures and finally learns to show her true feelings. 
	I liked this book because it taught me what really happened to Jews during WWII and how they escaped. I always learned that Hitler just killed Jews I didn't know how he did it or what the Jewish society went through.
