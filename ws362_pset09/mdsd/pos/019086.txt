This is a gorgeous cookbook with pictures that make you want to run into the kitchen and start chopping!  The author's annotations on how he has modified the traditional recipes to bring them more in line with modern  dietary guidelines are helpful in themselves and can be applied to other  recipes.  The first recipe I tried was wonderful (Red Snapper Veracruz),  can't wait for more.  All in all, a very thorough and healthy approach to  an exciting cuisine. Thanks Stephen
