This is a great book!  The review is substantial and there are 3 practice tests.  While I understand that many previous reviewers are not happy with REA removing 3 practice tests from the first edition (which had a total of 6), they also replaced them with review chapters.  The first edition was only a book of practice tests.  As someone who works in publishing, I can say that there aren't enough test-takers for this exam to make a book of this kind too profitable, and I'm simply amazed that REA is willing to put such a high page count on this book to bring us all of this material.  Great job!  I have sat for the actual test once already and I think the questions are exactly the types that are asked.  The review chapters won't be enough to review, but no one book ever will be.  You will have to pull out all of your Norton Anthologies and read for months.  And I seriously recommend a course in literary theory to anyone who is still enrolled in school.  There's no way around it.  This test is getting harder.  Just try one practice test before reviewing all that much and you will see what I'm talking about
