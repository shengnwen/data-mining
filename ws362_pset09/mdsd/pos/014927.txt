Thank You, Francis Yockey, for the antidote to a lifetime of vicious lies and deadly propaganda -- which I was fortunate to survive. 
You wrote this book in the year of my birth -- 1948 -- but it took me 56 years to find my way to it. If only your murderers had not hidden it from me -- so much wasted time and pointless misery could have been avoided. Had I been allowed to read your book instead of the boring, meaningless, obscenely stupid rubbish I was force fed in school, the world of Action might have come alive for me sooner. 
The wasteland of the dead lies around me, but the fire rekindled by your lightning bolt burns ferociously within me.
I salute you, your genius, your courage. As long as i live, your passion will live through me. You have not lived, died, or written in vain. Your cries of anguish have been heard; your sword has been lifted from the dust and is held aloft by many, myself among them. If I could look into your eyes, place my hand upon your shoulder, I would tell you stories of horror and valor -- tales of tears, of love and lusty women, of battles fought and won...and we would eat and drink and laugh until the dawn.
The door of my home is open, a place is forever set at my table for you and your friends. Welcome
