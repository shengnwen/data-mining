This book now completes my reading all of his novels. I cannot remember the last time a book touched me so. Only someone that experienced the horrors of war could tell this story of fiction. Over the years we have seen what Vietnam did to the minds of some of our finest. No one could survive that war without some mental duress. We are all approaching our elder years now but every man that served in the crevasses of his mind knows what the Author has said in this novel. God bless them all
