When I found out about this title, I was hoping for something big, meaty, and profusely illustrated. What I received was a small pocket-sized booklet. However, there is enough "meat" in this small book to make up for its compact size. Frayling expertly cuts out the fluff and provides what is in essence an extended essay on the making of this classic, underrated film. While my greatest complaint is the number and size of the photographs, this is again nothing more than a criticism of the format, not the content. I need to disagree with the author, Frayling, who in his text deemphasizes his own effort by acknowledging Leon Stover's A PROPHETIC SOUL as THE ultimate account of the film. While Stover's book is indeed a thorough examination of Wells and the philosophy and politics behind THINGS TO COME, Frayling's book is an excellent "making of" book and in fact compliments Stover's oft times overly cerebral volume. I gave this book a rating of four simply because of the format. The content is worthy of a five
