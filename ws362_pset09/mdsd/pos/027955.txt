Writing is very lyrical, with excellent use of imagery.  Ninety percent of the metaphors work.  However, some of the metaphors do not make comlete sense in context and are mixed (See LRB article by Nicholas Spice).  
Although some reviewers dislike the books non-linear storytelling and structure, I thought it worked well.  Each of the scenes feeds into the next and allows reader to get a better understanding of character, events, or themes.  The book is not entirely historically accurate and is more similar to taking a trip inside a very imaginative and talented person's stories based on history. The use of imagery and the creative, if not entirely accurate, use of historical events or people as "snapshots" that evoke feelings or ideas is a theme that occurs extensively throughout Ondaatje's poetry (ex: "Elizabeth"), so it is not surprising to find it in his novel.  
Another weakness with the novel was that the characters and events often functioned more to explore themes, which made the character behave in ways that would not be truly realistic.  The English patient, Katherine, and Hana and lost some depth becuase of this.  Kip is probably the most multidimensional character in the book.  The movie, especially Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas, did a far better job of bringing the other characters to life.
You would probably enjoy this book if any of the following are true: you like the poetry of Wallace Stevens, you like and prefer historical fiction that is romantic or has strong story telling elements over historical fiction that is 100% true to its time (think Tale of Two Cities, Love in the Time of Cholera, Gone with the Wind, etc.), or you are not a historical event nitpicker.   A novel does not always have to be historically 100% accurate (hence the term FICTION), but is often an exploration of emotions, themes, or ideas.  I enjoyed the novel, even though it was not "perfect.
