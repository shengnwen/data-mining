this book is one of my favorite books written by Thich Nhat Hanh.
Not only does "Being Peace" offers you peace and joy while you are reading it but open your horizon.  The pictures drawn by Mayumi Oda is breathtaking, but the best part of this book is Thich Nhat Hanh's wisdom of how to live life fully in the present moment, working for peace, the heart of practice, and of interbeing. This book will definitely make you smile and I 100% recommend this book to everyone :-
