This book has everything....Love, Greed, Murder.  What more can you ask for?  This book was one of the first romance novels I ever read, and I still have my original copy, that belonged to my mother.  I love to read it over and over again.  Luke and Roxy are two of my favorite characters.  Usually, the background characters tend to fade, but those in this book, Max, Mouse, Lily, and even Mike the dog are all memorable.
