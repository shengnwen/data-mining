A beautiful but sad look at abandoned and forgotten scenes in America.  The lighting and the timing of the photographs makes this a very unique and delightful book.  Clearly a lot of thought went into capturing these images.  It's a sad commentary, in some ways, of human nature.  When we tire of something, we just toss it by the wayside in favor of something new.
