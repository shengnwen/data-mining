Forrest Church, a Unitarian minister and historian, has pulled together a nice sampling of letters, documents, and legal briefs from the early days of the United States of America (both pre- and post-Constitution) that lays out how most of our founding generations felt about the separation of church and state--they were very much opposed to religion mixing with government and politics. Mr. Church has presented the material in chronological order, and he introduces each piece to highlight its contextual setting and importance. These are more than just the familiar quotes, these pieces in their whole so that the complete context of what is said is there for the examination.

Included are number chapters on some the most recognizable figures important in the separation of church and state debate, including Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, John Adams, Patrick Henry and James Madison; but, what makes this book more useful are the lesser known public and religious leaders included: Isaac Backus, Caleb Wallace, and George Mason among others.

The separation of church and state was a hot topic open for much debate in our founding days. Most of the original colonies prior to and into the Revolution, had laws on the books that sanctioned a state religion, usually the Anglican Church, and collected taxes that paid the clergy. As King George's yoke was being thrown off during the Revolution, our fledgling country debated itself on the meaning of freedom and liberty, and religious freedom was of utmost importance for our founders.

What makes this book important is that instead of being a thick volume of every conceivable reference to our freedom of and from religion that only an historian would glance at, this book is of the perfect size and length that a layperson can read it and learn for his or herself how important it is that we keep government out of religion and more importantly that we keep religion out of government
