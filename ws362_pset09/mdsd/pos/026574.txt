As a well-assimilated Latina, I grew up hearing about Jose Marti as the father of Cuban independence, a poet, a revolutionary, a hero in battle, and yet not really understanding his place in the larger history of Latin American and this hemisphere.  While I knew about his political life and some of his works, until reading this book, I truly did not know the level of impact Marti had on race, gender, bicultural and other social issues. This book pulled me in quickly.  Montero makes Marti's 20th century ideas and writings on complex issues easily accessible and relevant to the 21st century mind.  While this book will certainly encourage interesting dialogue among academics and long-time students of Marti and of Latino literary/political figures and history, its value for me has been to share in Montero's connection and understanding of Marti, and thus awaken and reintroduce me to his life, ideas and works.  Highly recommend it
