This book is one of the most entertaining of all the Elvis books. It is huge with 700-plus pages, but I found myself drawn to it continually. Sometimes I read only 5 pages, sometimes 100 pages at a time but was mesmerized by the easy conversational style and casual truths revealed by three of Elvis' closest and oldest friends. Its as if you were sitting and talking to Lamar, Marty or Billy around the coffee table. The anecdotes ring true because the reader realizes no one could ever have invented some of the ridiculous situations Elvis and "The Memphis Mafia" got themselves into!  When all the little stories are knitted together they reveal a lifestyle riddled with drugs, sex, firearms, and every other excess you could ever imagine. After reading this eyewitness account, it becomes impossible for the reader to ever buy the "whitewash job" that Elvis was not heavily, chronically and seriously addicted to drugs throughout his ENTIRE singing carreer and that he had debilitating psychological problems.  

Lamar Fike, Billy Smith, and Marty Lacker are the heroes in this book. Their patience, love, and loyalty were truly what kept Elvis alive for 42 years.
