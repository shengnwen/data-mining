I've rated this five stars only because you cannot list six.  This is the one and only account of the Flood that you need to read.  

Even though it is now old enough to be a classic, it is as timely as today's newspaper.  The hubris of the robber barons contrasted with the human anguish is nowhere more poignantly told than in McCullough's meticulously researched account.  (And yes, he is related to people connected with the story, as am I).

If you want the story to come alive, then focus on the people...Especially Cyrus Elder, the Cambria Iron executive who was the only Club member whose immediate family members perished in the Flood.  Representing both sides of the story, Cyrus is the center around which the disaster unfolds.  

Yes, it helps if you know the terrain--go out of your way, if you can, to see the National Flood Memorial and you will be awestruck by the sweep of the broken dam's size.  Far off in the distance, across the long-dry lake bed, you will see the rooftops of the little Pennsylvania town of St Michaels, which grew up around the abandoned cottages of the illustrious members of the defunct Club.  Many of the cottages are still there!  Better yet, you can wander through the original Clubhouse--some of the wallpaper probably dates back to 1889, even now.  

In the main NFM building, be sure to look at the telegraph handset, the one by which the ignored warning from South Fork was sent down the wire to Johnstown and then relayed on to Robert Pitcairn in Pittsburgh.  

McCullough tells it best.  Read the book; then go see for yourself.
