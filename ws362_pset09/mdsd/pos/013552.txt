After having unsuccessfully searched for the perfect C tutorials and also K&R C, I can confidently report that this is by far the best introductory text to the C language.  You can think of it as K&R in a truly tutorial mode.  Very complete coverage of language features and just the right amount of instructional aid without being too terse on the one hand (K&R) and without being to plodding and wordy on the other (Deitel and others).  You should find it as a thorough yet relatively quick read.  Kochan has a very nice writing style which makes the tutorial also very enjoyable and rewarding.  The example programs are short and sweet; very similar to the kinds of programs found in K&R.  There are also lots of appropriately challenging programming exercises at the end of each chapter and half the answers are available on the author's website (www.kochan-wood.com).  Another good feature is that the tutorial is arranged by subject matter so you can use it also as a user-friendly reference in addition to K&R
