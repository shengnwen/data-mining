While some of the acting in the film was quite ordinary, this fact-based film biography of Audie Murphy, the most highly-decorated soldier in US history, and portrayed by himself, is essential to the serious war film collector.  Murphy insisted that the scenarios presented in the film were factual, while some were, of course, dramatically enhanced for Hollywood consumption.  It is a fast-moving story and definitely enjoyable.
