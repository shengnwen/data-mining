Do you want to earn money, but don't know how? If so, Beyond the Lemonade Stand is the perfect book for you. This short book is by Bill Rancic, winner of The Apprentice TV show. The book is full of useful tips for "saleskids" such as: what is investing and how do you do it. There are stories about how Bill and other children made money. My favorite chapter was managing your money, because I learned new ways to save my money. One reason that I adored this book was because there are sections you can fill-in. The whole last chapter you can write down your appointments and clients.

This book won't interest everyone, only kids who like non-fiction and enjoy making money (which I love to do). I think this book is a little expensive at $15 (including shipping). I would pay about $10 total for it. However, I really don't mind the price because 100% of the profit goes to children's charities. I treasure this book and recommend it to all "saleskids".
