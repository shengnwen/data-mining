This is an excellent book for both the new guy and the veteran. At almost 500 pages, this is a very practical book that covers every aspect of truck driving and life on the road. In addition to basic operations, there is also plenty of detailed mechanical info on the inner workings of a truck. That will probably be of more interest to owner-operators than company drivers but it's good to know it's there in case you ever need it.  My only complaint is that this book wasn't around when I started out. It definitely would've made for a much smoother transition into the 'industry'. Highly reccomended.
