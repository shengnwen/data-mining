This book I found shortly before undergoing an operation and during a year of suffering many severe health difficulties. I was so struck by the way the author relates his wife's tragic accident, his feelings for his wife and I suppose was most involved with the testimonial he makes concerning his involvement in the circumstances leading to her accident. I wish my husband would read this memoir, it is so tender. I think the author is searingly honest in his account of these years. The text is healing, we learn from tragedy. It causes me to relate to how I am finding my previous life struggles to be reordered against the background of the loss of health. He yearns to live back in the ordinary that was his life before his wife was so hurt, to have known it for the gift it was. This book is a quiet call to the living. I hope it will be read and appreciated for the beautiful book it is
