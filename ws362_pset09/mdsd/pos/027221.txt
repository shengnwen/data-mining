I donated my collection of 7,000 newspapers to Nick Baker's American Newspaper Repository. I have watched him carry loads of newspapers into a rented space in an old New Hampshire mill. I have looked at old copies of the New York Times with him. What Nick Baker is doing for our heritage cannot be overstated. He is the only person on earth who was thinking about the collateral damage of cultural evaporation parlayed from the destruction of old books and newspapers. "Double Fold" is brilliant, detailed and gripping. Nick Baker justly deserved the National Book Critics Circle award for General Non-Fiction. Is there any logical reason for the existence of only one copy of the New York World from the early 1900s after ONE MILLION copies a day were printed ?  Snobbish librarians must admit their mistakes. They were sold a technological bill of goods and they fell for it. The books and newspapers are not crumbling. Nick showed me a 101-year-old New York World with stories about the McKinley assassination. One story line was "Advances in Surgery since Garfield was shot" It was as clear and readable as the day it was printed..
