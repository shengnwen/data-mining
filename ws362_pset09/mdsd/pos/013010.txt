I read Mr. Hogan's book on hypnosis.  Since I liked the first book, it was not difficult for me to try reading this one. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this book is a pure gem. One can learn about people personalities, the laws of behavior and many other psychology tricks.  Learn when someone is trying ot negotiate with you vs. when you are being manipulated.  It will help any person in any aspect of their life -- both personally and profesionally
