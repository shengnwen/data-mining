In short, I highly recommend this book to anyone who espouses reason over vitriolic spew. If you love America, but are troubled by the current state of affairs, this book may provide you with some level of inspiration.

I purposefully chose the audio version of this book because I have heard Reich speak and his quirky delivery is affecting.
