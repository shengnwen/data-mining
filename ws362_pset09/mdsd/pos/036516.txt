I loved this book!  I knew the Romans liked a good drink but had no idea they were quite so curious and intellectually voracious -- they traveled around to all the great sights of the Empire (the Seven Wonders tour) and managed to invent on the way guidebooks, souvenirs and shoddy hotels!  The author does a great job of bringing history to life by making connections to the present -- and with a great sense of humor.  My favorite chapter was in Arcadia (Greece), which I've been to -- Perrottet (sp?) runs into a mad monk in the middle of a thunderstorm, and ends up deep in a philosophical discussion on the meaning of travel, ancient and modern.  It really is a great way to learn about things that every educated person should already know... (Petronius, Seneca and all the gang -- I vaguely knew who they were, but now they're like old drinking pals!
