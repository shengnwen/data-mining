This is one of my favorite Kundera novels (I've read them all), though it is certainly a bit of an oddball.  As other reviewers have noted, it sticks to the story, without commentary from the author.  There are also some structural differences, such as the number of chapters (see The Art of the Novel) and such.  My only complaint is with this new translation.  Perhaps it's just because I first read The Farewell Party, but there were some subtle changes that I just didn't understand.  The spelling of one character's name was changed (possibly due to difference in English pronounciation, with the intent of preserving the original sound) and another peripheral character's name was changed altogether.  There were others as well.  Given Kundera's complaints about overzealous translators in Testaments Betrayed, I suspect he might not have approved.  Still, I can't imagine anyone preferring Slowness to this
