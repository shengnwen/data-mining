This is one of the many PKD novels where women are descirbed as cold and  frigid people. Even though, i still concidered this as a  &quot;romance&quot; story, one where a man loses his mind (phrenia and  hallucinations) over a dark hair girl called Pris (different Pris from  DADoES novel). Oh, yes, there are the Lincoln and Stanton simulcaras, but  they're just a mere sub-plot to the story..
