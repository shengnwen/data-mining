There are a lot of books about King Kong out there at the moment, but what made me choose Mr. Morton's book is the large section he devotes to the 1976 King Kong produced by Dino De Laurentiis. This was the pre-Star Wars movie sensation of my childhood and I loved reading the behind the scenes story of its making, as well as getting another peek at some Kong '76 merchandise (hey, I had those cups!). The author also appears to share my opinion that this film gets an unfair bad rap. Nice to see him set the record straight re reviews and box office.

Above Kong '76, it just great to have a book devoted to ALL the King Kong films. Sure, we all love the original film and Mr. Morton does a spectacular job covering it, but I equally enjoyed reading about Son of Kong, King Kong vs. Godzilla, King Kong Lives, etc. And a full chapter devoted Kong collectibles and the Kong movies that were never made...you gotta love that.

If you're a Kong lover, or just want one good Kong movie book on your shelf, Ray Morton's KING KONG, THE HISTORY OF A MOVIE ICON is the book to get
