This is a great book.It was written for those of us who want to travel to India and learn more yoga, meditation etc.Not all places are described in equal length and depth but you will always find useful information about  yoga schools, ashrams and monasteries in all the parts of India.In a lot of  cases, the writers have been there and they took the classes for you, sat  through the satsangs and tried the food and water.The book talks about each  place separately and gives you info on &quot;Teachers &amp;  Teachings&quot;, &quot;Facilities and Food&quot;,  &quot;Schedule&quot;,&quot;Fees&quot;,&quot;Contact  Information&quot;,&quot;How To Get There&quot;,etc.A very helpful guide for  spiritual seekers who intend to travel to India
