This book is defenitly a classic.  It probably could have been of longer.  If it was at least the length of franenstein I am sure I would have given it 5 stars.  The book does a great job of exploring man's dual nature.  It is good for a quick read on a rainy day.  Anyone who wants to say they've read the classics should read this book.  Of course that is just my opnion, I could be wrong
