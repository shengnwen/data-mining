My mom handed me this book when i was leaving on a plane for london. I needed something to do so i decided to read it just so i had something to do on the nine hour flight. What surprised me was that this book was actually engaging and interesting! The main character, Kinsey Millhone is frequently put into interesting and sometimes life threatening situations. Combine that with an interesting plot and a surprise ending and you got yourself quite a good thriller/mystery.  Sue Grafton goes to great length to express the detail of Kinsey Millhone's every movement, which i enjoyed. Every move she made, be it getting out of a car or dodging a bullet, was written in great detail that kept me on the edge of my seat. Sue Grafton is also quite skilled at creating a very diverse set of characters for each novel. Its good to have diversity in mystery novels because each character is thuroghly analyzed. I dont know if i would plan on reading all of Sue Grafton's novels, because i could see myself getting quite bored very quickly of the style. But if you have a few hours to kill i definitely suggest this book
