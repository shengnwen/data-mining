I'm not an engineer, but I've got a lot of telecom experience.  The second edition of "SIP: Understanding the Session Initiation Protocol," delivers on the title.  Engineers and programmers can look to the text as a good starting point, but will want to go the IETF for more serious stuff.  Still, the text provides sample SIP messages and deconstructs SIP message flows.  The non-technical reader can still understand the protocol and its uses, and make more informed business decisions (strategy, marketing, product management, finance or M&A).  I evaluated all the other titles available from Amazon.com before purchasing and reading this one, and I am convinced this was the best selection available
