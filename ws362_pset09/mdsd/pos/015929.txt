Mary Gaitskill's Bad Behavior is all about the darker side of human nature...sadomasochism, prostitution and unhealthy sexual and emotional relationships. Every story in this book is written frankly and there is no sugercoating of the subject matter. Each story is shocking and provocative and left me thinking seriously about what the characters were going through, even though I found myself unable to relate to their problems.

The one qualm I have with this book is that most of the stories seemed incomplete and when they ended, I felt as though the issues had not really been resolved. Perhaps Gaitskill did this intentionally in order to show that some situations can never truly be taken care of. If you like happy endings, this is not the right kind of literature for you.

If you want some interesting material that could make for a good character study, read this book. I will say, however, that this is certainly not for everyone. If you have a problem with reading or hearing about S&M, you will probably want to avoid this, due to the fact that almost every story has some elements of sadomasochism. I recommend this book, but with a "caution" attached
