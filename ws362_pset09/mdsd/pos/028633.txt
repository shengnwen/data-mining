I actually bought this book as a gift to a freind who was in the a similar situation but she was the one with cancer. I got a library copy to read before I gave it to her and cried so hard (I had lost my husband to cancer a year before) that I could not give the gift as I was afraid that I would make her situation worse.

I have the book in my collection and will get through it in my own time. It really is a book of love and should be taken that way. I recommend it
