This is one of those novels that I want to read again right after I finish the last page.  The plot is interesting, the setting is beautiful, and the characters are lovable.  I found myself unexpectedly absorbed into the story despite the fact that I usually prefer novels set in modern time.  My only complaint is that some word choices in conversations sound too modern, not that I know what 15th century Italian sounds like.  Some words just seem so out of place once in a while
