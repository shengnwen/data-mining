In 'A Gladiator Only Dies Once', Steven Saylor collects nine Gordianus the Finder tales he has written over the years. These stories are nice straightforward detective investigations with Gordianus as the upstanding honest gumshoe (gum-sandal?). His clients tend to be drawn from the patrician class of late Republican Rome - the supposed cream of society, but some of this cream has definitely spoiled.

Saylor is scrupulously accurate with historical details as he takes the reader to Sicily where he encounters Cicero and the secret of Archimedes' Tomb or to the luxuriant gardens and cherry orchards of the epicurean Lucullus. These are just two of the many historical characters in Saylor's stories. The resolution to Saylor's puzzles often lies not so much in the 'who did it', which is sometimes fairly obvious, as in 'why did they do it', generally a more interesting inquiry.

An appendix explains the provenance of each story and its connection to Roman history. A timeline of Gordianus' life will be a handy reference for fans of the Roma Sub Rosa series.

Highly recommended.
