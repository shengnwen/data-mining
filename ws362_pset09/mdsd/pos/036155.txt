Regardless of whether you are a diehard Marlovian or not, Burgess' novel is a well crafted, loving treatise to the loftiness and the bawdiness of Elizabethan English. The story of Kit Marlowe, the Jim Morrison of his  time, is richly imagined using the scant but intriguing information left to  us. I recommend this book highly
