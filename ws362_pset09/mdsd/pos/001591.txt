I am a firm believer that anyone involved in the politics of sex work (pro or con) would benefit from reading this book.  The writing in this collection puts a human face and name to what often gets boiled down to semantics and political warfare.  These stories and essays are all well written, personal and provide the reader with an easy familiarity and way to feel some empathy where, that might not have existed before.  In a society where sex as commerce pervades almost every corner of our lives, it's easy to simply sit back and judge without any understanding of the people involved.  In sum this is a fantastic book my hat off to editor Jill Nagle
