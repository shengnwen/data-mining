The title of this book refers to the members of the Dominican order, who were called the "Hounds of God" for their determined efort to stamp out what they considered to be heresy and other ills facing the Catholic Church in Spain and elsewhere. This book takes many diverse paths: the beginning of the inquisition in Spain, the uniting of Spain under one Spanish kingdom, the expulsion of the Jews and the Moors, and the efforts of Christopher Columbus to receive backing for his attempt to sail West across the Atlantic. To his credit, the author handles all of these things quite well. We receive thumbnail biographies of the most important "players" of the time, and we follow each thread until there emerges one pattern that combines all of them. It's extremely well-written, and is never dull. It's a good primer for a tumultous period in Spanish (and Church) history, and I highly recommend it! (Sorry about the silly review title, but I'm an avid Monthy Python fan.)
