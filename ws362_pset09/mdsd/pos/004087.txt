Wayne Dyer has once more produced an excellant program on creating your own reality. This time he addresses perseptions that limit your access to success. How you think about what you want to achieve results in what you achieve. It addresses dealing with obsticles and forming the relationships you have with those around you. It explains concepts in plain straight talk that you can relate too. Its an enjoyable and powerful program and I recommend you buy a copy to ad to your collection. It was and is a good investment
