This high standard detective story about an English sleuth searching for his lost parents in Shanghai in the early 20th century turns into an international political thriller. His father works for an opium trader; his uncle is a double agent entangled in the communist resistance; he himself had a Japanese schoolfriend who fights now in the Japanese army.

The detective's adage is 'combat evil', combat 'those busy conspiring to put civilization to the torch'. But, 'the evil ones are much too cunning for ordinary decent citizens.'
He is confronted with dirty Western politics: 'their refusal to acknowledge their drastic culpability.'
The naive thought that they 'could shame these companies into giving up their opium profits. We thought we were dealing with fellow-Christians.' But the West 'wanted the Chinese to be useless. They liked them to be in chaos, drug-addicted, unable to govern themselves properly. That way, the country could be run virtually like a colony.'

The story is written in the author's characteristic cool, clever, indirect suggestive style. But he looses his temperament in the endgame, where he hovers on the edge of an improbable melodrama.

A very worthwhile read
