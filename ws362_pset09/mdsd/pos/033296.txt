This is my favorite book about winter camping. The author has thought through the entire process of winter outings. Travel by snowshoe, ski, or mountaineering gear. Tenting. Sleeping. Cooking. Picking an area to visit.  Getting there and back alive. Also, Steve Gorman recognizes the value in a  wide range of styles, from the modern alloy snowshoes, Mountain tents,  synthetics, and Gore-tex to the traditional modes of wood stove and saw,  canvas tent, ash and babiche snowshoes. He makes snow camping sound fun,  the difficulties manageable. Right up there with Rustrum's &quot;Paradise  Below Zero&quot;, Harry Roberts' &quot;Moving On&quot;,  and Glenn  Randall's &quot;Cold Comfort&quot;
