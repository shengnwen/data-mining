I think that this book is a great source of information for teenagers. It provides great advice for teenagers feeling lost or confused. I think that every parent should have a copy of this book to give to their growing up  child. I especially liked the foreward by Bettie B. Youngs.She sure is  educated. The diet and exercise portion is exactly what teens need because  they worry about their appearence so much.It tells about potion size which  is the most important. My daughter loves this book
