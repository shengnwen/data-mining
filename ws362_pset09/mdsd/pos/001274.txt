I went out & bought this book after seeing the film version of R&GAD. I liked the movie so much that I had to have the print version of the script to compare with. It's instructive to see how Mr Stoppard took his play to the big screen and to see what he added  (AFAIK, he took *nothing* away (as what happens in too many films adapted from another source))
I do have to say that this book makes a most *excellent* companion to the film for reference.
I have read this book many more times than I have seen the film and it's enjoyable from the first page to the last.
Fans of The Bard's work will certainly appreciate this as I call R&GAD, "The Post-It Note of Hamlet"
