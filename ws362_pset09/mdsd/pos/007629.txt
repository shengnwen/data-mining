This encyclopedia is a leading resource written by leading philosophers and scholars.  It is indispensible for researchers and students who need to refer to a philosophical topic or a great thinker and their thought.  It is also good for the casual reader who may be interested in philosophy and wishes to learn more about the subject.

The encyclopedia is very comprehensive and covers all the main areas of philosophy as well as both Eastern and Western philosophy.  Jewish and Islamic and African Philosophies are also well represented.  There are many biographies of leading philosophers, as well as scientists, theologians, lawyers, writers and politicians who have covered philosophical questions.  

The price puts this resource beyond the means of most individual buyers, but all good libraries should stock it.
