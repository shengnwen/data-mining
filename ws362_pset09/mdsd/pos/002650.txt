In Aegypt, John Crowley creates not one, but two solid, fleshly worlds: a late seventies small town, complex enough to hold both the foolishness of failed coke dealer, scholar and desperate monogamist Pierce Moffett, and  the ordinary heroic strength of newly single mother and artist Rosie  Rasmussen; and the world of John Dee, court magician to Queen Elizabeth.   Crowley's virtousic realism renders Dee's conversations with the angels and  alchemical searching as sturdy and believable as Rose and Pierce's grocery  shopping, angst, and romantic turnarounds.       Both worlds can be  balanced in the same book because both worlds are there to tell the same  story.  What is that story?  What did the angels tell to John Dee?  Who can  catch a falling star?    For all its realism, this is a book about occult  knowledge.  This book is an initiation.  John Crowley is attempting a  direct transmission of gnosis through literature.  Does he succeed
