In late winter I had the chance to hear author Ellen Cooney read excerpts from her latest book, A Private Hotel for Gentle Ladies.I was instantly transported into the world of Charlotte Heath and turn of the century Boston. To me, a good novel does just that, takes me away from the day to day humdrum, into another place.

Heroine Charlotte left her philandering husband, after she recovered from a year long illness. She checked into a "reverse brothel", where the women guests get more than a mint on the pillow with the bedtime turn down service.

I could natter on, but a few important things. Ms. Cooney's reading was fabulous. She breathed life into her quirky and beautifully drawn characters. I loved the way she shared the characters' thoughts, giving me an inside view and insight into their beings. Her question and answers after the reading conveyed a down home demeanor and also an unbelievable brilliance. Her personna is like her characters-witty, smart, reflective, self knowing, gracious. She is a natural and gifted teacher. Don't miss Ellen Cooney the next time she comes to a local book store to read.

I liked that Ms. Cooney's latest work left me pondering.  I am not sure her aim was social commentary, but more to tell a good story. I identified with Charlotte. Who hasn't, after being betrayed, tried to come to terms with and try to understand what led up to a relationship ending? But also, I wonder, how different are the women of the 21st century from Charlotte? Some 30 years after the women's movement, are women more free or more bound and limited by the expectations of others? At any rate, do read A Private Hotel for Gentle Ladies, Ellen Cooney's best so far.
