After getting a slow start with Mixed Signals, it absolutely caught on fire for me!  Belle O'Brien, disc jockey extraordinaire moves to small-town Virginia to help a former boss (with whom she had a crush on) with his new oldies radio station.  It seems like everyone in town is sending out  signals to someone else, and they are not always transmitting the correct  messages.  Mistaken love affairs, small fibs and secret pasts line this  tale of inspirational romance, and readers shouldn't be surprised if they  laugh out loud more than once or twice.  The characters are all realistic  and loveable (I wouldn't mind being a guest in Norah's kitchen myself), and  I definitely will recommend this novel to my reading group
