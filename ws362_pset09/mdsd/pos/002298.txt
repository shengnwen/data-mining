Ian McDonald is both a classical and a pop critic so he is uniquely qualified to make a serious appraisal of the greatest act in the history of recorded music.  The book is very enthusiastic about the Beatles and is full from start to finish with surprising musical insights that only a classicist  could come up with.  But this book is not only about music.  The 35 page introduction analyzes the cultural and even philosphical meaning of the Beatles.  I have read many Beatle books, but this book comes closer than any other to showing what the Beatles mean.  The fact that the book is both the best musicological and cultural analysis of the Beatles is amazing.  I have only 2 criticisms.  First, McDonald reviews all of the Beatles' own songs,186 titles, together with all of their cover tunes.  This means that some of the individual treatments are sometimes thin, and, of course, some of my favorites are not treated with the respect I think they deserve.  Second, both the cultural and musical jargon tend to be dense and technical.  This could put off casual fans and the larger part of the world who has not heard of Satre, Foucault, Derrida or Deconstructionism.  But let's not quibble.  This book is must reading for serious music fans, culture hounds and anyone who wants to understand Western Culture after it was swept up in Beatlemania
