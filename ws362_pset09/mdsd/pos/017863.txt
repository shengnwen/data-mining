Have you ever had a person be nice to you for a reason, and then they end up being your best friend? Was that person a dragon? If not then you check out the book Dragon's Bait, written by Vivian Vande Velde. To read this book you will find out what it is like to lose everything, then get the greatest thing, friendship. What you least expect will happen when you read this Fantasy book, and will make you take a look at your own life.

Have you ever accused someone of being a witch? This is what happens when a town turns on a young girl named Alys. This is a great book, for it goes into great detail, and has a great storyline. This is a book for those of us that love Dragons and their myths. Dragon's Bait is a good book with detail of dragons and how they are emotionally.

A great storyline, this is what every book need. This is one of those books, and one that will make you think. A deep and interesting plot puts you into the action and the thoughts of the characters. Being in the Fantasy world makes this book even more interesting. What other book have you a dragon, a "witch", a crooked priest, and evil towns people, and with a story that also tells a great lesson that you could use in your life.
