Why does it seems that in all mysteries, the witnesses, bystanders, etc. practically seem unaffected by the horror of the murder? This is so common that I still give this one 5-stars since, this complaint aside, this is about about good as a comtemparary mystery can get!! We start out here where a 12 year old boy, with cancer, discovers a body in revolutionary war costume, in the woods near a shack, and meets up with our heroine, cemetary and tombstone investigator Sweeney St. George.The resulting mystery is a real puzzler, and interesting Revolutionary War, Concord battle Re-enactors, and Minuteman lore are wonderfully drawn into the story. Having checked out these sites along with the tombstones, I found this sideline as interesting as as the plot! And the solution here was truly fine, not a stretch at all, in fact the most likely motive and circumstance as well, one I did not know till the explanation at the end. So this is a really good mystery, despite my gripe as noted at the beginning of this review
