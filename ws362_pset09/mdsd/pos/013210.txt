Other reviewers have commented or complained that if you know Saudi history, this book is old hat.  Well, I don't know Saudi history, and this book details some almost unbelievable things.  When I heard (Unabridged Audio CD) hours of descriptions of questionable human rights, monetary excesses and possible trickery in foreign policy since 1932, I somehow got the feeling that things were different now.  So I was surprised to hear that apparently nothing had changed in 2002 when the Crown Prince visited Crawford, Texas.

I heard the author discuss this book on CSPAN and got the feeling that he was careful to state things in an unbiased manner.  I have no way of knowing if, or how much, this book may be biased. But even if there is "an other hand", it would be hard to find an ofsetting justification for some of the duplicity, excesses and abuses described.

It is true that this book is basically a history of the Saudi Kingdom.  However, its central focus appears to be a plan to protect their oil from takeover by other entities.  The author leaves us to make up our own minds: Is the plan too far fetched to be believed, or is it so far fetched that we must believe it?

Also, the reader of this audio book is really good at pronouncing names
