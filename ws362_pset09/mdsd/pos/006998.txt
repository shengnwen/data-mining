We ordered this book for my grandma when she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  I spent hours on the phone with her explaining what diabetes is, that it's not her fault (she takes amazing care of herself!) and that its okay to be upset.  When this book arrived, I got a call the next day from her--she'd stayed up most of the night reading--and never again got an emotional call about the subject.  She found it answered all her questions, was interesting to read, and also helped her feel "normal" whether it was carb counting or feeling shock over her diagnosis.  I highly recommend you buy this for yourself, family, or friends
