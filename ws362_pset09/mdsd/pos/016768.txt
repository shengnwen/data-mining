I purchased this book and was a bit dissapointed that there was focuse on outdated methods like mail-in responses.  With the advent of the Web, we've cut our client's costs by 80% and get them a 30% better response rate.  Just make sure that whatever survey provider you go with offers correlation analysis, Confidence intervals, and Cumulative distribution  are among the various statistical measures used to analyze your results. We're using Vista - no other survey tool gives you all of this crucial information.
