My wife and I have just signed a contract to display our photography in a new gallery in Taos, New Mexico, that specializes in photography. I have been reading, Mastering Digital Photography, Second Edition, for a few weeks now, and have learned a great deal about printing. In some cases, it has reinforced what we were doing, and in others, the information has changed the way we do business with our printing. The net result is that this book has given us some of the knowledge we needed to present our work in a truly professional way, and has probably contributed to the success of our bid for our place in this gallery.
