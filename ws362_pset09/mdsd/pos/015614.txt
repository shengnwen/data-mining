I sell radio advertising for a living and this is one of the best books about radio advertising that I've ever read. (Another great book is "Radio Advertising: the Authoritative Handbook" by Schulberg.) This is a small book with only 150+ pages but it's jam-packed with information. I finished the whole book in one evening -- I simply could not put it down. It's loaded with practical how-to steps in planning, buying and writing. And it's so easy to read. It makes radio advertising simple, logical, and fun!
