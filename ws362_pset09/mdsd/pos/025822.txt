As a selective, but serious cookbook collector and cook, I anxiously awaited receiving my copy of this book.  It has every great recipe that I've pretty much ever wanted right in one place and some I plan to try that I wasn't familiar with before.  Trouble is, I can't really justify buying any other cookbooks in the future!  This one really does have it all for me.  Easy ingredients to locate, new twists on old dishes and very tasty. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who is beginning their adventure into cooking or for those who are already established.  Makes a great gift, too
