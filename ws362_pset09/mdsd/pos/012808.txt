  I am a little unsure of how to rate this book. I first off want to say that it is so well and pleasantly written that you don't want to put it down. This author's love of books is so passionate and evident that you feel drawn into the thrill of his wonderful finds as he goes on his treasure hunts. 
  As far as useful information, I would say yes, for the rare and antiquarian book collector.
... But I bought this book with the desire to find information on how to find find, buy and sell used books. I don't feel like i got a whole lot of information there. He does talk about used bookstore hopping, but I was hoping to get a little more information than that. This book is also very dated in my opinion. He really dislikes the internet, and his information on the internet, even though revised and updated, seems really out of date. I can't believe he never once mentions Amazon! He does mention ebay,and other internet book/buying/selling arenas, but how can you not mention Amazon, the website that has most effected the bookselling industry? 
 To sum it up if you are interested in just beginning book collecting of rare books, or if you just want to read a well written book by someone who loves to read, this book is for you. 
 If you are looking to find information on how to get good books, information on selling on the internet, really this won't be helpful. 
 I hope my review was a little helpful
