Mary Bliss is shocked when her life as a good southern wife falls apart when her husband disappears (with all their money). She starts with the small lies to cover this disgrace from her teenage daughter and the neighbors. From there, she gets mired deeper and deeper in more lies and finally a convoluted cover up for faking his death. 
It has some funny moments, though not in the same way as Becky Bloomwood is funny. I miss the first-person stream-of-consciousness style of the Shopaholic books. 
Still this keeps your attention as a mystery, as a snapshot of southern life and as a story of relationships (mother/daughter, women friends, wife/husband, wife/mother-in-law, new boyfriend). Enjoyable reading
