Fortunately, the gruesomeness is not overdone, but comes close.  Lehane, however, is a master craftsman and keeps you guessing till the end.  The plot unfolds in a timely fashion, the characters are highly credible and the reader only marvels at the creativity of the author.  This is a gritty novel with a little leavening morality thrown in that helps put everything in perspective.  One of the best thrillers I've read in a long time.
