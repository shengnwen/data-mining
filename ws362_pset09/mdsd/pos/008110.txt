Thank goodness I finally found this Nelles Map a month before my trip to Oahu!  It honestly was the only thorough map I found for this island in 8 months of searching both Hawaii visitor sites and book companies.  This map gave great detail and was not so miniscule that I had to squint to read it.  The only drawback (I felt) was the too large hard cover.  The firmness of the cover was fine-it was just too large to squeeze into compact luggage pieces or vehicle cubbies.  (This was my lone reason for withholding a star.) 

side note-I had located the Kauai and Big Island sister maps months before and used all 3 maps daily on our trip.  The only map I found to offer better detailing of downtown areas was the Hawaiian airlines map-and they only offered ones for Kauai and the Big Island.  All that said, my Nelles maps are the ones I have kept for return trips to Hawaii
