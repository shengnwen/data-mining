For those who read the editorial review, know that the "paperback version" is actually an entirely different translation, and while it is abridged, this version is not.  
So, for those who read the editorial review and were concerned that this translation was abridged, don't worry, it isn't.
However, for those of you who read the editorial review, which sings the praises of the editor, and think that you're getting a version of innordinately high quality in this book, you're not.  the translation is very awkward at points.  it still gets the point accross, just sometimes with little attention paid to grammar
