I happen to love English literature (serious and not-so) from the early part of the twentieth century.  This book is both wonderful and horrible--it won't be for everyone, but those in sympathy with the period will not feel they have wasted their time reading it.

There is no question the first part of the book--the Oxford days--is its strongest, most cohesive part.  The later sections lose that early, sharp focus.

The prose is truly a thing of beauty--as smooth and silky as foie gras or Belgian chocolate.  It makes one long for the days when it wasn't necessary to explain that true martinis are made with gin.  But as I turned over the last pages, I realized I despised almost every character in the book--especially those with whom I am sure I was supposed to feel sympathy.  I found the narrator to be little more than a crashing snob, although that isn't always a hindrance toward my love for a character.  Indeed, the only character I really liked was Anthony Blanche--who was disliked by most of the others, but who was the most insightful and least delusional.  Some of the even-more-minor characters are unobjectionable, but that, after all, is damning with faint
praise.  In spite of that, I am glad I read it and shall probably re-read it every few years.

A must-read for any true Anglophile, but not without its flaws
