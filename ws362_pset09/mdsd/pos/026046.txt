The first thing I immediately started to compare this book to was Brokeback Mountain.  With all of the farm and rural talk, I wanted to scream Jack & Ennis as I began to read the story.  I must say that I was completely wrong (for the most part) and Donaghe managed to keep me thoroughly engaged throughout.  

While there are some parts that have become clichï¿½ for many gay novels (we've got another obsessively homophobic closet-case in Paul Romaine), Donaghe manages to throw in a good amount of dramatic twists to keep things fresh.  I also liked the use of religious diversity throughout; the conversations about God/soul/life sound very similar to thoughts that often bounce around in my head and amongst my circle of friends.  

The biggest question I had as I read this was why set it in 1965?  Aside from a few references to JFK and WWII, the story didn't seem to be affected in any way by the time period.  There are many parts in the US today where homophobia runs rampant.

All in all, if you are a fan of novels centering around coming out, you'll definitely be happy after reading this
