Really, how does he classify as a racist?  Can people read a book?  It is a tremendous reworking/continuation of a literary classic.  It breathes new life into the old tale and gives it a 21st century spin.  It's the same Koontz style that HIS readers have come to enjoy, and that is not a bad thing at all.  There are only a two novelists whose works I will continue to read, Michael Crichton and Dean Koontz.  As a law student, my time is scarce and Koontz makes reading more than worth my time.  However, reading a trilogy in the works is difficult.  If you haven't started the series yet, wait until book 3 comes out and read them in quick succession.  I can't wait for the final installment.  Do not listen to the negative reviewers, they sound jilted for some personal reason and are not being fair critics
