This book is geared mainly for screenwriting, but it can be useful for novelists and short story writers as well.  Linda Seger discusses character backstory, relationships with supporting characters, dialogue, and so on.   Plus, there are interviews with today's leading writers across the  spectrum.  Her narrative is clear and easy to understand, with plenty of  examples of both good and bad writing.  Even though I'm not a screenwriter,  I found this book very useful and entertaining
