I haven't read these books since high school, more than ten years ago.  I wanted to re-read them as I was feeling nostalgic.  After re-reading Dragons of Autumn Twilight I was a little concerned that the book was not living up to the memory I had of it.  Autumn Twilight was fun but the writing quality wasn't quite what I remembered and the story, while it had some good moments, lacked a really epic scope.  Still, I understood it had to set up all the characters so I was more optimistic for this second book.

Dragons of Winter's Night did not disappoint.  It really picked up the action and the story became much richer and more fast-paced.  The dialogue and charaterizations become much more realistic and the varied locales and new characters and races help make the story much more epic than the first book.  

The companions are given more depth and dimension.  Tanis is a good example of more complicated character, but Laurana becomes a much richer character also, since her part in book one was somewhat shallow.  And Sturm's storyline and trials to become an actual Knight gripped me much more now than they did years ago.  That was what really sold me on Weis and Hickman's improved writing, in that they were able to make Sturm more than just a one-dimensional chivalrous knight and gave him a deep soul.  It was easier to understand his motivations in condemning the petty divisions in the knighthood, even though he knew it will keep him from ever becoming a knight, which was his life's dream.  I also liked Sir Gunthar Uth Wistan and how he handled the political infighting within the Knights of Solamnia and his support of Sturm, how even though he used Sturm he still genuinely cared for him.

Tas is amusing, as other readers have pointed out, although I'm glad they kept the Gnomes to a minimum.  A little of them go a long way.  

All in all, this book was as good as I had hoped it to be.  I really enjoyed it after all these years and recommend it to any curious reader.
