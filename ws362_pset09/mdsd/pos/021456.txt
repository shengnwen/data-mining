Some of the previous reviewers really got their knickers into a twist over this book.  It's not the best Sherman & Cragg have put out, but it is a decent start for a new spinoff.

I was not pleased to see good troops used for bad purposes, either, but it happens in the real world, too.  It's most especially possible to use good troops for bad purposes if the troops and the missions are clandestine.  That's why political oversight is such a good idea, in the real world.

In this book the Force Recon unit is actually believable, if you are aware of the training and the capabilities of such units in real history.  Although I would tend to think that Starfist Force Recon seems closer to SEAL or Delta Force in how it's being used, and how it seems to be trained.  It also, unfortunately, seems to be well-versed in Spetsnaz tactics and techniques.  Soviet Spetsnaz were trained to take lives and torture if necessary in order to fulfil their mission -- although borderline psychopaths, such as Bella Dawn, were weeded out of even Spetsnaz units.

In a later book, it would be nice to see Force Recon find out how they had been misused in the case in the book, and then deal effectively and secretly with the jerks in the government who pulled the dirty stunts.

I enjoyed this book, although I would have preferred it if the assassins had not succeeded.

A couple of the previous reviewers had real problems with the strong woman types portrayed in the book.  Mostly negatively.  I have a book called "The Most Evil Women in History" and it is a hard read due to the horrible things some of these women did (ancient and modern) --- but Bella Dawn would not be the first woman to scare a grown man cold
