A pretty good book.  It outlines the key strategic motifs of nearly every basic pawn structure you will find in the game, and gives plenty of example games ranging from the obscure to the famous like Keene-Miles 1975.  It's chock full of great positional advice and standard plans for almost every opening.  I learned a lot of useful stuff, like that one key factor in deciding whether g4!? is sound in the Sicilian depends on whether black can play ...d5! in response immediately.  The book outlines ideas for minority attacks, liquidation of the pawn center, etc.  I found many interesting thematic similarities between seemingly unrelated openings by examining their pawn structures in this book.  The only part of the book I found lacking was the discussion on Stonewalls especially the Dutch, a dubious but powerful opening in the right hands.  The Stonewalls chapter was short even as far as overviews go and looked like the author got lazy and wanted to just get paid ASAP.  Other than that, this book was awesome
