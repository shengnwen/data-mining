I was not familiar with Thomas Friedman's New York Times columns.  This book contains a sampling of his columns.  The book mainly portrays the difference in the Arab vs. the culture of the West. The book opens with the shock of the events of 9/11, considered a tragedy by the West and a cause for celebration for many places in the Arab and Muslim world.  
The author goes onto explain the Arab world's rage against America is the result of the idea that America represents, globalization , modernity, plurality.  Muslim populations in the middle east are generally ruled by oppressive regimes that are failing their populace, providing a limited world vision, while censoring information.  The author made an interesting observation, India has the second largest Muslim population of any  country in the world,  but the Muslim rage in not present, as the author notes, chanting "death to America" is not the favored occupation of its populace.  The reason,  India is a democracy,  the people are concerned with bettering themselves  through government.
And so it goes,  The author's main point is that when the Middle East can be democratized, and the poverty alleviated it will be ready to join the modern world.
I really believe Tom Freidman is right on target with the ideas within this book.
