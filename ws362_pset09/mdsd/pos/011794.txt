There is also a site - www.moviemistakes.com, which is free (unless you want to pay for membership which allows access to pictures of the mistakes, less ads, etc), and shows many more mistakes.  There are sections for TV and movie mistakes, and each show is ordered either into episodes or ordered by rating (you can give thumbs up or thumbs down to the mistake, and the most popular will end up in the Top 20 mistakes).  There are sections of each movie/show for major and minor mistakes, corrections (of the mistakes that are submitted), trivia, easter eggs, pictures, and questions (that are asked by anyone).  You can submit any of these, as long as you follow the rules.  There are also different types of mistakes - continuity, revealing,  "deliberate", factual, audio, visible crew/equipment, plot holes, and other.  The 'manager' of the site does not contribute mistakes, trivia, etc, but rather the audience submits all of the information.  In the case of an incorrect mistake, someone can also correct it.  It's a great site
