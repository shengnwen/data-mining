I would recommend these for any fan. Some interesting insights into the films. The prologue to A New Hope has a two page write up that describes the back story for all the prequels. You'll also find some conflicts with the prequels ie, Luke's uncle is said to be Obi-wan's brother and Anakins unnamed wife lived after Luke and Leia's birth.
