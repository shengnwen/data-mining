Most of my dessert recipes are Julia Child-style rich, but I recently got this book from the library to see how well I could make low-fat, whole-wheat baking work (I've been baking since I was 8 and use mostly my own recipes). Yesterday I made my usual white flour, high-fat, high-sugar banana bread for my entire office, which everyone loved. Today I made the whole wheat Brown Sugar Banana Bread from the bread section of this cookbook, without the nuts, and the ENTIRE office is raving about it! Everyone ate both kinds and declared this one just as good, if not better. I also got a number of her other cookbooks and have been VERY impressed with the recipes. Definitely a must-have for any kitchen
