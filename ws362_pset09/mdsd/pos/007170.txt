On content I would rate this book a solid 5, but I found the readibility of this book to detract from its message.   The book is filled with scientific evidience in masse when it comes to proving that beauty reigns when it comes to popularity, picking out a mate, professional success, and just about anything else in life.  This book is more of an academic book than it is for general pleasure reading.  In fact this book would be an excellent choice for research, as experiments are solid, and come in such large quanity it would be of value to many. 

The major distraction of this book is the complex language was written in.  Constant complex-compound sentences with a post college level vocabulary makes Patzer's book a slow read.  If this would have been easier to read, I would have given this book a solid five.  

Content in this book is solid, ever wondered what impact attractiveness has in intimate relationships, work relationships, and relationships with strangers?  What characteristics of physical attractiveness does each gender find the most important?  It may surprise you that each gender cares for different qualities than we tend to normaly think of.  This book would an excellent resource for anyone wanting to quantify how attractiveness plays a part in daily lives.
