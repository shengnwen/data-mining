 Dave Hunt has been teaching for years about the issues of
Biblical prophecy and apostasy in the backslidden churches. Now
comes his newest work regarding much DOCUMENTED TRUTH and Biblical
truth that shows irrefutably just how much the nations have
betrayed Israel and her Covenant with THE GOD of Israel: The
Covenant with The Land, AND The Covenant regarding the promised
restored Davidic/Messianic Kingdom. If you want a factual and
very sound overview of *what is REALLY happening* in the highly
volatile and prophetically significant Middle East: read this
book. Get a copy to your pastor or to a friend. Better yet: send
a copy to your favorite journalist. Everybody needs to know
just how sinister is the conscious (and subconscious) plot to
destroy Israel and repudiate their Covenant with The GOD
 {Yahweh-YaHOVaH} of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. GOD is getting
ready to unleash His fury upon the nations. Be ready. and be
VERY SURE you are standing on the right side of THIS issue.
Be very VERY sure.
