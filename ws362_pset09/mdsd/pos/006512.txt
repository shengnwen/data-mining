My ex dumped me about 23 or 24 days ago.  I got this book based on someone who really liked it.  For the most part I'm very happy with it.  Some of the stuff repeats over and over again, but I must admit I am feeling much better, and the book has definately helped me out.  I'm to the point where I mentally have forgiven my ex, and feel comfortable with not ever seeing her again.  I think after 30 days I'll be strong enough to make my ex a VERY distant memory.  The one thing I want to caution on, is that 30 days is just a guideline, it could take longer for people depending on the situation...
