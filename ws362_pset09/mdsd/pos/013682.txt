When I discovered I was related to Robert Beverley, I bought this book just to have.  It is a wonderful, rich look into early Virginia with special (and favorable) focus on the Native Americans in that area in the early 1700s.  I have enjoyed the book, as have my children, on its own merits and not simply because this is an ancestor of mine.
