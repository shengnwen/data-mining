Great book.  If there were a way to give this book 4 and a half stars, I would have rated it such.  Shipler's book manages to give a face to both sides of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict without taking sides.  Never before has there been such a need for people to be exposed to the intricacies behind both sides of the Middle East conflict.  If you are interested in the historical facts that have led up to the Promised Land's current state of volatility, there are probably better books to go to.  However, if you want to hear from the inside what the Palestinian experience is like living in occupied West Bank, Golan Heights, and Gaza Strip and their viewpoint of Israelis, no book can do it better. Also, what stands out above the fray of literature on this subject, is the continual reaching out of individuals and individual groups' to reconcile their differences and the points of hope and points of futility that result from these attempts.  If you are looking for something black and white that will give you a clear conclusion on what is to be done in the middle east Pandora's Box that is modern day Israel, this book will not give it to you.  What it will give you is an epiphany as to just how complex the human dimension is between the Jews and Arabs and how there really is no clear solution to the conflict as long as things remain status quo.  It is not a hopeful book, but a deeply revealing one.  Don't hesitate to buy this book if you are interested in the human dimension in modern day Israel and Palestine
