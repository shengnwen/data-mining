As my favorite Joanne Harris book, this story was very appealing to me, because it reflected the realities of what people lived through in France during the occupation and resistance period of World War II.  It does not condemn or blame but with great humanitarian compassion reveals how all sides responded to their circumstances in the best way that they could.  It is a story about lives impacted by war and the human drama of survival during the worst of times.  It is uplifting in the sense that we see the strength of the human spirit to endure.  The story is also a powerful reminder of what the war generation in Europe endured, and how modern Europe continues to grapple with the legacy of this experience.
