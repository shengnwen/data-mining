Dan Simmons is a brilliant writer. I don't think anybody will deny that after reading his works...especially Song of Kali. He takes you to a dark, dark place and doesn't let you go. You feel like gasping for breath but you can't. His writing does that to you. I've never read anything like this in horror. I'm not surprised it won the World Fantasy Award. He creates a horrific world where menacing things lurk at every corner. This is what horror should do and he does it very nicely. If you want to read another horror masterpiece by Simmons, you should check out Summer of Night. Its better in my opinion. But this is still an unforgettable experience. Simmons has the gift
