...and he's one of the best writers in America.  Fascinating and well-written story of a family, their talented but twisted son, and how the process of getting to Washington is so corrupt and corrupting that by the time you get there you have already lost the goal you started to seek.  The ultimate in inside politics...and as pointed out by other reviewers, a nice trip for nostalgic baby boomers from the early part of the boom (like me, b. 1944).  A good place to start on Just if he's new to you; a classic to savor if you know his work already
