The hours are long, the people you meet on the job tend to make you feel unwelcome, the amount of travel required for the job is mind-boggling, and the requisite decor is monotonous.  Such is the life--- ummm, such is the routine of Death, the anthropomorphic personification of the end of life.  An assistant would ease two of the shortcomings of the job and mitigate a third (sorry, even an assistant is no help with the decor issues), so Death takes on an apprentice.

  Death's horse is pale, but is also named Binky.  Death likes cats.  Death is the only character to appear in every Discworld book.  Most enjoyable is how Death alternates between passionless competence in his domain, and mild neurosis regarding his self image and relationships.  Anyone, even Death, who thinks that an adolescent girl is easier to deal with than a younger child deserves what he gets, so Death has adopted a teenage girl.  And boy does Death create work for himself by taking on Mort as an apprentice to aid him and be a companion for his adopted adolescent daughter, Ysabell.

Hilarity ensues as Mort becomes romantically involved with a young woman who was one of his scheduled tasks, and we learn more about Death's servant Albert.

Pratchett begins to hit his stride in this book, although some later volumes backslide a little.  This volume shows the deftness and brilliance Pratchett is capable of in a well-flowing story.  Very enjoyable, but provides those twists on perpective that make Pratchett so much fun
