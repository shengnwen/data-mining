i can honestly say i've never read anything quite like collected fictions. Imaginary animals , recreated lives of villians , libraries that go on forever - every page contains some dazzling use of the imagination. You can see where great writers like gabriel garcia marquez, Julio Cortazar and Mario vargas Llosa get some of their inspiration.....

In fact, borges is, if you like, the 'Daddy' of South American fiction, a true original who has wielded his immense intellect to interesting thought provoking stories and ideas about fiction, that will last as long as the world does.
