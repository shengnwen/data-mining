Truthfully I only read this book because my mother-in-law gave it to me when she was done.  I had thought I had heard/read it all and just read it because there wasn't anything better to read.  But I must say that I was surprised at how interesting it was and despite the fact that its several years old, still very relevant.  I am an author of a self-help book for those who step out of their careers to be stay-at-home moms and have seen first hand the way the media, even in the SMALL town I currently reside, has almost but completely ignored both me and my book.  In chapter 11, Mr. Goldberg discusses how the media represses the negative research regarding the institution of childcare and in my case explains why the media ignores the subject of the stay-at-home parent, despite the fact that there are millions of parents at home.  I have researched this topic for years and yet Mr. Goldberg presented research I hadn't seen before.  This is an excellent book and a must read for publishers and others who may be wondering why the media is ignoring their message.
