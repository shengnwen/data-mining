Clive Cussler retains his title as the grandmaster of adventure fiction in the second installment of the Oregon Files, stories of the adventures of the covert organization, the Corporation.  While the plot was more complex than in Golden Buddha, the first Oregon Files book, we have less of a glimpse into who our protagonists are.  The book is nonstop, high-adrenaline fun, however, as our Corporation friends anchor of Reykjavik, Iceland, on assignment to protect the Emir of Qatar, when a call comes in from the United States government.  A highly radioactive meteorite has been discovered in Greenland, and the US wants to hire the Corporation to steal it before it can fall into the wrong hands.  Juan Cabrillo, the Corporation's chairman, takes off to collect the meteorite while the others protect the emir.  Things heat up quickly when a team of assassins gets the meteorite before Cabrillo, leading the Corporation on a chase across the northern seas, Scotland, England, and eventually Saudi Arabia.  Simultaneously, a team of Arab terrorists kidnaps the emir, and the Corporation goes in for the rescue.  Turns out there are two teams of bad guys this time:  one wanting the meteorite to kill in the name of Islam, and another out to destroy Islam.  It's fun to watch the story unravel with high action and intricate plotting as the Corporation coordinates its efforts with the US and other governments, leaving us feeling like we're privy to exciting, classified information kept secret from the rest of the world.  Filled with Cussler's trademark similes and good humor, there's a slight Dirk Pitt flavor, though the Oregon Files have a stamp all their own.  This third series of Cussler's is off and running.  I did note there was no mention of Juan Cabrillo's prosthetic leg in this book, and I'm left to wonder if it's going to fade into nonexistence in future novels.  I guess we'll see
