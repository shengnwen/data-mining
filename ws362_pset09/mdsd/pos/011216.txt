I have owned this book for quite some time and it is well weathered.  I have often used it before a fishing trip to put a few odds in my favor, or after to try to see &quot;where were those fish?&quot;.  Other than that I  have often flipped through it over the long cold winter, and dreamed of  open water.  As a life-long pike lover, I find in this book a true tribute  to this wonderful gamefish that should be a staple of any angler's photo  album.  Lots of research and historical points here with old records of  some true fish-stories.  A must have
