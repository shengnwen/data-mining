I thought Can't Stop Won't Stop was an excellent inside look at hip hop. The author did a good job giving the reader an inside look at this topic. The book shows just how hip hop has grown to the point we have coined a whole generation "The Hip Hop Generation". After reading this book and others about hip hop, I feel that hip hop is going in the wrong direction. Another book about hip hop The Lost Generation and the book by Bakari Kitwana points this fact out in an excellent way. As a matter of fact, if you liked this book you will enjoy reading The Lost Generation as well. Overall, I think Can't Stop Won't Stop is a good book to check out if you are interested in finding out more about the hip hop generation. A hot topic nowadays.
