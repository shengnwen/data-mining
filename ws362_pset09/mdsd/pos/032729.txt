As someone who's read alot of the finance-y type books who is also a practicioner, this is an entertaining book.   I'm in the middle of reading Accidental Banker but it is geared more towards those already in I-banking like myself, whereas Monkey Business reminds me of when I first started on the street.   I highly recommend this book for anyone thinking about I-banking or High Finance.
