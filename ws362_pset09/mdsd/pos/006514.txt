With the chilly season setting in here in Washington State, the thoughts of a tropical vacation keep me going all winter long.  I must admit that what attracted me first to this book was the palm tree, the blue-green water, the sand and the longing of wanting to be there.  This is the first of Nora Roberts I have read, however I am an avid JD Robb reader.  
This book was so well written that you could just envision yourself in the sea diving for treasure or aboard the boat in the warm sun.  How exciting!  The plot was wonderful, the characters were likable, the villians were nasty.  This is one book that I am going to buy for myself as a guilty treat, and I will read it again when the cold starts setting in, so that it can take me away again for a warm exciting adventure.
