I'm a grad student in ecology, and this book is a wonderful review of the subject.  The writing is straightforward and includes lots of examples from the scientific literature.  

It's well written and has many levels, so it would be just as valuable for an undergrad with an interest in ecology as it is for the grad student boning up for qualifying exams (me!).  Much better than comparable ecology books that I used as an undergraduate
