I used this book as my ONLY study guide for the CLEP test of the same title.

I studied for only three weeks, I passed with an A.

My score was 61 (50 is passing on the CLEP).

This was the lowest score that I have ever gotten on a CLEP test.  If this book had more of a question and answer section, I'm sure my score would have been higher.

But all in all, the book was "almost perfect".
