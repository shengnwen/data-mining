Indeed, Dreyfus and Rabinow have &quot;cleared up&quot; much of Foucaults difficult methods.  I would say that reading this does not excuse anyone from Foucaults works; it could be read alongside them to help clarify  themes and connect seemingly useless portions that most people would like  to skip through. Besides, without actually reading Foucault you are missing  out on some of the most profound, stylistic, and original philosophy of the  twentieth century. An excellent introduction and guide, but comprehensive  enough to warrant FIVE stars. Trust me. Dreyfus and Rabinow have written a  surprisingly original book here; their view and support of Foucault as  &quot;beyond structuralism and hermeneutics&quot; is brilliantly explained
