The title says it all: you cannot remain anonymous or hidden any more, anyone with the will or intent can find out a wealth of information about you, and resistance is futile. O'Harrow goes through a laundry list of means that are utilized to capture and share information about you, all without your knowledge or consent. There are companies that exist solely for the purpose of gathering and selling personal information. That's capitalism at work for you (or is it against you?). A fact of life in the information age is that things that make life much easier and simpler for us are also the primary sources for diminishing our privacy. This double-edged sword really does cut both ways, since it is a price we pay for ease, convenience and protection. The irony is that we have struggled and fought for our freedom, yet are not able to survive today without the protections afforded by these measures. It is frightening to think that we can be tracked by satellite when we use GPS in our cars or when we use a credit card at a store. Our grocers know our buying habits because we use their store's discount cards in order to save ourselves money. Phone records indicate whom we called and at what time. Just try to live today without credit cards or a phone! It is difficult to ascertain O'Harrow's purpose for writing this book because he leaves many conclusions to us. Does he take some perverse pleasure in making us feel powerless? Or perhaps he is alerting us to information collecting methods so that we take precautionary measures? We can take precautions, yet if our identity is stolen, laws are designed to protect credit card companies, not us. Only as a majority would we be able to reverse this trend and return to anonymity, though what would be the repercussions of this? Whatever the purpose for the book, it is reasonably informative and at the very least should spur us to contemplate this topical and pervasive issue.
