This book is full of things you don't want to read.  We all think our situations are unique, our loves are special, our relationships with married men are different.  Ha!  This book dispels all those lies we tell ourselves to make it okay.  It opened my eyes to the reality of the situation and the realization that every affair is the same.  It was an eye opener and it really did help me.

As to the affair itself, my guy dumped me to work on things with the wife just as the book said they usually do.  Time has passed and he has decided to leave his wife and get a divorce.  We are trying to pick things up and make a relationship work.  Does this make my affair different?  Not really...  but sometimes the outcome is different.  I guess I got a guy in the 1% of men who really do leave their wives..
