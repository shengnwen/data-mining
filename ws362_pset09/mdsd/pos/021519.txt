Alternadad is a funny, at times touching, memoir of marriage and parenting.  Though Pollack is no Sedaris in the humor department (at no point in reading Alternadad did my sides split), credit where it's due: he does have an eye for quirky details, connections, and language.  Above all, Pollack emerges from the pages of this memoir as an eminently likeable person, and -- together with his wife -- a seemingly very decent parent: the kind of guy I'd like to hang out with.  Having just finished this slightly overlong memoir, I am left only to wonder what's so "Alterna" about this particular dad.  Pollack seems pretty much like the next guy, trying to earn a living, provide for his family, instill proper values in his child, etc.  (If that's alternative, I'd be curious to know what Pollack considers middle of the road.)  In the end, I enjoyed setting a spell with the Pollack family.
