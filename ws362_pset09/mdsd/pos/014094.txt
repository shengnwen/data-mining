I found the book to be delightful for me.  I also enjoyed Sara Ryan's Empress of the World.  This book hits home for a lot of young LGBT that go through the disapproval of friends and family.  Peters did a great job of expressing "falling in love the first time" I would recommend this book to anyone, gay or straight.  I look forward to more books by Peters
