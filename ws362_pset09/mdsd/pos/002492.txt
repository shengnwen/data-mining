4.9 stars:

If you are one of those cookbook collectors that enjoy the glossy, amusing cookbooks written by glossy, amusing TV personalities that are either "barefoot" or "naked", then this book is NOT for you.  This book has no pictures, no glossy pages, and no stories of how the chef found a rare pepper plant on a recent excursion to Machu Picchu, Peru.  This book is a compilation of recipes by a "group of women from Saint Paul's Church."  Some recipes may be authentic and traditional; some may be completely made up; who knows and who cares is what I say.

The recipes are good.  The directions are easy.  And the ingredients are available to most of us that don't live beyond the reach of the Interstate (let alone the Internet!)

Here are some of the 250+ recipes in this book:
Baklava
Skaltsounia cookies
Phylo triangles
Souzoukakia (10-points if you can say that ten times fast)
Moussaka
Mock mageritsa
Stuffed grape leaves (yes!!)
Whole baby lamb
Politico-style salad
Béchamel sauce
Meatball avgolemono soup
Mock manti
Shish kebab (Mmmmmm)
12 different breads!
Farina cake
Flaounes
Sagnaki
Kapama
Souvlakia
Chicken stefado
Greek coffee (whoa, I'm awake now!)
Iced kourabiedes (cookies)
Bougatsa
And my personal favorite....
Loukoumades (if you haven't had one - or a dozen - then you are missing out!)

I highly recommend this book as an addition to your cookbook collection.  You will find it to be one of your favorites
