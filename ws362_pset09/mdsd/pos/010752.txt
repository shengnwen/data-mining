I've read several books in this genre and have to say this one is the most provocative of the group, which, goes to the essence of the Matrix experience.  

I didn't give this book five stars because some of the essays seemed a little "canned" and too much like sitting through my college philosophy course.  Some arguments (the nature of faith, motivation, choice and free will) seemed well reasoned in the context of the movie sequences used for illustration, while others (tao, mystical experience) seemed labored and unconvincing (maybe Neo could "see" the machine world and Smith in Bane's body after being blinded because of his implants picking up signals instead of being a "mystical" experience - just an idea).

But, again, this is the essence of the Matrix experience:  each person sees a different story or stories based on their knowledge and experience.  The Wachowski Brothers take religious and mythical themes from (apparently) all cultures and tweak them to suit their story.  My personal favorite is when Neo - the "one" - betrays his love with a kiss instead of himself being betrayed by a kiss (ala Judas).  As a Christian, this sequence made me think that Neo really isn't the Christ-like figure that people want him to be and is really something else, but what?  That question, for me, was answered when Neo meets the Architect.  Mr Lawrence addresses the "kiss" sequence from the point-of-view of Persephone, which is a valid approach, but not the one I would have chosen.

I've earmarked several passages in Mr. Lawrence's book for follow-up inquiry, especially the sections which address biblical passges.  Much like the follow-up inquiries that all three movies provoked in me, this book is rich with ideas and worth investing the time in.
