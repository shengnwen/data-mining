Author Emily Luchetti combines her passion for ice cream with the vivid photos of Sheri Giblin to create a masterful book that explores the world of gourmet ice cream desserts. Each dessert is intended to be made using a hand-crank ice cream maker and comes out tasting like Rum Raisin Ice Cream Sandwiches, Apricot Sherbet Cake or Pistachio. 

Even the casual coffee table book reader will enjoy spending a few hours diving into the pages of Passion for Ice Cream. And, if you're an adventurous cook, by all means, try a recipe or two.
