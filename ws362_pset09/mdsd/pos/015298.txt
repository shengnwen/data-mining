The fired gardener's daughter marries the billionaire owner of the estate in I Heard That Song Before.  It's like taking up the story of Cinderella after the Prince and Cinderella have married.  

Unlike Cinderella, this story has some dark elements that overhang the marriage.  At age six, Kay Lansing, our Cinderella, overhears a mysterious argument over money between a man and woman at the Carrington estate where her father works.  That argument comes to have even greater significance in Kay's future.  Kay's husband, Peter Carrington, has also been the prime suspect in the disappearance of neighbor Susan Althorp, a disappearance that happened the same day Kay overheard the argument.  Further, Peter's pregnant first wife died mysteriously in the swimming pool.

So is Peter really Prince Charming?  That's the primary mystery that the book explores.  It's a fun mystery.

What makes this book rise above the average thriller is that Mary Higgins Clark does a masterful job of speeding up developments, events, and pressures on all of the characters just as soon as Kay and Peter return from their honeymoon.  The result is peril that radiates out like the ripples from a boulder dropped into a billionaire's pool.    

The book is light on character development or I would have rated it higher.  But for premise and story development, this is a superb book. 

Have fun!
