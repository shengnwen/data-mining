This book is rather strange. There is a very distinct writing style, and Camus paints a very vivid picture of everything that is going on.

The plot itself is at first completely bewildering. The book starts out with the death of our main character's mother, and then moves with startling speed to completely different things, and before you even realize what's happening, there's a baffling trial.

The thing that troubled me most about the story was the trial itself, because knowing how silly the arguments are, one can get extremely frustrated, and I found myself quite angry at the book.

It was the ending that I truly enjoyed. It was a very solid, satisfying ending, making the overall reflections easier. This is certainly a good book; not perfect, not incredible, and, in fact, often very confusing. Overall, though, it's an interesting book to read, and when I was done, I found myself thinking about all sorts of things, because the book really does make you think. It's not perfect, no, but it is thought-provoking. And while some people cannot stand it, others love it dearly. It's a book worth reading
