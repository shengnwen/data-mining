Maiden Voyage is a wonderful account of Tanya Aebi's adventure around the world.  Her story is told in such honesty that any reader may feel the longing to explore the world.  I myself have spoken of it so often that my husband is a little worried that I will leave him and the land for the seclusion and adventure of the sea.  He needn't worry, but I at least want to learn how to sail.

I would recommend this book to anyone.  It is one of the few books that you can read more than once.  I must caution you to pace yourself while reading or the book will pass by in the blink of an eye, and you will be left wishing that Tanya had published more books.
