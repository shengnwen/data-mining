This is a wonderful book.  Once you get started you can't put it down! If  you have not read the other books on the Delany family, don't worry for Ms.  Oke catches you up on where they have been to the present storyline.  The  way she bring the message of God and his teachings is simply excellent, and  she also ties this in to today's society and how easy it is to relate to  the characters just like you were there yourself.  I hope there is a sequel  soon! I love her books and would reccommend them to anyone
