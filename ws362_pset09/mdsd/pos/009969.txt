The Provincial Lady books are fictitious diaries  and as such, are written in abbreviated phrases, memos to the writer herself.  This type of writing does get a bit monotonous, but the content, the account of an almost famous writer from one of England's southern counties (before WW II) is very diverting.  Having achieved a modest success with her first diary, the Provincial Lady  is now invited to international literary conferences, but must cope with the fact that she is still an unknown, and is often forced to fake acquaintanceship with books she hasn't read. Although her literary agent waits eagerly for her latest book (necessitating the renting of a London flat in order to have uninteruppted time to write) she still  deals with an embarassing lack of funds in her bank account.  This oscillation between the trajectory of her career and the earthbound concerns of money and child-rearing constitute a major theme.  Anyone who has ever had to balance career and, say, laundry, will get a kick out of the conundrum. A witty read by an engaging writer equipped with senses of irony and absurdity. Imagine Erma Bombeck transplanted to 1930's England, and I think you'll get some idea of our heroine
