Open mind - you bet. A broad range of boats here.  I wanted to build a light displacement, shallow draft, plus open ocean cruiser, 6 out of eight builders said it can't be done. Bolger gives you three designes from 30 to 90 feet, timber or steel plus a lot more smaller boats.  I took the plans, which I enlarger on a photocopier from A5 book page, to A3, to the Tasmanian Wooden Boat festival in Tasmania Australia and had a wonderful response fron two 70+ year old ship wrights who thought the designs were very usefull, practical and seaworthy.  I guess the best review you could get is a &quot;build it&quot; from a veteran ship wright who understands everone wants something unique or has a special need in their design.  This book will give you ideas and solutions, if not exact plans, to overcome many unique problems you may have.  I have a shallow bay to tie up in but I wanted to let the boat sit on the beach at low tide and I also have a thirty foot bridge between me and the sea and I want to sail to New Zealand, a tough design brief.  I got all the answeres from Boats with an open mind.  Only problem with this book is, &quot;is your mind open enough?&quot; If not, go buy a white plastic boat and miss the charm of a personal, warm, wonderful boat that meets your every requirement
