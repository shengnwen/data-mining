I don't know anything about French, I bought this book to help me when visiting France, It's really good pocket book, it has categories such as Every Day Phrases, Villas and Apartments, Traveling Around, Driving, Eating, Menu Guide, Stores, Sport, Health, and many more categories. 

It shows the phrase and words in English, French, and then the pronunciation of the French words in English letters. 
Also it has general info about each category in France. 

I speak English, Arabic and Spanish, and I find the French language very hard for me to understand and speak. 

I think this is a really great pocket book for traveler to France
