Unger has footnoted the many dubious connections between the Bush family and their associates with the money that flows through the Saudi dynasty.  The mixing of personal fortunes of the Republican party & Mid-East policy is highly questionable and perhaps unethical.  

George H.W. Bush's policy toward the Mideast as Vice President & President and his complicity in the Iran contra scandal along with his cozy retirement at the Carlyle group makes him an easy target for conspiracy theorists.  Unfortunately for the American people, the theories are probably a reality.  Bush Jr. has his own credibility problems beginning with his energy company, Harken, getting bailed out by Saudi angel investors & then the peculiar midnight flights after 9/11, smuggling bin Laden family members during an air-stopage.  There are many other questionable and unethical policy decisions by father and son noted in the last 25 years of American foreign policy.

Incompetence and corruption is what is illustrated in Unger's well researched book, historians will most likely judge this family's bungling of American policy harshly.
