The power of narrative to define reality is a common theme in much of fantasy fiction. (Silverlock by John Myers Myers is a good place to start if you're looking for that theme, but it's all through fantasy, where prophecy and other narrative-based magic abounds.)  Zeitgeist updates this to 1999 and a superficially global perspective, as well as adding a lot of humor.  Those who think this novel is science fiction and then complain about its lack of realism have missed what for me is the point of the novel.  It's as much a fantasy set in contemporary times as American Gods (by Neil Gaiman) or most of Charles De Lint's work, except Zeitgeist is about current or recent myths instead of the traditional ones about gods or elves.  It's a millennial fantasy -- Y2K was supposed to be the end of the world, don't you remember?  It fizzled as an apocalypse, but many people seriously believed in it.  That is one of the main themes of the book, how the stories of a cultural belief can shape reality.   How exactly do people think something is science fiction where characters vomit money and bullets, children levitate, and the main character summons the spirit of his father through a ritual though unseasonal celebration of Christmas?  Zeitgeist isn't about the future, it's a mythologization of the most recent past -- a very entertaining one
