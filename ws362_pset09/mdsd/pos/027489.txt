This is one of the best books I have read on how the Biblical view of marriage and family fits into culture- any culture.  Since, this is based in Africa you would think that it the contents would be very territorial, but it transcends that.  I would recommend this book especially to people living in cultures foreign to their own as well as those who have questions about how Biblical principles (which are very ancient) apply in this present day
