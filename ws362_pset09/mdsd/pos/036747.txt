All the Pretty Horses reveals the fate of a young man trying to live his life by a code no longer recognized by the world.  His personal integrity is based on his ability to follow through with his commitments to himself and others and to honor the values his western lifestyle forged by his West Texas upbringing.  His lack of close relationships with females taints his view of love and when his survival depends on his willingness to kill, he struggles with the morality of living a life based on survival of the fittest.  His journey toward manhood and choosing his own destiny is fraught with loneliness, moral dilemnas, and cruel lessons about human nature and survival.  The best and worst of human nature is exposed in this bildungsromain by McCarthy.  His style is difficult to follow but the beautiful prose more than makes up for his lack of speaker tags, punctuation, and quotation marks.  This book is a treasure worth seeking out and discovering
