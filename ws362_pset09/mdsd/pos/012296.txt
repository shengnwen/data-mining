I have to admit I bought this book because it was in the closeout bin and I got a deal on it.  I next have to admit that it sat in a pile of books to read for at least three months before I got around to reading it.  But on starting it, I was highly impressed.  It's well paced, factual, well researched without being dry and scholarly.

First, I had no idea that his battles were fought off the English and Scottish coasts and that he was considered to be a pirate by the English- I always thought he fought battles off the American coast.

Second, I had no idea that he was so closely tied with Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and the closing stages of the French monarchy- nor that he served under Catherine the Great in helping her to gain a passage through the Black Sea.

Third, the personality of the man, greatly flawed in its insatiable desire for glory and honor, was balanced by an ability to fight-- and to WIN.

America wasn't a third-rate, fourth-rate or even a fifth-rate naval power during her Revolutionary War.  America was essentially a "no rate."  But Jones gave America victories when most others (with a few notable exception) did not.  And he forced the British to bring home more of Her navy to protect home waters.

For those who have read any of the Horatio Hornblower or "Lucky Jack Aubrey" works of fiction, I recommend that they also read this book.

War is mostly waged by ordinary men- with fears, hopes, desires and needs like all of us.  However, in every major conflict there a very few, like John Paul Jr., son of an English landscape gardener, who do more than their duty would dicate.  For John Paul "Jones" it was his desire to be covered with glory and honor as well as his desire to build a winning AMERICAN Navy that caused him to push himselves and others far beyond the normal limits.

To "Jones", the thoughts of marriage, children, even his health were secondary to these.

I salute Evan Thomas for an excellent work about the father of the American Navy
