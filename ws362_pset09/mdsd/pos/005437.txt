Very much like a Nora Roberts style of writing, Sharon Sala has done a superb job with her romantic suspense novel "REUNION." You know almost immediately who the killer is, and yet are still compelled to read on to a very emotional ending. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, it is better when you know very little about what is going to happen and just enjoy the book for what it is. 
My only qualms with the novel was the repetition of reiterating the facts more than once as if the reader couldn't keep track of what was just said, and the relationship moved too quickly with no friction to add to the anticipation. However, it is a compelling read that instantly pulls you into the story leaving you with a completely different outlook than when you began the book. I know this sounds criptic, but I just don't want to spoil it for anyone. Read it and you'll understand what I mean
