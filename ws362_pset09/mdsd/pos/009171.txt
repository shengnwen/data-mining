I thoroughly enjoyed leisurely leafing through these pages of interior design counsel. I plan to do it often! Just as the furniture is toned down without losing any "toney" impact, the writing (I notice since I am a writer) gently guides the reader to a variety of ideas. I was not talked down to with over-the-top in-the-know design jargon, nor was I left feeling I'd just read the longest sales pitch this side of QVC! It was as if I had just sat down with my personal interior designer who miraculously somehow knows exactly what I want without a peep from me. A very "comfortable" read while draped over my Morgan leather chair and sipping my double expresso cappuccino. Thank you Ms. Drucker! (oh yea, Gold and Williams too) I feel designer-empowered!!
