In 1919, a tank filled with 2.3 million gallons of molasses spilled its contents onto Boston's North End creating a wave 25 feet high and 150 feet long.  In its path of destruction, 21 people were killed from 10 year old children to a 76 year old messenger caught up while doing his job in the area.

In today's world of cable and internet news, insatiable for events to cover, it is hard to imagine a deadly and unusual story like this almost forgotten a mere century later.  Yet, I grew up just outside of Boston and worked in the city for years without ever hearing this event referred to.

Dark Tide has just been reprinted and justifiably so as it deserves a wide readership.  I ran through this book in 3 days.  In part 1, Puleo paints a picture of foreboding as a giant tank looms over the North End and commercial waterfront, blocking out the sun for many residents. The tank oozes molasses when full and is surrounded by local children filling cans with the sweetener to bring home.  Meanwhile, rumbling noises are emitted from inside the tank while Builder and Manager Arthur Jell ignores repeated warnings from employee Isaac Gonzales that disaster is immenent.

Using a structure similar to that of Jonathan Harr in A Civil Action, Puleo follows an account of the tragedy by covering the legal battles to determine who was at fault.  Although justice seems to be better served in Puleo's North End than in Harr's Woburn, Mass, the reader may be stunned at how little value the judge assigns to human life especially when compared to a more modern calculus.

This is an exteremly dramatic book for a historical account and a must read for Boston natives.
