The authors of the Nancy Drew Cookbook have cleverly and completely captured the essence of the Nancy Drew novels, as they still existed in the early 1970s (I understand Miss Drew has been significantly updated in recent years).

Most of the recipes look as if they were designed by a dietitian for a school cafeteria, but there are a few bright spots here and there, as well as many actual good cooking and entertaining tips.

I once held an Elvis party and tried to recreate Elvis' favorite foods.  This is the type of cookbook I used, one which offered essentially plain, homey food, not at all in accord with today's dietary fashions
