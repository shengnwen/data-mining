Did I enjoy this book?  I thought that it was fantastic.  Originally, I felt, Oh hum, 500 pages on a river,,boring.  After I started I literally could not put it down.  I felt that the historical portions on the politics were excellent.  The pictures enriched the reading.  And the topics on engineering river and water were outstanding.  These were topics that I would never have considered reading or thinking about and have added to new knowledge and stiumulated new interests
