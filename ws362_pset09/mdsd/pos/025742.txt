I had never heard of this book until a member of the AARP Bulletin Board posted that they had found it available and bought it for their grandchildren.  

Amazon's reviews gave this book glowing praise, therefore, I bought it for my 13 year old grandson.  When the book arrived I decided to read a few pages just to make sure it was something he might like.  I never put the book down!  I read the entire book, being careful not to bend the pages.  Oh! what a delightful story.  At 59 I was saying to myself, "Well, if he could do that, I wonder if this, or that could be done too?!?!"  I knew then that this book was perfect for anyone, young or old.  It's an easy to read book, and I'm only sorry I didn't order two, one for me, and one for my grandson!
