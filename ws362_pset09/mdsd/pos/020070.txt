So many study Bibles are from the dispensational school of theology, and it's great to have a Bible that is focused on the reformation truths.

I got the hardcover because I wasn't sure how I'd like this Bible, and if it ended up on the shelf, I wanted it to wear well.  However, it's quickly become my main Bible, as the notes are great, the translation is very readable, and the book headings and sidebars are very helpful.

My only complaint is what others have said; that this Bible doesn't have a map section in the back.  Don't know why they didn't add this, but it definitely is a hindrance to using this Bible as my only Bible
