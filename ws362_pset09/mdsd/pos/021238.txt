I was really impresed by the Idiot's Guide to low carbing. Where certain other low carb books are thinly veiled attempts to bash the lifestyle, the Idiot's Guide explains why this way of life is so healthy.

The book is primarily full of great low carb recipes. There are breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks, desserts, and even an entire section dedicated to kid-friendly meals.

These aren't obscure meals that take a gourmet to appreciate. They are quick, easy, and very tasty. You get a lightning chicken stew, almond oatmeal cookies, meatloaf, chicken marsala, and tostadas. There are meals for vegetarians, meals for steak-lovers, and everyone in between. 

There's also information on low carbing, if you somehow got this book without knowing what a low carb diet is about. There's background information about carbs, about how our modern diet is overloaded with sugar. It encourages you to eat fresh fruits and veggies, to find balance in your food
