The poetic language and tasteful suspense makes Jamaica Inn and Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier two of my favorite books. Jamaica Inn is a brilliant story, made even more mysterious by Tori Amos' song of the same name. It was her song about the book that made me seek out books by DuMaurier and once again Tori is genius. This was one of the best books I have ever read. Both the book and the song reveal the complexities and horrors of human behavior. DuMaurier also has a rich knowledge of the English countryside and uses fantastic imagery to transport the reader to the moors of Southern England
