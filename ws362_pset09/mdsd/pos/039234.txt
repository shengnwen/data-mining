This book was absolutely wonderful in preparing my 2 1/2 yr. old son to go  to the hospital to have his tonsils removed.  The book is filled will  real-life color photographs of what to expect during a hospital stay. It  really prepared my son in a realistic manner verses &quot;cartoon&quot; or  &quot;drawing&quot; style books.  Through the photos, he understood what a  hospital room looked like, wearing a gown, getting an armband, and seeing  Doctors and Nurses in their scrubs and masks. This book also pictured  medical equipment used for vitals, X-rays, IVs, and lab tests. By  describing the pictures to my son prior to his surgery, he was not afraid  at the hospital.  Additionally, this book is not directed at any particular  reason for being in the hospital, but rather what to expect when you are  there
