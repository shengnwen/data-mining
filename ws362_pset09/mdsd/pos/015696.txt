Awesome work...and I hope Marvelly will consider a sequel including even more teachers (Stephen Jourdain?  Byron Katie?  Neelam?), although this is a great representative sampling.  Not only are the interviews with these modern-day Advaitins at once engaging and penetrating, but Marvelly's chronicling of her own &quot;walk on the path&quot; of nondual understanding is thoughtful and touching, and deeply personal in a way I very much appreciate and relate to.  The interview with Pamela Wilson especially is like sitting with her in satsang; marvelously vivid.  This is must reading for anyone interested in timeless wisdom and spiritual self-reliance
