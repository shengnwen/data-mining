This is a very helpful book that introduces the reader to the basic contours of postmodernism in its cultural, historical and philosophical dimensions.  Grenz helpfully traces the ethos of the postmodern context, showing how it reacts against Enlightenment concepts of rationality.  He likewise examines the shift in philosphy of science that has taken place in the postmodern context, largely attributable to Kuhn.  He then spends two chapters chronicling the rise of modernity and the transition to postmodern.  Following this discussion, Grenz offers a basic portrait of crucial postmodern philosophers, Foucault, Derrida and Rorty.  Grenz concludes his book with a small chapter on the gospel in the postmodern context.

On the whole this is a helpful book that adequately introduces the reader to the basic issues, currents and philosophers of postmodernity.  Certainly some of Grenz's readings of Foucault and Derrida will be controversial (whose aren't?), but it is a helpful intro nonetheless.  It was also unfortunate that Grenz spent so little time on the gospel in the postmodern context.  Readers wanting more on this issue should consult Grenz's "Beyond Foundationalism", or for something more substanatial, the many works of Lesslie Newbigin
