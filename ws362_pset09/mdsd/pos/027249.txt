While it is true that Mrs. Bell writes her book from her Christian perspective, everyone who is interested in homeschooling can get loads of valuable information from this book.  She discloses early on that she will be speaking with a Christian voice and background so with that in mind it seems a pity to skip this well written resource.  Two thumbs up!  Love the resource guide and all of the fantastic further reading suggestions
