This volume by Rand and her allies at the time, Alan Greenspan, and Nathaniel Branden, is excellent. Rand's articles show how the only moral political and economic system is capitalism. Property rights, reason and rational thought are what has freed man from the shackles of mysticism, superstition, and religious tyranny. The best articles are Branden's "Alienation" in which he points out the fallacies of the anti modern ideals of Erich Fromm's " The Art of Loving". Fromm is exposed as an admirer of the Dark Ages and pines for the ideals of collectivism. Another great article is Rand's " The Roots of War" in which she condemns the Vietnam War and the draft. She rightly points out the futility of Vietnam and the slavery that the draft creates. She smashes the ideals of conservative collectivism in her article " Conservatism: An Obituary" by show the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of conservatism. She exposes the conservative worship of "tradition" and "order". She also ridicules the weak and sorry defenses that conservatives state for capitalism, and freedom. This little book has some of Rand's best writings and thoughts. A great buy for those that support capitialism and freedom
