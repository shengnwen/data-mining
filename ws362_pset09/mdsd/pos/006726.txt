I haven't read her first book yet, but I'm going to. I loved this book, and I read all the mysteries I can get my hands on. I've bought copies for three friends. Someone asked me why I read a mystery that has some gay characters. Frankly, I couldn't care less. These characters, all of them, are well drawn, mostly lovable, except the 'bad guys'of course, and the plot is gripping. It's magical, a little gory in spots, very spooky, and the setting is so vivid I want to visit Glastonbury. I can't wait until the next one in the series
