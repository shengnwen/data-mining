	The Kite Rider is a story about a boy, Haoyou, who goes through the pain of seeing his father die. Haoyou went to see his father off of the harbor and watched in horror as his father was put on the kite tester. His father died in the air. The man who killed Haoyou's father wanted to marry his mother. Haoyou's great uncle, Bo approved so Haoyou and his cousin Miping put him aboard a ship that was set to sail. Later that day  in the house of his great uncle, the Great Miao master of the Jade circus, offers Haoyou the chance to become a kite rider. Bo agreed  that it would be a great way  to earn money. Haoyou had no say in the matter and said he would only go if  Miping could come with him. The Miao agreed so they went to travel with the Jade circus. They have many adventures and find out the Miao's great secret. Haoyou  even got to perform  in front of  Kublai Khan himself.
	Haoyou has much talent he makes kites for a living  to support his mother and sister after his father died. He  stays calm when others would be panicking he trusts the spirits of his ancestors to take care of  him when he is up in the air.  It takes Haoyou  time to understand some things he is slow of mind.  He is always thinking, which his uncle says is bad, and gets himself  and his cousin into trouble more than once.
	Personally  I liked this book it is full of adventure and customs I have never heard of. This is a book that can teach you something not only  is for fun reading.  It is also my opinion that you could read this book over and over again and learn something new each time. Yes I would recommend this book to my friends
