Father Andrew Greeley, Supreme Seanchai of Chicago's SouthSide Irish and beyond, delights the reader with another brilliant episode of the fair fey Nuala Anne McGrail Coyne & friends & family.  Sure, but shouldn't you best begin at the beginning? It begins with *Irish Gold.* 

In *Irish Cream,* Fr Greeley has again interwoven a compelling  historical tale with the modern day trials and tribulations of the Coynes. But this time the historical tie-in is clumsy and the flips and flops back and forth are disconcerting - one would think especially for the reader unfamiliar with Fr. Greeley's conventions. And by now in the Greeley oeuvre, what with everyone making cameos in everyone else's serials, you best be reading Bishop Blackwood  ("Blackie") Ryan in the *Happy are ...* books and "the crazy O'Malleys" of *A Midwinter's Tale* etc.

So, what are ya doin' still sittin' there staring at your computer screen? Get reading!  

P.S.: Yo! Old White Men in Rome! Elect Father Greeley for Pope! You'd be amazed at the return of the abused, disenchanted & disenfranchised back to the pews and our tithes back to the  collection basket!
