Need a monster that no one has ever heard of?

Need a creepy crawly that comes at you from the far edges of imagination-and makes every bit of sense when it does?

This is no rehashed bestiary.  Rather, the bright minds at Sword and Sorcery Studios take the time to design entirely new beasts, monsters and creatures, then their in depth descriptions breathe life into their design.  

Do I like them all? Will I use them all? No.

But they all dazzle with creativity, and reward my investment of time. They all seem to suggest a special encounter of their own.

Perhaps one day, I will find a place in my world for each one. Until then, any time I need a fresh, vibrant creature like the bloodmare or the sentry crow, I know where to look.
