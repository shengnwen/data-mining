I just finished another Anne Tyler book that was written earlier in her career. Once again I feel like I've lived with another group of people/characters for the few weeks that it took to read this story. It was a slow read. I wished the first three quarters of this book flowed with the same dramatic intensity that the last quarter did. I didn't fully understand lead character Morgan until then. But maybe that's the point. Once the plot twisted the characters seemed to come into view more. All in all I enjoyed it and recommend it for Tyler fans
