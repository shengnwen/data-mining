I preface this review with an admission: any and all of Edith Wharton's works so far are like candy to me. Once I start one of her books, it will take quite a while before I put it down. 

Age of Innocence to me is like a good Monet painting. It is surreal, interesting and sad, and yet there are so many layers to it. How you interpret it and how you decipher it's layers, is the key to enjoying it. Her verse is also intricate, careful and precise. 

Note of caution: The movie is much better after you've read the book. There is great meaning in the pregnant stares and the social layers of society, something that is not easily expressed in a two hour long movie
