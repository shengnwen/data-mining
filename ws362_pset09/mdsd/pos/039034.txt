Intimate Weddings is beautifully designed, has been painstakingly researched, and is written with style and elegance. The book explains the rationale for having a small wedding, how to go about planning your wedding, setting a budget, creating an intimate ceremony, organizing a reception, planning indoor vs. outdoor receptions, choosing a theme, planning your honeymoon, second weddings, and preserving your wedding memories. Christina Friedrichsen challenges couples to question wedding traditions that may or may not work for them as they plan an intimate and memorable wedding: e.g. do you really want a receiving line? If you want to plan a simple but tasteful wedding, the resource directory at the back of this book will be invaluable to you in your research
