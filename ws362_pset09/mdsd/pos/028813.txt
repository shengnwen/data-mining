This is a book that needs to be on the shelf of anyone seriously studying the ancient Near East, with or without an interest in Biblical archaeology. It collects an enormous variety of ancient texts and inscriptions, trying to give the current "gold-standard" translations (with extensive footnoting discussing ambiguities, variants, and so on, and tying it in closely to all of the original literature on which the book is based). Some of the texts are things you can find in many sources, like the Epic of Gilgamesh or some of the Egyptian hymns; but this book collects an extraordinary range of things that you would normally need a giant research library to find, such as early Palestinian ostraka, a wide selection of Egyptian and Akkadian oracles and prophecies, and even a Sumerian lullaby.
