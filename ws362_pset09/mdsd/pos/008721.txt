As far as explaining warfare in the classical world, you really couldn't get a better book.  Its illustrations are clear and informative.  I originally found this book in my high school library and it took all my will power to keep from stealing it.  I've found that most books that expain famous battles do so in a manner that's often vague and leave much to the reader's interpretation.  This book shows how a battle came about - step by step.  Keep in mind that it doesn't especially delve in the political/social mechanisms of why the battle started, but that isn't necessary considering that so many other books cover those topics sufficiently
