This is a great book for all those interested in making their own skincare and bodycare products. The recipes are very easy to follow and all the products I've made have come out wonderfully. I have noticed a definite  improvement in my skin. There is also a great reference guide to all the  products that are used. I would defintely recommend this book to anyone,  from the beginner to the advanced
