I found this book delightful!  I liked and identified with the main character, Isabel Dalhousie, especially as she sought to do the right thing even when all others advised her against any action.  The book opens with Isabel attending a concert and a young man falls from the balcony of the concert hall to his death.  It is ruled an accident but something keeps nagging at Isabel that there was more to it than that.  Isabel uses her talent as a philospher to help her uncover the truth behind the young man's death.  

The characters in the book are amusing, self-centered, and true-to-life in many ways.  Isabel is a well drawn character with real flaws as are the other major characters in this novel.  The writing is very detailed which made me feel like I was actually in Edinburgh.  Isabel was my favorite character of course but her housekeeper Grace comes in second.  What a delight it was to hear what came from Grace's mouth.

This book is not as light or easy as his Ladies' Detective Agency books but it is a wonderful read nonetheless.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I look forward to reading his second book in this series
