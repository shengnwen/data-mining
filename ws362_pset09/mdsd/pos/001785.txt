    The epilogue of the book brings the dramatic storytelling and allure of the initial years of high altitude spying to a screeching halt when the author makes a futile effort to connect the 1950's and 60's to our post 9-11 world.  He believes that "terrorists are everything Soviet military forces were not," and that civilian and military intelligence analysts were crutched by the availability of high-resolution pictures vice experienced Human Intelligence operatives in the world's hot spots (pg. 361).  This loosely formulated conclusion seems to be as cockamamie as blaming the "smart" bombs dropped from B-1's and B-52's for not homing in on and killing terrorists like Osama bin Laden.

    Every technology has its place.  But, it's like comparing apples and oranges when it comes to the intelligence disciplines.  Human operatives have a different focus than imagery intelligence, and can really give a ground truth perspective of the political, emotional, and potential hostilities of a situation.  If Taubman feels that the lack of CIA and other agents on the ground in places like Afghanistan and Iraq were the crux of the problem, then he could have addressed such in a different forum than this very comprehensive effort on the history of United States air and space-borne reconnaissance.
