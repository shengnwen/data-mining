You've heard many times that "Seinfeld" was "a show about nothing."  That's pretty much what you get here...

Kubrick loathed publicity and hated doing interviews even more.  Since he himself had been a photojournalist, of sorts, before starting his career making movies, this is a little paradoxical, but understandable.

I don't doubt that just about every documented Kubrick interview ever done is, in some way, represented in this book - but it still ends up a mighty slim volume.  Students of Kubrick will not learn much here that has not already been cited, in secondary source, in the great number of other Kubrick "biographies" and critical treatises.

And you cannot help believing that this is exactly what Kubrick wanted.  Over and over again, in this book itself, he insists that the movies he made were to stand on their own merits.  Talking about movies meant nothing to him - making them was everything
