I am always amazed how ordinary Americans who say they believe in education find that those who are educated are members of an "elite."  As if that meant something bad. Hofstadter unveils our schizophrenia over being educated and our parallel discourse of how we feel that it is undemocratic (in the old sense of the word)to be "smarter" than others because of "book learning."  It is an old mistrust, yet we flock to colleges and universities anyway to do exactly that. Very strange conflicts run through American culture when we raise the old fear of being "better than others" because we have received an education. Excellent and insightful book, and still relevant today
