I read this book in 1980, and each chapter of it still stands out in my mind in glittering bas-relief against all I read before or have read since. What stands out the most, however, is that my thinking changed after reading this book. Everything since reading it has been inevitably processed through its filter, which has quite simply changed my life. Perhaps a first-reading today would not have an equal effect; in 1980 it was timely. Things we take for granted now were difficult to conceptualize then--the internet, for instance. But I'll leave it for contemporary readers to decide whether G�del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid is as eternal as the title claims. For me, the answer is a resounding yes. I can say without doubt that my life would have been different if I had not read it at that time. 

Ok, if it's so great, then what is it that makes it so? Trying to describe what is great about this book is like trying to say what is great about a particular Bach Fugue, or an Escher print. A fugue doesn't typically have a great melody. The rhythm can be monotonous and predictable. You know where it begins and where it will end up, and the subjects will enter on cue and not deviate from their lines. Escher's prints, similarly, are composed of mediocre representations of their subjects. Shading is not sublime, some of the features may be grotesque. What is it, then, that makes that fugue or that print great? Ahhh... that's the subject of this book, and in beautifully crafted recursion, its own principles apply equally to itself. 

You will come away with an understanding of the underlying principles of intelligence, beauty, craft, logic, and universal principles of creation. A deeper appreciation for those things does not necessarily mean a simpler or easier means of describing same. In fact, it may be the opposite, sort of "the more you know, the more you know you don't know." This confrontation with, and participation in, the infinite seems to be the root of our longing--a sense that Bach, Escher, and G�del weaved intuitively into their own work without feeling compelled to explain. 

So, rather than expect to come away from this book with the answers to the big quiz of life, I would say what one is more likely to find is a deepening of "mu," a rendering of knowledge into its proper place where "answers" in the Western sense dissolve into the questions in a deepening spiral of association and metaphor to the point at which one sees so many possibilities that the original question loses its significance. So is it nirvana? Not this book. But one may get caught up in the craft of the author and his inspirations to the point that one might feel lifted up and deposited at the trailhead of a new path, and the best that one can expect in this life is a new, sublime path. I think Hofstadter would agree that nirvana, should it exist, is the path, not the destination, and this book may well prove the author to be a willing bodhisattva.
