This book suggests many creative ways to make your wedding reception fun and unique.  The author describes 4 weddings (one for each season) thoroughly and with an artist's eye for detail and color.  She also provides an extensive index for all aspects of reception preparation and planning.  The pictures vividly display the character of each wedding, bringing them to life.  I would have prefered some extra examples with illustrations of decorationg ideas for each season that were not part of the featured wedding. It would have been nice to have some more practical examples of possibilities.  The featured weddings are gorgeous but, for people like myself, a bit out of reach financially.  Surely, one can put a creative, unique twist on some less eccentric styles to make them equally as special, beautiful and perfect for any wedding
