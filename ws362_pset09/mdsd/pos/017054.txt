A lot of American readers may be put off by the rather dryly literate writing style of this British writer, but I would urge them to stick it out for a deep and true read, with an ending that is uplifting, but as painful  and complex as life itself. As one who grew up with the benefit of an  idealistic liberal education and travelled the world widely and deeply, and  like the protoganists of this book found that the almost diefied third  world races are no less free of the capacity to do evil than white  westerners, this novel had a brave ring of truth. In fact, it is so against  the grain that I'm surprised it wasn't condemned by the liberal elites who  write most of the book reviews. A different view of the missionary  experience, as well as Mantel's classical prose and subtly unfolding plot  make an interesting antidote to the simplistically politically correct and  gimmickally narrated bestseller, Barbara Kinsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood  Bible.&quot; This is one of the few books I've read in recent years that  had something new and original to say
