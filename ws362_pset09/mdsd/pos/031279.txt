Two-ex Texas Ranger turned rancher took 500 cows and 200 horses up to Montana.  They did this so one of the ex-Rangers Woodrow F. Call's son could have a place to live after they built the house up in Mpntana.  Not long after Woodrow Call, Augutus McCrae and Jake Spoon left to go ahead and start to build the house and part of the ranch, they were attacked by a Band of Indians.  They fought the Indians off but Jake was wounded badly.  About 5 months after they left to build the ranch and house, they came back to get the horses and cattle and take them back to Montana.  They lived there for 6 years until the Indians over ran the place and every one was killed.  Larry McMurtrywrote 21 books, 2 collections of essays and 31 screenplays.  I enjoyed this book because I like westerns
