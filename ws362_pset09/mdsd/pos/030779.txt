Edna St. Vincent Millay, Dorothy Parker, Zelda Fitzergerald, and Edna Ferber are perfect exemplars of New York in 1920s and Marion Meade's book, Bobbed Hair and Bathtub Gin, captures that time in a somewhat arbitraryly episodic fashion.  This is not the place to come to get a good biography of any one of these women (Marion Meade's book on Dorothy Parker is a delightful place to begin for that) nor does it capture its time period as well as some other similar books (To Be Young Was Very Heaven about women in New York before the First World War) but there is still great delight to be found in these pages as one skims through the lives of these rather amazing women.  If there is not always much bobbed hair as promised, it is made up for by great heaping quantites of bathtub gin, among many other libations.  As well as many romances, a few abortions, great literary successful, and some professional failures.  It was a time and it still makes for a wonderful read
