I thought I had tired of Cadfael, but the book suddenly sat there on a shelf - the only new book that seemed to call my name, so I tried, and she did it again. The storyline is close to the rest of the books in the  series, a combination of a mystey and a lovestorey. This time with a  surprising conclusion. Resume: there is (as usual) a fair near the convent,  pilgrims come to the fair because the saint (from Morbid taste for bones)is  beeing moved to her permanet resting place. Among the pilgrims a pair of  men travelling together, one a pilgrim the other his companion and a small  family consisting of brother, sister and aunt. These five plus Cadfael are  the main charecters.  We get a miracle, some political intrigue, a small  love story and a murder all in a readable prose. It is well worth the time  and money
