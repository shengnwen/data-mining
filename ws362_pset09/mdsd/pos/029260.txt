As a married woman I was able to take an underground tour of the working mine my husband, father, and brothers worked at.  I was truly humbled from then on as to how that paycheck came to be.
     In the Deep Dark Gregg Olsen has captured not only the Sunshine disaster but the people who were most directly effected by it. Brilliant, riviting and compelling to the point of not being able to put it down; I was drawn into the struggles of the people who's names might be different than of those I'd known; but I recognized every one of them!
     The American public doesn't give a damn about the man that produces the raw materials that give him comfort.  With this book perhaps one or two might stop and think at least for a minute.   Thanks Mr. Olse
