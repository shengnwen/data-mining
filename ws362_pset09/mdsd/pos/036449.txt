I bought this Bible for my personal study and it is a great resource. I enjoy reading the study information they provide as it gives you a deeper look into the times and customs as well as geography. It can be a little distracting though as sometimes I find myself reading the supplemental information more that I am reading the text of the Bible itself. The leather is not as soft as I thought it would be and when I received it one of the pages had been cut oddly at the factory. Overall a good product
