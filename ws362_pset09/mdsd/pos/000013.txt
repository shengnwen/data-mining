Freya, a British transplant living a vagabond existence in Manhattan and Jack, a southern trust-fund baby and would be novelist, have been best friends for years. After Freya's latest relationship disaster, Jack lets her move in with him temporarily. Soon, the two begin to get on each other's nerves, and sabotage each other's new relationships. She's disgusted that he dates really young women, including one of his workshop students (with a pierced tongue no less...); he's tired of her inflexible attitude about others.

Freya is searching desperately to find a new man to take to her conniving step-sister's English wedding. After meeting a lot of Mr. Wrong's and managing to humiliate herself at almost every turn, she asks Jack to accompany her. After discovering he's going to be cut off by his womanizing father, Jack decides to take a break from his writer's block and agrees to go to England as her significant other. While in England, Jack and Freya's relationship suddenly takes a different turn, as the two discover that they have unresolved feelings for each other that they never explored. And Jack's act of betrayal tests the limits of their friendship.

I liked the story, the secondary characters, and Sisman's witty writing style. But I didn't like the ambiguous ending. After 400 pages, I wanted closure.
