Well I concur with another reviewer here, book was enough of a base for me to pass the CLEP test. However, many questions on the actual test referred to periods, antebellum, that were not listed in this book. It was extremely helpful to read the detailed answers in the back after missing a question or just for more in depth knowledge of the subject. Also their were a lot of questions on women's rights and activists that were just skimmed over in the book. If you just want to pass the test, this book would probably be enough as long as you study it well
