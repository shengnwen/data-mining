As a naturopath who works with many allergic and environmentally sensitive patients, I wholeheartedly recommend this book.  In great depth, Dr. Rapp talks about the multiple factors that are causing so much ill health and suffering in our toxic world. Readers will find the author to be kind, compassionate and practical with "nuts and bolts" tips. She was a pioneer in this field and in this book shows she is at the top of her game.  I hope she'll do a cookbook next as so many of the existing allergy cookbooks contain so much poor information,  Dr. Rapp has a great website [...].
