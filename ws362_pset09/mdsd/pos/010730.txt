This is at its most simply a story about the Cars movie so don't expect anything new here.  When you can get your child interested in reading though, it's worth every penny.
From an arrogant do-it alone McQueen, to learning respect in Radiator Springs, and to winning in spirit at the Piston Cup it's all here.  Here for mommy or daddy to read at bedtime (or anytime or that matter)!

A big beautiful well illustrated book for your Cars fan!
