This book has good demonstrations for the painting of flowers and vegetables.  In it Mrs. Walsh tells a little about her own personal preferences for painting, her studio, etc., making it fun to read.  I found  this information very useful.  There are many examples on how to paint the  various types of fruits and vegetables, and a variety of flowers as well.   The instruction makes one not afraid to try it!  I am a visual learner, and  this book met that need
