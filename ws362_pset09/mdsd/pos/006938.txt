You can argue all you want about qualifications of Mr. Cherniske.  But I will say that my daily caffiene intake was from 600-1100mg a day for years, I quit cold turkey about a month before I started reading the book...and the withdrawal was incredible....headaches, shakes, irritable beyond belief.  You can't say this isn't an additive drug while you're slugging down four or more startbucks coffees a day.  

For months and months I've had hard a time sleeping, waking up in the morning feeling like I have no energy at all.  Within two weeks of quitting caffien, I feel great.  I still go to bed at 11:30-midnight and get up the same time at 5:45am, yet in the morning I can now get up without any problems and I'm awake the whole day without fatigue, feeling more energized.  I CHANGED NOTHING ELSE IN MY DIET OR ROUTINE.  I still eat the same stuff as before and have not started exorcizing, or most of all...have taken NONE of the suggested suppliments in the book.  The only thing I did was stop drinking coffee/coke and started drinking more water.

So save yourself a few bucks if you don't want to buy the book, but do yourself a favor and cut out caffiene.  The withdrawal sucks, but it doesn't last for ever.  If anything once you get through it, it will give you reason to stay away from caffeine.
