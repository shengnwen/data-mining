Whether navigating the harrowing world of snipers and anti-snipers in war-torn Sarajevo, or the perilous world of his own psyche, John Falk writes with wit, humor, and insight.  

Falk had the guts to walk away from a cushy upper-middle-class life and into the most dangerous place on the planet.  Afflicted by depression, he subjected himself to a kind of shock-treatment by journeying to Sarajevo in the hopes of becoming a freelance journalist.  Once he settled in, with a monster stash of Zoloft in his bindle, Falk became close with the family who took him in as a boarder.  While managing to stay alive and sane in a truly hellish battle zone, Falk sussed out a war story worthy of Heller or Vonnegut and became a successful writer.  More importantly, however, he dedicated himself to helping people who badly needed it, and this personal story is the heart of the book.
