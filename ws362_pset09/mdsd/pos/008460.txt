As a whole everyone felt that this book was EXCELLENT!  The group felt that Andrew could be blamed for the outcome of the book because he should have followed his instincts and noticed the signs from the beginning.  The female character, Mika, showed all of the signs that she was crazy from their first date.  The end of the story revealed that Andrew was actually a reincarnated spirit of Mark Justice, which also happened to be Mika's first love.   

The group also discussed the notion of `soul mates' and if there is one mate that is destined for everyone. The female character, Mika, believed that Andrew was her soul mate because she could see it in his eyes with her own special powers.  The group felt that everyone does have a soul mate but may not realize it or may not meet that special person within their lifetime.  

The group discussed the meaning behind the title of the book and felt that a shadow could also mean that someone is always watching you and could also be perceived as a ghost.  

They all agreed that the storyline could possibly be extended into sequel through Andrew's father and stepmother, June.  Only because there were some questions that were left unanswered like: where did the special powers come from? What was in the upper room?
