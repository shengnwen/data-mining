The Brussats have presented us with a real winner. Their book is not just another interesting, inspirational collection of advice and philosophy, but instead a very practical reference that I can use frequently in my every  day life. And not just for myself but with my clients as well. Particularly  easy to use because of it's coherent, straight forward format that runs  throughout the book, it offers exercises and information that help me  impart, to myself and others, ways for living a grateful, gracious, life,  in which difficult circumstances, disappointments, pain,etc., may be  transformed, even if only for a few moments, so we can catch a glimpse of  the light and restore our faith. This is genuinely a major accomplishment.  The book has not yet made it to my book shelf though I bought it when it  first came out in early winter. It stays out on my desk at all times so  that I can refer to it everyday. I want to say thank you and bravo. I look  forward to Maryanne and Frederick Brussats next star turn in publishing
