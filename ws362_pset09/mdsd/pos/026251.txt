The Five Tibetans are not a "quick fix" for those of you who want some kind of overnight transformation.  I recently restarted the Five Tibetans (after a few years of not doing them) and after 2 weeks, am feeling an increased energy and better sleep patterns.  The Five Tibetans don't take long to do and you don't need any equipment. Some of the other reviewers have had problems with nausa from the spinning rite - my advice is to do fewer (and slower!) repititions.  

The Five Tibetans are also a great compliment to other activities, whether it be strength training, cardio, etc.  Fitness is a way of life, and one must decide if one will dedicate themselves to get some form of activity in every day - this is key to good health, weight loss and a higher quality of life
