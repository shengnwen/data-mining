I completely enjoyed this book, it is informative, practical, and consistently puts forth the message that ANYONE can build a home.  I bought some acreage and have started my own.  When I get overwhelmed, I reread this book, step back, and break it down into smaller steps.  One of the easiest, most encouraging books I've read on any subject, and the best of the dozen books I've read on this subject
