A strange new drug is flooding through New York called Berzerk that gives you an incredible high that can easily descend into a murderous rage.   Jack is hired by a medical researcher to investigate her bosses apparent links to a known underworld figure, convinced that her boss is somehow being blackmailed.  At the same time he is also hired by another man who is determined to get bloody revenge on the same underworld figure.

Before the story is over Jack will find Berzerk has a closer acquaintance to both his clients and his adventures in THE TOMB than he would have wished.  This novel is more uneven in pace than the previous books, but it winds together to a good conclusion.  The weirdness of The Otherness also rears its ugly head as Jack is baffled as to how he keeps running into its influence.

The Otherness gives these books a slightly X Files flavour, but Jack is such an engaging character that I'm still looking forward to the next book in this series.
