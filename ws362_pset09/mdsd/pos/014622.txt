With this book, I started at the first fall menu and started cooking my way through it. It's been totally doable. The recipes are so simple and laid out with directions of what to do first, second etc. that preparing entire meals with dessert gets faster with time. (She includes a healthy dessert in most of them.) I have noticed a couple mismarkings that would've affected the whole dish if I hadn't caught them, and while some of the recipes are really wonderful, others are just plain yuck! (I know it's health food but sometimes it goes too far!) As for flavor, it's definitely on the side of the old "healthy" stuff. If you're looking for the creative haute-cuisine vegetarian/vegan stuff you can find today, this is not it. However, the meals make me feel good and satisfied. They are so balanced, I find I don't crave sweets afterwards. The suggestions for what to do with the leftovers are really useful. Also, if you are nervous (as I was) about using all of these strange ingredients, the directions are simple enough that you'll become a pro in no time. One more thing - my complexion has really improved since I started using this book
