One of the funniest books i have ever read!  when i first started reading Terry Pratchett's Discworld Series i couldn't believe i had gone through my life without knowing his books were out there.  i am an ultimate film fan and i cracked up at all the references.  this was to movie fans what Soul Music was to music lovers.  Discworld is for everyone who loves mystery, adventure, and above all, a good laugh
