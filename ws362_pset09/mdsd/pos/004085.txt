I would recommend this book to all elementary school teachers. The pictures are a little less colorful, but the content is excellent. We ended up writing there's an end in Brenda and other books. Kitchen-no end in  sink, no end in stove, but there's an end in blender. Fast Food Place- No  end in Happy Meal at McDonalds, no end in the ice cream sundae at Dairy  queen, but there's an end in Chicken Tenders at Burger king, etc. etc
