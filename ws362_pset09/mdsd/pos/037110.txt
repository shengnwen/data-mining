I aggree with the other reader when he says that this is indeed a very useful book and one that I consult regularly when looking for quick answers to some of my questions. I personally like the color-matching guide, which helps you select what to plant based on the color of the flowers and on the plant's height. However, I think this book lacks some information on which annuals to plant close to your perennials (very few gardens that I know of contain only perennials). I also dislike the fact that the section on different species is organized by their scientific names rather than list them by their common names, which makes me constantly have to go to the index to find where the entry for a specific plant is. How many people know the Latin name for common species such as Shasta Daisies, Black-eyed Susans and Day Lillies??
