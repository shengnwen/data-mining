This is a book on how to build armor.  Tools, techniques, materials, workspace needed, cost estimates are all part of it.  I make leather armor for re-enactors, so much of what was taught here was not directly applicable.  However, there are chapters on how to measure, pattern, and cut.  These are useful even if the material used isn't metal but leather.  There are even some basic instructions on leatherworking.  Overall, a pretty straightforward work.  I recommend it for anyone who is interested in armor construction, collecting, or re-enacting.
