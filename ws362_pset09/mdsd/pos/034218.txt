When I began reading the book, I thought it was a complete waste of money- the begining was just aweful. BUT, after a while it gets so interesting that I did not want to put it down. I give it 4 and not 5 only becaUSE you cannot begin a book that is full of good stuff with the most boring stuff:  disappoint people with the first chapter- its a waste of a great book since poeple will not want to keep reading it!
