This book is full of excellent information for the novice and/or the expert. Also included are Minitab applications which I found to be extremely helpful. This is not easy reading but for any student or advocate of the Six Sigma initiative, it is worth the money. I find it a useful tool for learning, research, or reference. With the proper useage, this book can help make the novice an expert. Well done
