Pearl S. Buck's &quot;East Wind: West Wind&quot; tells the life story of a traditional Chinese woman through her inner thoughts and feelings in an interesting manner. The woman, who was betrothed to a Chinese man before birth, later finds herself married the man, who has studied in America to become a doctor. Throughout the book, the woman represents stiff Chinese traditions while the man represents more modern and western beliefs.  Relying on her traditional upbringing, the women attempts to please her husband by being his servant.  However, he tries to change her view of what marriage should be: an equal partnership and not a servant and master relationship.  Throughout the book, the couple strives to overcome various trials and ordeals that deal with changing traditions.  In my opinion, &quot;East Wind: West Wind&quot; attempts to tackle the implicit battle between old, established traditions and more modern ideas; it also shows the conflicts between Eastern ideology and Western ideology. Overall, the book is a wonderful insight into the ancient cultural practices of China and how well they do or do not mingle with modern culture. &quot;East Wind: West Wind&quot; is a delightful and easy book to read, and it can be considered on of Pearl S. Buck's best works
