Unlike the fawning bios by Ayn Rand "disciples", this bio gives you a fair and balanced story of the life of Ayn Rand. Instead of presenting her as some super-guru and putting her on a high pedestal, this shows her in all her humanity, and shows that Rand, like the rest of us, was just as fallible, just as irrational. She was cruel as well as kind, rational as well as wildly irrational. Good as well as bad. 

Branden did a fabulous job at writing Rand's story.

Highly recommended - especially for those Rand fans who refuse to see that Ayn Rand was first and foremost a human being
