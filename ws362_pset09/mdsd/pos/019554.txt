In this day and age most people do not want to read about their Dark Nights of the Soul. We have a medical industry that does not want you to read this book. We have politicans who want to keep you in a constant state of fear who do not want you to read this book. And we have an entertainment and media industry which does not want you to read this book. For to read it is to know that the fear that they generate, the messages they try to stick us with, and the palliatives that they offer to assuage it don't work. Desperately wanting us to believe that life falls into their three act framework they do what they can to have us accept this souless narrative as our map to happiness, health and good fortune. But a few abberations slip through. Dark Nights of the Soul is one.

This is a significant work. A primer for life and dealing with its natural ebb and flow. If you don't acknowledge the foundation of the book then you can't understand that the dark nights that we think are there to tear us down are really there to transform us.

This book will change how to think and how you embrace life. It will challenge your ideas about disease, anger, aging, and even happiness. It makes connections between your body, mind and soul that you previously might have believed only lightly touch each other. It will or should help you to understand that a textured life is not about constantly walking around with an insipid smile on your face and saying 'feeling great' when someone asks.

If there is a fault with the book it is that it is too honest and refuses to sugar coat its message. And in that alone it will be missed by a significant majority that absolutely needs to read this.

Dark Nights should be on everyones list. Read it
