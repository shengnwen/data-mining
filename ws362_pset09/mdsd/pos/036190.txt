I read Charles Patterson's "Eternal Treblinka" in preparation for seeing him at our 50th reunion from Kent School. This powerful examination of the relationship between man's cruelty to animals as it relates to man's cruelty to fellow humans such as in the Holocaust is not for the faint-hearted. This extremely well-written and researched book is eminently readable and Charlie's passion for the subject matter shines through on each page.
