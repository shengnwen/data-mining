Dr. Hardin's book is a powerful book that presents information vital to healing the wounds inflicted on gays and lesbians, both by society and by individuals, in a manner that is friendly, accessible and eminently usable  without compromising on the complexity of the topic.  The respect with  which the subjects of his book and the readers are treated is healing in  and of itself.  This book is a must read for all gays and lesbians, their  family, friends and coworkers and anyone interested in preventing the  damage inflicted on individuals simply because of their sexual orientation.   It speaks indirectly as well to members of other groups who likewise  suffer discrimination because of group membership.  As a woman, in a male  dominated society, I found much of relevance to my own situation in his  book.  This book is an easy, accessible read whose implications and  potential to better the lives of its readers are  profound and anything but  simplistic.  I highly recommend it
