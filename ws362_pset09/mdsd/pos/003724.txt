I've long been a fan of Dick Francis, since he first began writing in the 60s. His earlier books were my favorites, as I loved the milieu of the steeplechasing world. I loved some of his later works too, but was saddened as the scene moved further and further from the racing world. 

And much as I have loved Francis I found some of his later works to be so dreadful as to be almost unbearable. Just *thinking* about 10-Lb. Penalty still makes me shudder. 

But because I'm a long-time fan I just had to give this book a try, and was quite pleasant surprised. I loved the return of racing front-and-center. The writing was the crisp, clean, classic Francis writing of old. The style reminded me so much of the earlier novels I loved. 

Sid Halley was never a particularly favorite character of mine, and I've often wished Francis had chosen someone else to make multiple appearances. There are various continuity lapses here. Early on Halley refers several times to his "widowed" mother, even though we know from previous books that she was never married due to her fiance's death just days before the wedding, and in fact Halley evens repeats that again later on in this story. 

Anfd with each Halley book we seem to lose complete sight of characters who were important in the previous books. I still want to know whatever became of Zanna Martin from the first Halley book - probably one of my favorite characters. 

But overall I was unexpectedly delighted with this book.
