At B'Vale high school they have clicks, so as a student you know where you fit. Simon Glass was the nerd, no one liked him and everyone mad fun of him. Rob Haynes a new kid who in a matter of days shot up the social ladder (which in high school isn't so easy) right up to the most poplular kid in school. Lance Ansley had won every popularity contest since kindergarden, until Rob Haynes showed up and took over. One day Rob came up with the brilliant idea to make Simon Glass "class favorite". So Rob and his three buddies Young, Bob, and Coop take Simon under their wings and show him how to be mr. popularity. They take him shopping for new clothes, get him a new haircut, and they show him how to act. As time goes on they four guys learn Simon doesn't take every order he is given, he has some fight in him. Which the other three do everything that Rob tells them to do, with no question. Time goes by and Young resents Simon more and more, Coop likes Simon yet hates him. Bob is indifferent until Simon makes a comment at the end of the book that takes Bob's anger and drives it over the edge. Rob gets aggrivated when the plan doesn't go exactly his way. So when Simon starts not listening Rob bottles up his aggrivation until he blows up. He lets all his anger out after the favorites dance, at the dance Simon went behind Robs back and messed with the voting. That night didn't end well for Simon.
     The thing i liked most about the book was you knew from the beginning that Rob, Bob, Young, and Coop end up killing Simon. You don't know how, why, or even when you just know he dies. Thats what got me reading the book, I wanted to know the details. It's a fascinating book with a suspenseful ending. It shows the extremes of the high school clicks and what people will do to get their way. All in all this book is a great read and i recommend the book to anyone who's  atleast in high school
