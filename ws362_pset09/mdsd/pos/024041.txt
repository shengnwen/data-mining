I loved reading this book, matter of fact I don't think I put it down til I was finished. For people unfamiliar with Beatle hysteria, it might seem a little odd, but I remember my friend and I going through those &quot;clues&quot; and some things were truly bizarre. We wore out records playing them backwards. We searched through photos with magnifying glasses. I only gave it 4 stars, perhaps unfairly, because I remember some &quot;clues&quot; that aren't in the book. Maybe every area of the country had it's own &quot;clues?&quot; If you know what people mean by &quot;Turn Me On Dead Man&quot; you'll love this
