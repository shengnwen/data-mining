This book is also a bestseller in Japan.  Here someone called it &quot;The only textbook now available that broadly explains accounting figures in the valuation model of the firm&quot;. This is a good book for beginners.  Although the contents might be somewhat easy, the order in which it is  written is very meaningful. You will probably have read everything in this  book somewhere else, but certainly not in this order !   The importance of  the ideas in this book go beyond its contents !
