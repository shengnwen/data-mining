ZZ Packer's short story collection was an enjoyable read for me. She takes on some territory that's outside the norm for contemporary black fiction. Several of her characters originate from Baltimore, but many go very far afield. Stories that stick out for me dealt with a girl scout troup from the city seeking to battle with a white troup from the suburbs and a twist coming in the story. An interesting story also dealt with a woman from Baltimore who seeks refuge in Japan and struggles in unforseen ways. 

Several of the characters in this book left me wanting to know more about them, and I hope she'll do a novel to build on this promising start.
