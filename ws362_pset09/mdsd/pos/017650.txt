The reviews so far are quickly turning into a debate over suitablility of training types, crossover of athletic capacity and etc.  This section is for reviews.

This book will teach you how to lift in the Olympic Style, pure and simple.  This would be a supreme training tool in conjunction with an olympic lifting coach, but is very good on its own.  Without a trainer, and using this book, I went from no confidence to snatching and clean and jerking.

The author does not at any point say that olympic lifting is the be-all and end-all of athletic training, but states that olympic lifting can play a major role in preparation for sport.  Thus, the book achieves exactly what it says it will: teach the reader olympic lifting, and how to apply it to sports
