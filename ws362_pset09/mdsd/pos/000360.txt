THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT is silly, insipid and over the top. A mess of a book. But an enjoyable mess. So much so it is unputdownable. Sheldon never falters from his high-gloss, nonstop suspense formula and delivers the melodrama goods with panache and style. His unidimensional characters may go through every impossible situation known to man but, boy, are the chapters engrossing. His scenes are as tight as his heroines' perfect attributes. He may not have written the All-American novel, but he has winningly delivered a bubble gum treat worthy of any beach read seeker.-----Martin Boucher
