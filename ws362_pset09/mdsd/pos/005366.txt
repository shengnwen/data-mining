Arthur C Clarke, the archrival of Issac Asimov has been well known by the author of 2001 Time Odyssey which was made into a cult film in 1967. He wrote great many excellent science fiction books which represent what we call "hard-core sci-fi books" based upon state-of-the-art modern technology and theories.

Most of his recent books, however, are the collaborated ones among which make us wonder why the author's name was put into at all.

This particular one he collaborates with Stephen Baxter known by his works of Manihold series. Among the collaborated efforts including Rama series, this one well picks the prume of Clark's past works such as Space Odyssey series and Rama series. 

The very idea of patchwork of historical eras and appearance of historical great heroes Alexander the Great and Chengis Khan is very exciting and one would want more of the heroes such as Napoleon, Nobunaga Oda or well-known ancient Chinese strategist Zhuge Liang. And Lucy the man-ape just reminds me of the introductory part of 2001. 

I hope this one will be further developed into TV series and let us enjoy the crossroads of different eras further.

Verdict: Well in tune with Clarke's pet theme on Extra-Terrestial intervention.
