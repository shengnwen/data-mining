 I thought the book was a bit draggy.  But as a Jewish conservative woman. I thought it was interesting in the everyday life,in medieval France.  How traditional woman were treated in Judiasm, but this is historical fiction so who knows where the history ends and the fiction begins and visa versa.
  It did make me want to know about jewish law. 

  I did think it was interesting how the Jews and the gentiles got along.  How well the french jews were treated during that time.  What I found interesting is I never realized how much supersticion there was in the jewish faith, unless it came from the secular world and intertwined.  I did enjoy the book on these few points. I did enjoy how  Rashi's daughter may have been treated as a talmud scholar.  When the mother argued with Rashi that something terrible would happen if they became scholars. Also,  How Joheved was treated by the husband and how they were treated by the husband, and it had to be kept secret
