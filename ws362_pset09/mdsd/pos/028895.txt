Sharansky's autobiography is one of the most compelling works of literature that I have read.  This is literature - it made me pause to  think and reflect on what he said frequently, and my copy is well-thumbed.   The story is of a spiritual journey, as the young Sharansky's awareness of  his Jewishness de-Sovietizes him and leads him into the Gulag - willingly,  as he forknew the risks of protesting Soviet emmigration policy.  His  voluntary civil disobedience seperated him from his bride, Avital,  physically for a decade, but the growing intensity of the spiritual forces  working within and through him bonded them ever more securely.  The moral  courage demonstrated by one of the most celebrated of the Refusniks is  evident on nearly every page.  The spiritual uplift that Sharansky found  came from his faith, and from reading the classics, one of the few  liberties permitted him in the Gulag.  (Looted libraries and personal  collections left the prison system well-stocked for this purpose.) The  comments on how he was encouraged by his encounter with Aristophanes, when  he understood the connection between himself and a character in a 2,500  play through a joke that he finally 'got,'are among the most uplifting in  the book.  Sharansky recounts how that joke opened a floodgate in his mind,  through which came pouring the voices of Rabelais, Cerevantes and other  great classics, reminding him of his humanity and the ways of man.  The  climatic chapter, &quot;The Interconnection of Souls,&quot; should be  re-read many times.   -Lloyd A. Conwa
