I first found out about this book when my son came home with it from the elem. school library on their class' library day. He is 6 yrs old and loves to try to use paper to trace over the cars & trucks in the book.  Older kids could probably try to draw it freehand from the picture.  It really shows pretty much step by step to drawing all sorts of these things.  This has led to my son drawing more and improved his fine motor skills, including handwriting.  Partly because of this, he got a Crayola Light Up Trace Desk for Christmas that has vehicle stencils and he is still drawing . .
