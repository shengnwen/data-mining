	It's always a treat to hear a fresh voice, and in this case a double pleasure because as best as I can recall I've not heard any other narrations by Renee Raudman.  She offers a thoughtful, appealing reading of Laura Dave's debut novel.

	Ms. Dave has created a heroine in a quandary.  Emma Everett had both second thoughts and cold feet before her wedding to Matt.  Without explanation or adieu she left him sound asleep in a Rhode Island motel.  From there she went to work in a bait and tackle shop ostensibly to shoot a documentary about the wives of fishermen who waited for their men to return.

	Now, three years have passed and she's headed back to New York City for her older brother's wedding.  Josh has always been her hero so it's a bit of a shock when she finds that he, too, is having second thoughts about his upcoming nuptials.  Actually, his thoughts are mostly filled with another woman, a single mom to whom he is not engaged.

	As Emma tries to help Josh make the right decision, she also learns some things about herself.

	A promising debut novel finely read.
