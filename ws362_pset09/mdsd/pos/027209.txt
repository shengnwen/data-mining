This book has completely educated me on what my eleven-year old son needs to know for his 6th year.  I have read the book and can say that if everyone in the country knew everything in this book we would all be better off.  As a matter of fact, I know very few adults that know one quarter of what is in this book.  This has motivated me to add this to my son's daily routine.  We work it together and have wonderful mom-son time alone.  A book you can't do without
