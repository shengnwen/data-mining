This book was great for interactions with reading between two people.  One of the stories with mice, dogs and cats was not a good example of how to resolve conflict - threat was countered with threat - but the format for reading together and the rhyming were excellent and the rest of the stories modeled good values.  "I hate my hat" is my son's favorite
