I have a three-year old daughter with whom I wanted to explore arts and crafts. I looked at many different arts and crafts books before choosing this one to buy. Many other books that I looked at had projects that had complicated instructions or used materials that were expensive. I needed a book that I could pull off the bookshelf, open up, and pick a suitable art project quickly. Little Hands has realistic projects- by that, I mean projects that are meaningful, uncomplicated, and use basic materials that you're likely to have around the house
