When I got this book I was pleased about most of the places it listed. However, the author left a lot out (though I know you can't please everybody) and put in too many expensive hotels. If we're supposed to do all 1000 things before we die, how are we expected to afford all of it if we're staying in all the expensive hotels? *sigh* oh well. 

I did find a lot of the descriptions inspiring and encouraging, and left me wanting to visit them.
