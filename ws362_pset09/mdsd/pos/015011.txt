Airelle is certainly a young lady with a sad and horrific past and she is so fortunate to have someone like Burke Drummond to have fallen in love with her 3 years before, and devoted and patient to find a way to achieve marriage between them.  This is such an unbelievable love story - I think the only weakness is perhaps the development of how Airelle began to change her feelings for Burke.  Certainly he was patient and unbelievably caring and devoted and seemed to do all the right things - just on an emotional level I am not exactly sure what caused Airelle to actually accept Burke's love.  And the ending with the crazed nanny and Entinne - that would have seemed to immediately drawn Burke and Airelle together - to skip then to the wedding 3 weeks later and they are still coming together just seemed a little weak - I mean most of the time when there is such an intense scene as almost dying in the fire couples cannot bare to be away from one another.  For the most part though I love Coulter books and look forward to the others in this series
