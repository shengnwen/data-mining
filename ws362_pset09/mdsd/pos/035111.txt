Don't let anybody tell you anymore that being vegan means giving up all your old-time favorite flavors! What a great book for home cooking! I made the &quot;Fried Chicken Tofu&quot; and my carnivore friend who practically eats ONLY meat ate it all (before learning what it really was), and the Bar-Be-Que Beans are addictive, just as the author says. If you like spoonbread and creamed corn and greens &amp; all that but wondered how to fix it vegan, this is your cookbook. Some recipes are high-fat, but you can be sensible and have them as once-in-a-while treats
