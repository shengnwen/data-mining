this book is probably the best guide book I have ever used. It has really good info. It has information on both rims of the canyon and some surrounding areas of Arizona. It has a useful metric-standard conversion table in the back. Bill Weir writes like an expert. The book will make you an expert on the grand canyon. Not only does it contain tourist information but it also has history and facts about the canyon. Great travel tool
