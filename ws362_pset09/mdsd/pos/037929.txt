I grew in the area that is addressed in the book (A block away from the Richard Allen Housing Projects) I am to young to remember the orginators of the Black Mafia but I came up during the era of the JBM and I knew,hung out and hustled with a lot of the sons and nephews of many of the founding members.This book puts everything out there and lets the reader soak in about how "Being Fly" and connected could shorten your life span. I have read it several times now I am still blown away by it.

GET THIS BOOK!!
