I got this book at Easter and have made several of the recipes.  All have been good, a few outstanding. (The &quot;good&quot; ones were tasty but identifiable as a low-fat product.  The outstanding ones were as good as a full-fat counterpart.)  However, I can't give this book 5 stars because the nutrition information given is lacking a key aspect:  no carbohydrate information is provided.  Fat, calories, protein, etc., are all listed, but no carbohydrate.  That makes figuring American Diabetic Association or American Dietetic Association exchanges hard to do accurately.  One can make a guess of the starch exchanges from the calories, but carbohydrate information would allow one to figure exchanges much more precisely.  Since this IS a book of baked goods, not giving the carbohydrate information is like reviewing a new brand of gasoline and detailing all the ingredients EXCEPT the octane.  Hard to believe, given that the author is a nutritionist, and makes you wonder if they are trying to downplay how much sugar and complex carbs are in the recipes.  Since many &quot;low-fat&quot; products are unhealthy precisely because they use great amounts of sugars and starches to taste good despite the lack of fat, you have to wonder about these recipes, too
