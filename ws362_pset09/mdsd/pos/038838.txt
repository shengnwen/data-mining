I first heard about Dr. Peeke on Discovery Channel's Body Challenge. I read this book cover to cover and it hit me; this is why I've had trouble losing weight! It helped me to understand how stress-eating was affecting my inability to lose weight; or to keep it off.  I highly recommend this book and I'm not kidding about how much help it's been to me.  The proof is in the 24 lbs lost and 4% fat loss in 10 weeks!  What do you have to lose??
