I grew up watching M*A*S*H and watched Alda playing one of the presidential candidates on The West Wing.  I also remember his campaigning for ERA.  When I saw this book, I thought it would be interesting to know a little bit more about the man.  This book was a quicker read than I would have thought and was a very interesting read.

No one part of his life dominates the book.  Although his years with the fictional 4077th were helpful in his growth as an actor, writer, and director, those years aren't overbearing on the rest.  We learn quite a bit about his influence from his father, his worries with his mother, and his evolution in thought as he strove to become better at his craft.  I found myself taking notes on some points for things I wanted to follow-up on later.

Like the character Hawkeye, Alda can go from hilarity to sadness, and the book takes us there.  We read of some of the hard times in his life (like the medical problem in Chile or dealing with his mother's illness), but he always seems to show us that these are moments that make us stronger.

I would definitely recommend this book to others
