I like this book, it's better than some other vampire lit books i read. The main character, Vincent, is very likeable, though Jackie is not so much at the beginning. It is not full of erotic scenes like many others, and it has a smooth tone. It is kind of a mystery book, though i wouldn't buy it if that's the reason for purchase
