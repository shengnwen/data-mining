Unlikely to actually happen, the event which begins this book still leads to an very interesting look into the way that a number of people are affected for years by a very quick and unplanned decision.  Everyone in this book is multi-dimensional and likeable because you grow to feel like you know what motivates them.  The protrayal of the growing up years for a person with Down's Syndrome is very well done--one sees the strengths as well as the limitations.  I thought some of the resolutions of the years of keeping a secret were a bit simplistic and convenient but other than that, I enjoyed this book a lot.  Well worth reading
