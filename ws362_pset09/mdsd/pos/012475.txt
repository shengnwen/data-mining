I purchased this book in order to plan a 6 week trip to New Mexico and Arizona.   If you want a book that will clearly and intelligently tell you about everything in these two states, this is a good option.  Unfortunately, this book isn't very helpful in prioritizing sites.  For example, I'm sure every single indian pueblo is listed, but it's difficult to tell which ones are worth allocating time to.  Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent book, but, if this is your first visit to the area, you will need a more opinionated book to help you sift though the many, many sightseeing options
