Like a scrapbook of deities and banshees whom haunt the plane of advertisement and commercialism, this novel generates
new visual capabilities using a fashionable medium. A witless juxtaposition of elements from an even more witless source. BLACK DICE are geniuses. They have made a cool book, i guess, but it acts more like headway towards new forms of their creative aesthetic sense. Anticipation is granted.
Bjorn Copeland seems to have the obvious talent but as a collective, they must upgrade. Use multimedia like a shaman.  
Allow the creative horchata to act like a panacea only to further the capability of something as pleasing to the spirits as a shwarma. Give me Lizzie's digits.
