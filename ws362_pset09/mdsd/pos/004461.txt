Just so there's no confusion, I am the author of this book. This book is written for the graphic industry professional. It is not a how-to book for the layman, though there are sections that outline specific techniques. The focus of the book is on professional applications of digital photography and how digital capture impacts the workflow of the professional graphic artist and art director. Digital photography affords a more collaborative environment for art directors, photographers and graphic artists in a commercial environment but there are many pitfalls due to the lack of the tangible point of reference that a physical piece of film provides. This book provides an overview of the types of professional digital cameras- their strengths and weaknesses. It examines resolution requirements for modern reproduction and gives details for the best practices in color control and communication between photographer, designer, prepress and printer. Real world examples from leading digital photographers from around the world highlight solutions that digital capture provides in commercial work. There is a special chapter on the &quot;Politics of Color&quot; that examines the potential problems in utilizing digital images with workgroups that incorporate separate professional agendas. Designers need this book to stay on top of the latest developments in digital photo methodology. Photographers need this book to get an overview of how digital photography integrates into a complete graphics workflow (many are buying copies of the book for their clients). Art directors need this book to learn about various creative applications that digital capture makes possible. Anyone considering a career in the graphic arts will want to read this book to learn about the future direction of photography in graphic design
