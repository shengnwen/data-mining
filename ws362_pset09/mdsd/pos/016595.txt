There are two key words in the title to this book which to those considering retirement are a must: "Low-Tax"!  If for some reason you missed that pitch maybe the second clue as to whom the book might appeal to is those on fixed incomes; ie. those who haved retired.  Because we all know that taxes are an item over which we have little control, it behooves us to find a place we can stand to live that also might be a "tax heaven" instead of a "tax hell" to use terms supplied by the authors.  I found that definitive term well applied by the authors but would not necessarily agree as to their choice of the best places to live in the states which have low tax rates.  This book determines places with low taxes based on the things which the average joe pays taxes: personal and real property, income, purchases.  Some web sites such as the one produced by the Tax Foundation of America base their ratings on "per capita income" of all taxes, including business taxes and thus don't accurately reflect how individual tax rates might affect the retiree.  This book avoids that trap.   Now if you can afford to purchase a home in these "tax heavens" you are really set.  Remember people who have retired have fixed incomes from pensions, social security, personal savings (IRA's,etc.) and so on.  They have to limit governement access to those funds.  States with NO income tax certainly have to be a place to start.
