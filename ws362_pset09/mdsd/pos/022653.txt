well i've purchased quite a few books on this subject since filing and this is one of the most informative i've read so far. It is jam packed with information on where to go to get a good secured credit card. She even gives websites and toll free numbers! All i can say for spooge-monkey is look at his name, it says it all! I purchased the book he refers to and found it to be &quot;lame and cheesy&quot; with no useful information at all
