I purchased this book for a niece who is almost twelve and has recently lost her mother because of a traffic accident. This book offers good advice to young people who wish to make wise, godly choices. I, like Dr. Dobson, value the Bible-based teachings that this country was founded on. Secular people will not like this book.
