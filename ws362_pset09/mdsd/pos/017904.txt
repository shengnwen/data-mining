The essence of the book is that "Emotions are contagious" and identifying by how much can make the difference between allowing a life to be hijacked and taking back control.  There are many examples of how the connection between mind and body is real, the physiological with the psychological combined, and how toxic energy can drain and damage a human body physically.  All those "gut" feelings or intuitive sensations we feel among and between people are real and Daniel Goleman explores how important it can be to figure out the source of that tension.  The Eureka moments reading this book for me were realizing that the toxicity of any relationship corrodes trust.  How many relationships recycle the same destructive pattern over and over again? 
The author examines how those patterns effect immune function and neurological function so that nourishment based on empathy is healing and control or erosion of value is hurting.  He discusses examples of autistic kids whose mindsight gets shrouded in obscurity.  The book is not all about mapping the wireless network we all share the author also demonstrates how making changes affects everyone around us and sometimes forces them to grow with us to emotionally evolve.
Powerful book of enlightenment - easily understood and easy to read and relate to examples.
