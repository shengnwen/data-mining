After having read &quot;Growing Yound with HGH&quot; (prior to Dr. Sears, &quot;Anti-Aging Zone) I must admit.....many of the same philosophies of anit-aging translated better with Dr. Klatz's book . Maybe it's me, but I  felt I needed to go the library and read the book in the reference section  for back-up. Dont get me wrong...it has a great deal of good information  for turning back the biological clock...you just may have to re-read a  couple of chapters....after having done a little research on terminology,  biology, and human nutrition. That's my opinion...and I'm sticking to it
