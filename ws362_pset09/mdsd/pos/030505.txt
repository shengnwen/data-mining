The best photographically based U2 publication since BP Fallon's 1994 book Faraway, So Close!, U2 Show follows the Irish band moving from `70s pub gigs through to gargantuan stadium bills. Lovingly detailed with candid shots backstage, Bono's early scaffold climbing antics and images from their first Australian tour in 1984, U2 Show also comes up trumps with its notation by numerous crew who have worked the lights, checked the sound and designed the stage over the years. The testimonials by everyone from Brian Eno through to Anton Corbijn prove a strong family ethos has been present in U2's inner circle from the beginning. While the pages of reports from stage technicians and sound engineers can sometimes be a little heavy going at the tail end of this tome and there's more proofing errors than a quality official book like this should contain, there's plenty of insider information that will impress fans of Dublin's finest.
