I thought that this book was very good becouse it was so exciting and adventurous.  I like to do alot  of things that are like this.  The one thing that I did not like about this book is that in all of them they say almost the same thing and I think that they should only say that in the first book cause it just gets boring after a while. The other reason I like these books is because she is kind of like me when I was little I ws always asking questions.  And I think everybody got sick of me when I would as so many questions. This book is about a little girl who lives to think that she is the best at things and she really is not.Cause one of her friends is kinda like her and she can do things better that Junie. Junie is in kindergaurten and in this book she was doing some Sneaky, Peaky, Spying and she was spying on her teacher cause she had a boyfriend and Junie thought that teachers did not have any lives they just stayed at school all of the time.  Then she is not aloud to spy and she does, and guess what happens?  Yep you guessed it, big trouble, to the priciples office.  I am not going to say anymore cause if i sayanything more I would have read the whole book.I encourage you ro read this book if you like any adventure or like to get into trouble and ask alot of questions. This might be the book for you. So iI encourage you to reak it if you like adventure
