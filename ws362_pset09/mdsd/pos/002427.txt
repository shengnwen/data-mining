One thing I like about the books Gary Keller puts together is he goes right to "the horse's mouth" and asks those who are making it big investing in real estate, "What are you doing that works so well for you."  He sees a pattern they all have, and then puts a system down in book form that anyone can follow.

For the beginner, there are enough details to give you a good idea what to do...beginning to end.  Create a plan, and pursue it.  Stay focused.

For the advanced, you get reaffirmation that what you are doing is right, and a few new angles to try.  You'll find a gem here and there that will strengthen your systems and procedures.  Most of all, you get the notion to think big.  I mean REALLY BIG.  A million dollars a year in cash flow BIG!  Big enough so you can share your masses of wealth with the masses, make a difference in the world, and never miss the money.

Specifics are somewhat lacking, but don't sweat that part.  There is no right or wrong investment, only a right or wrong way of handling it
