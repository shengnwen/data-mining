I'm a Hodgkin's patient who's almost finished reading this book. I found it to be an easy, quick read that felt good since it validated everything I feel about illness and life in general already. My guess is most of the reviewers who gave this book five stars are the same.

However, I have to agree with the two spotlighted reviewers and not give this book five stars. We're not all born with the same "toolbox" and turning a negative, passive personality into the positive, proactive one that Dr. Siegel claims is necessary to overcome disease doesn't happen very quickly (if at all) . . . it takes years, and a lot more resources than just this book
