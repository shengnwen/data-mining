I'm on my third copy.  a habit that comes with this book.  You will read it tote it and quote it at an unimaginable frequency. Its more than THE WAR,its the people as well as the feeling of the times. What a gift of prose he has. This book made me come to respect Michael Herr as the most articulate writer i have ever come across.
