This is a must own book for any student of Carl Jung.  It covers the basic concepts of his psychological topology in his own words in a brief space and goes into a much deeper dive on the Self.  This exploration of Self goes deeply into Christian symbolism and the structure and dynamics of the Self.

Like much of Carl Jung's writing, some of this is very tough going for people new to Jung.  It is not a bedside book and the average reader will need to look a lot of things up.  However, it is indispensable in terms of the concepts.

There are many good books that can provide commentary on this book and you can find them easily.  I would highly recommend that you pick up one of these books about Aion in addition to the text itself.  This is a book that has many layers and one which you must be patient with.

If you are merely looking for an introduction to Jung, then I would go with Jung's Map of the Soul by Murray Stein.  This is the BEST introduction I know of and quotes Aion a lot.  Aspects of the Faminine is also very good for those who want to know more about the anima/animus and a more readable version of Jung's thoughts on marriage, the feminine, etc.

The Viking Portable Jung is also good to get a cross section of Jung's most important thought.  However, you will eventually want to read Aion for its depth and extensive elaboration on the nature of the Self.
