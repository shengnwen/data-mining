I bought this for my niece's 5th birthday along with about 10 different colors of kid's washable stamp pads (from an education store and from a craft store). It is my understanding that some of the stamp pads used for "stamping" take awhile to dry and are permanent (not a good combo for kids--I could see them on the clothes and smudged across the paper) GET THE KIDS THE QUICK DRY WASHABLE KIND OF INK! Hampton Art made the kind I purchased. They also make a "smelly" version. Grape, bubble gum, etc. Though this would be a hit, I had a budget. Anyway, you want different colors of ink to make all of the different, fun characters. I put the pads in a box with a black liquid ink pen. She seemed very interested. Her mom thought it was neat and her other aunt who is a first grade teacher looked it over and asked where she could get one for her class. I wish I had this book when I was a kid. Very cool. I would say that this book could be for all ages but is most appropriate for elementary age children and younger
