This unabridged audio version of "Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves" was wonderfully read by Cecil.  This is not my typically genre of book and I was pleasantly impressed and surprised by this book.  I have not read the prior books in this series and had no problems following along so the priors are not a necessity. In a nutshell, this book is about a dim-witted Bertie and his attempt to keep from inadvertently becoming engaged to a sappy Madeline.  The dry, British humor of this story is excellently portrayed by Cecil and I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a refreshing change of pace
