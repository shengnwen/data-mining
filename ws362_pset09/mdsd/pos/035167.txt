"Draw nearer and listen.  Sit inside the circle, close by the fire of warmth and friendship.  Tell me your story, and I'll tell you mine," Patricia Commins writes in concluding chapter five.  Commins is not a psychologist, nor does she pretend to be.  She is a grown woman who has summoned the guts to examine her relationship with her mother, and gives her readers the benefit of that experience.  I for one, related to her story, her remembrances, her sense of loss, but most importantly to her joy at discovering her mother and herself.  Immersing myself in Ms. Commins' book, I began to recall many forgotten memories of my own mother, a woman who embraced many roles.  Mom was typical of the 40's and 50's Midwestern mom who baked cupcakes, scrubbed floors, hung the wash on the clothesline and nurtured her kids.  But prior to embracing those roles, she was "Rosie the Riveter" - serving as a draftsman in Ford's River Rouge plant - responsible for the successful completion of the B-24 bomb bay doors.  Through Ms. Commins deft ability of prying loose memories through her stories, I remembered mine.   I related to her "spiritual e-mail" and found myself probing the memory banks surrounding my father.  It matters not the gender of the parent with whom the reader had issues, or whether that parent is still among the living, Ms. Commins, through her gentle remembrances, humor, and down-to-earth approach, has given all readers a true gift.  Thank you, Patricia.
