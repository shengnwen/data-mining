The Authors have written a book that forces the reader to ask some necessary questions, but makes it okay to answer them - no matter what your answer is.  They propose several questions related to "Should I start my business?", "What kind of business?" and "When?"  These issues are basic; however, in my workshops and consulting for woman owned businesses I find that these are ones that women struggle with.  This book does not provide all the answers and that's good because the answers are very circumstantial and personal.  The "Girls" do a great job with the section on loans, they provide some good information and make it easy to understand.  This book does not really stress the "girl thing"; it's more of a female viewpoint of business start up factors.  This view point makes it very comfortable, understandable and believable.  I personally want to thank the Authors for stressing research.  In my years of selling, consulting and working with business development I have seen research make a huge difference in the efficiency, revenue generation and success of woman owned businesses.  Chapter 4 - Your Business Plan should be open beside you when you are writing your own Business Plan because it provides some very practical advice and explanations.  This book is fun and inspirational, but is also full of realistic suggestions and helpful information
