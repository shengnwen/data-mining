I was given a copy of this book as a gift by a friend who has made seven pilgrimages to Medjugorje, and whose own life has been transformed by the experience.

I was initially rather skeptical, but after reading this extraordinary account, I have now bought copies for other people as well.

Almost exactly 25 years ago, six children reported that the Virgin Mary had appeared to them on a hillside in Bosnia-Herzegovina. She has allegedly been returning every day since then, making comments about the world, and advising us on actions that we need to take. 

The story is inspirational, and was recently given more credence by a scientific report indicating that there really is something going on here which appears inexplicable according to the currently accepted scientific model.

The Vatican has not yet elevated Medjugorje to the level of a "miracle," but the fact is that the events in this village have transformed the lives of people all over the world.

I highly recommend this book to all spiritual seekers
