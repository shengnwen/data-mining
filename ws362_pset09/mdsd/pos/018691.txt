This is an extraordinary novel.  Kaylie Jones' sense of craft is absolutely first-rate and her characters come alive in chapter after chapter; on page after page.  All the other reviewers have done a terrific job of highlighting why this book achieves such an intense level of drama, storyline, etc.  I'd like just to add a few odds &amp; ends: (1) KJ's control of her material is beyond crafty; it's superlative.  She weaves a great many characters in and out of a novel full of what Arthur Miller calls &quot;time bends,&quot; yet the narrative is never confused or confusing, as KJ shifts back and forth in time with an effortless grace (and a truly exquisite use of asterisks!); and (2) there's a grace and polish to the writing that is a joy to read--while periodically the author erupts with the kind of gloriously unbuttoned, bold, in-your-face roughhewn prose that her late, great father was famous for (i.e., James &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; Jones made high art out of lowdown barracks talk and the lingo of the world's misfits back in the day, especially in his WW II novels).  OK: anyone with an eye and an ear for a marvelous work about a 30ish woman in the Nineties trying to heal her life as she maneuvers adulthood's trickiest labyrinths will likely adore this novel.  Kaylie Jones is more than her father's daughter; she's a major author in her own right and this novel should be celebrated.  It's a serious, sensuous, intense, artfully textured piece of work.
