I'm not a vegetarian and I doubt I'll become one.  But I found this collection interesting because I've always thought of vegetarians as nice but sorta flakey tree huggers.  The essays here are written by people who offer strong arguments for their beliefs.  (Usually, that is.  The one by Harriet Schlieffer is over the top).  But sorry folks.  My appetite over-rules my head in this case
