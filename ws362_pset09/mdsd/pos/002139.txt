This appears to be a reprint of the little book by the same title that utterly consumed me, probably for hundreds of hours, in the 1970's.  It was old then, and looks even older now.  And yet, pushing letters around on a page is timeless.  It's laughably low-tech and yet, utterly modern, all at the same time.  Some of the tricks and techniques described are so profound and clever, they are reminiscent of calculus in how they demonstrate the power of the well-applied human mind.  This book can be an absorbing hobby all by itself.  Plus when I found a coded note written by some girls in my junior high school, I was able to read it..
