I read this book two years ago at least. I don't know why I'm writing a review now of all times, except that I love this book and really can't get it out of my head. It's an incredible, sweeping epic. The feat of this book astounds me - I'm amazed by how the author weaves together the generations, the characters and the history. I learned so much about India and Burma. Stunning how smoothly Ghosh develops characters through their history and place. I found myself moved to tears by the marriage of Rajkumar and Dolly and the evolution of their once-starry relationship
