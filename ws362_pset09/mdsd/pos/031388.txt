This book is exactly what I was looking for. So often we don't have the words for what we want to express to our Father in Heaven. Stormie gives us these words, with varying situations and circumstances, so we can just seek, ask, and knock as we praise our Father in Heaven. The prayers are to the point, in language we use daily and have scripture references to support each request. The book is small enough to fit in a purse or fit in a glove box in the car. I'm enjoying it immensely. The author is a true PRAYER WARRIOR
