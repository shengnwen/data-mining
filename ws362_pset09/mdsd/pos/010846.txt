This book is a quick and enjoyable read that will dispel some myths about wolves.  The author traveled to a remote are of northern Canada in the summer of 1948 to study wolves, which were supposedly destroying the caribou population.  The actual culprit turned out to be human hunters.  His sympathetic descriptions probably didn't do much for his career with the Canadian government, but may have changed some minds about the threat that wolves pose to people.

Excellent descriptions of wolf behavior in their natural habitat, including the interaction of an immediate family with pups and various groups that live in adjacent territories.  Some of the behaviors he observed had not been seen before by scientists, and he was accused of fabricating them, but most of these observations have since been verified by others.

At times, Mowat could be accused of attributing human motivations to animal behaviors.  If this bothers you, you many not fully enjoy this book
