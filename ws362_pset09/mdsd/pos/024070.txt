This book is a good history of time. My first real book on cosmology. Since then, there have many other discoveries in the field that make our understanding of things slightly difference. Still this is a really good first book at understanding cosmology. They're just a little too worried that readers won't understand it if they add something a little technical. It becomes a book good only for those who will never grasp anything more, or a first book for those who will graduate to more descriptive, technical books
