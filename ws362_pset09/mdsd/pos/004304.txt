I absolutely adore this book.  As others have mentioned, Guenevere is written as a fully-imagined person, with complex emotions and motivations, from her childhood through the twilight years of Camelot. Unlike in some versions, I found the love triangle between Arthur, her, and Lancelot completely believable, and my heart broke for each of them in turn.  Mckenzie also manages to flesh out a multitude of compelling supporting characters, making the reader just as apprehensive as Guenevere is when the soldiers ride off to battle, wondering who will return.  If you have any interest in Arthurian myths, and enjoy excellently written characters with both flaws and virtues, don't miss this book
