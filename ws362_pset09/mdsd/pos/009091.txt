Having skimmed the reviews on this site it is apparent I am not the only person who decided The World According to Garp was worth re-reading after 25 years. 
 
The World According to Garp is ultimately about lust and its destructive nature.  If you are easily offended (Irving's novels tend to revolve around twisted sexual behaviour and Garp is no exception) you may want to avoid The World According to Garp (and pretty much everything in the Irving catalogue).  

But the World According to Garp is more than a series of bizarre sexual encounters.  It is a complex, disturbing, and insightful novel. In The World According to Garp, Irving has created some of the most vivid, unique, and truly memorable characters in modern literature, not to mention some of the best lines of dialogue ever put to paper.  The World According to Garp is both hilarious and heartbreakingly poignant. 

I do have to admit that I did find (as I often find with Irving's novels) that it meanders a little in the middle (I could have done with a little less on the wife-swapping relationship for example).  Even though some plot lines didn't engage me as thoroughly as others, all in all, The World According to Garp is a well written, enormously entertaining novel.

If you haven't read anything by John Irving, The World According to Garp is a great place to start.  If you read the novel years ago, its well worth reading again.
