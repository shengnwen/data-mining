I purchased the Pausanias' Guide to Southern Greece many years ago before vacationing in the Pelopponese.  Pausanias gives a very detailed account of many tourists sites.  It is referred to on plaques at Greek sites in Greece.  However, as important as Pausanias, is Peter Levi.  His footnotes are extremely helpful in understanding the text and relating descriptions to what is on the ground today.  I learned at least as much from the Peter Levi's footnotes as I did from Pausanias' text.  I would not buy a different translation without his footnotes.
I give this only a 4 star rating because it may be too detailed for the casual reader
