This is the fist book I bought on this subject and I did find it to be quite helpful. Helpful for writing any kind of letter, helpful for web-sites, helpful for blogs and helpful for novels.

The author touches on everything you need to know, when it comes to writing hypnotically. One thing he seems to do though, is state the same thing in different ways, in different chapters. I am guessing this book could be rearranged and edited down to half it's size.

Overall though I would highly recommend it to anyone who has something to communicate in writing. The book also has some good references to other writers and what they have to offer. Buy it
