I really enjoyed this book. I learned a lot of history. He breaks it down into the seven deadly sins. How the apple became the "forbidden fruit" in the Bible. Why to even this day we look down at corn (think about how it's in junk food). Why some foods are shunned over the years for class reasons (for example white bread over dark bread in in 17th and 18th century France.

I highly recommend reading this book
