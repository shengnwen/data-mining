This book was so helpful! My husband and I are trying to start a t-shirt company and we didn't know were to start. This book showed us all of the different techniques and really spelled out how to do each of them. It was very easy to understand, gave us some great ideas and it even showed us how to make our screen from scratch. I would recommend getting this book if you are wondering how to screen print.
