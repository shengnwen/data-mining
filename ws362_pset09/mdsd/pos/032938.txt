  Reading this book will help prepare expatriates know about the culture and subcultures of the Japanese. The text comes with a 60-minute CD that can be read along with to practice some common and practical Japanese words/phrases. 

This book does not prepare readers for writing or understanding kanji characters, but it can let you know how to say things like: Where are the restrooms? : Toire wa doko desu ka?, as well as times, calendar terms, business jargon and a bit more.

  I think the value of this book lies in the fact that it is comprehensive. It begins with a nice little history lesson about the eastern archipelago. It progresses into conversational but well-written explanations of transportation, lodging, etiquette, politics and the psychological aspects of entering (and eventually leaving) such a different culture. It also has a nice little black-and-white map printed on the inside front cover. 

This book is ideal for students, travellers, TEFL teachers and people who just want to learn about a very interesting society.

I enjoyed reading it and I think it's worth its price.
