        The Culture of Fear by Barry Glassner is an extremely well researched book. If you ever find yourself becoming afraid from the stories on the news about things such as kidnapping or plane crashes you should pick up this book and read it immediately. This book is not merely to entertain you, although at a certain level it is rather entertaining, once you realize people are so easily manipulated by people in influential positions like reporters. Mainly it is to inform people that they are ultimately being "brainwashed" by the media. Glassner goes on to explain that the media is not interested in informing people of actual facts, statistics, or situations they should fear. They are merely focused on using the stories that sell, the statistics that grab people's attention. 
	This book is one big vessel that simply contains seven years worth of data, statistics, facts, quotes, and other information. Glassner takes what reporters and the media have said with their evidence and then explained it in a much more understanding way that reveals that there is nothing really to fear. As you continue reading this book you only become more and more astounded by the stupidity of the human race. Fact after fact just makes us look utterly ridiculous. After reading this book you will be much more informed and much more critical about how much emotion you invest into fearing unnecessary things such as road rage and killer kids.
