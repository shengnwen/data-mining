Since I graduated college several years ago, I always wished I could have taken more history courses.
 I wanted to find a history book that would cover all the details, but not drown me in a sea of words. This book does exactly that. The bonus of course being the excellent photography and overall presentation. I found the book's depth to be just about right. The ancient Egypt section for example, covers all the major time periods in about eight pages of text. It doesn't bog you down in too many details but still manages to immerse you.
The only downfall of this book is that there are no maps. I would highly recommend picking up an historical atlas as a companion just to reinforce what your reading. This would be especially helpful in understanding something like the conquests of Alexander. The book's layout is a little off as well. For the most part everything is in chronological order, but occasionally you will see some gaps. A good example of this is the coverage of the Minoans in the chapter after the Egyptians and Persians.
 Overall, it's a great book for the price and it contains just enough history to satisfy your appetite as well as beautiful photography to suck you in.
