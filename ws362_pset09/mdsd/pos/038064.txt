A World of Hurt by Mary Reynolds Powell helps ease the pain I have felt for the past 29 years.  I served at the 24th Evac Hospital as an Internist on the medical wards (5-10)in 1971-72. I spent a total of 5 years in the army before I could face leaving the haunting memories of that &quot;war&quot; behind me. The book brings back so much to me and has helped me realize that I am not alone in these feelings. She writes from the heart and you feel what she felt, and you know the hurt that lasts a life time.  I thank her for writing this book and recommend it to anyone who was in Vietnam and to all those who want to understand the horror of war and the helpless feeling and anguish of youthful death. This book is therapeutic to so many of us who served and have kept the pain internally and have cried in silence and in the darkness.  I thank you for this book for it is a gift to all  eho suffered.  I can no longer remain anonymous
