I really enjoyed this first hand account of General Bennett's experiences.   I have read this type of book extensively, and I put this very close to the top of my list.  

I especially enjoyed his comments about how people behaved and thought during this climatic time in our history.  His feelings about missing his wife, and how he felt when his first troopers died, and what that must have meant to the families added a real human touch.   I enjoyed his description of train rides, gas rationing, and many other small points that really gave me a feel for what it was like for not just soldiers, but also civilians, both American and Foreign.  

I agree, it would have been really nice to have some pictures of what his vehicles looked like and some maps.  But, I would also have enjoyed a picture of his wife whom he obviously loved deeply.  A picture of Fort Knox, or Fort Sill during training.  

Those would really have added value to this book, but it certainly stands out without them too.  My thanks to General Bennett for sharing his story, and not just the combat.  

Well done!
