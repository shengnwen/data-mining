Everything that Carlo Ginzburg has ever written has always been groundbreaking and exhilirating. Here he uses Inquisition documents to describe and analyze the ideas of a common man, which are probably more complicated and interesting than those of the philosophers and theologians of his time. And remember that this was the age of the so-called Renaissance (an absurd concept) and Reformation (ditto). Ginzburg leaves the reader wondering how an &quot;un-educated&quot; man could have such complicated ideas. Highly recommended
