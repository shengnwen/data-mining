I began reading Savory's book for a research project into ecological cattle management.  Once I began reading it, I couldn't put it down, and I'm glad I didn't.  Not only did the book teach me everything I could possibly want to know about Savory's cattle management methodology, but it gave a great perspective for managing life.  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially people interested in any type of management (business or ecological) or anyone interested in environmental studies
