I wanted to visit the old shops of Kyoto, where they have been doing their craft for generations.  I was able to find the few shops that I picked out ahead of time.  They were all open and many had English literature on their products and history and some even had English speaking employees.  So, don't be afraid to visit these charming shops.

I gave it 4 stars because although accurate, the book did not give very detailed directions.  The articles provided a small map of the cross streets but when you get into the smaller streets, the signs are not in English.  I bought a Osaka-Kyoto Atlas before I went and that was a great help in finding the smaller streets.  

The book is full of traditional shops and inns and I would highly recommend buying it.  Just do a little planning the night before and buy a good atlas and you will be fine
