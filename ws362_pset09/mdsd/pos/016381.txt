I bought this book despite the bad reviews.  I had read Susan Squires previous books in this series and had a hard time believing that this one was as bad as some said.

I wasn't disappointed.  I enjoyed the book, maybe because I had some warning that it wasn't a warm, fuzzy feel good romance.  Honestly, I enjoyed the darker element.  Lately, I've been bored with the same 'ol, same 'ol "boy meets girl, boy can't have girl, boy gets girl anyway" historical romance.

I've read most (if not all) of the major historical romance writers and a number of the minor writers.  I've also read a number of the supernatural romance ficition out there and can tell you, a lot of it is just bad.  

In this, the writing was good, the characters well developed and the story something interesting.  It's not the next great American novel but I wasn't expecting it to be.  It was an easy read on a 3 hour flight.  Like I said, if you like your romance a little darker, a little edgier then you might want to go ahead and give this a try
