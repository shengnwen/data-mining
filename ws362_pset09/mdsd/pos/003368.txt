I really liked Red Dragon. It was very interesting in the way it handled the psychology of the killer. He clearly suffered from some sort of multiple personality disorder, but it seemed that he chooses the other personality. The Red Dragon at first seems to be a being of Francis Dolarhyde's choosing. But, as you start to learn about the life of Francis, you see that he has turned his abusive grandmother's memory into a personality he is melding with. He talks to his grandmother's picture like he is not afraid of her, but you can tell he fears the Red Dragon. The Red Dragon reminds me of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings. Francis is both terrified and fascinated by the Dragon, so he does it's bidding, killing two families to appease it. Will Graham, a retired FBI consultant is called in to help catch this terrifying serial killer. Graham asks the help of the insane Hannibal Lector, who the killer idolizes. Lector turns the killer against Graham, and he must find the killer before he kills again, and this time, Graham is his target. A well-written novel. I didn't like the profanity, but it wasn't extravagant or misused. The language used was interesting. At times it sounded like an omnipotent third party, and sometimes like an observer from the outside. I have never watched any of the Hannibal movies, but now I might just consider it
