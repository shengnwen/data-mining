When I read this book its told in such a great way, that you forget throughout the whole book that it is in fact a non-fiction book. Pat Conroy tells about his life in very good detail. He places every quote from his friends in here literaly word for word, you can tell as some charactors have much stronger (colorful) language than others. 

The main storyline in this book is how Pat Conroy, a teacher at an integrated high school at the time of Martin Luther Kings Death, gets tired of all the racism between White people and Black people. He thought that by being a High School teacher he might be able to change the world. After he accepts the fact that society wont ever change in this school. He asks to be appointed to an open position on Yamacraw Island as a teacher and principle. Yamacraw is an island off the coast of South Carolina. When he arrives at Yamacraw he finds out just how dumb the children are. It's hard not laugh at some of the plain and simple reatarded remarks they make. Within a few chapters of the book you can tell that Pat Conroy is finally begging to make a difference in the lives of the children.

You really need to get the book and read the rest of his story. Find out if he gets fed up with a false cause of teaching future farmers or if he sticks with it and helps to develope Yamacraws first succesful people
