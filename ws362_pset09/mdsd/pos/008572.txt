As always Kellermans book is well constructed with a lot of action and an exciting plot. Friendship, broken relationships and corrupt politicians play a big part in this book. Fascism and rascism give this book a more dark side, with sometimes horrible descriptions and thoughts. You will really start thinking about these themes when you finished this book
