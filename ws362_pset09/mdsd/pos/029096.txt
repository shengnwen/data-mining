This album was great.  When I actually found it, I had to get it fast.  I used to listen to this album when my mother bought it for me endlessly (this was when I turned 8 or 9).  Now, my 3 boys love it.  While I forgot how some of the songs are rather graphic (I had memorized all the songs when I was little and was able to sing along once more after hearing them again) they are great for boys
