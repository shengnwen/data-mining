I have read the book Ida B. by Katherine Hannigan and it was a very good book.
Ida B. always talked to the trees and the brook. She played with them every evening. Then one day Ida B.'s mom got a lump on her body.She went to the doctor and found that the lump had Cancer. Before Ida B. had been home schooled by her mom and dad, but Ida B.'s dad couldn't take care of the farm, school Ida B. and take care of mom.Ida B.'s dad ended haveing to sell a little bit of the valleys and mountains thay he owned and he had to send Ida B. to school. A school buddy, Claire, moved into the land that had to be sold. Ida B. got into a fight with her and can't find a way out. Then when the school year ended mom got better, but did Ida B. end the fight with Claire? Find out in this book.
I was stunned when I found out that Ida B.'s mom had Cancer. It would not be fun to have to sell some of your families land and go to school and have your mom sick and tired. I also think that it would not be fun to not have any friends at school and be in a fight with someone in your own class. It was a hard time for Ida B. Therefore, if you want a good book, read Ida B.
