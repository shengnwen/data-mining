"Bless me Father for I will sin..." and soon Father Tom Madden discovers that a serial killer has targeted his younger sister as his next victim, challenging Tom to break the sacred seal of confession to notify the authorities.

Tom calls in his best friend Nick Buchanan, who also happens to be a nearly burnt out FBI agent told to take a vacation. Nick instead gets involved in protecting Tom's sister Laurant, who is all grown up, and quite a temptation. Nick's colleague Noah, another of the infamous FBI "Apostles" also joins the investigation protecting Tom, as he masquerades as a flirtatious priest.

But Laurant's reservations over being treated like a victim, an over ambitious FBI agent, a spurned lover, and Nick's own intuition wreak havoc on the case and turn it in several directions, as Nick and Laurant fall for each other.

Garwood is great at providing plenty of red herrings to make you think you know who the killer is, only to pull the rug out from under you. She is also a master of teasing and bantering between her main characters (as well as Noah, who as a priest cannot get over the whole celibacy thing).
