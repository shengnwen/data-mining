this is the 3rd book after mortal fear and quiet game with an almost anti-climax weak and rush ending. i just don't know why after all the endeavor of what mr iles did for all of his novels with 95% part of them so great but all with disastrous weak endings. i also think that iles should horn his writing specifically on the legal/court trial part, because they are all so obviously weak and lame. but with what i've all said, mr iles still got my respect so far, because he's a great storyteller. the endings, mr iles, the endings, don't fall into the trap like nielson de milleso's latest novel, by killing all the bad guys and unlikable guys in his novels in that 9/11 twin towers and found an easy way out to finish his 'don't-know-how-to-finish-it' ending. it's irresponsible and an insult to the readers. the endings, mr iles, the endings, should i repeat it third time to call for your attention
