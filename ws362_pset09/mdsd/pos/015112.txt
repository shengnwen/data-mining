It's always difficult to find the perfect "learn a little of the language before you go" book. This one's not bad; and I did learn what I needed to: "how do you get to ...", "where's the toilet?", "how much is it?" and other assorted phrases, as well as enough to understand at least part of the answers.

I did like the way the book presented pronunciations, and I'm pretty picky in that regard.

If you will be using the book ONLY before you go, and NOT as a resource while you're there, then this is a good buy for you. It's not a good carry-with resource, though, due to layoug and lack of index.

The stickers were a fun idea; if you are taking children with you, the stickers will really help your kids learn a few words as well
