For a book i only bought because i was attracted to the cover...it was pretty good.  I'm not usually one to go for crime dramas/thrillers, but Liparulo was amazing at making so many different stories interconnect into a delicious outcome.  Not to mention the no doubt strenuous research done.  Half way through you can almost feel how hard he must have worked for his novel
