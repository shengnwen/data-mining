Kushner is skilled at relating Biblical literature to questions and concerns of today.  He relates the verse to terrorists, Einstein and daily living. He provides insights and advice as to how we can live our lives more effectively.  His words also provide hope to all of us:

"You may have to work hard to earn your living...But you don't have to work hard in order to feel good about yourself.  All you have to do is stop striving, relax, and say to yourself, I feel good about who I am."
