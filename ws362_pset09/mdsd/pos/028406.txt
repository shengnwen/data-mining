This book made me think how much I wish it were around 10 years ago or so when my mother was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. As a person in my early twenties then, I was unprepared for dealing with a family member with a terminal illness. My mother, too, though she suffered from many health-ailments in her life, was also unprepared for death and dying. Often, she would send me to the bookstore, searching for some type of diversion or something that might give her solace. I usually returned empty-handed or with books that made her feel worse. (The only exception was "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff" which she did get some comfort from.) Morrie, I think, would have been just the thing for both of us back then. Unfortunately, it wasn't there, but it is now, so if you know a family going through a difficult time, I think this is just the book. One doesn't need to know suffering to appreciate this book and get something from it. Don't let the fact that this is a book about death deter you from picking it up. It is much more accurately a book about living
