This book is basically an instruction manual for applying to college. I particularly like the step-by-step instructions for filling out the common application form, and I think that the advice throughout is sound. The book is very thorough, well organized, and written in a way that will be easy for teens to use. I really think that this book is essential for kids who are applying to private colleges.

The only reservations I have is that the book does not alway make clear what is imperative, and what is merely an opinion of the author. As a parent, I would recommend supplementing the book with other sources of information to help get a better understanding of the process.
