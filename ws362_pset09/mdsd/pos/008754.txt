First of all, I would like to thank the authors of this book for doing such a wonderful job of explaining some of the toughest concepts of Photoshop CS2 in an unconventional but easy-to-understand way.

Emphatically speaking, this has been, by far, the best book on Adobe Photoshop CS2 for me. I have gone through almost every known Photoshop book just not to leave any feature unlearnt or to satisfy my hunger to learn every single thing about Photoshop. I have been an Adobe Photoshop guy right from the beginning and had been looking for a book which can throw light on the hidden features of this gigantic photography software. This book, in real terms, is Photoshop CS2 THE BIBLE. I tried to get myself clear on many tiny features of Photoshop CS2 but most of the books failed to help me understand those small but vital features. I do have sound knowledge of the software even though the rich content of the book did not allow me to skip even a single page of this book. The most striking thing about the book, apart from the richness of the content, is the approach taken by the authors to explain Photoshop CS2. Their explanation makes things very easy to understand. 
For example, if you know levels and Curves. This is what they have to say about them. 
"If Levels is an automatic transmission, Curves is a stick shift." 

Of course, this book is NOT for those who want to learn Photoshop tricks. Instead, it is for those who want to know "the mechanism of Photoshop CS2". If you want to learn Photoshop CS2 from scratch and have patience and passion, this book IS for YOU. You can count on my words.
