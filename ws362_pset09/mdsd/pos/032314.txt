Supplement Professor Kroodsma's title with Don Stap's survey of how birdsong clues are collected and interpreted by experts in his fascinating Birdsong: A Natural History. Birdsong focuses on the mysteries of birdsong, from how birds learn and develop regional 'dialects' to an even more fascinating set of insights on the influence of birdsong on great musicians. From how bird sounds are captured using sensitive equipment in the wild to exactly what a bird is 'saying' in a 2-3 second song, Stap provides a lively survey indeed.
