James Harriot has that amazing ability to transport you into his world, take you into his confidence, and offer you his friendship.....all through a series of heartwarming stories taken from his life as a Yorkshire vet.  It's so refreshing to read books that are not strewn with violence and sex...yet which captivate your attention.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants some good wholesome entertainment and an occasional chuckle
