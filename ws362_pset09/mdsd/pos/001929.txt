Overall I really liked Case Histories, although I agree that the ending was slighly anti-climactic. I was waiting for all of the stories to be tied together or at least for exciting conclusions to the mysteries. Instead a good bit of the ending was sort of random, out-of-left field answers to the questions in the book. Even so, the book was a really enjoyable experience, one of those books that you just have a good time reading. I didn't have a problem with the sex in the book, which some people have mentioned. It was mentioned frequently but not described graphically or anything like that - if you think that would offend you then don't buy this book, however. I think people were just surprised because this is a British mystery, and we don't expect much sex in those books? Overall a worthwhile read.
