Not by definition, but the bigger question is whether there are any true atheists.  John Blanchard goes through the entire atheist perspective from ancient Greek philosophers, to European thought leaders like Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and then existentialists like Sartre and Camus.  He shows that although these people have a basically atheistic worldview, they all have some sort of basic beliefs that cannot be "proven" by the rational thought process that they so deify.  Blanchard shows that the atheistic position is basically untenable, and contradictory.  If there is no external point of reference, how can anyone make sense of what is real and what is not real with just their observations and cogitations.  And of course there is the famous conundrum that to be a true atheist you must be sure and know that nowhere, at no place, at no time, has there ever been, exists, or will be any God.  But to know that, he'd have to have infinite knowledge, which would mean he is a god!

Although I don't think this book will appeal to any atheists, I do challenge any openminded atheist to read through this book and convince himself that he could possibly know that there is no God.  

For a Christian, this book is excellent in that it introduces you to all of the different thinkings of the world, and how people have tried to philosophize a reality without God.  By the time you are done with this book, you will never again think that evolution or creation by random chance (for example) has even one leg to stand on.  A long read, but very helpful, especially since we have been exposed to many atheistic philosophies without knowing what they were based on
