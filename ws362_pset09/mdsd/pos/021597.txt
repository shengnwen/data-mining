An extremely entertaining and readable book. A pleasing eye for the small detail, an efficent prose style. He has extreme selective memory - the Spanish Civil War or Castro's Cuban revolution with no mention of crushing poverty just one example. In some cases he's flat out wrong - Cuba a 'rich country' under Batista. His dismisal of Ghandi smacks of racism. In general he has come to praise the colonialist English, Vichy France, Franco and Nixon; to savage FDR, JFK and labor unions.

Much of his savaging is Monday morning (or Wednesday afternoon) quarterbacking. He claims 'moral relativism' as the scourge of the twentieth century while turning a blind eye when events don't fit his 'white mans burden' theory of post-colonialism. He blaims Leninism for everything but earthquakes and is ruthless in his hatred of state communism, state capitalism. He swings numbers around to trash post-war labor enough to deserve Twain's over used saw: Lies, damned lies and statistics.

Blind of course to the morally relative shenanigans of Reagan and Thatcher, he doesn't come off as a revisionist so much as a self important old man settling old scores (take that, Roosevelt!) while remaining blissfully ignorant of the grey areas around his heros.

However, he can write and he knows his subject. With less axes to grind, this would be a great book. He's unrelenting in his hatred of the Bolsheviks and Nazis, and as I agree I find much of his real-politik analysis very interesting and in many cases accurate.

There are much better surveys of the 20th century, Martin Gilbert's comes to mind as his right wing spin doesn't kick in until 1968, but for the flavor of the times this is a tasty read. Just don't take his opinions, or even some of his 'facts', at face value
