I homeschool my two older children and wanted a book that I  could use  with my 4-year old just for fun.  When we set down  to our 'homeschool  time' she had a blast.  We sorted the M&amp;M's by color, counted so many  of each color, learned simple addition and shapes.  The best part came at  the end of the book where we learned subtraction  and ate the M&amp;M's.   My daughter's eyes got very big and she asked, &quot;You mean REALLY eat  them?&quot
