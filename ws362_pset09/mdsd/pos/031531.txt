This is a book that really captures the heart of the New York underworld.  Gritty and quirky, with deep and sometimes likeable characters that jump right off the page.  If you liked Sleepers, Underboss or even the Sopranos, this is a book you should definitely read.  The characters aren't slick, "Hollywood" mobsters, but real people whom you'll find yourself reluctantly cheering for in the end
