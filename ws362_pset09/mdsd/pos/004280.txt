The first couple of chapters are review of Wireless basics, which is good for people like me with no prior knowledge in this area. The book also covers (in detail) step-by-step methods of pre-planning, attacking/hacking, and what folks are going to go for after you have access.

The book was very well layed out. The only negative was the cryptography chapters, which were a little "dry" for me. But, most of this book was understandable. All in all, this was one of the best technical books I've read.
