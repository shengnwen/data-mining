I found this book to be very informative, easy to read and although the message at times is very sobering, the human interest stories are heart warming.  I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in learning about the plight of the Mississippi Delta ecology, what is needed to restore it and the Cajun culture so intergral a part of this region for the last 300 years.
