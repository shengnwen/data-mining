I was a little hesitant in purchasing this book since it was written by a military leader who likely operated in an environment where authoritarian leadership is the norm.  My concern was unfounded.  It is written for police leaders and in language that is easily understood.  The author has some great insight into what it takes to be an effective leader.  More importantly though, he gives some concrete examples and ideas on how to act as a leader.  The case histories are based in hard reality with examples most police officers will be able to relate to.  I really can't say enough good things about this book.  It should be required reading for all police brass
