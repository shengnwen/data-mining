This isn't just a comic book.  If you buy it expecting a simple, mindless  read, you're going to be disapointed.  If, on the other hand, you buy it  with the hope of opening your mind to possibilities you had never before  considered, you're in for a hell of a read.  When you finish, you'll  probably be left with more questions than answers, but then, the Invisibles  has never been about answering questions, it's been about encouraging  people to start finding their own answers
