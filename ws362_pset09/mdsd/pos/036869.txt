Amy Tan writes about wonderful people. 

Amy Tan creates exceptional characters.

Amy Tan will write you a story that is so rich and clear you can almost touch it.

That is what I love in reading Amy Tan. As your average southern white female, I'm not exactly versed in the world of Amy Tan's characters. But she takes me there. I find myself so completely involved in the world she writes about that I forget where I am. Isn't that why you pedalled your bicycle to the library in the summer when you were a kid? Amy Tan will remind you of that sense of discovery you had back then, when you were reading all the great classics for the first time and the discovery of it all was an addictive thrill that kept your library card smoking and well worn with use.

She has a gift in her storytelling for expanding the universe. Read this book.
