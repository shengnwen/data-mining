This the Disney story about Arial, the little mermaid &amp; all her odd assortment of friends that live with her in the sea.  My grand-daughter Britanie, is 4 years old &amp; just loves this book/ tape so much that she  wore it out. I love the idea that the cassettes follow the words in the  book so the children following the words read aloud, start to recognize  words that they hear.  I am in the process of trying to purchase her  another set. This is only thing she asked me to get again her for  Christmas
