In a touching and heart rending story, Mr. Stratton has captured one of the anomalies of life on this planet at this point in time.  "Chanda's Secret" deals with the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa.  While AIDS is significant enough in the United States it is truly an epidemic in parts of Africa, where up to 3 out of every 4 people have AIDS.  Stratton's book deals with the subject most artistically.

The biggest anomaly about the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa is that even though it is hugely prevalent, it is a huge stigma to have the disease.  It is not only a stigma for the patient, but for the patient's entire family.  Many would rather go off and die or commit suicide to spare their families from living with the shame of knowing they were an "AIDS Family."

In this book, the reality of the disease is portrayed through the eyes of a young girl in Africa.  She has to deal with most difficult life conditions, but then on top of all that, AIDS strikes at her house.  The story tells most tenderly and appropriately about the trials and tribulations of her dilemma and what could be done if only people were willing to face things straight on, rather than hiding from the reality.

The book is extraordinarily well written.  It is recommended for all readers between 12 and 112 for a close look at the HIV/AIDS dilemma in Africa.  Stratton shows true tenderness and care when he describes the reality, yet manages to get that reality across in rather stark imagery.  It is well worth the time to read.
