If you enjoy crafts, are excited about beading and love to give gifts to others or yourself, or even if want to start a small jewelry business, you'll fall in love with Easy Beading: The Best Projects from the First Year of BeadStyle Magazine.

The editors of magazine have gathered and tested more than 140 beading projects and put them into a wonderful beading book. And it's for the beginner and experienced beader.

What makes this book special is that it doesn't just provide you with projects. It also provides all the necessary information that a beader needs to be successful in creating the projects.

Each project is organized by the type of material used, provides concise and easy directions, and includes a supply list and step-by-step photographs to help you visualize your art.

It covers the various tools and materials, bead types, basic techniques, shortcuts to make beading easier and includes a handy index.

With Easy Beading you are able to make the project shown, adapt it to fit your needs or if you're inspired by a project you can use it as a vehicle to create your own one-of-a-kind piece of art jewelry.

Whether you want earrings, necklaces or bracelets, there are many exciting projects for all beaders. One of my favorites is The Name Game by Alicia Sandefur. It's a perfect gift project for a new mother or even the grandmothers. It is a bracelet made with alphabet beads that spell out the child's name. And the child's birthstone can be incorporated into the bracelet. How perfect is that?
