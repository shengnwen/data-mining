Harvey Daniels' book, Literature Circles, allowed me to start lit. circles in my classroom.  I never would have tried this cutting edge educational technique without his book.  He gives advice and worksheets, but also lets  real teachers talk for themselves and how it works in their classrooms. The  book also details, through real life examples, how lit. circles can work in  the K-12 curriculum of any classroom, and in any school. This is an  excellent book for lit. circle beginners
