I have now read a number of books in this genre, with this being one of the first.  That is probably the proper place for it.  

It gives a lot of perspective on Christian history which I never would have guessed - plus many quirky anecdotes, such as how the image of the witch with the pointed hat and the devil with horns and a tail were derived from the church (in the author's opinion), and how the easter bunny came to deliver eggs.

Some of the information might be hard to take at first, but some of it is undeniable.  After reading many other books, this one seemed to present a good overview, without delving into theology questions or pursuing issues which other texts treat with some depth.

I found it a quick read, and left me hungry for more information on many of the issues it presents
