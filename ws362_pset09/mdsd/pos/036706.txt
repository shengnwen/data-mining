I've used the method in this book for several years, starting at age 47, I'm now 52, and it changed my life, made me stronger, healthier and more sucessful.  Highly, highly recommended.  There's a lot to learn but when  you do it completely for awhile, and then you see others coming into the  gym doing their routines, you really see the superiority of this method.   It is totally thought out and very beneficial for both men and women.  I  have started my daughter using it, and she has seen the same great results.   Kudos to the master.  I could lose his movies, but NOT this book
