My father had a giant book of cartoons from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that I never got tired of reading as a kid.  Some of the cartoonists that I learned to love way back when, such as Chas. Addams, Sidney Hoff, and Wm. Steig, are present and accounted for in this 1994 collection of cartoons devoted to the practice of the law (by those who have yet to get it right).  However, most of these 85 cartoons are by some of the newer kids on the block, such as Michael Maslin and Danny Shanahan, who just do strike my funny bone with as much regularity as the old masters.  The looks on the faces of the lawyer and his two clients in the Steig cartoon is not equaled throughout this book and their is not a better caption than Chon Day's lawyer sadly informing his client, &quot;I've just about resigned myself to your getting twenty years.&quot;  These are amusing enough, but really not up to the quality I expect from &quot;The New Yorker.&quot;   On the other hand, if you were to give this book as a present to a lawyer acquaintance, they are not going to be terribly offended (which may well be the problem in a nutshell).   Still, "The New York Book of Lawyer Cartoons" is worth a look through, just like an issue of the magazine.  I always read all the cartoons whenever I see a copy lying around.  Oh, and the listing of what movies are playing in the revival houses.  The thought of going to a theater to see a Chaplin, Bogart or Hepburn movie still sounds like high culture to me
