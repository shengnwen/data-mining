Rascal
Sterling North
 
Rascal, by Sterling North, is an autobiography written in 1963. At age twelve, Sterling is a strong and smart boy, who has been helping his father and himself get by in their home ever since his mother died a year ago.  Every once  and a while, his older sister, Jessica, comes to see how they are doing. Sterling and his friend are out enjoying the summer when they come upon a mother racoon and her newborn babies. When the mother is scared away, Sterling takes one of the little raccoons for his own, naming it Rascal. Rascal is a very odd racoon, who enjoys being inside and around people. As the book goes on, Rascal and Sterling both grow up, learning life lessons along the way. The end is great, and Sterling ends up having one year that he will never forget. This book gives a great sense of feeling from the character's perspective and what it would be like to be in their shoes. The one thing that was not the best was that it was a little bit on the shorter side. It would have been great if it were longer.  Aside from that, it was a great book. People who enjoy humor and adventure books would like to read this book.
