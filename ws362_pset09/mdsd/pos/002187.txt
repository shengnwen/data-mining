I enjoyed this sequal even more than the first book. I found it a deep and detailed insight into Agnes and her life as her children leave home and then return. I developed a lot of sympathy with the character of Agnes. 

I actually read this book first and then went to get the first book. I was a little surprised that some events in the second book were not built up to in the first. I did not get the impression that Agnes husband was in any way unstable in the first novel, but in the second Agnes suspects that he committed suicide.

I loved the cover of this book as well as the content. The Scofield family were really brought to life. The descriptions of the families interactions were so real and I could really imagine being there with them at their family gatherings
