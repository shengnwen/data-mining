I had high expectation for this book. The book is enjoyable, and I can so recognize so many people descrived as liars etc around me, and want to explore how well to learn to  read the other people.
However, on the same time some small things seem to growing bigger while reading the book; the style is the same than an Italian law student would use for her thesis, just spiced with far too many examples of every day life (of the kids of the friends of the author, of the people that the author has observed in coffee shops) and so on. The descriptions are sometimes very good, and give a clear picture of the stereotypes, yet I can't but have one image based on the book of Dr Dimitrius: braggadacia (too many examples of famous trials in the examples. If all those OJ Simpson references aren't only for marketing?); over use of foreign terms when there are equivalent English ones (most from German, French, a few Italian etc) - suggesting the people who have a lot of money are supposed to spend a lot of money in clothing etc; and the most weird: the author uses the words she and her in over 90 % of the cases whenever it would be a generic he/she or his/her, the he/his being on very special occasions. 
It would be great to be able to meet Dr Dimitrius just to see how close or far of the image based on her writing would prove to be to how she acts 'in real life'
