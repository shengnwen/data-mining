I agree with the other readers, with one caveat: an annoying distraction for me while reading this otherwise excellent book was the author's chronic use of incorrect terminology when referring to female genitalia.  There are at least 5 or 6 points in the book where she refers to a woman's vagina, when what she clearly means is vulva.  It's just irritating when female writers, especially, don't know the parts of the female body
