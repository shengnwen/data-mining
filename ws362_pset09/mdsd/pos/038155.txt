The text Trauma and Recovery is an insightful book that outlines the many horrors and ramifications of psychological and physical trauma, as well as the arduous path to partial recovery.  I use the word partial because it is not only what the text itself states (211), it is what I have observed as a ministry professional.  Traumatized persons lose their senses of trust and selfhood, senses that are extremely difficult to regain once they are lost.  This is especially true of those who are chronically abused.
	Dr. Herman begins her treatise of this topic with an historical backdrop and proceeds with a well articulated presentation of trauma as is it is commonly seen and understood by practitioners as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  The various symptoms of this disorder are outlined and explained clinically and pragmatically.  As the chapters unfolded, I found myself in a position where I could almost hear the screams and cries for help coming from the oppressed and abused.  From my past work with war veterans in a clinical setting, I revisited many of Dr. Herman's case studies in the context of my own mind and experience.  I believe that she is extremely accurate in her descriptions of PTSD in the various populations of victims.
	The two major emphases of the book, trauma and recovery, are logically connected in its content.  For example, on Page 133, the author states that the core experiences of trauma are disempowerment and disconnection from others.  Therefore, recovery seeks to empower the survivor and create new connections.  It is interesting how much emphasis Dr. Herman places on relationships within the healing process.  Isn't it intriguing that the corrective for abusive or traumatic relationships are wholesome relationships, and that healing can only happen within the context of these wholesome relationships?
