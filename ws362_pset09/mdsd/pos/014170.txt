Reading this book was a review of what Peter would speak about in his classes in the early 1990's until he died.  Professor Drucker had tremendous perception of what was happening in the world.  He often said, "I will not tell you anything you don't know but I will tell you things you do not perceive".  He accomplishes this in this book.  Peter is not a visionary, he writes about things that are currently happening.  He does not provide the answers for todays issues but rather clarifies the questions.  He does not look at the world's issues as left or right but as a manager would who is faced with addressing them.

Everyone in the world, especially society's leaders, should read and re-read this book.

I have asked my grandkids to read this so that they will have a better understanding of the world they are growing up in
