I have found this volume to be a wonderful, valuable resource for Christian-Buddhist dialogue and comparitive study. I have for many years now studied ways of understanding the Christian gospel from perspectives other than the majority Greek philosophical system. What a treat to find a scholar of Fr. Keenan's calibre! Fr. Keenan provides a lucid and profound explanation of some of the foundational contours of (Mahayana) Buddhist thought. He also provides an excellent introduction to the minority Christian mystic school of thought. Fr. Keenan's exploration of how to utilize a Mahayana world-view/philosophy in understanding and interpreting anew the Christian gospel stands as an achievment in Christian-Buddhist comparitive study. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a coherent, thoughtful method for integrating Christian and Buddhist thought
