I've read 3 of Jorge Cruise's books and found something I was looking for in each of them.  8 Minutes in the Morning book -- pros: love the exercises,  cons: hate the eating card system.  8 Minutes for Real Shapes, Real Sizes book -- pros: love his enthusiasm, journaling ideas, goal setting and how he addresses emotional eating, system for controlling portions is very easy to follow, cons: exercises are too easy overall.  The 3-Hour Diet -- pros: love the science behind eating every 3 hours, cons: in reality, it's hard to stick to a 3 hour schedule, exercise plan is nearly non-existent in this book.   While each book has it's strong and weak points, overall, Jorge's ideas do work.  In the course of 3 months, I lost 30 pounds.  Real Shapes/Sizes provided the motivation and portion control, 8 minutes provided the exercise routine and The 3 hour plan kept me for eating too often.
