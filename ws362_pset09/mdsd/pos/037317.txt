"Ruth Culham masterfully unlocks the magic of writing for teachers and students alike.  She's created an invaluable resource for primary teachers to use in guiding children as they begin the journey of learning to write.  Included are suggestions on what to say to young writers, teaching ideas, examples of student work, scoring guides to assess primary students' writing and much, much more!  Ruth's book will touch your heart and leave you excited about writing.  Voice in non-fiction?  You bet!  Anything's possible, once you know the traits."
