I first learned of the existence of this book from a passing reference in a Sunday New York Times Book Review magazine; it was given a left-handed compliment (something to the effect that should you want to know all the minute details of the band's history, it could be found in this book). That's pretty much the sum of it - this is a great book about one of the greatest (and most under-rated) bands in music history. However, the author does not ignore the members' flaws and shortcomings; this is a very objective look at a band who was responsible for its limited commercial success. However, Roxy's influence on contemporary music can not be denied, far ahead of its time
