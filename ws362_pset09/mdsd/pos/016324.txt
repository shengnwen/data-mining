Like other WW I history buffs, I had long searched for Albertini's legendary work.  Used copies of the three volume set I found on the net were both incomplete and too expensive.  It was with great pleasure that I saw the Enigma Press reissuance of this work offered through the History Book Club for only $45.00.  To my great disappointment, the newly released work was riddled with typographical errors of the most disconcerting kind:  sentences running together for lack of periods; numbers inserted into words; incorrect spacing withing words and between words in sentences; incomprehensible symbols for times and dates.  Every page of this work is riddled with incomprehensible errors.  This new and updated version is also an example of false advertising since there is no new information or interpretation of Albertini's research or his own role during the war.  Because my search for any usable copy of this book was so extensive and frustrating, I have decided to hold on to this wretched reissuance rather than use it to wrap dead fish
