[Mild SPOILERS ahead, and please note that my comments do not relate to any translation, as I have only read the book in Russian.] Absolutely magnificent. Particularly admirable is the authors' ability to conclude this novel, more or less a loose series of episodes, with a meaningful, tragic, moving ending! It was chilling and terrifying; I definitely didn't expect it to end on this note. Well, the authors have shown they are masters on more than just one level, that of humour, which surely offers dozens of unforgettable moments throughout the book. The masterful command of the Russian language is shown throughout. Now what is the timeless appeal of _The Twelve Chairs_? It is, first, that there is no bad person in which there wouldn't be certain qualities that are highly admirable, if not redeeming: see the inexhaustible energy and cheerfulness of the evil Ostap Bender. Secondly, the novel excellently shows how the quest for material goods turns humans into, literally, animals: the action concludes with a wolfish howl by the absurd Ippolit, and who could forget the mercenary priest, preaching to the birds at the top of a mountain cliff
