"Demonology" was written by King James I of England (formerly King James VI of Scotland) to defend his belief in the power of witches (and thereby justify their torture and execution).  It's valuable as a historical record of a particular time and mindset, and could have benefitted from an introduction written by someone with knowledge of the historical context.  What it has is an introduction written by someone who needs to re-take high school world history.  Never mind that he doesn't know what Old English actually was (hint: "Demonology" is not written in it); he also confuses Mary Stuart (mother of King James) with Mary Tudor, referring to her as "Bloody Mary."  (He also apparently thinks that Mary Stuart was the Queen of England.)  Buy the book, but if you're new to the study of this period, don't believe anything written in the introduction
