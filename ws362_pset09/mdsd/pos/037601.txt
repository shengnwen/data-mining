I love all of Gemmells work and with the completion of this book, i have now read them all. the story is great, the characters  are developed enough, but i just felt that this one lacked a little something. dont get me wrong, i enjoyed it and recomend it to any fantasy readers. (maybe it lacked his usual blood and guts that i enjoy in a book). i give this book 4 stars, but if you want just a stand alone book, something that is not part of a tedious series, than this is the book for you
