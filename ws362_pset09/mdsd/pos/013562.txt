I really like the organizer, but I agree with one of the other reviews that the pockets need to be reinforced. 

Also, I am already in need of filler pages.  There isn't enough black recipe sheets for a person who would want this type of organizer.   Where can I get more blanck recipe sheets?  It is an odd size, so you really need to be able to purchase them from the manufactuer.
