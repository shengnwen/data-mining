As stated in other reviews, this is essentially a picture identification book. If you are looking for a dichotomous key for invasive non-native and native plants for Western states, this does not exactly fit that description, but it is still extremely useful. I know many land managers and scientists who have used this book frequently, and it always gets well-deserved high praise.
I was also very confused about the publication date, edition, ISSN, etc., until I consulted the University of Wyoming Bookstore, which was very helpful
