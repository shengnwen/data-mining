I always wonder what makes a book a good story to nominate for a Pulitzer prize? Even though I knew NIGHT was about the holocaust I still wondered what would make this book a winner. 
My son had a copy of the book and loaned it to me. I read it in one sitting and not because it is only about 100 pages long, but because I was able to get under the skin of a man who endured unspeakable experiences and survived and found some humanity in all the horror. I love the last line of the book...priceless
