This is suppose to be a follow up of Somthing Borrowed but I actually read this first then Something Borrowed.  I enjoyed this one more and it really didn't matter which order you read them in.  This is a book about the pretty, popular girl, Darcy who has life handed to her on a silver platter.  She never really worked hard for anything and could have any guy she wants, and knows it.  She is engaged to the dream guy but has a fling with one of the groomsmen.  She thinks she will follow through with the wedding but finds out she is pregnant by the groomsmen and then she finds the groom having a fling with her maid of honor.  It is nice to see the brat have egg on her face after a cake life but it takes her a while to be truly humbled.  After Darcy is humbled she starts a new life and learns to forgive.  This book is comparible to Confessions of a Shopaholic
