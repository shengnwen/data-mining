As a graduating senior myself I can partially understand some of Cedric's struggles as a high school student.  Probably many others can also because we all went through it.  I, myself, have the priveldge of growing up in a afluent neighborhood and school district.  I can see how difficult it was for someone wanting to acheive so much and to not relate with his fellow students and join in on the culture they lived.  Though through his mothers gift of faith, and strength.  Cedric Jenning's manages to leave the hallowed halls of his high school to go onto something great.  Ultimately proving to us that to do something great it takes a great leap of faith in ourselves to achieve something above what could be expected of us, and to rise above the situation we where born into and change it.  Cedric talks about dreamkillders and how so many people are given a situation weather for the good or for the bad and they settle just for that.  While many can't see the opportunity that lies behind the hard work of changing the situation.  Even those with good situation don't try to make it better and to settle for what they have.  Thoreau said that, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."  This book is a good message for all of those who read old, and young.  Especially for those getting ready to enter a new step of there life, or are just planning to stay in the one they are now.
