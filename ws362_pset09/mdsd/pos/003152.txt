Tad Crawford has written a whole series of books out of his expertise in the law and creative arts, with a special focus on visual arts. I'd suggest looking at Tad's other books, too, since this one is more action-focused without extensive explanations of the whys and wherefores of it. 

"Business and Legal Forms" has the documents you'll need, such as model and property releases, copyright transer forms, publishing contracts and sales forms. His descriptions are very helpful. Of greatest practical use, though, is the included media containing MS Word documents of all of the forms.
