     I enjoyed this novel so much that I went out and bought a Dr. Smile therapist to have as my own.  Indeed, last week in my once real therapy session, my own Dr. Smile asked me what I thought of him. Being immersed in TSPE, I answered, 'I don't worry about you because I know you are merely an hallucination I see once a week'.
     As a child of the sixties, I am ashamed I never heard of PKD before.  Where was I while being transmogrified by psychedelic mornings. I can't speak about this novel cogently except to say: this is a film waiting to happen. This and 'martian time-slip'. Before reading Dick, I thought 'Being John Malkevich' was novel.  I realize, it was PKD who created much that has followed. Sorry not to make sense in time order or structure but my jaws interlock and my hand mechanically probes perhaps forever in orbit as you will too; trust me, even without chew-z. In short, a really triumphant experience for each of us who has ever grappled with time and our own private space between misfits and miscreants and the passion of an existential moment
