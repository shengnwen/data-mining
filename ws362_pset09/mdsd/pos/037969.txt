There's a lot of fascinating stuff here, but you almost have to read between the lines to get there. I agree with the other reviewer who says that it's more like a Gerstner biography than properly a look at the turnaround itself-- more interesting to me would have been less personality and more a look at how a pure business methodology approach (a la McKinsey) replaced the former technical focus and how that impacted the company. While it was amusing to get a feel of the personalities, it was often distracting when trying to read for a real case study
