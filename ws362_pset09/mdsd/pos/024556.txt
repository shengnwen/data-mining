Saffo. As you have never seen her before. As a woman, a wise and a passionate soul. We have so little on Saffo that the Historical parts are more on the backbround of the historic age where she lived than on herself. A true history about her with the little things we have would not be possible. But the fiction is really very nice and this is one of my favourite books. I do reccomend this book to who likes this genre. Buy it
