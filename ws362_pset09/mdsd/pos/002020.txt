This was a fantastic book.  It really made me think about the politics of organ donation and the hardship of having a child with a terminal illness.  The story is told from the perspective of each family member as well as the lawyer representing the well sister/organ donor.  I really felt compelled to side with the well sister, but as a parent I could empathize with the parents as well.  This book will keep you up late until it's finished...a great read
