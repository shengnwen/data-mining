This book opened my eyes to a world of knitting outside of yarn stores, scarves, and baby blankets. Some of the coolest patterns around for younger knitters! I knit the bag out of tulle, the ribbon slippers, and the wire baskets. So cool. They make great gifts and starting points for different projects. 

Most of the projects are quite simple, basic knits and purls, and the focus is really on the materials. I use it mainly as an idea book. Great one for the collection
