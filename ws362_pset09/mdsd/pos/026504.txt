Nate the Great is a cool detective who solves lots of mysteries.  In this story he is trying to find out who is dumping Oliver's trash.  We liked it when Nate the Great went undercover to solve the case.  The best part was when Nate runs into a &quot;Stinky Surprise&quot;!   We think this is a  great book for all second graders
