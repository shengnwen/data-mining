I think Chocolate Fever deserves 4 stars because it was the funnies book I have ever read. Chocolate Fever is funny because Henry gets a diseases that gets him really embarassed and he gets himself in a lot of trouble. The reason I recumend this book to others because anyone can read it or give it to someone for a gift
