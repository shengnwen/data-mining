I read this book about 25 years ago. It was a textbook for a graduate course, The History of the English language, Of course, I cannot make very specific remarks about something that I read so long ago, but I can state  that I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  It was complete, well documented, and  utterly fascinating!  It enabled me to understand so much more about how  people speak and think, how language changes, and how it stays the same
