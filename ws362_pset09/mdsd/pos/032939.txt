So far I've read the first three volumes of the Preacher saga. This is my favorite so far, perhaps because it seems to have the most amusing perversion of all three. For any preacher noobs, I would recomend starting at the beginning.

Side note:
When I first read the Preacher I thought that the accents were a bit off... then I realized that Cassidy is from the British Isles. If you know that, the dialogue is way more realistic
