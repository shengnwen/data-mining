I bought this as a gift for a precocious toddler who absolutely adores books.  Her ideal day is spent wandering from book to book, preferably with you reading all of them out loud to her.

What I like about this book is that it's open-ended.  You can talk about the pictures in any way that you like.  There are no words and -- like viewing a painting in a museum -- there is no single right way to react.  You can respond to the cover art as "tied" and "untied," but you can also choose neat/messy, or new/old, or tying/sitting, or any other combination of words you choose.

Furthermore, just because the pictures include opposites, and the title mentions opposites, there are no rules which say you have to take notice of the opposites.  You could just as easily choose to talk about the colors, or shapes, or what's in the background.  Because of this, I think this book is well suited for kids who don't want to "sit still and listen."  It's a book that is well-suited for interaction and discussion.

So ultimately, what I like about this book is that it requires you to engage your brain, and to respond yourself, instead of accepting a path that was pre-determined by the author.

Of course, that's exactly what offended this particular toddler about this book:  She was looking forward to someone else reading aloud to her, and was rather surprised to discover that not all books are like that.  After an inspection to verify that there were, indeed, no words printed on the pages, she took away the "defective" picture book and brought out another for me to read to her
