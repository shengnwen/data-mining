Reading and using this book is almost the same as taking Anastasia's online Intensive Picture Book courses.  In fact in some ways it's like taking IPB 3 !  Anastasia leads writers a few steps further than many "how to write for children" books do.  The exercises help you study and discover what works while they also set up habits of keeping a writer's journal for you to think about your writing process, and a reader's log to keep track of what you've read.  There's something for everyone- from board books to YA, fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.  Make sure to check out the great info in marketing and in each appendix
