Mr. Izsak has gathered a lot of useful information both on how to approach the task of organizing a garage and the kinds of systems that are available.  Both the logical suggestions for how to tackle such a big project and the chapter on the organizing systems were very helpful.  I found the latter especially useful and a time-saver because I could zero in onthe kind of systems that best fit my personal situation.

It was also very easy to use the table of contents to find the parts that I most needed.  Mr. Izsak's book provides the tools to tackle a job most of us dread but really need to do.
