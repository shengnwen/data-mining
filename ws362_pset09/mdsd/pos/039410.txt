Just finshed Sweet Forever and it blew me away. This is not only the best crime fiction book I have ever read, but it is one of the best books period. Pelecanos puts you right in the middle of  D.C. in the mid 80s, and you actually feel like you are there. Do yourself a favor and read this book you will not be sorry
