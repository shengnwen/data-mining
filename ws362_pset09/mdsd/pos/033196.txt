Being Southern born, when I first picked up this book I went looking for things that Grandmother used to cook. 

In the first few pages I found "Hot-Water Cornbread." Yup! The recipe was right on. To be sure, Grandmother used yellow cornmeal rather than white, but that's OK. And in the recipe says "stir until the batter is the consistency of grits." -- That's southern. 

Speaking of grits, there are six different dishes cooked with grits. I've only cooked four of those so far. (For you yankees, grits is polenta.) One recipe was not so good, it called for quick cooking grits. No self-respecting southerner would use quick grits. Instead get some good stone ground yellow grits. (Google will give you a lot of choices when you search for "stone ground grits." I've not tried them all, but all that I've tried have been good.) 

This book is a collection of recipes from Southern Living magazine. They take a pretty wide interpretation of southern including gumbo from Louisiana, some Texas/western dishes, and even some Mexican. 

As an annual book, this one contains a selection of recipes that were well received by the readers and by the magazine staff. It's a great book
