I just read the book this afternoon in one sitting and loved it!  I completely fell in love with Frank.  Despite his dominant nature, his heart was still very vulnerable.  I just wanted to nestle into his arms and love him and protect him forever.  The second to the last chapter even made me cry.  

I also liked how it was rather "light" on the BDSM elements.  The games they played, while very erotic, seemed milder than those portrayed in many other books.  The focus wasn't on weird, sadistic acts of pain, but on their love and need for one another.  It was, at heart, a love story. 

The only thing that I didn't particularly care for were certain aspects of Kristine's personality.  I just had a hard time relating to her character in some ways.  I'm more of a shy, modest girl and had difficulty relating to the whole stripper, drinking, partying scene...and her indignation to some of Frank's actions.  I just would have reacted differently had I been in her place.  Also, her diction didn't seem very lady-like.  Some words in her narration just seemed a little unclassy to me.  Her character works great with the story, and she was very likeable, but I do think I would have enjoyed the book a bit more if I'd been able to relate to her better. 

Anyway, excellent book.  I highly recommend
