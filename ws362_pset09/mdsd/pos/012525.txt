I wish Carolyn had addressed her snarky tone with Apprentice candidates. From another manager, it's an abuse of power. I don't agree with Carolyn's advocacy of outsourced parenthood. What's the point? But I was pleasantly surprised by the content of her book. It was likely written by her, given the errors in grammar and content organization. But it is very open about office politics, a topic rarely discussed so openly and personally. And her advice on how individuals need to position themselves relative to employers to promote success is spot on.
