Who is Joe Eszterhas?  His most famous films are Basic Instinct,  Sliver,  Showgirls,  and Jade.  His first screenplay was made into a film which I've always considered one of the most underappreciated movies of all time,  F.I.S.T.  He has written lots of others.

About the book,  I'll be honest,  I loved it.  

After the New York Times Book Review came out I ordered it immediately.  The following Saturday, when I first had the time to devote to it, I spent the entire day reading it from cover to cover (like many of the studio executives who Eszterhas lampooms,   my lips must move as a read because I'm a slow reader).  Here is my take on it:

First,  I think that the chapters are taken from Eszterhas' writing notebooks. That is a good thing.  This is the raw data of years of reading,  listening,  and contemplating Hollywood and the screenwriters craft.  It is filled with seemingly good advice,  but advice you'd never get from, say, Richard Walter,  head of the Screenwriting Department at UCLA.  This is less genteel advice.  This is straightalking from a veteran who has been in the trenches,  survived the battles,  and is here is help teach other screenwriters how to make it in the business.

Don't expect a smooth flowing narrative,  except for the last chapter about his unproduced screenplay---"SACRED COW"---about and American President caught on film having sex with a cow,  and owning up to it when he is caught.  That Chapter,  unlike the others,  was written as a single essay.  The remainder of the book is a collection of thoughts about writers,  agents,  directors,  producers,  actors, and Hollywood from someone who knows.

P.S.  Why did I give it only 4 stars instead of 5?  Amazon suffers from grade inflation.  To Kill a Mockingbird gets 5 stars from me.  4 stars is still pretty darn good
