I think Bronte's 'Jane Eyre', as well as an excellent read, provides a brilliant insight for todays readers, into the life of 'misfits' in the 19th century. Jane is a poor, plain, governess who throughout her life struggles to belong somewhere, have some sort of position in society. She had no family, therefore when she discovered cousins in Mary, Diana and St.John, she willingly gave them each 5,000 pounds out of her inheritance. Jane is a strong woman who fights to maintain her moral and religious values even though tempted several times to put them aside. Jane seeks emotional fulfillment and detests society's idea of marriage (marriage for material wealth, political power, position etc). Rochester is Jane's intellectual equal and therefore she agrees to marry him, until she realises he has almost tricked her into a bigamus marriage. Then she must flee Thornfield in order to maintain her values and self-respect. Only when she has her own financial independence and no longer needs to be Rochesters mistress, can she return to him and marry him. He is now actually dependent on her for vision and other things because he has lost the use of one of his hands. Jane Eyre is a satisfying novel that gives women inspriration to stand up for their rights and not be submissive because some men consider them inferiors. Jane teaches women to value themselves. I think in writing this fantastic novel, Bronte had sent out an excellent message to those who believe women should be controlled by men and Jane was the perfect protagonist to get this message across
