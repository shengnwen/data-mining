This book is a fascinating and practical guide to choosing the right foods and lifestyle for your own body.  It starts with simple questionnaires to help you understand your body from an &quot;energetic&quot; or Eastern perspective.  Prout describes symptoms of excess &quot;heat,&quot; &quot;cold,&quot; &quot;dampness,&quot; &quot;dryness,&quot; and &quot;wind&quot; -- all Chinese diagnostic terms.  The book then goes on to give the foods and lifestyle strategies to best remedy these imbalances.  Someone who is overweight should avoid &quot;damp&quot; foods, for instance, as opposed to counting calories, the Western approach that has obviously been failing us so far.  Imbalances are easy to spot and I enjoyed figuring out my pattern.   I really like the fact that moods (a temper, irritability, depression) fit in with body patterns.  This is  a customized approach to eating right and is based on thosands of years of observation rather than hundreds of years of &quot;science&quot; which only seem to correspond with increasing disease and obesity rates
