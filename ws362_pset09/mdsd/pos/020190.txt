I agree with all the other reviewers: I was disappointed that there weren't patterns, but I also think the book provides really great design inspiration. The other two books on remaking clothing that I've looked at in the past three days (Generation T and Sew Subversive) were both quite basic and not that inspiring, design-wise... this book is much more design-conscious and exciting. For someone like me who has some confidence about messing around with materials, sewing, knitting, etc., this is a great book to get ideas bouncing around. But you'll have to work out the how-tos yourself, for the most part. Definitely a keeper, and well worth a look.
