This story really started out with a bang.  Fran is finally leaving her abusive husband  Bobby, and very much like the movie "sleeping with the enemy" it is time to relocate and start a new , different life.

Fran brings along her son in an effort to protect them both, and the story line there is a sad and sometimes intense one, as would be expected when you rip a boy form his father's life.

Fran faces the usual challenges of forming a new life, plus the added stress of staying hidden from her past.  The stroy is interesting, I will give Quindlen that, and I was impressed by her portryal of Bobby- so believable and frightening at times, but her writing style is not my favorite, and at could be a bit  cliche in parts of the book, thus the 4 stars. 

 If you liked the movie mentioned, or similiar "Lifetime" stlye stories this will be a good one to add to your list.  Not a hard read, maybe felt a bit long at some places, but the story is good enought to keep you invlolved.  Definitely worth it's 4 star rating
