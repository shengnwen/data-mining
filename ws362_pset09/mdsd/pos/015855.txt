This is a great book for learning how to draw animals, as advertised by the no-nonsense title.  A junior high school art student would probably find this book challenging, and advanced art students can still glean nuggets from this richly illustrated book.  For the price, this is a tremendous value compared to glossy, full-color texts that don't cover as many different kinds of animals.  This book has been around for a while, but its effectiveness has not diminished, unlike some others of the author's titles.
