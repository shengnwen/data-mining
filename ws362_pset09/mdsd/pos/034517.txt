I was kind of leery when I saw this book with no John Naisbitt, but felt that I needed to read anything like this that is predicting the future. The past Megatrends did pretty well in their long range predictions. As I looked further I saw that the current author was part of the team, indeed was married to John Naisbitt, who put together the earlier books. 

Now that I've gotten through the book I find myself of mixed emotions about it. She projects that a kindler and gentler world of business will emerge. She backs this up with research from a number of companies that have moved to a model where spiritual values are integrated into the corporation from the top down. This has resulted in better employee and customer relations, good things by any standard. She then gives seven areas in which she further defines what she calls Conscious Capitalism and are the seven megatrends that she forecasts. 

The seven megatrends, all seem pretty related to the general concept of increased spiritual values in the corporation. While she may be correct, I hope she is, I find myself wondering on a few points. 

Increased spirituality may be very good in some ways, but this too can go too far, i.e. Islambic spiritual fundamentalists crashing into the World Trade Center, or rioting today in Copenhagen over a cartoon printed in the newspaper. And in our own country the Christian fundamentalists bombing abortion clinics and wanting to teach our kids the Biblical way rather than the scientific way on issues like evolution. 

All of the megatrends she mentions are business related, I don't see the non-business aspects discussed here as they were in the original books, such as the predictions on computers and communications. 

What will other big trends portend of the future: global warming, the end of the oil based economy, nano technology, the chances of a big plague (as if AIDS wasn't big enough).
