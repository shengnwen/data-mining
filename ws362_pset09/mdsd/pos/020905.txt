I love cooking and I have a lot of cooking books. I really enjoy this book because it was different. It didn't have any photos, but each course has a fun and sometimes helpful introduction. Really good recipes and not too dificult. 
If you like cooking you will enjoy it. If you want easy and fast recipes this is not what your looking for
