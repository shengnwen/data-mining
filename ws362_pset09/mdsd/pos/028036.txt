I read this book not looking for high Western literature, but more as a lens into the worldview and trends of contemporary Chinese urban bourgeois society. On that front, Shanghai baby succeeds: Wei offers a pleasantly narcissistic, Western-culture obsessed Plath-wannabe of sorts. Coco is over-the-top, at once both marvellously shallow and psuedo-intellectual, and I found the numerous occasional references and assumptions proferred on race, sexuality, feminism, commercialization and class to be like little candy rewards, sprinkled throughout a dirge of heavy-handed, unremarkable, but nevertheless pleasant romance lit.

I am in the process of moving to China, and certainly feel that Shanghai Baby has assisted in my crash-course self-education on contemporary Chinese society. Recommended for such purposes. If you're looking for the next Tan or Murakami or Marquez, this isn't the novel you want. But if you enjoy your fare light and sweet on occasion, as a solid precis on the current state of the young "Cosmopolitan artist with Chinese characteristics," then read this book.
