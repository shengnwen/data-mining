I have been a longtime fan of Robert's work....unfortunately, lately it seems some of the story lines are becoming repetitive. This was refreshingly new and I read it twice before putting it down.

There are several different curves thrown into the mix of this book. Everything from Black-market baby selling, to ancient civilizations & their cultures, to theories of ghosts & curses, to dealing with ex-romances in the workplace. Only Roberts could intertwine this many storylines without making it confusing.

Here is the cliff-notes version: Witty and beautiful archaeologist Callie Dunnbrook, is sent to small town Woodsboro to investigate claims of 5000 year old bones found at a construction site. Unfortunately, the town isn't that friendly. When people start vanishing, many wonder...could it be a local or a curse from the disturbed graves? Not only must she wrestle with a possibly cursed dig site; but her partner for the dig, sent from the university, is none other than her ex-husband, Jake!! To make matters worse local, famous baker, Suzanne (think-Mrs. Smith's) claims Callie is her daughter who was kidnapped as an infant. Only problem is Callie wasn't adopted...or was she? 

Poor Callie must decipher clues to the past; Suzanne's, Jake's, the remains in the ground, and her own. As the old adage proves true, secrets never last forever
