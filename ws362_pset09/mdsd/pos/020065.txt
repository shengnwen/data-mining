This book is very interesting to read if you like to run, and running is what I like to do.  I liked to learn the facts about how running once was in the earlier days to how it is now.  I also liked to learn the stories behind the runners who broke the four minute mile mark.  You are able to learn that they are just normal people who are able to do something great with their lives.  They are able to continue to push themselves to the next level just to be the first person to break four minutes.  That is a great thing to achieve because very few people can do it.  It was a great book to read you want to read something and learn about running history at the same time.
