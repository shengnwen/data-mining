What a gorgeous book, rich with insight and absolutely sumptious writing. I checked it out on a recommend from Poets and Writers magazine and was absolutely engrossed.  The main character often speaks in a voice a bit more mature than we know him to be, but I was okay with that because his insights were positively priceless.
