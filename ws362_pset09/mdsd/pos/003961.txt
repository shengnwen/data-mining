   This book explains in easy terms why cancer is about always
not as a result of genetics but the result of the way we are
& have been living life in our bodies in our environment.
In the Complete Cancer Cleanse, you will learn tons of facts
about how to get well once again if fighting cancer that your
doctors don't know about.  You will discover all sorts of things
that can cause cancer to you that you did not know about & it's
not just food but much, much more! You can learn how to detoxify
your body with dietetic programs of cleansing your liver, colon,
lymph nodes, skin, kidneys, & more.  Learn which toothpastes,
shampoos, soaps, cosmetics, jewelry that you do not want to use
& others you will want to use as they are cancer friendly.
This book is just as SIGNIFICANT if you DO NOT HAVE CANCER as
it is for those of us who do, so it will inspire you to not
ever get CANCER in the first place as I unfortunately have due
to my past lifestyle choices.  Cancer is almost always preventable & it is up to you to not get ill in life! Isn't 
that WORTH it if you cherish living your single precious life
