One Hundred Years of Solitude is a beautifully written book filled with memorable characters and packed with raw emotion and truth. Why not give it five stars then? Well, it was a rough decision. From a writing perspective, this is top notch stuff, no questions asked. 

Some people have  called the book boring, which is not true. Most of the characters and their stories are highly entertaining. The problem I encountered was that once a certain character dies, or his/her story stops being the primary focus, it takes a while for the reader to get involved in the next character that the book chooses to focus on. There were certain characters I liked more than others, and I found myself really taken out of the book once they were relegated to secondary characters and I had to adjust to a whole new set of characters and subplots. 

Also, I never found myself confused by the similar names family members. Rather, I had a harder time keeping up with the numerous characters who only appear for two chapters and then die or just go off somewhere.

On the whole, I really enjoyed this book. Not one of my all-time favorite, but a beautiful book that really brough out emotion in me, especially towards the end, with that jaw-droppingly beautiful final sentence that ties together the overriding theme of the entire book.
