    I had only recently become aware of Edward Gorey and his works, and this was one of my first Gorey Books along with "The Gashlycrumb Tinies".  This book is not his most macabre work, yes, but it one of his most charming.  

    The story may seem relatively simple, and to a simple mind it is nothing more than a witty story that is full of nonsense, but to others it is slightly thought provoking.  The chapters are numbered in a strange order for a reason, and many small details of the book hold some significance.  Without giving too much away, if you stop and think about it, and if you look at the first illustration and then the part where the main characters reach the bush, you will begin to see what this story is, or rather may possibly be, about.  I'd rather not say what my interpretation is, but suffice to say this book cannot be reduced to a chronicle of nonsense which some narrow-minded people might say.

    It is true that not a lot of people will interpret the story the same way, but that's part of the appeal of it.  Other than its thought-provoking aspect, it is an extremely charming children's book.  The illustrations are delightful, the humor is subtle but funny, and the book is overall just a fun read.  Who can forget lines like "It was too dark to hear anything" or the alligator's emotionally deep verse, "I die"?  

    This book is amusing for all ages, whether your child is 8, 16, or an adult.  Even I, being a teenager, can't help but laugh at it.  While many may consider it inane, if you approach it with an open mind, you're in for an interesting experience.
