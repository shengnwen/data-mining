I read Lady Chatterly's lover for the first time in high school, and to be honest, it was more for the juicy bits than anything else. Five years later, though, it was an aside from a professor during a  lecture on Nabokov that convinced me to pick it up again.

This was the first novel that I'd read where I truly felt an inner conflict brewing - but in a good way. Lady Chatterly's Lover, though banned for its immorality on its publication, is a book that will force a person to question their own morality and moral judgements, and perhaps rethink them. 

It is a story of a young woman married to an older man who is confined to a wheel chair due to a war wound. Her husband and she have a respectful relationship, though she does not love him, and though he may love her, he is not particularly attentive. To cure her boredom and satisfy her libido, she turns to adultery. Her first lover is a egotistical Irish writer, but she leaves him quickly over "performance" issues. She finds herself attracted to Oliver, the gamekeeper on her husband's estate. They continue the affair under the nose of her husband, who, afraid that she will leave him, pretends not to notice. 

Lawrence's writing is sublime, to say the least. His descriptions  of the estate are picture perfect, and each scene is told almost cinematically. The characters are perfectly developed; you can feel Lady Chatterly's inner turmoil in the beginning of the novel as she copes with caring for her husband and her unsatisfied libido, without any social outlets but her husband's friends. As she begins her affair with Oliver, you notice how that tension that she held is slowly released - and how her husband, paralyzed and coping with a wife who spends less and less time with him, absorbs this tension. Beautiful read.
