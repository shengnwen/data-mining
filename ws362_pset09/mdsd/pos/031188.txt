This is exactly the book I've been looking for.  I've programmed in Java for 10 years and would code Javascript only at gunpoint because I could never find a way to get my arms around it.  Years and years of trial-and-error Javascript coding are all behind me now because I feel like I understand the guts of how Javascript works.  I've bought other books on Javascript, but they're all marginal or useless: they read either like a children's book or like the IRS tax code.  This book plows through Javascript systematically and neatly, with gobs and gobs of real-world comments that explain various schools of Javascript thought.  Some really advanced topics (like regular expressions) could have been postponed to appendices, but otherwise it was beautifully organized and almost effortless to read.  Bravo
