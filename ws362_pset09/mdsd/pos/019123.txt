While The Camel Club is certainly not the best David Baldacci book I've read, it does offer well-crafted, entertaining escapist fiction.  (For those who are interested, I think his best novel is The Winner, a story about a conspiracy to cheat a state lottery, which everyone who enjoys suspense yarns should make it a point to read.)  

But back to The Camel Club:  There are a couple of incidents toward the end of the novel that seem implausible, which is too bad because the plot is quite strong up until that point. Overall, however, the story engages the reader and reflects the current public awareness of terrorism and domestic security.

The characters are well drawn, and I especially liked the fact that the female characters are all strong women who don't rely on the men to do their thinking.  The members of the Camel Club -- Caleb, Milton, Reuben and the leader Oliver -- are terrific characters who are likable and who the reader can root for unconditionally.  Milton, who suffers from OCD, is particularly endearing, and Baldacci gets a lot of humor from his situation, but does so in a way that is affectionate rather than offensive or cruel.

Overall, this is a very entertaining read that holds the attention of an intelligent reader and makes you want to keep turning the pages late into the evening
