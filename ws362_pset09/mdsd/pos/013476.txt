Believe it or not, this was a great mini-series.  I loved Identity Crisis and would recommend it slightly more than this book, but of all the "Countdown" books which took some lesser known DC characters and pulled them out of the shadows, this book was the best.  I convinced a couple of friends to purchase this trade as well, and they agree with my assessment.  Give it a shot! The nice thing about lesser known characters is that it gives writers a chance to change them around for the better. Gail Simone took full advantage of that as she hand picked some seemingly strange characters and changed them into a very good working team. Be prepared for the sequel, "Secret Six", which starts in May.
