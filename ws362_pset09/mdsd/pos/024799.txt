Sometimes Buddhist teachings can seem inaccessable to Westerners, but this book is an exception.  It contains tremendous insights into uncertainty and impermanence and solid teachings on dealing with the unsatisfactory aspects of life.  It is not, however, just a book of dry teachings.  There are lively stories and snapshots of monastery life that add an extra dimension to the book.  I also enjoyed the softly humorous aspects of many of Ajahn Chah's teachings.  This book is well-written and hard to put down.  While perhaps not appropriate as an introductory text, I give it my unreserved recommendation for people with any background knowledge of Buddhism.
