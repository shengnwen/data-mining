The authors have achieved a triumph with this book, a superb synthesis of the period that brings the reader, as close as possible, to the state of mind of the principal characters and of the times.  I received more insight into Jefferson here in three pages than in some other whole biographies, though the authors are perhaps less sympathetic to John Adams than I think he deserves. This book should be read AFTER the reader is familiar with standard biographies of Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton et al and with the general history of the time.  Then reading this book will give you a depth of insight and understanding into this period that is very satisfying
