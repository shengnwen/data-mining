I have been reading up on global warming, pro, con and other. Though this book is slight and warming is but one topic, I have discovered its real flaw (one that applies to this and many similar books) - its conclusions are unacceptable. Not that they are arguable, provable, true, untrue, but rather they are unacceptable to the correct thinking folks who just love the idea of "crisis!" Everything is a "crisis" and I conclude that "Global Warming - the Crisis!" is largely, not exclusively, that.

Huge ice ages, warming trends, weather shifts, desertification and extinctions all occurred long before we climbed down out of the trees. Our contribution is miniscule and that is the fact. Sorry, no major funding for the "crisis" mongers.
