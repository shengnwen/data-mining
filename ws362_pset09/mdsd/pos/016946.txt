this is a beautifully written book. the prose is wonderful, the characters are vivid and distinct from one another, the plot is well worked out. 

the american publisher has printed a hint on the back cover: "who's likely to like this? fans of minette walters." this is an accurate statement. this novel is more about character and psychology, memory and human interactions than forensics or procedure.
