Other than the Malory Family, I know that Megan and Delvin book is Ms. Lindsey's best. Man of my dreams is my favorite book. I couldn,t put the book down if I want too. I love it. I now have 14 books by Johanna Lindsey and I intend to collect all books by her. Thanks Ms. Lindsey for being such an excellent writer.
