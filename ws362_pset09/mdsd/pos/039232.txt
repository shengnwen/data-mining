I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but this book is so amazing that I just had to comment. I read several books to my son every night. He is only 4 months old and usually reacts more or less the same to each book (generally lseems mostly to just enjoy sitting on my lap and looking at pictures). But Dear Zoo is different! He now has started to understand that the point is to lift up the flaps. And he just can't get enough of it! He actually started crying when I tried to go on to "Goodnight Moon". The rhythm of the text and the simple pictures, plus the fun of the flaps really has him enthralled. Highly recommended!
