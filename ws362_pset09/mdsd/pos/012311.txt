I love this bible.  My only  reservation is that the pages are so thin and the print is light.  The printing almost shows through the page to give an overall grey appearance. Also any highlite shows through.  Other than that, I love the commentaries and divisions of subject matter make it very easy to read.   I ordered a couple more for family members
