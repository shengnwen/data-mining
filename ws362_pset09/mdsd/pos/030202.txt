This book kept me interested and offers another great depiction of a Messianic figure taking the world by storm. It's a bit less realistic than Messiah, and I would recommend reading Messiah over Kalki. But if you've already read Messiah and want more, check this one out.

The story, overall, moves pretty fast and keeps you guessing. Down to the last page you won't know what's going to happen next.
