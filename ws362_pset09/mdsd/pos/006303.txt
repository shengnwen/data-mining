Jason is the quintessential green warrior.  Young, enthusiastic, exceedingly bright, and seemingly undaunted at the prospect of swimming against the current, Jason shares with us his passion for sustainable design.  Having spent the formative years of his career working with the veritable giants of the sustainable design field, Jason shares his unique perspectives and experiences that today's up and coming green warriors can only dream of.

A must for any aspiring architect, Jason takes the reader through the entire series of timeless principles that form the very foundation of sustainable design with loads of practical examples and current references to help empower the reader to internalize and apply those principles in their own practice.  At the end of our journey, we are convinced that it is the rest of the world that is, in fact, swimming against the current, and we are emboldened and encouraged to follow our instincts, and are reminded that good design not only can, but in fact must be sustainable.  He also dedicates an entire chapter to predicting the future of architecture, complete with a timeline for the next 100 years!

Jason specifically reaches out to encourage the next generation of green warriors with a chapter dedicated to understanding the drivers of, and barriers to, sustainable design in today's corporate structures and design firms, giving the reader a helpful "big picture" overview to help recognize the progress of an organization's corporate culture on the path to sustainability, and to better understand how to make a difference.

To complete the package as an essential resource, the appendices include Jason's own "Green Warrior Reading List", & a "Who's Who in Green Design".

A must-read for anyone serious about facilities design in the 21st. century.
