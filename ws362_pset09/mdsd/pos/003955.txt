Like many others, I have read numerous books regarding the Bush administration and their influences on our democracy and our values as a people.
This is one of two that stands-out for their dispassion, unimpeachable logic and irrefutable-meticulously done research.  The other is "All the President's Spin" by Ben Fritz and the good people at www.spinsanity.com .  I must admit that neither of these two books I have just mentioned are particularly relaxing-fun reading.  Research rarely is.
One of the essential points made by the two brilliant authors of "The Book on Bush: How George W. (Mis)leads America",  the always brilliant Eric Alterman and the former Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, Mark Green, are methods used by this administration which are fundamentally different than say, the Reagan Administration. Besides resorting to the raw power of audacity, that is to say; lying boldly and unapologetically; the Bush administration relies on lots of nice moderate or even liberal sounding words, to push their arrogant agenda.  Who can be against "clear skies", "healthy forest", "tax relief for working families", "leaving no child behind", or "liberating Iraq"?  Unfortunately a docile mainstream media which is all too influenced by the echo chamber of rightwing media rarely brings to light the difference between reality and rhetoric of this administration.
This book painstakingly does bring the reality to light with detailed and irrefutable research.
May I also suggest; read Eric Alterman's latest book, "When Presidents Lie: A History of Official Deception and Its Consequences". The catastrophic consequences of official lies are examined from FDR on Yalta to LBJ on the Gulf of Tonkin to Ronald Reagan on Central America George W. on...I always expect the uncompromising-honest-straightforward facts from Eric Alterman.
