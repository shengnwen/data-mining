I actually read another collection of Gogol stories but I have read &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, &quot;The Nose&quot;, and &quot;The Overcoat&quot;. The book is worth buying for Diary of a Madman or the Nose alone. These are both great stories that really show the uniqueness and talent of Gogol which seems even more amazing when thinking he was writing in the 19th Century. The Overcoat is a good story but the other two are classics and unbelieveable works of fantasy and social commentary that still seems relevant today
