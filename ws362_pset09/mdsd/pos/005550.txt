Why is it so hard to imagine humanity devolving? You think there is some mystical god who is going to save us from ourselves? 

I'm frankly much more willing to believe in humanity (d?)evolving into primates who form a symbiosis with trees.

And yeah, tool using dinosaurs. I don't find the idea all that out there; I mean, don't chimps use crude tools? Guess what, the book is clearly labeled science fiction and Baxter even included a note at the end explaining that this was largley conjecture. 

"The long shadow" was easily the most awesome chapter out of the book, and the one that has made me think most. 1000 years seems like a hell of a long time, but in the grand scale it is nothing... assuming you believe the Earth is older than 12,000 years, that is.

This is currently my favorite book, one that I've read probably 10 times now
