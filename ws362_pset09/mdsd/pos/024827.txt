Sociologist David Karp shares the insights gleaned from over 60 interviews of those who have loved ones suffering from the ravages of mental illness. He pieces together excerpts of these interviews to illustrate the different ways mental illness affects the lives of families and friends. Those interviewed share how they attempt to cope with such issues as personal feelings of guilt, the societal stygma associated with mental illness, and the frustration of dealing with a bureaucracy that is not always responsive. At the core of many of the interviews is a redeeming theme of hope. Karp's thesis is that the moral boundaries of caregiving necessarily shift as the mental illness emerges over time, and that it is imperative to balance the needs of the mentally ill person with the needs of those who provide care and support.  Karp reminds readers of the 4 C's: (1) I did not cause it, (2) I cannot cure it, (3) I cannot control it, (4) all I can do is cope with it.
