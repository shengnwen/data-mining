		Saving Shiloh by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor.
Imagine that your twelve years old. Your best friend has an imagination as big as the sky and thinks he's a detective. You're trying to help someone who is as stubborn as a mule but yet you don't give up on him. If you like stories like this you'll love this one.
	The book is set in a little town called Friendly in West Virginia. The main character   is a little boy named Marty. Who has a dog named Shiloh. He's had to work a long time to get witch probably have already read in the first book. He's trying to do anything to keep Judd's dogs from being mean. Then everyone in the counties trying to pin murder on him. Their blaming him for things that have been stolen out of some houses. And the only one who doesn't think it is him is marty. 	The best part of this book is you can be anyone and still make a big difference. 
	I would recommend this to anyone over the age of nine. This is a very good family book. For the parent to read to there child.
