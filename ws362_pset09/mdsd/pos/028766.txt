Probably the best book on Contract Theory I know. Very rigorous but with the posibility of a second non-mathematical reading. The conceptualization of most examples and motivations in terms of buyer-seller limits the scope to economists.
The book deeply analyzes topics usually casted aside by another handbooks.
