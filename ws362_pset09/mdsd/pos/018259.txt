I didn't think I was going to like this book, but it is very, very good. I have a library of esoteric books, mostly classics, and have the problem of running into the same information over and over again. Not the case with this book. I also thought this would be a book written from an outsider's view, but the respect that Mr. Christian shows his subject its figures reveal that he is a true student. His portrayal of initiation into the Egyptian Mysteries and the life of Julian stand out as exceptional sections of the book. This is a classic work.
