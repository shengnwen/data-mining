I am very pleased with this version of the NIV Audio Bible. It is of the highest quality and very enjoyable to listen to...especially with all the little "extras" that dramatize the background. It is  easy to imagine being there as you hear the animals, crowds and other sounds in the background. 
I hightly recommend this Audio Bible
