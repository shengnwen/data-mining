We the people of the United States like to think of ourselves as peace loving icons, holding ourselves up above the petty problems that affect the rest of the world. And there is a certain amount of truth to that. 

On the other hand, consider Sweden and Switzerland who haven't been in any wars for several centuries. The conclusion has to be that the United States has a fairly war-like culture. 

This book is written from the standpoint of looking at the present war in Iraq. His thesis is that this is not the first time we instituted a regime change. He starts with an analysis of what he calls our first first one, the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. (Being a Yankee he forgets the one about twenty years before that, but we Confederates remember.). 

I believe that the only redeeming grace we can offer is that in general the regime changes we have instituted have not been nearly as bad as say the Germans in Poland, the British in Zululand. While we've had incidents such as the one in My Lai, it was nothing like the Japanese Rape of Nanking. Indeed, in places such as the Phillipines, Germany and Japan we've fairly rapidly pulled out.
