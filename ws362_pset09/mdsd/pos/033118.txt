This book was great. Simple, easy to implement keys to success that make sense. This book helped me understand how I can tweak my inter-personal style to let my strong areas shine. Anyone who disrespects this book does not know the power of self-development, and will not benefit. It is an easy read. I plan to read it once a year to keep myself on track. Oh, and it is great for anyone who wants to advance their career, not just those who aspire to become the CEO
