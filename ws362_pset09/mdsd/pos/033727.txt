For anyone who wants to gain an understanding of the Chinese people, this is a good place to start.  With unusual candor and insight (especially for someone in his twenties), Mr. Hessler uses anecdotes to relay his observations of Chinese life and perspective.  An enjoyable read, both because it is well-written and because it is very interesting (and even humorous)
