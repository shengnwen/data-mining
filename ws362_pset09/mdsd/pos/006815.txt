This book was weird in the sense that, Jo is immediately so alien yet so understandable. A complex character, she embodies the every woman, with her seemingly perfect life. But with every page you realise how much like you she really is. She feels lost in herself, and her many roles,(lifes as she calls it}she feels that each is so seperate yet so easily does she fall from one to another. Her almost reckless abandonment of one life, in her youth for another, shows an almost schizophrenic personality division. She is running away to find herself. And yet, it is not over, in her middle age, when life is seemingly blissfull, she abandons the comfortable for the danger of the known past. So simply does the story unfold, with its onion-like layers, it makes you feel that I must have seen this coming. Mid-life crisis was never so dramatic. I feel the author is trying to convey a message; that life is a complex journey that has lessons to be learnt and everything that happens has a reason, and if the lesson has not been learnt, unresolved issues will come forward to pave the way
