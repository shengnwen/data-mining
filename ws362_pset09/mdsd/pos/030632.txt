This book is a clearly written, easy to follow, detailed and concise handbook on cartooning the head and figure by using several different styles and variations, and emphasizing humor and exaggeration. This fully illustrated reference contains over 3,000 step-by-step diagrams and illustrations and is structured into sixteen carefully organized sections that cover the basic and not so basic principles of cartooning. 
It includes general topics like caricatures, cartooning styles and techniques, the head and face, the standing, walking and running figure, different positions for the figure, and emotions and facial expressions (the alphabetized catalog of 150 emotions and expressions alone is worth the price of this book). He also goes into specific topics like hands, feet and clothing, pretty girls, babies and children, and sports cartoons. As an added bonus he includes additional topics such as Advertising Applications for Cartoons and Special Problems which cover specific characters like hobos, tramps and the military, and conversations, special attires and crowds, among others.
By studying this book as if it were a textbook on a course, doing all the exercises and reviewing each section afterwards, my cartoons have come to life in a very, very short time.
The invaluable and practical advice in this book is essential for any artist's reference library and can be particularly useful for beginners, cartoonists, animators, characters designers, and comic book artists. It also serves as a great source book for ideas.
