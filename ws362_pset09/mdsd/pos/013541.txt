Overall this is a good book and well worth every cent. The material is covered better than most data structure text books. It also avoids using recursion in situations when its not needed. For example, the texts chapter on red-black trees is probably the best I've seen. It explains key concepts while building on previous knowledge with notes to where the previous material was covered. The red-black tree is explained without using recursion, because the authors were smart enough to have realized the general reader cares about creating practical data structures without any or much lost in performance. Cormen et al does this well indeed. Each algorithm is laid out in pseudo-code that can easily be adapted to code in any language. One of my dissatisfactions was with the presentation of the pseudocode in that the indentation was done in a strange manner. This made the scope of the blocks of logic in certain algorithms confusing. Furthermore, the binding of the book is quite fragile and would most likely be broken with casual use as a textbook in college. However, I suspect the author did this to lower the price for college students and I thank him for that. In conclusion, this is near perfect book and is the reason why I give it four stars instead of five. 

If you are seeking a good data structure or algorithm textbook, then you cannot go wrong with Introduction to Algorithms
