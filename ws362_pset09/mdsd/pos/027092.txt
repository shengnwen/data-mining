Credibility is a leadership book based on the thought that through honesty, competence, and valuing people, leaders can be most effective.  When credible leadership exists, people have a strong desire to follow their leaders, not just because they have to, but because they want to.  When employees are committed to their leader, they are committed to the success of their company as well.

The book is easy to read and presents many interesting case studies and profiles of companies and leaders who apply this philosophy.  Divided into sections, the book explains the six disciplines of credibility: discovering yourself, appreciating constituents, affirming shared values, developing capacity, serving a purpose, and sustaining hope.  Useful applications of the theory and "next step" action plans are provided to help readers gain credibility in their own leadership roles.  Unfortunately the book is a bit dated, as it was published in 1993.
