I'd been wanting to read this book for a while, so when a chance gift certificate happened along, this was my purchase.  The title struck me right away to the fact that this would not be a scholarly, heavy tome on weighty matters within Firefly and Serenity.  Yes, intellectual issues were discussed, but it was in the manner of real people speaking, not some professor lecturing to a bunch of truant students.
I didn't agree with everything said in the book, and while we can all hate the network which didn't renew Firefly, that same network has given us Bones, and frankly, with lots of market forces in play, the book does degenerate into a bit of Fox is the evil, evil empire, cue Star Wars-ian music, a bit too much of the time.  But, I found each essay broad enough that it differed from its companions, and the lively, yet intelligent tone taken with the works assumed not only did the readers enjoy the show, but yes, also brought their own subtext, and in fact, it is this subtext which gave rise to some of the essays.
If you're watching a television show or a movie for more than the "ooh, pretty pictures" effect, then you're bound to think about it and ponder the various points.  Finding Serenity does just that.  It ponders the points raised in the television series, Firefly, and provides some interesting discussion on them.  A wonderful companion to the television series and the movie, which was released after the book.
