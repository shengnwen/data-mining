Cooking up a storm is a great cook book for kids of all ages. I have 3 kids ages 7, 11 and 16 and each one of them has enjoyed using this book to make some Fab food. Before this book they would get bored if they tried to use a cook book but with the pictures, explanations and real funny captions they were glued to it. Not only that but it has everything you could want to cook in it so its even useful for us adults. Anything that will get my kids in the kitchen making real food deserves some credit. I would definitely reccomend it!
