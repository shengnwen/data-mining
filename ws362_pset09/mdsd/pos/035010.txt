This is the best book on the Broadway musical to come out in a very long time.  The photo selection is amazing offering rare if never before published photographs from these great shows.  I particularly like the "side bars" of extra information and commentary.  The layout is absolutely beautiful and the text is informative in a highly entertaining way.  A fun read with plenty of eye candy for the musical buff
