I read this story as a child at the school library (after seeing it on Reading Rainbow) and enjoyed it very much. Now I'm an adult and have collected the books I remember from my childhood for a bit of nostalgia. Gregory is one of them. I have also collected it for my nephew. It's a sweet story and easy to read, perfect for any child
