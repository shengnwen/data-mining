Although I have had some background in perspective drawing there are alway situations that may trip me up. I like the way this book demonstrates these concepts from a basic viewpoint without being condescending or overly technical. I have used it to successfully teach perpective drawing to interior design students who had no previous experience. I think this book is useful as well to budding illustrators and artists
