Evan Marshall: I just had to let you know again, I bought your first book 16-step program to write a novel, and am very happy to say I've enjoyed it again.  Your Workbook Plan was a great follow-up to your first novel writing book...I only wish you would come out with a followup software program...I would be the first one to buy it. Please keep up writing these how-to wonders...and thanks again....I bought Storycraft software and I'm sad to say I got caught with a worthless piece of software  ..SAVE YOUR MONEY, and buy Evan Marshall's 2 writing books
