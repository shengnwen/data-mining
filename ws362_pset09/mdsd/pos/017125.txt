This is a good reference book for readers and writers, and possibly courageous public speakers.  A thematic index at the back of the book makes finding the right term easy.  The entries provide concise, clear definitions, as well as quoted sources which add clarity as to the origin and usage of the word or phrase.  These authorities are cross-referenced to an author/work bibliography in the front of the book, handy for those who wish to conduct further research.  Many of the euphemisms deal with sexual topics, a possible commentary on either the repressive or playful nature of our social mores.  Most of the words and phrases are modern, at least within the last fifty years, but some obsolete terms are included, often to show comparison to current usage. While not an exhaustive study of euphemisms, or a substitution for a good slang dictionary, this is a great reference book to have, to use, and to read -- just for the fun of it.
