The telephone rang, and she knew she was going to die.

Talk about a line to draw a reader into a story! And it did pull me into the first chapter.

Then I paused. What, he's making drug-scum into heroes and heroines? I didn't really want to go on. Yet, I couldn't resist the appeal of Perez-Reverte's prose. I'm glad I didn't. Because "The Queen of the South" is another winner by an author I'm really beginning to like.

"Queen" is a look into the sordid world of drug smugglers on two continents and, despite my distaste for the real thing, it's an engrossing romp. As I did, you may not find Teresa Mendoza appealing at first. But, she'll grow on you as you watch her grow from a teenaged narco's morra into a sophisticated woman worthy of her own corrido as she and her faithful bodyguard Pote facedown their enemies alone.

Perez-Reverte even throws in a surprise late in the book, which puts another light on his hero and heroine. But, I can't get into that without spoiling the story for others.

The author employs a technique in which the tale is told in alternate chapters by Teresa and an anonymous reporter, a method which adds a sense of reality to the tale.
