I was surprised at some of the reviews on this book, I have had good result with it so I can't say anything bad about it. :) 

This book has so many recipes it is insane (in a good way though). It is a great reference and a wonderful book to pull out when you just want to try something new. I am always looking for something new and interesting to try and boy does this book have it. On many occasions this book has saved me when I needed a last min cookie idea for office parties or my daughters classroom parties. Over all I give it 4 Stars, the book covers everything under the sun and all the recipes I have tried out have come out good.
