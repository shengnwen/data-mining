I purchased this book for my sister in January of 2000,  two days after she was diagnosed with Stage 4 small-cell lung cancer. She began chemotherapy treatments the next week, and simultaneously begin eating  exclusively through the plan in this book.  Throughout the course of her  treatments which have just ended this past month (May 2000) she never once  got even the least bit nauseated and her energy level allowed her to remain  active, missing only three days of work the entire course of treatment.   Her blood levels remained consistently &quot;at the high end of  normal&quot;, she was never hospitalized nor required blood transfusions.  She never lost her appetite,in fact, she eats what seems to be continually,   and she lost approximately 20-lbs, which was due to better eating habits  following the plan in this book.  She ever once wavered from the plan in  this book, everything was done to precision.  Her last oncology visit, a  week ago today, showed the cancer in two places had disappeared.  The tumor  in her lung had shrunk from 8 centimeters to 3. She begins radiation next  week, which her oncologist says &quot;we are going to shrink the remnants  of the tumor into nothing but scar tissue&quot;.  Her doctors and staff are  amazed at the way she has accepted the chemo &amp; how she has totally  turned this around, which she attributes to her strong faith in God, strong  family support and this book that provided the tool of nutrition.  She has  never looked more radiant and healthy in all her &quot;50-something&quot;  years. What began as a very dismal prognosis, now has her doctors  constantly quizzing her about how she has stayed in such marvelous  condition.  Full remission is on the horizon, and we owe alot of it to this  book.  It was a God-send, and I highly recommend it
