As far as "popular history" goes, this one is not bad.  There are certainly better books addressing the life of this fascinating person (Dallek's work and Caro's work comes to mind), but for those interested in LBJ, this is a very good start.  The book is well researched, and while you may disagree with some of the author's "cause and effect scenarios," they are logical and do give food for thought. Some of her assertions certainly make mroe sense than many I have read.  This work is not as detailed as I like (that is just me), but does cover quite a lot of gound in a very readable form.  This book has been in publication for sometime now, but it is still well worth adding to your LBJ collection if you have not already done so.  Very much recommend this one.
