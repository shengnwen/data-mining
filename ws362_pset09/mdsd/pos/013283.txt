I was introduced to this book by my girlfriend, who picked it up randomly because she liked the cover. Turns out she loved the book, which inspired me to read it as well. This book ended up being a great introduction to O'Brien, in some ways lighter than many of his other works, but it still has of the undertones common to many of his books. Because Vietnam is not as key to this book as many of the other ones, I think it's more accessible to the general populace. So if you are weary about reading war books, you could pick this one up first, and if you like it, maybe move on to some of his other novels
