I bought this one several years ago for my oldest son, now my little guy loves it, too.  It seems a bit sad to me now in the wake of the Columbia tragedy ("I want to be an astronaut, a member of the crew" sounds somewhat different now), but that doesn't really affect little kids.  If you or your kids are space nuts, this is a good one to begin with
