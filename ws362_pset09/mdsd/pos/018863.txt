First of all, I was expecting a totally different reaction  when I chose this book to read.  But after getting thru a good portion of it, I could not put it down.  Elizabeth George has an excellent way of developing characters and relationships as well as, developing the mystery and suspense and tying them all together at the end.  I am so hooked!!
The Lyndley/Havers relationship is a story in itself.  These 2 get put together by their superior.  Havers has a history of not getting along with her partners and Lyndley has the reputation of being a philanderer.  They are put together to solve the murder of a farmer whose daughter was found by his side with blood all over her in an almost catatonic state.
There is so many mini plots in the story but oddly enough, it is not difficult to follow.
I can not wait to read the next one!
