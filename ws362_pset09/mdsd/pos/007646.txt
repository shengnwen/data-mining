I don't care for the series "For Dummies," but I got this one anyway...and was pleasantly surprised! As a Spanish teacher, I think this book does a pretty good job introducing the language, formatting that's pleasant to the eye, and of course, grammar explanation. If you are truly teaching yourself, this is a GREAT place to start. It's conducive to skipping around if you get too bored with a particular lesson, and you can supplement with information when you need a little more practice. 

For the money, this is a great adult-centered teaching guide.

For the much younger student, it's of course, WAY too intense, and not near "fun" enough to keep interest. Try Flip Flop Spanish instead
