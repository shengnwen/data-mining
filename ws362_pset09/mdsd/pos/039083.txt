This is a beautiful book.  The explanations are clear and beautifully illustrated with photos by the very fit author ... she is an inspiration.  She divides the workouts in a variety of ways ... there're workouts for the Core, Lower Body, and Upper Body; and each focus area has a basic, intermediate, challenge and express workout so you can start at your current fitness level and build up in 6-week increments.  In addition, each level has variations for beginners and advanced exercises ... it is very thorough.  The nutrition chapter is a solid, basic plan for a lifetime ... not a diet.  The only drawback is that the exercises do not always specify exactly which muscle you are working altho she does give you pointers on how to find certain muscles and feel them working.  This is a great resource and very good value for the money.  Highly recommend it for all fitness levels
