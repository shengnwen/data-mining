Shrapnel In the Heart is a book to be read by everyone no matter what generation they were born in.  Shrapnel In The Heart is a book that has letters and rememberances left behind at the Vietnam War Memorial.  Some of the letters tell the story about the people behind the letter.  The stories are sad, but the courage of the men and women is a true inspiration. The people written about in this book were extrememly young (18, 19, 20) and it seems like they died in vain.  But through their letters that were left behind it is easy to see that these young men knew their duty and refused to shirk from it.  These men and women are true heroes
