I agree with several reviewers that the licks here are often brief, and many of them repeat certain shapes, but hey, that's the blues.  And as Marshall says in his introduction, once you know the basic chord progression implied by the lick (and they are stated), one can write a context for the riff,
or can join one lick to others in the book with some transposition.  My highest marks go to the playing and sound of the guitars used by Marshall.  This is a very interesting historical review of blues styles, as well as being a pretty good teaching tool, too
