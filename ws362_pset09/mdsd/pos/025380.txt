I don't watch television, and I don't read financial magazines.  I bought Chatzky's book on a friend's recommendation and was immediately impressed that someone had written a book for those of us who don't need to be rich.  The questionnaires and charts and graphs are easy to digest, and the overall tone of the book is comforting.  A great mix of economics, psychology, and common sense
