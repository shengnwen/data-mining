Greg Iles' Dead Sleep depicts the thoughts of an independent career woman with eloquence.  The ability to show how frail the human psyche is when faced with dire family issues is outstanding.  Issues of rape, child abuse and post Vietnam stress compound the problems and are taken on with balanced composure.
The book begins with a photographer needing a break from work and taking a vacation to Hong Kong.  To her disbelief, a portrait is on display in a popular art exhibit that is a replica of her twin sister who has been missing for 18 months.  To get closure from her sister's death or disappearance, she begins a journey to answer questions the FBI can't find.
At times, the reader loses patience with the investigation's pace because the team is truthfully depicted as trained to "follow the book".  The ebb and flow of detective work is weaved into the plot to understand why women are disappearing without a trace of evidence or ransom demand.  The effective use of bouncing from masculine and feminine individual traits adds to the seamless story of a family member who owes a sibling a childhood debt.  If you want to follow the mind set of a woman in the men's world of police work, this is a good place to start.
