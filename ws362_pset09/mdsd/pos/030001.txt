If you ever thought your child might have ADHD, or any other learning disability, you must read this. If you are a pediatrician, it's likely you've been pressured by schools into diagnosing patients with ADHD. Please read this before you do. Teachers/educational specialists can really learn from the masterpiece:&quot;In Their Own Way&quot;. The brilliant author, Thomas Armstrong, Ph.D., inspires us to &quot;respect the garden of childhood&quot; and not slap a &quot;flawed label&quot; such &quot;attention deficit hyperactivity&quot; on kids. Many kids have been branded as &quot;underachievers&quot;, &quot;learning disabled&quot;, simply have a nontraditional style of learning, Armstrong says. Each child has his own unique combination of multiple intelligences in learning, which must be honored and nurtured.&quot; We should not be putting these kids in remedial groups or writing them off as underachievers. Instead, he suggests: &quot;We should use better teaching strategies appropriate to the real needs of the kids, based on their multiple intelligences.&quot; Better yet, Dr. Armstrong gives concrete teaching strategy suggestions parents and teachers can follow. He also lists learning materials, books, games,internet sites, and computer software to foster the eight intelligences. If we believe Dr. Armstrong, nurturing kids is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Children rise to the highest level of our expectations. Parents and teachers can have hope. A generation of &quot;ADHD labeled&quot; kids or &quot;learning disabled&quot; kids need not be thought of as patients needing lifelong medication or remediation, but as potential Stephen Hawkings, just waiting to be nurtured properly. It is our responsibility to help these souls find their own way. It is our future
