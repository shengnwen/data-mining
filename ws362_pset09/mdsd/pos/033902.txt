I have to admit I didn't know what to expect from this book....what kind of arguments would the author's use to connect modern meat processing/consumption to alzheimer's? My conclusion?....I feel the authors make excellent arguments for the case. The authors use an impressive amount of data to back up their assertions. While reading the book, doubts I may have had on an idea they were presenting were shattered after they backed up their ideas again and again with hard facts. If you're a skeptic like me, I think this book at the very least will make you question a few things that you may never have thought about before on the subject. Highly Recommended
