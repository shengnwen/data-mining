What a wonderful little book with some just amazing ideas!  I've been lightweight backpacking for several years now, and Don Ladigin has included bits of his wisdom that will make time spent out in the wilderness even more rewarding.  Some of his ideas seem so simple and straightforward, I wonder why I didn't think of that!  Thanks Don
