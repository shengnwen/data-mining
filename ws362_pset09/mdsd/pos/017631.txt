A well presented volume that is easy and pleasant to read despite the 400+ pages.  Not a lot of philosophical pondering but a straightforward blow by blow chronology.  There are relatively few illustrations and only one map.  Some maps of the battlefields would be nice but the details of the battles are broad enough that it is not a real problem.  Genealogical tables are included and necessary though the writing is a bit small for these tired old eyes.  The book ends with the defeat of Lancaster (hope I am not giving anything away) and does not cover the subsequent conflict among the Yorkists and defeat by Henry Tudor as detailed in Shakespeare's Richard III
