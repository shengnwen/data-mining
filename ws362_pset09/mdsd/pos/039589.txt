I loved this book!  It really made me feel warm and fuzzy about the actress I have enjoyed watching on reruns for years.  While reading it, it sounded like Lucy was talking to me. I am glad I read this book before reading the biography about Lucy (which was not written by her, obviously).  That other book definitely painted a less-appealing story, and included a lot of garbage about the actress, that was not necessary.  This book is for anyone who loves the actress, and wants to learn more about who she was (without dragging up all the garbage).  I truly recommend this book.
