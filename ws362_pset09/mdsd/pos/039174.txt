This is an extraordinarily well written book.   It clearly explains economic principles without resorting to technical language; more importantly, it uses these principles to explain why some things work and some don't, whether it be policies for fostering economic growth, controlling pollution, reducing congestion, or providing lower cost health care.  Even though I was an economics major, I learned a lot, and even when the material was very familiar to me, the writing was so good I was not tempted to skip.

	Some of the facts which were new to me: China's approach to adopting capitalism gradually was to hold constant the amount of resources controlled by state planning, letting economic growth  free up more and more resources subject to the market economy;  many European countries such as France employ a kind of free market approach to health care in that private health insurance is compulsory, but the state subsidizes the cost for poorer citizens (what Massachusetts is now trying);  in countries like England, the per cent of income spent on gasoline actually goes up with income until you get to the very rich.  Harford's first hand accounts of  Cameroon, and his explanation as to why modern irrigation canals in Nepal increase productivity, but modern dams do not, is the type of color which adds so much to this book.

	Harford also uses economics to explain corporate pricing strategies.  By the time he gets to refreshment stands in movie theaters, it gets a little tiresome and he misses something: I think the markups on candy bars are lower than other items because it is easier to sneak them in.  Another thing missed is that used car warranties allow for a vibrant used car market despite the information asymmetries Harford discusses.

	The general conclusion of the book is that you can have social justice and economic efficiency, but you must be clever and not ignore economic principles, especially people's strong tendency to mostly do what promotes their self interest.
