I have used &quot;General Microbiology&quot; as a teaching source in Microbial Physiology for many years.  I have allways been amazed at the scope of information packed in what appears to be a rather small volume, which is not easy to find in other sources.  It is excellent value for money.  On the downside, it is getting long in the tooth and there does not seem to be a new revision on the horizon - which is a real pity
