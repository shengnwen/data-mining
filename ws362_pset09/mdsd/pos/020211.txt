If you are a Nora Roberts fan you will not be disappointed in this trilogy. The added fantasy of fairies and ghosts and the fey Irish who believe in them are a delight. I've read all three and they are all as good as the first. You will move into the Gallagher Clan and become part of the family and their fortunes
