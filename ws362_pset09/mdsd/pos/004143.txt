This is actually the best book you can find on the epic battles fought on Gallipoli. Simply beacuse the Turkish sources fail to make accurate research on the subject as well as failing to display any images or memoirs... Not only you take a full grasp of the events in strategic and historical aspects but also has easy-to-read novelistic narrative. Nonetheless, it is written from the British point of view. You can see the British prejudices regarding Tukrs and the rest. The book fails to give you information on Turkish sufferings as well as Turkish army and its position on World War I. In contrast, the author seems to undermine it. There is no mention of the following facts 1. Turks have their most sorrowful folk songs on Gallipoli. Even today, everybody in Turkey knows &quot;Canakkale Turkusu&quot;. 2. Turks gave British Army two more defeats in Mezopotamia and were only defeated with vastly superior forces added to Arab treason(= which is another sad part of Turkish history) 3. The British defeat at Gallipoli is the single reason we Turks still live in Istanbul. 4. The author is unknowingly insulting to Turks which is unacceptable. Many Turks refer to Churchill much worse that &quot;Gypsy face&quot;. He may have won the war for Britain but this does not make him a hero for humanity except Britain and allies
