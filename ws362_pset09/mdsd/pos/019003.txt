This is a great book for all types of study environments. It is good for small groups with study questions for each chapter. It is also great for personal study of the basic tenants of Christianity. In easy to understand language, Paul Little covers the foundational aspects of the Christian faith. I currently use this book in the development of new leaders in our church
