I would like to begin and say that this book was published on June 1, 2000, over a year before September 11th happened.  With that being said, Flynn has written a sharp, entertaining thriller featuring Mitch Rapp, an undercover assassin who takes care of the dirty work of terrorists for the United States (without actually belonging to the CIA or FBI).  And this book deals with terrorists, who have Al-Qaieda and Iraqi/Sadaam Hussein ties (sound familiar?!), and who have a vision of making the United States suffer.  Flynn gives us great detail on how the terrorists plan on taking over the White House and gives us realistic scenarios of how this is done (although he said he changed aspects of the real White House so that terrorists wouldn't get any ideas).  And Mitch Rapp (think of him as Jack Bauer in a book without a whiny daughter that gets in his way) is the only one who can save the day.  Without ruining what will happen, Flynn writes a Tom Clancy-like book (with a lot of details in which I learned A LOT - but still not as detailed as Clancy) that is action-packed.  You will be rooting for the good guys (I hope!) and the ending will not disappoint.  As this is a series, read this book first.  Then read these:
-Third Option
-Separation of Power
-Executive Power
-Memorial Day
-Consent To Kill
-Act Of Treason (coming out 10/10/06)

A great thing about Flynn, is that he is a conservative Republican, so you will not get the liberal spins that can ruin good books (like David Baldacci's Camel Club!).  He actually writes it like it is (with a little bias, but at least it is like a breath of fresh air).  But don't expect to see any movies get made from these books.  Flynn said in an interview that liberal Hollywood thinks his books would make great movies, but because of his stance, no one wants to risk supporting a conservative Republican.  So much for making the best, entertaining movies possible!  

In conclusion, give this series a try.  Read this book, and if you like it, you'll have a lot of reading to do to finish the series
