I've read a lot of the reviews on here, and as someone who was not one of the "5%," I feel the need to defend Swofford.  I served in a Marine Corps Infantry unit for 3 1/2 years of my 4 year enlistment (Boot and SOI took up the other 5 months).  The truth is, Swofford hit the nail right on the head for how those ranked Cpl and below see life in an infantry unit.  I can't begin to recall how many training ops we would go out for in which we would sit around for 4 days to do one live fire exercise.  And then combat?  While my combat experience differed from Swofford's (I'm an OIF veteran), a lot of the emotions and inner turmoil that he described were felt by myself and the Marines under my charge.  This book may not be for civilians, and especially not for the P.O.G.s, it should be read by anyone who has served in an infantry unit or who has loved ones who have.
