Tom Wolfe is among my favorite authors, having already read "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "The Right Stuff". I had never heard of "A Man in Full" but after reading the excerpt on Amazon, which was the chapter introducing Riger Too-White, I decided to purchase the audio-CD version of this book. 

I have listened to several audiobooks overt the last few months, and I have found that no matter what the subject or author, what makes or breaks an audiobook is the narration/reading. Most have been good. (Anything narrated by Boyd Gaines should be avoided.)

In contrast, "A Man in Full" is expertly narrated by David Ogden Stiers, best-known as Major Winchester on "M*A*S*H". He brought depth and life to every character in the novel, and was able to differentiate each character so as to stand out in the listener's mind.

Stiers' diction and intonation were extremely helpful in describing each scene, and the motivations behind each character. One can easily pick up on the nervous fear & frustration in Conrad on his fateful day when he fails his typing test, has his car towed, is jerked around by surrounding characters who seem to go out of their way to keep him from getting enough change for a phone call, then by the staff at the impound lot, after which you finally hear him snap, resulting in his failed attempt to steal back his own car, resulting in his imprisonment. 

I howled out loud at the sheer improbability of Charlie and Conrad coming together through what seemed like fate (or was it the hand of Zeus?). One could almost sense this about to happen, however, but the manner in which it occurred, and the subsequent outcome of their meeting (as opposed to what most readers, like myself, might have predicted), is (as Wolfe might write), a jolt to the solar plexus. 

(P.S. - Is there a Tom Wolfe novel without "solar plexus" in it?
