As a former classmate of Monie Phillips I can attest to his commitment to the profession of Physical Therapy.  This book is a great first read for anyone interested in becoming a physical therapist.  It provides insights into many of the challanges of the modern healthcare enviroment and how this relates to physical therapists in a broad spectrum of settings all of which the author has had experience in.  This book will also be of great interest for students and new grads to help them be prepared for situations they are sure to face.  More experienced therapists will enjoy and relate to the author's experiences he has shared of his practice as a therapist, a director of a rehab facility, and many other roles.
