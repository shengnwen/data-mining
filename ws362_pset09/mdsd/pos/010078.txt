  If you have a little trouble getting my title;you'll surely know what it means if you read this gem of a book.I have been an avid birder for close to 20 years.In that time I have compiled a list of nearly 600 species in North America,met and birded with hundreds of other birders,made numerous friends,travelled far and wide, as well as locally,joined several bird clubs,served on executives,read hundreds of 'bird books';and own around 1000 books dealing with every aspect of birdwatching.With all that;I am pleased to call myself a 'Bad Birdwatcher';even though I had never heard the term before.
 What makes this book so good is that it does an excellent job of telling what birding is all about,the many ways one can partake in it,and what attracts so many to it.In other words,if you want to see what birding really is or want to give a friend a book to find out for themselves,what this birding you do is all about;then you won't find a better book .
  The author is an experienced birder from Britain,and quite a bit of what he talks about is birding in Britain.Don't let that disuade you as he covers a lot of other countries and everything he says is applicable to any country as well as very good for a rank amateur to the most seasoned 'expert'.
 He also talks about something I don't believe I've ever seen covered.He explains the reason for this interest in birds and not other animals,insects,and other species.That's not to say that some people get interested in butterflies,mammals,etc.;but birdwatching outstrips them all.
  "Anyone who has ever gazed up at the sky or stared out of the window,knows something about birds.In this funny,inspiring eye-opening book Simon Barnes paints a riviting picture of how birdwatching has framed his life and can help all of us to a better understanding of our place on this planet."
 A great addition to the numerous bird books,but one that is different and has something to offer for everyone;be they already a birder or just interested
