Amuse-Bouche are wonderful when served in restaurants but there have been, until now, very few books covering these amazing pieces of indulgence. This book is a real gem as it enables an 'ordinary' cook to give a professional quality to any dinner party, or family meal for that matter. I would highly recommend it, and look forward to other chefs inputting their ideas too.
