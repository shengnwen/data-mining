     While i agree with other reviewers that this book didn't present all the cities/towns that were affected, hurricane katrina was just so massive that i don't think any one book would be able to do it justice.  Having said that, this book does attempt to give an overview of the destruction that occured in MS/LA..particularly new orleans.

     As a new orleans resident myself, i missed most of the early coverage due to power outages that occured as far away as baton rouge and jackson, MS.  Having this book is a good reminder of what the nation saw and what the gulf coast lived through.

     The introduction was written by new orleans native wynton marsalis then goes to moving pictures of the disaster presented in a time line fashion--from when the storm first came ashore on aug 29 until weeks into the tragedy.
  
      It also offers graphical maps of the levee breaks, flood zones of new orleans showing almost the entire city underwater, and even myths that occured during this hectic time.

      It devouts a small section to gulf coast MS which was horribly affected as well and a small section on the rescuers, volunteers and aftermath of the storm and the future of the gulf coast.  The last pages were about hurricane rita and its affects on the region.

This is a great book for a concise overview of this nationwide disaster.  5% of the proceeds go to red-cross relief efforts which i think should be higher.  All in all, a worthwhile purchase...many of the pictures will be scenes that bring a tear to your eye and stay with you.
