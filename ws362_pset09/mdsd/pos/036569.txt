This book is a very solid introduction to using a bo staff (~ 6 foot pole weapon) in martial arts. The bo is nearly universally the first weapon form that practitioners learn yet there aren't a lot of really good books out there teaching people how to use one. Even a great book is no substitute for a competent instructor, of course, yet it can be a great supplement to dojo training. This one is fairly general, hence more broadly useful than some style-specific works, and pretty well done. Despite the fact that the layout is logical and the writing is quite good it is, unfortunately, a 30-year-old work with dark, grainy pictures that are a bit challenging to read. Contents include history of the bo staff, profiles of kobudo masters, types of bo staffs, bo basics (holding the staff, warm-up exercise, fighting positions), kihon (basics), striking, thrusting, blocking, combinations, applications, and basic bo kata. The comparison and contrast between open-hand and weapon applications (e.g., stances, basic techniques) is a great tie-in for karate practitioners interested in picking up a weapons form. Overall it's a very good resource.
