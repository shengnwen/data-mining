Peter Matthiessen describes his character. "First time you seen the man, you wanted him to like you---he was that kind." 
Similar praises were most likely  sung for  the likes of Napoleon, Lincoln, JFK, Julius Caesar, Malcolm X, St. Joan, Socrates and even Il Duce. Seems like we  always want to place a charismatic leader especially high on the pedestal so he has all the farther to fall. So, it is with Mr. Watson. He is smart, sexy, charming, and hard working. He is also very tough, can handle a knife and gun. He can shoot the mustache off a sheriff at 100 yards. No, you don't want to get this guy mad at you. Mister Watson.  Whether you fear him or love him---- woman have been know to take one look at him and drop their drawers ----as long as that power provides some benefit to you and yours, you want him around. When he drinks too much, earns too much, roughs up too much, you look the other way. But when he loses his power, you shoot him full of lead. You use handguns, rifles, and buck shot. Even get the "youngins" into the act. You slay the mighty Goliath and then you string him up by the toes and drag his body through the muddy swamps. Tear his pretty face off his head. Bury him in a shallow grave with a noose tied to the tree of liberty so that it may be refreshed by this natural piece of manure. 
Mister Watson. We're not sure of what you are guilty, but we know you must be guilty of something.  
Bang.
