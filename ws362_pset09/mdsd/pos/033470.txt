I read this book when it first came out.  I loved every part of it.  During the days I read it, I actually felt as though I was out in the farmland among these characters.  Sadly, I have been trying to find books of similar writing and settings, but it hasn't panned out.  Hopefully, more books of equal caliber are on the way from this talented author
