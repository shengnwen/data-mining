I purchased this Tarot Deck - not so much for the use with Tarot readings but after reading: Vodou Visions - as you can use the cards as a focus point in your rituals - both books are highly recommended to those interested in Vodou... I was pleased to see that the cards can easily be used as a Tarot Deck as well - the information inside is so well done and so easy to read that it makes previous knowledge of the tarot easy to use with this deck (if you read the book) There is only 34 pages to read, before you get to "each card meaning" and at the end of that section there is another (Approx. 40 pages), which is a "How To" section and very enlightening... There is also information at the back about each meaning for each card to make things easier for beginners...
This set will work for both beginners and experienced - at the end of the book the author has a Last Judgment and in case she ever reads her reviews I would like to tell her that the book in fact was worth the sacrifice of the trees that went into making the pages, so filled with magick, and it has indeed brought me closer to the mystery's of life and will continue to do so as I continue my journey of life... I will add my own sacrifice to the Loa for leading me to this Treasure! 
Brightest of Blessings
