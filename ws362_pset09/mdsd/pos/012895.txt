After Can't buy me love this was the second novel by Chris Kenry that I read. It's very well-written, funny but it has some definite dark undercurrents too. And as with the first book, the image on the cover doesn't do this novel justice at all. Can somebody please have a word with the art department at Kensington Publishing so in future this won't happen again? One more negative: the story ends way too soon. So dear, DEAR Mr. Kenry, will you please consider writing a sequel? Maybe call it Max &amp; the City of St. Tropez? ;-)
