This book isn't bad.  I have not finished reading it, but it does give quite a bit of useful information.  However, Cal seems to repeat himself several times in the book.  There are many books out there that offer adequate, if not better, knowledge of how to play the game.  Louisville Slugger's book is good as well as Coaching Pitchers.  I would suggest only buying this book if you are a die hard baseball fan and plan on collecting many books.  One good thing about the book is that Cal does give that sense of how to be a good teammate and maybe even a great family member
