Extreme Denial isn't at the top of the list of Morrell's great work but it is still a very good and very enjoyable read. Morrell has written a similar main character to what he does with most of his work with Extreme Denial's main character Stephen Decker. If you enjoyed Mitch Coltrane (Double Image), Cavanaugh (The Protector) Malone (Burnt Sienna) or any of Morrell's other ex CIA, ex Special Forces characters which drive most of his novels then you'll really enjoy this novel as well. 

In Extreme Denial CIA agent Stephen Decker has finally had enough when he is teamed up with Brian McKittrick, the incompetent bumbling son of former chairman of the National Security Council, for an antiterrorism assignment in Rome. Saving both the son's and father's lives they use extreme denial to blame everything on him. Seeing a story on a unique historic type of housing in Santa Fe New Mexico and with no other plans Decker decides he'll relocate there. When looking at a house Decker gets the idea his training in dealing with people will probably make him a decent real estate agent so convinces the women who wants to sell him an expensive house to throw in a trial job for himself to clench the deal. Soon he is highly successful, meets a new female client Beth who is very attractive and like he did has moved to Santa Fe to start a new life. With romance blossoming Decker finally believes he has reinvented his life for the better. When he starts to notice someone from his past life in the streets and his and Beth's bedroom enjoyment is interrupted by guys firing machine guns Decker knows someone or some people don't want him to move on with his life. 

A great read, also check out Morrell's great reads First Blood, Burnt Sienna, The Protector, Double Image and Creepers as well!
