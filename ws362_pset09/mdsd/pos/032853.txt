I guess that when you think of millionaires, you think of flashy people with nice cars and a lot of bling, but I had no Idea that there were so many BORING millionaires!  I guess it's not really pboring to have over a million dollars, but I want to be able to enjoy my monye.  THeat's the purpose of this book , though- to show that you have to be boring and then you can get to be a millionaire with all the money you didn't spend on fun stuff!  I almost fell asleep a couple times reading this, but when I stayed awake it was really eye-opening.  I won't scoff at those people who don't have "big hats" but have a lot of cattle anymore
