Now Henry James is not for everyone. His writing style has to really be paid attention to, and can sometimes lag. But this novel was a fantastic work of literary genuis! The tale is chilling, with a plot that makes the reader really think.
But I must say that one must only read this if one:
1. Can understand classical/Victorian writing style.
2. Enjoys Henry James already as an author. (This should not be the first novel of his you read. I would suggest The American firstly.)
3. Has a taste for classical horror.

So, that is what I have to say.
I will not dive into the plot - enough people have done that - and I will only recommend this becasue I really love this. But I would encourage for you to read it and form your own opinion.
That is the best thing to do.
But as for me, I love this! It is one of my favorites!
