I admit to not being able to pick Bill Moyers out of a crowd - so the fact that this was written by his son made very little difference to me.  

What did make a huge difference, however, is the brutal honesty in this book.  William Moyers is an addict and admits it.  He does not shy away from the [...] that he did while in the throes of his addiction which makes this story of recovery all the more fascinating.

Also really enjoyed his take on Hazelden, which I believe is often overlooked in the world of addictionn - but is a god send.

Thank you William for writing such a wonderful book.  Of course, it comes out of your pain - but I am so grateful to you for sharing
