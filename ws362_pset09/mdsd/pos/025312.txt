This book should please any fan of the film who is interested in the planets, characters, and locations that were created for the film. It begins years before the release of the movie, describing meetings with the director on the material requested for Episode III and how shows how the entire story was planned out with hundreds of paintings and sketches. One of the best things is seeing what didn't make it into the final film. It is also an excellent companion to "The Making of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" also by Jonathan Rinzler. It simply is a must-buy for those who appreciate what goes into making a great movie
