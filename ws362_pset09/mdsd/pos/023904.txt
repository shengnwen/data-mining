Kremer's exhaustively thorough guide is an extremely valuable resource for authors and publishers. The Table of Contents consists of 10 pages - you can simply drink a cup of tea, languishing there while you read through it to absorb the depth and detail to know exactly what chapters to pounce on first. Excellent how-tos and easy-to-follow, albeit so much to consider, you might re-think authoring your book at all! Just kidding... just because he's researched it, included it here (whatever "it" is), does not mean you must read the entire 674 pages and apply everything. Obviously, some of the material will "speak" to your needs and a lot may not. 
In my case, I have at least 50 colorful paper clips attached to page tops, designating highlighted specifics. Some of the info is clearly outdated, changed URLs, etc.
It is definitely the most complete, comprehensive handbook I own on the subject of publishing and marketing.
I highly recommend it for authors planning to get involved with the marketing of your book, even if you have a publisher (not yourself), you will be expected to do your part. Then, when your publisher stops promoting, you'll be ahead of your game with enough knowledge to not miss a beat, while continuing to sell your books.
You will probably want to buy the latest version for all the updates!
