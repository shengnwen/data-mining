the author explains the graphs quite well in his textbook. all the examples are interesting and relate to real life. i've had the honor of having the author as a sub for our regular lecturer for a week at UC Berkeley. his book's just like his lectures, very entertaning and does not bore me to sleep.
but the book does not help with the difficult tests given since it only covers the basics, one needs to do the problems in the study guide in order to really apply the concepts.
