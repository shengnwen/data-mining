I would never have read this book if anyone else had written it.  But Sandford wrote it, so I read it.  I'm glad that I did.  While the subject matter wasn't something I'd typically go for, the writing was first rate.  

This book is about Jake Winter, a 'researcher' for the White House.  Jake is asked to look into the disappearance of a former senator, which starts the journey - which is interesting, if a bit confusing at times.  

BTW, the next Prey book - Invisible Prey - is due out in May of 2007.
