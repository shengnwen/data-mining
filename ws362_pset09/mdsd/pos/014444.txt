For me, this was a wonderful find.  This book wasn't particularly long, and I'd seen about 25% of the material before, but parts of it were simply wonderful.

I love the way it has helped me think about my projects.  

As high as I rate this work, I cannot recommend buying if you can check it out from your library.  It has lots of blank space (if the text was condensed like a novel, it would be about 100 pages at most), and it is easy enough to Xerox or copy down the best passages you find to have personal significance.
