With Fevre Dream Martin has written an enjoyable tale of horror aboard a steamboat on the Mississippi river in the mid 19th century. While the vampire story is good it's the setting that makes this novel worth reading amongst the endless stream of vampire stories cramming bookstore and library shelves. Martin does an admirable job of painting realistic scenes of life on the river and aboard a steamboat. He throws out just enough jargon to keep it authentic. Recommended for both horror fans and those who enjoy period fiction
