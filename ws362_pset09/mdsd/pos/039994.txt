This is a beautiful book.  It deserves to be read by anyone who loves great writing.  It deftly and insightfully weaves the different stories of the McLaughlin family into a rich and deeply satisfying tapestry.

The novel is written from the subjective perspectives of six people, bound together by ties beyond their choosing.  Like all great writers, Napolitano displays a manifest affection for her characters, and it becomes an affection we share.  Notably our sympathies shift throughout the novel, as these are real human beings, drawn with the skill and attention they deserve.

I read Within Arm's Reach in one sitting.  It is exquisitely written, with an ending that feels true and yet emotionally satisfying.  With this remarkably accomplished debut, Napolitano can stand proud in the company of Ann Patchett, Alice McDermott and even John Irving.

This is Napolitano's first novel and her future looks extremely bright, not to understate the fact that she has clearly already arrived
