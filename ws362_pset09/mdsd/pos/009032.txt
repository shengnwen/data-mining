I guess I must be the only one who fails to understand why there is such a fuss about this book.  Judith Miller, a reporter, spent quite a while interviewing plenty of people and has written a book which tells about what she heard.  Its style is anecdotal, of course.  It shows plenty about the region and its people, warts and all.

Now, what about the reviews of this book?  David Pryce-Jones feels that Miller seriously misinterprets the rationale of Islamists.  That may well be true.  But I think that Miller is free to judge the Islamists by her own standards.  It might be better for us readers were she to tell us more.  But she didn't, and I think we ought to read David Pryce-Jones' book, "The Closed Circle," as well as Miller's.  

More striking is the amazing attack on Miller by Ed Said.  Without this, I might not have read her book at all.  First, Said, a notorious thug, grouped Miller with a surprisingly diverse set of scholars, namely Samuel Huntington, Martin Kramer, Bernard Lewis, Daniel Pipes, Steven Emerson, and Barry Rubin.  I wonder if Said confused these people with the "Magnificent Seven" and was worried that they would ride into town and gun him down.  It seemed that way when he complained (in 1996) that these seven all make it look as though there is a "threat" from militant Islam.  Said went on to say that this book is a weapon "in the conflict to subordinate, beat down, compel, and defeat any Arab or Muslim resistance to U. S. - Israeli dominance."

Um, this book?  Said had to be kidding.  If there was ever projection, this was it, given that so many of Said's books really were weapons in Said's war against human rights, justice, and truth.  Said went on to question Miller's qualifications to write such a book.  He wisely did not challenge his own qualifications to write anything on this subject.  

In any case, this book is worth reading
