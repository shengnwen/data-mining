A history of the Jewish people in Palestine as revealed in the archeological record, from Abraham until the Romans.  Marcus' primary objectives are to assess the historical accuracy of the Bible and to provide an introduction to the various theories of what the Bible omits or gets wrong.  She also  give the reader a very good feel for the land,  and to a lesser extent the archeologists, and the digs. Understanding Jewish history requires some understanding of the other Middle Eastern peoples as well as the approach to ruling an empire of the major powers, Babylonia, Assyria, and Persia.  Her style is more discursive, and less organized than I would like, although this is more true of some chapters than others.  Too often she is a reporter, reporting on what various archeologists have to say, rather than a student of the material, providing a coherent view of  what is currently known, and alternative possibilities. Still, overall she does a  good job, and much of the material is fascinating
