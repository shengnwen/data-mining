This last book in "The Dark is Rising" Sequence goes through the motions of being dark an mysterious, and does so effectively, but the feel is about what you'd expect to get rereading "The Dark is Rising" (book 2 in the sequence).  It manages to wrap things up, and could be turned into a movie without some director mutilating the plot to slip in CGI shots.  The final battle is pure CGI gold.  Overall, I am satisfied, and do not feel cheated in any way by the latter four books of the series (although I hated the first one, and I'm glad I read the second one first, or I would have never continued)
