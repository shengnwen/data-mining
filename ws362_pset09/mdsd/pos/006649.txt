I purchased this book with the intent to learn more about the sport I participate in, which is Olympic Weightlifting. I found the book to very informative on each aspect of lifting. I also liked the detailed explanations throughout the book.  

The only thing I recommend for the next version of this book aside from updating out of date information, ie the Weight Classes for Olympic Weightlifting, is better editing. There were grammatical errors and such throughout the book, but it was still readable.

Other than the editing, I'm very pleased to add this book to my library and will recommend it others that want to learn more about Olympic Weightlifting or another form of lifting
