Finally there is someone who is writng about being a parent without being dipsy deweyed. Judith Newman has incredible, sharp, honest humor that will offend sanctimonious people and will cause those of us who love the truth to rejoice.  Her stories of motherhood are brutal and touching.  Her evaluation of her existence is harsh but never ceases to impress me.  Finally someone is not telling me to have a baby at 54 and find Nirvana, Judith is making me laugh and be wary and I thank her for it
