As others say here, this rather long book weaves beautifully connecting about all the dots, and is really a rather easy read, since the professor is mainly answering questions presented at forums thruout the USA. Basically, he blasts away at the military-industrial complex, though he hardly ever uses that term, first formulated in 1960 by Eisenhower. Since the Defense Dept. receives over 50% of federal taxes, and is responsible for dropping so many hundreds of thousands of bombs, slaughtering at least as many people in overseas military adventures, his thoughts on this subject are deep and near limitless. So why is so much spent on bombs, missiles, and planes rather on schools and medicine? According to the author, mainly since if spent on the latter, citizens would have a say, which is the last thing the gov't wants! And the media is almost totally muzzled! On this point, as on others, he may simplify things a bit, the reason I humbly give this book only 4 stars! His comments on Central America in the 1980's, Russia and South America are on target, and his humor makes his comments, and the book, even more effective! Like "People in Guatamala would find Bulgaria a real paradise!". His also excorciates the universities, and many other large institutions.  Other reviewers make some fine points too, so I'll kep this review short, and simply end by saying this is definitely territic "anti-establishment" read, and you won't regret your time spent!
