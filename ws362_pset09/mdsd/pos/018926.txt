I was very skeptical of this book at first, Erics example projects that you learn from seem kind of lame and dated looking, and although they arent visually exciting this isnt a design book, its a book to learn CSS, and learn it I did.

Im already an experienced web developer with some CSS experience but never with fully tableless design. I was able to read this book fairly quickly gather quick knowledge of the aspects of CSS I did not know about.  The sites he has you build dont look exciting, however they do a good job teaching you the fundamentals, which is the most important part.  I was able to read a chapter, then goto my own personal website which was more fun and apply what I learned.  Then read another chapter learn something else and then apply that knowledge to the site I was working on.  By the time I finished the book, I had also made a pretty cool site of my own that was visually exciting to me as well as CSS rich (look ma, no tables!)

This way I was getting the most of his excercises, and then applying them to my own fun design.  I think this is a perfect way to learn css and I recommend this "dual-path" approach so you don't get totally bored working on eric's designs only
