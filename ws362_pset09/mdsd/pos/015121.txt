This is a fun and helpful book.  It was beneficial for me to learn that I should EXPECT my body to vary from the pattern standard - rather than beat  myself up over it.  I particularly liked the book's &quot;before and  after&quot; photos. It's good to have so many visual images showing  &quot;this is what it means&quot;.  Gale's insights will help me for years  to come
