Robert Massie does an excellent job regardless of the subject he writes on. His masterpiece on Peter the Great is a dazzling 700 page ode to Russia's rise.  Peter the Great helped to expand the borders in all directions of Russia and built his namesake St. Petersburg. His interest in integrating with Europe and establishing a navy are all well covered in this book. It all focuses on the Great Northern War with Sweden which gives the Russians a coast on the Baltic sea.  Everything about this book is well done from the writing, to the research to the organization. I highly recommend it for even those who are casually interested in Russian history.  You will not be disappointed by reading this one!
