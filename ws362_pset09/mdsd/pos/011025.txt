After reading the book "Leadership on Lincoln," I wanted to learn more about the life of this fascinating figure in American history.  This title provides many details about the man, his many tragedies and failures, and his ultimate success as a leader.  The author does well in not standing in the way of his subject -- he simply unfolds the story before the reader's eyes.  This volume is rather large at 600 pages, but the read is an enjoyable one.  For anyone wanting to discover a thorough treatment of the life of Abraham Lincoln, this book is an excellent investment
