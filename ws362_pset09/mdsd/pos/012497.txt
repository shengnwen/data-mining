This book does have a good compendium of Frank Norris short stories. Some of the stories are brilliant and it evident that they were written by the author of "McTeague", "The Octopus", etc... Some of the stories drag a bit. I have read almost all of Frank Norris's books. I have come to expect excellent writing when I see his name as the author. The stories are presented in a chronological order so one can see his evolution as an author. One can not help but wonder what his body of work would have been if he had not died at such a young age.
