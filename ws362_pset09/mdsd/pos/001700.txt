I recommend this book because it tells what Derek Jeter, of the Yankees, does at home. He is a very ordinary person. He drives himself around, and does his own laundry. " I am a couch potato." This is the very thing I never hear a famous person say. " I always put time in for fans." He gives his signature to anyone he can. Derek Jeter is a very responsible person.
