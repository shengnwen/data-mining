I have read several of Ira Levin's books.  I have really liked them all.  Ira has a style of writing that engages you and makes you feel like a friend is telling you the story.  If you have seen &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (Elizabeth Taylor, Shelly Winters - a fabulous movie) then you pretty much are going to guess most of the story.  It doesn't differ too much from that, HOWEVER you will be engrossed absolutley even though you THINK you know what's going to happen :)  I was a little disappointed with the ending-the rest of the book was so exciting that the end seemed a little too neat and pretty - pretty.  I really don't think you can go wrong no matter which Ira Levin book you read (or can manage to find..most are no longer in print-part of the attraction).  Devious actions and thoughts make his characters memorable.  I think the real horror lies in his ability to take a mundane thing and find the dark side of it
