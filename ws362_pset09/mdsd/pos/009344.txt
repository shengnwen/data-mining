Frankie Machine, the retired mafia hitman who is brought out of retirement in this novel, is somewhat reminiscent of Spenser - the erudite tough guy.  He loves words, excellent food and opera.  He is also an excellent killer, thus the moniker "Machine".

We're introduced to the former hitman as he goes through his day running four businesses, dating a babe, still taking care of his ex-wife and trying to figure out how to pay for his daughter's med school.  He is then approached by an old mob acquaintence.  Trying to stay out of the fray, he agrees to mediate, only to find he is the target of a hit.  The book then goes into retrospective mode as he flashes back to his past deeds tries to figure who and why he is the target.  All the time he is one step ahead (or maybe behind) the killers now after him.

There's some good old-style mafia stuff here along with the modernization of the Godfather (there are plenty of amusing jabs taken at the Godfather mafia wannabes).  Although the plot seems formulaic, the writing is so good and Frankie Machine is such a great character, it all works.   The book keeps moving at a fast pace through Frankie's past operations while the present day plot is being woven and unravelling.  The switches from the present to the past and back keep the tension high throughout.

This was thoroughly enjoyable and Winslow is a writer worth keeping an eye on
