In order for you to appreciate my review you have to know something about me. I am a HUNA Life Priest. Most of you do not know what HUNA is but suffice to say it is what Kahuna practiced in ancient Hawaii. Today it is called by many HUNA and it is a spiritual practice and  psychology that works. Now having said this, I first read Psycho-Cybernetics in 1969. I thought the book was excellent and that it broke new ground in mind sciences and helped to merge the Western thought process with the Eastern process. I just finished New Psycho-Cybernetics and I found it also to be excellent and true to its original work. I particularly found the principles to be better explained. However, it repeats itself about how good Psycho-Cybernetics is rather than focus on teaching techniques but it does none the less teach you the techniques even though it makes you wade through its hype. The principles are sound and even though they do not necessarily know exactly why they work so well, what they do know now for a fact is after more than thirty years of people applying the techniques is that if followed it produces a desired effect and is repeatable. Further, anyone can learn to do this if they simply apply themselves. Now over thirty years later the book continues to be in print due to its success with millions and despite many closed minds in the mental health field the results from using Psycho-Cybernetics can not be dismissed. It walks hand in hand with the practice of HUNA and is good mental tool for accomplishing desired goals and objectives in a balanced and positive mental attitude. To me it is a must reading for everyone and especially for young adults. People who practice Psycho-Cybernetics will be people that you will see achieving their goals and being leaders by example. Nuff said.
