Okay, first let me confess that I'm not the typical Steve King fan (is there such a thing?).  I read The Stand years ago, and have loved the Dark Tower series, which has led me to start reading some the peripheral Tower books like Insomnia.

I'm glad I read it, even without the Tower connection, I would have liked it.  But for you Tower junkies who haven't read it, but are interested in the Tower connections, read pages 461,580, 683, and 728 (this page caught me off-guard and gave me chills).  These pages are from the Viking hardcover edition
