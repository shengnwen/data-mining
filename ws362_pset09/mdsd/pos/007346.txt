Most women in the 21st century are too lazy to actually keep their homes. Instead of looking to the way so many spend time in front of the computer, television, or telephone, it's much easier to bash a book that admits that "home making" *gasps* TAKES TIME. I hustle 40 hour+ work weeks and attend college full time. This book has helped me bring a once hectic mess ridden existence under control. I take pride in my home now and have more energy since I'm in a more productive and tidy environment. I find this book to be indispensible and since I've placed myself on a rather relaxed chore schedule, I get things done without feeling overwhelmed. 

In our modern society where Sex in the City shaped a generation and women are becoming more like men (and men more like women); it felt as if the author has made a connection with those of us who still wish to take care of our homes and those within, as has been our role for thousands of years.
