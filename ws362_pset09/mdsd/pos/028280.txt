I love forensic thrillers, I love ancient history and archaeology. By education I am a molecular biologist. So I was immensely fascinated by Kathy Reichs latest thriller. Largely I was not disappointed by hearing the unabridged CD version. But the plot has one major drawback. It hinges much on the so-called "James Ossuary". This ossuary surfaced in 2003 in the antiquities black market. This ossuary and the so called "Stone of Solomon" have been at the center of major criminal investigation themselves. As it turned out both came from the same forgery shop of Oded Golan, where countless other forged antiquities were found. The ossuary it self is an original but the part of the inscription which reads "brother of Jesus" had been added by Oded Golan.
The BBC has produced a very exciting documentation about the scientific and criminal investigations leading to the exposure of these forgeries and the arrest of Oded Golan.
Since all this has become public before the publishing date of "Cross Bones" Kathy Reichs should have used this information in the resolution of her own fictional case.
But still she has made a point: If you mix religious zealotry into science truth always loses out.
