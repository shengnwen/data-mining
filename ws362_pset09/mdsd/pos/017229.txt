I am sorry to say that in my opinion Stephen King ran out of gas at around 1989.This is a stupid story about a car which is not a car which reminds me of what my girlfriend Cheryl said when she saw my 1971 Volkswagen Beetle for the first time a long time ago when my life was a  lot simpler. Back then all I needed to keep me happy was a date with her and a pepperoni pizza and a 6 pack of Miller beer together with a Drive In Movie. In this sorry excuse for a novel King introduces the reader to State Troopers in Western Pennsylvania who come across a strange automobile and then they are intrigued, fascinated and pretty darn bored by the whole thing which I was by the end of this book. I guess when you aren't living in an overcrowded trailer somewhere in Hicksville , Maine then you aren't as hungry to produce good stories. Thankfully the "King Bandwagon" has almost rolled to a stop .I give this book 5 stars because King once showed so much promise as a writer and he did take the time to write this book instead of just publishing his Laundry List which no doubt would be a bestseller
