If you enjoyed Nancy, Bess, George and Ned as a child you will find comparable delight with Mariah Stewart's books.  Moderate suspense, minimal gore, unoffensive language, steamless romance and characters who fight for truth and justice without the aid of pyrotechnics.  A nice change-up from the standard twisted fare that has become the norm
