A really fine piece of work..gives one a great appreciation for some of the characters of golf's early years in America, and "characters" is the right term...uses Bobby Jones as contrast and an ideal...very nicely done...Puts Jones and the development of golf in context of what was going on in America and the world.  Lots of readable national and international history in addition to straight golf and straight biography....good book. Great read...You can feel Jones' passion and agony when competing....insights into a different time, a different world but with values that are still respected and needed today.  Informative and inspiring without being preachy.  Lots of good, tough competition, written a way that makes it as real as if you were standing at the green.
