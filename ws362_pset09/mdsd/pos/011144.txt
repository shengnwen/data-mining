Very enjoyable book and would make a good screenplay for a film. Obviously embellished for the novel which makes it a gripping read but some of the thoughts and conversations that the participants had could never have been known by the author.

A few glaring errors too. For instance when it is mentioned that there was a rumor to have Wes Santee compete against Bannister and Landy by satellite in Quantico, Virginia in 1954, that would be a bit difficult as the first artificial satellite didn't exist until 1957!! And the telecommunications ones only came around in the sixties. Again all stuff to embellish the book but take it with a pinch of salt
