The story, with various excursions in time and place, of Liberty Fish, a Union deserter who seeks his mother's family in South Carolina and finds strange and unpleasant things.

Wright's sentence-level writing is poetic, manic, maximalist, with a stunning ear for nineteenth-century slang. From the first scene, in which bearded 'ladies' assault a fleeing slave, the reader knows this is an accomplished novel and a wildly original one. And at times while reading the book I thought it was a work of sheer genius. Wright's Southern plantation world, though, beautifully written though it is, contains themes and images and stock characters I've seen too many times before. He's much more interesting when he talks about Northern radicals and Grahamites and snake-oil salesman; that's new and interesting.

This isn't really a war novel, but the battle sequence is excellent.

I lost interest, though, toward the end, when Liberty accompanies his mad grandfather on a strange journey. Somehow the book's climax seemed anticlimactic for me, and I think that says something about the weakness of this novel: for me, anyway, it never evokes strong emotion. It's brilliantly intelligent, often humorous, tremendously entertaining at many points, but I could never find its heart.

As far as the writing goes, I suspect some people will love the book and others will find it unreadable
