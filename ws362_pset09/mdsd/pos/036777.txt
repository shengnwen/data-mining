I bought this book after realizing I was completely and utterly frustrated with the corporate world, of which I had been a part of for 30+ years. At first, upon reading the book, I was very interested in following the direction the book was taking, but then at some point I became very frustrated at myself for not having the courage and backbone to have followed my dreams earlier in my career. After working through the frustration, I began taking control of my life, one step at a time, and am setting up my own business. I did this knowing full well I can make better decisions about what goes on in a business than those running the companies I have worked for, and I will have to answer to no one but myself one way or the other. For me the corporate life will soon end and I will leave it behind. BUY THE BOOK!
