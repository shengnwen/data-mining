I was very satisfied with my new cookbook, however I was expecting to also receive in the back of this book a DVD that I thought was a part of all of the Over the Open Fire cookbooks.  I was a little disapointed that this was not a part of MY book.  I reviewed this book at a Lodge cooking store in Pigeon Forge TN, where the DVD was a part of the package.  The next time I will be a little more careful in my selection of where the purchase is made.
