Beautifully written and the translation was excellent, I guess.  I mean, if I can't read it in French, how do I know the translation is good?  I don't, but the writing is so beautifu I assume it has been well-translated.

I read this book like I can eat a bag of potato chips, easily.

The only criticism I have is that Hugo didn't know when to quit.  The movie versions all end with Javert's suicide and Valjean going off to a happy life.  In the book, Cosette and Marius treat Valjean rather shabbily once they learn of his former life as a convict.  I thought them rather ungrateful little creeps.  Valjean dies and they mourn him once they know the truth of his life.  NOW they are sorry, after he's dead, when it's too late.  Couldn't they have asked him earlier instead of casting him from their lives?  Valjean dies of a broken heart, so I blame his ingrate daughter and knucklehead son-in-law.

The story ends more satisfyingly with Javert's suicide, not with Valjean's death.  Nevertheless, it is worth reading all the way through
