I found this book by Jim Gatheral very useful from a practical standpoint. His insight for trading applications is remarkable.  I reccommend this book to any derivative trader to read from cover to cover. Its filled w/ useful tips and concepts that will save you and your firm from the many pitfalls that arise in marketers trying to satisfy their clients at the house's expense. 

Managers should make this required reading for all traders
