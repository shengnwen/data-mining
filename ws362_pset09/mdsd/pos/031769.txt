Truly as close to Braveheart as you can get! I've not had a book move me to tears for such a long time.  Not until I came to the end of Ravenheart and Jaim Grymauch's heroic stand against the Varlish. Dramatic doesn't come close to the way Gemmell has written this piece. Its moving, touching and from the heart, just the way I guess he wanted his readers to feel for the characters and the storyline. Before Gemmell, I was only hooked on Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series. On a whim, I picked up Sword in the Storm from our local library, and got hooked after the first 3 chapters. Great writing style and storytelling ability. Its the modern world's answer to the travelling storyteller of old
