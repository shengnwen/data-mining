This is a good, simple book that shows the correlation between taoist philosophy and the Star Wars films.  The author's writing style is enjoyable and the book is very easy to follow.  If you are a fan of the Star Wars films and would like to learn about taoism, then I recommend this book.  Of course, you should also pick up a copy of the Tao Te Ching, which is the cornerstone of the philosophy -- I recommend the translations by Jonathan Star and Brian Browne Walker
