Lets see, we gay guys (sorry lesbians, it's mainly about the guys here) have been responsible for most of the asthetically pleasing and fun aspects of what otherwise might have been a world destined to drabness. It's nice to read a book that not only lays out the comprehesive contributions to civilization that gay guys have made, but also is a fun read by no other than a gay man's favorite friend, the proud, and in this case, self-proclaimed fag hag. 

I love this book, Cathy tells it like it is and is proud of her relationships with her gay friends. Hmmm, reminds me of some people I know. And believe me, we gay guys truly do love our fag hag friends, who else "gets" the progresive ideas in language, design, and fabulousness - not to mention appreciate the campy gossip that we gay men of so oft known for. Plus in return we get that most important of input, the female perspective. Of course fag hags and faggots alike both appreciate the non-sexual male-female realtionship that only we really have. 

From gay speak to gay food we pioneered the most civlized trends. No, I didn't metion fashion, why would I, everyone KNOWS gay men have locked up the fashion world for years. 

Anyway, I am having a grand time reading it and feeling ever so prideful
