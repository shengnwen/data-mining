I found this book to be informative in the respect that it was not a "tell all" but instead an attempt to deliver accurate information.  However, while the author tells the reader that he is a neighbor and friend of Martha's he also gives a critical review of how her busness took it's toll on her personal life.  The only reason this is done is because Martha is a woman and so is expected to devote time to her family and run an empire at the same time,  Of course this is not something expected of her male counterparts,  Just as asking Martha about her hysterectomy is not something asked of bussnessMEN.  As for some reviewers here who state that she is everything they hate about women, thats a good thing because I don't think Martha is looking for a date from you anytime soon.  

What this book does show is that Martha is able to overcome many problems to create an empire out of idea's that the old boy's network envy.  Afterall, how dare Martha become one of the richest and most successful business woman in America by putting a value on what women do
