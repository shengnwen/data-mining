I suppose this could apply to any Calvin and Hobbes collection (not just Attack of the Deranged..., but let me share my favorite way to read Calvin and Hobbes.

If possible, I like to pick a rainy Saturday or Sunday.  I'm usually already bored and wandering around the cold house.  I catch sight of a Calvin and Hobbes book and read a few pages, but my fingers are cold and I can't concentrate.

So I make a steaming cup of my favorite tea and a piece of toast with lots of butter, wrap up in a blanket on the couch, and sit and read straight through.

It's so comforting to listen to the rain and read Calvin and Hobbes.  There's just something about it.

Er, see other reviews for information about this actual book
