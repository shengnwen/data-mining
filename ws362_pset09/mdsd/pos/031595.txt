This third installment of 'The Art Of', or should I say sixth, is once again a wonderful book. The contents are again one step further into the digital age, most pieces being made on a screen, not on paper. This is the only 'con' I have to all the 'pro's'. I miss the marker-made-visuals of for instance Doug Chiang. Even though this corresponds greatly with the way the movie was made, it is simply a thing I really like to see. But on the whole, it is a must-have for every Star Wars/movie art lover
