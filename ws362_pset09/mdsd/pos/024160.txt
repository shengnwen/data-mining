This is a new Victorian novel, starting with 2 chapters that were written by Charlotte Bront. Clare Boylan did a good job, finishing what Bront started. It must be difficult to finish something someone else started, let alone that person being the famous writer C. Bront is !!!
It's not an upbeat novel, but you do not expect it to be - Charlotte Bront it not know for her light, humerous writing. It tells the story about a little girl (who seems to be rich, with her expensive clothes and good looking and well-dressed father) who's dropped of by her father in a little private school. When the tution is not paid the headmistress finds out her "father" gave a false address and name. A gentlemen they know and a widow who lives in the little town try to find out who this girl really is, where she came from and why she was left in their town. The story takes you to the parts of London where the very poor live, the thieves, the pimps, the women and children they force to prostitute...
It's a good story, well written, the characters have depth. If you like Victorian novels, you'll like this one
