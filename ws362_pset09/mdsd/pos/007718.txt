This book is exactly what the title says:  it has insights, reflections, inspirations, and quests. And did I say 'thoughtful' and 'thought provoking'?   It's one of my all time favorites and I will treasure it always.  I like to use it to inspire my creative thought process.  It nudges my spirituality.  Great as a gift.
