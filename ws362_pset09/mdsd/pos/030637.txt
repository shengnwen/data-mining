And to be perfectly honest I prefer horror and suspense over staunch dramas or gun blazing action.  I love to get scared.  There are few enough horror writers in the world who do not only try to scare you but try to make you think as well and those few gems are the most gifted writers out there today.

This collection contains horror stories that are magical, that are raunchy and sexual, some that are optomistic, and some that are brilliantly laid out and leave you wanting more.

After reading Bras Coupe, I looked at myself differently a little bit. I questioned the people in my life, as well as myself, and added a new level of racism to exist in the world, one I had previously ignored.  And after googling the namesake, I learned something I had never known.

While reading play thing by terrance taylor, I was locked in suspense. The story was almost sickening but you could feel for everybody in the story.  The story was so humane and real. 

Tananarive Due and Steve Barnes did a great job on Danger Word, which is honestly one of the better Zombie stories I've ever read, and I've read lots. I think the husband and wife team even compares to George Ramero.

One thing I didnt like was Zane's story.  I understand Zane is an erotica writer, but if she is going to try and write horror, she shouldnt just over load the story with sex. Okay, its vampire sex but still...

I recomend this book to everybody.  I think it is a great place to start.  African American Or not, you will relate to these charecters, many of these themes are racial, but you can only learn from anothers perspective.
