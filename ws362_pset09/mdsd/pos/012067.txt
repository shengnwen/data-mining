We all want bosses with backbone, but they are surprisingly rare.  In Courage: The Backbone of Leadership, Gus Lee addresses an issue that hasn't received enough attention in the literature on leadership.  He provides leaders at all levels a useful framework for tackling difficult issues with integrity and courage.  Lee tells numerous stories of real leaders who used courage to confront unethical behavior, resolve conflicts with colleagues (subordinates, peers, and bosses), and challenge wrongs.  Also includes a useful self-assessment tool to help readers identify their deep concerns and establish behavioral objectives.
