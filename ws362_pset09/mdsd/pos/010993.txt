I liked NIGHTMARES and DREAMSCAPES better.  Personally I thought the selection of stories were better more in terms of Horror.  Physical Horror.  That being said, EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL is still a wonderful collection of short stories from the Horror master, Stephen King.  Each tale flows nicely through the entire book, not one story feels out of place.  "Dark Tales" is the perfect description of what kind of stories are in EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL.  Leaning more twords horrifying situations rather than Horror stories (in the physical sense), the book goes for more of a realistic type of Horror.  Psychopaths and torture instead of demons from another world in otherwords.  Thats not to say EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL dosn't have it's fair share of truely horrifying stories, full of monsters and demons.  The tale "1408" is a brooding and creepy story about a haunted hotel room that haunts the readers mind long after finishing it.  "Autopsy Room Four" is another terrifying story about someone trapped in their own mind and about to under go the knife.  My favorite story of them all is "The Man In The Black Suit" which feels the most like "classic" Stephen King.  Over all, this is a great collection of his work (I think alot of these stories were written during different years) and is a perfect addition to anyones Stephen King collection.  Personally speaking, if your new to the world of King I think you should start with NIGHTMARES and DREAMSCAPES (short stories seem to win people over) and then buy EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL.  The two books almost feel like they belong together.  Horror fans, check it out!
