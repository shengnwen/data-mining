I never knew there was a history of girls refusing to eat. This book starts all the way back from Midevial times up until the 1980's, when the book was written. I found it extremely fascinating. I would reccommend this book to anyone with an eating disorder, people who are into psychology or history, or just if you are looking for a great non-fiction book. Do not pass this one up
