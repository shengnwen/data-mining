Since J.D. Robb decided early in this series to split the Lieutenant Eve Dallas / Feeney team, introducing Peabody as Eve's new partner instead, we have been seeing this funny and appealing character (Delia Peabody) obtain more and more significance in the story line. In this case we witness a significant leap in Peabody's relevance with her having to face two different issues besides the current case in which she is involved assisting Eve. The first one is that McNabb (Feeney's current aide / partner) is finally accepting that he is in love with Peabody and has started to look at things in a different way. The other one is that she receives the visit of her brother Zeke, a free ager that is not totally adapted to the "normal" life in the city, but who has come to live with his sister while he works in a project for a married woman with whom he is falling in love.

Of course, Eve Dallas continues to be the main character in the story, and in this book she is involved in a couple of different cases. One of them is clearly bothering her, because a woman killed her husband with a drill and then cut a deal with the district attorney, getting a considerably milder sentence than the one she deserves according to Eve's standards. The other case involves one of Eve's weasels, the Fixer, who was murdered in an explosion by a group called Cassandra. This organization is now blowing up other buildings in the city, all of which belong to Eve's husband, the billionaire Roarke.

As with most of the other novels in the series, we find an action packed book that captures our attention right away and plunges us into a frantic race. Robb continues with her good job regarding character development, which as I mentioned focuses more than anything on Peabody and her relationship with McNabb. All of this is fairly balanced with the love scenes that are characteristic of the work of this author. Overall, this is an excellent read; I cannot wait to get to the next novel in this series.
