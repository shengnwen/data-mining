Hilarious, disturbing and painfully accurate, KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is a highly recommended book for anyone who loves restaurants, food, good stories and great writing.  

Essentially an autobiography, KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is a compilation of essays about the restaurant world and author Anthony Bourdain's journey from a lazy, dishwashing college drop-out to one of the most celebrated chefs in America.

What makes Bourdain's journey a fascinating read is the author's fearless honesty about himself and the food business.  Like a flasher, Bourdain reveals it all: the good, the bad and the truly ugly details the greater public would be shocked to learn about this seemingly glamorous industry.

While offering invaluable tips about how to cook like a pro, dine like regular and avoid the pitfalls that sink wannabe restaurateurs, Bourdain lovingly exposes the madness and mayhem behind the scenes of America's best restaurants. 

A chef's chef, Bourdain truly adores the criminal eccentrics who toil in his kitchen and in a sense KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is love letter to those he affectionately calls the "wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts, and psychopaths."

Though perhaps too frank for prim and proper types, KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL is so well written and so chock full of twisted details, I would recommend it highly to anyone who loves a good meal as much as a great tale.
