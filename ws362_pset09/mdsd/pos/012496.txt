Brought up with basic Christian beliefs, we have one crack at life and then spend an indefinite amount of time "sleeping" until resurrection day, I read this book as a skeptic about reincarnation and as a searcher for answers to questions about our spiritual being.  This book opened my mind to the possibility (of reincarnation) and definately to the endlessness of our spiritual being, which is beginning to make more sense than the original teachings of my youth.  If, in reading about these case studies, it's necessary to stretch the imagination to believe in ESP for them to possibly be true, why not the possibility of reincarnation.  Makes me wonder why the church doesn't want us to believe in the immortality of our spiritual being which they stress we have to repent to save in the first place.  Why not live more than one "life" to learn all the lessons there seem to be, one lifespan, 70 years (if you're get to live that long), doesn't seem to be enough. A very good read and no hidden philosophies
