I knew the family, as I went to high school with Quang and his older sister.  However, I had no idea what the family went through in order to arrive in Southern California.  

I am degreed in international relations, and thereby have an intellectual interest in global affairs and politics.  I find this book particularly enlightening and compelling, as Quang did a wonderful job in storytelling from a political/military point of view, all the while focusing on the humanistic, personal relations involving his family and their experiences. I wholeheartedly recommend this book, as it is well written and does not innundate one with too much military jargon
