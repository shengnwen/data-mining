The real trouble with Algebra and Precalculus is that many of the topics are interchangable.  This book does a fairly good job of covering many different topics.  I wish some of the examples were a little better, but there a lot of solutions and answers in the back for the many problems at the end of a section.  I think ideally, an Algebra II course should be very skill based, focused on "solving for x" in various situations.  A little more concrete and a little less analytical.  A precalculus course should be focused more on functions and function analysis.  Also it should include trigonometry and topics typically covered in a calculus course (without differentiation or integration) such as polar coordinates, parametrics, and vectors
