This book, as the title suggests deals with art from the Romantic period.  The good points in the book are: it gives detailed and informative commentary on artists, sculptors, and architects, paintings, sculptures and  buildings of the late 18th and 19th centuries.  There are 215 illustations.   The book puts the artists and their works in the context of history.  The  bad things in the  book are:  only 21 illustrations are in color.  This may  not seem that bad but color in Romantic paintings is important.  The book  has many illustrations of Turner's paintings, but if the viewer never saw  them in color it is very difficult to get the whole meaning of the works.   If the paintings were meant to be viewed in black and white they wouldn't  be painted in color.  That is why I gave it 4 stars.  I recomend ART IN  EUROPE 1700-1830 by Matthew Craske.  It is cheaper, more informative, has  better illustrations, and covers more material
