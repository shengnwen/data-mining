I just got this book today, and I am amazed at how much I have learned already. Dr. Cohen provides crucial information about how your doctor may prescribe far too high a dose of statins, and how to recognize and deal with drug side effects. 

The book also provides easy-to-understand information about natural alternatives (or complements) to statins, including Co-Q10, Red Yeast Rice, Plant Sterols, Policosanol, Niacin and others. I think this book will help me reduce my statin use and be able to control my cholesterol through other natural alternatives. There are a lot of products out there claiming to lower your cholesterol, and Dr. Cohen provides objective information and study data regarding many of those products, independent of commercial propaganda. 

Update six months later - with the advice of this book, I was able to lower my cholesterol from 310 to 192 in two months, using a combination of very low-dose statins, Policosanol (from sugar cane), Co-Q10, Fish Oil and plant sterols, as well as regular exercise. My Ldl is considered "optimal" now, after being "extremely high" just weeks ago. My doctor wanted to give me 40mg of Zocor, and I achieved my ideal Ldl with only 10mg. So, needless to say, I think this book is worth reading if you are considering statin therapy or just trying to get your cholesterol down. 

Thanks, Dr. Cohen
