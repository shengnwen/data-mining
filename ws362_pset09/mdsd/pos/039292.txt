I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Although there is nothing new in it, especially if you have read books on similar topics, Joe organizes the material in a systematic and usable way that is easy to follow. Just read the book and follow the steps! I did and within 2 weeks I had a new car! Everything he says in this book is true. Just open your mind to the possibilities and see what happens.
