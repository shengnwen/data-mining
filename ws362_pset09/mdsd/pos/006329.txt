I read this book in like 3rd grade and have been looking for it to read it again and again!  i loved how the author also had the less common stories like Atalanta and Orpheus. It had me going from the moment i checked it out until the moment i closed the back cover. It's useful also for projects and very informative, yet interesting, which is an odd combo.  Overall, i loved it
