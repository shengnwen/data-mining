The new book Genetically Engineered Food, A Self Defense Guide for Consumers, carefully lays out the history of genetic engineering of food (which is alarmingly short),moves into the current practices and lays out clear (and easy) recomendations for what we can do. Genetic engineering of food splices genes from another plant or animal or bacteria into yet another plant. According to David Suziki, a Canadian Geneticist,&quot;once these new forms have become established in our surroundings they can replicate, change, spread; there may be no turning back...... Since GM foods are now in our diet, we have become experimental subjects without our choice.&quot; This is not science fiction, this is at your local supermarket and you are are eating it
