I don't understand why there aren't any more books like this one...I have realized the importance of staying fit throughout pregnancy (my wife is in her 3rd trimester as I write this) - We have had this book from the first month of her pregnancy to now and it serves as our guide to working out with &quot;bread in the oven.&quot; My favorite exercise is the &quot;table&quot; one...you'll see when you get it - Herrera, the author, has put together a book that makes it easy for my wife and I to do the stuff our doctor tells us to - but have fun and explore different ways of doing it.  If there were a &quot;6 Star&quot; option, this book would get it. Thank you for making this book.  Sequel?
