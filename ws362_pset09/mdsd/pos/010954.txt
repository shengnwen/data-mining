Jeremiah truly illuminates acting not only for film, but for TV and stage, in this great book. He covers all aspects of what makes for a great performance, really giving practical and refreshing methods, advice and lessons that can be used not only by actors, but directors, screenwriters and all industry professionals. I recently took Jeremiah's 2-day "Power Directing" class. As Jeremiah points out, many of today's great directors (Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, etc.) are also actors...so it's absolutely vital to be able to merge the two disciplines when understanding how to direct scenes properly, elicit great performances on camera, edit together the scenes in a cohesive manner to tell the story, etc. I recommend both the book and his 2-day "Power Directing" class, not only for directors, but for actors and writers
