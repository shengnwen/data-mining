Robert Kysar's book, John the Maverick Gospel, is one of the finest short introductions to Johannine issues ever written over the last half a century.  Because of its brevity and clarity, the book is accessible for nonspecialist readers; and yet Kysar's familiarity with the vast array of international secondary literature makes his treatments worth considering for scholars and students alike.  Dealing with such topics as John's relation to the Synoptics, John's distinctive Christology (esp. the Father/Son relationship), John's presentations of the Signs-faith relationship, eschatology, and dualism, Kysar introduces his discussions with helpful lists of relevant texts for the reader to explore first inductively.  His excellent addition on the presentation of women in the Gospel of John is well worth the price of the book in and of itself!  This book is an excellent resource for teaching, and I recommend it enthusiastically
