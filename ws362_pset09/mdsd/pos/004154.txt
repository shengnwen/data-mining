This book is very different from the other quotation books I've used.  It is well organized and indexed, but a large number of quotes are very large indeed.  It is perhaps dominated by the Bible, Shakespeare, and a few other well-know authors/books.  If you know something is from Shakespeare and you need to know where (which play, act, etc.), this book is for you.  If you just collect quotes, as I do, it isn't all that helpful--Bartlett's is better for that purpose.  Also, see Lieberman's 3500 quotes book and, especially, Braude's book of speakers' stories (exceptionally good).  So, the Oxford book is a 3 or a 5 depending on how you want to use it.  So, I gave it a 4.  What can you do?  As Virgil (as quoted in the book) says: "Trust one who has gone through it."  Great reference text, but not a book to read through, IMHO
