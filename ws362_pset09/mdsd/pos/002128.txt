Dahl makes an ingenious twist by setting a predator as the hero.  (After all, unless you're a vegetarian, you're no better than the Big Bad Wolf.)

There are a few weaknesses in the book, though:

What makes the farmers think that one place is any better place for a stakeout than any other place?  Anyone who tries to catch a burrowing animal knows that anywhere in any direction is fair game.

Dahl tells us that the farmers are despicable because he wants us to see the fox as the hero.  However, he might have done a better job of characterizing the farmers as despicable.  Yes, they are fanatical in their effort to catch the fox, but that is not enough.

I still say "Matilda" is my favorite
