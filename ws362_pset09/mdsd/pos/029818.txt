True Confessions is so well written that you may not realize that the apparent lack of style IS the style. No flowery prose, not a wasted word. Expert craftsmanship.

Other reviewers have described the book as a mystery story. No such thing. The mystery is a MacGuffin, and the plot itself is just a device to, first, gradually reveal to us the characters, and, then, subject each of them to self-revelation and growth.

Although there is much irony and many clever bon mots in the story, its overall tone is bleak. I give it only four stars because its lack of sunlight mars our acceptance of it as reality. The film, on the other hand - an excellent adaptation - contains perhaps too much sunlight.

Summary: a great read, but don't hang your interest on its being a detective story
