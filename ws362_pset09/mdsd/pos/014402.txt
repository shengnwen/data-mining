Rovell quenched my need for the first riveting Gatorade sports marketing book ever written.  He didn't miss a beat in his passionate chronicle of Gatorade's inventors, memorable moments in sports history and Gatorade's rise to become an iconic brand.  Rovell's journalistic integrity and skillful writing was quite evident and made me not want to put the book down.   Rovell has given me the gift of a perfect, light hearted, easy read that anyone will enjoy.
