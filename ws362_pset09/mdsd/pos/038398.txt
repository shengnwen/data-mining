I read this book for my book club.  It was a very interesting read and an enlightening look into life in Africa as well as into the male psyche and into human nature. I think one reason I found it slightly lacking was that it is on Time's 100 Best Novels; I don't know if it warranted that and that made me expect more. I would still highly recommend it if you want something different and interesting to read that is also a fairly easy read.
