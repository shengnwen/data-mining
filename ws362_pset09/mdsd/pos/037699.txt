I purchased this kit (book and sample tests) primarily as a study guide to prepare for the 70-536 exam.  Due in large part to this kit, I was able to pass the exam on my first attempt.  Beyond being a great tool for exam preparation, the book provided a great deal of information and "how to" details for key .NET topics.  I do agree with a few other reviewers that there are some topics covered in the actual exam that are not addressed in the kit.  I recommend this product to anyone preparing for the 70-536 exam
