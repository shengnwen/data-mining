Peter Robinson is one of my hands-down-all-time-favorite writers and he never disappoints.  I wasn't as interested in this particular book as others and can't explain why.  I'm more inclined to think it was me rather than him, though.  My head may have just been in an odd, distracted place.  This follows his ever-present Inspector Alan Banks and a crime (or series of crimes?) that are particularly horrific - murder by arson.  Yorkshire is as wonderfully described as ever and the tension between Banks and DI Cabbot is still well-written.  The plot is wonderfully twisty.  As I said, the book is beautifully done - just can't figure why I didn't love it
