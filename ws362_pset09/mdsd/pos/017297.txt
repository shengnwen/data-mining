    This book was a lot of fun to read and I really felt like I learned a lot after I finished.  The book talks about genetically modified food and how there was such an outcry by the public when it first came in to the market.  People didn't want to eat "Frankestien food".  He explains why many things people think are bad about recombinant DNA (putting the DNA of one organism into another) are just misconceptions and that there is more potential for good than bad when it comes to recombinant DNA.  
    The book did get a little boring for me when it came to the chapter on the human genome project though, but that was the only chapter that wasn't interesting to me.  
    Even people with a strong science schooling will learn things they did not know from this book.  I am a third year biology major and learned a lot.  There may be some parts that are difficult to understand if you haven't taken a few science classes, but the book is still worth reading.  
    If you are a religious person you might get upset by this book because Watson treats evolution as truth and bases quite a bit of reasoning on it.  He doesn't try to hide the fact that he is an atheist, but does criticize the religious a little with his tone.  (I personally am not religious.)
