Starting with my son and then my daughter we read through Wilkin's books.  They loved them.  I loved them.  So, I was thrilled to find this edition.  I bought it for my grandson.  But I am keeping it for myself and will order another copy for him.  In this way he can have some of the best books at 'Grannie's" house for reading.  I plan to buy more and give them as gifts to my daughter's friends as they have children
