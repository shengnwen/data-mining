Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, is one of the most important persons in queer  theory. &quot;Epistemology&quot; is maybe her most well-known book. The  books contains several queer readings of literature, but it is the  Introduction and the title essay which are most famous. In the  &quot;Epistemology of the Closet&quot; article, Sedgwick deconstruct the  being in/being out of the closet binarism. She shows how one can never be  in the closet - as you can never be sure of who knows, and one can never be  out of the closet - as once again, you never know who already knows.  Sedgwick shows how so much of the discourse of secrecy in modern Western  societies is centered around homosexuality and the closet. She uses the  bibical story of Esther and shows how her story is a coming-out story. For  those of you celebearing Purim: the Megillah reading will never look the  same, once you realize that Esther confessing to Ahesurus she is Jewish, is  an act of coming out. This book is indispensable to anyone interested in  gay studies/queer theory
