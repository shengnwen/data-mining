Hanson is one of the rare people that can live in two distinct worlds and have the vision to see the difference.   Fortunately for all the rest of us, he also has the ability to allow us all to see his two worlds.   To me, many that read this book need to read it closer, for the book contains much more than casual reading can reveal.   This book tells real life stories of real life people and the many interactions that take place between these people, that will ultimately shape everyones future.  I did my best to try and say how I feel about this book.  Read this book yourself and enjoy
