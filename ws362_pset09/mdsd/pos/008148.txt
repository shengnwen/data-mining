This song changed my life and my diet. I thought it was very normal to eat my pets but little did i know the consequences of such actions. This song has inspired me to go into schools and teach the less fortunate about the workings of the digestive organs and their limits. Nadine Bernard Westcott is an central figure in my life and I'd like to sing my praises to her - and give my condolences to "The Old Lady" who swallowed a fly. RI
