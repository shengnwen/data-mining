An amazing Bruce Weber portfolio and everything a good coffee table book should be. It's size is amazing pound for pound and filled to the brim with Bruce's ad campaigns for Versace, Abercrombie & Fitch, endless fashionista mags as well as a plethora of portraits. Quite a treat for the eyes for no one takes a picture like Bruce Weber. Never have I seen a photographer who can capture the ultimate essence of beautiful youth like this man. Indulge yourself with this one..
