I love this book and I will be pulling it out often this growing season.  It's packed with very specific information on how to grow every imaginable edible plant --from flowers through vegetables and fruit trees--in containers.  You will learn when to plant, which varities do best in containers, whether to start with seed or transplants, how to combine plants in a container for beauty and/or successive harvesting, what size container to use, how often to fertilize and with what, when to harvest...the list goes on and on.  The writing itself is delightful, from the descriptions and planting instructions for theme gardens (Victorian Splendor, Tea Time, Childrens' Garden just to name a few) to the history of many of the plants and unusual recipes using the bounty of your containers (Begonia Sorbet, Strawberries with Scented 
Geraniums and Creme Fraiche, Stuffed Squash Blossoms with Fresh Tomato Sauce)!  The Bountiful Container is a joy to read and really makes you want to get out into your garden and start planting.  It's both a feel good book and a very informative book--IMO a rare combination in a reference book.  I can't say enough, I'm so glad I bought this book.
