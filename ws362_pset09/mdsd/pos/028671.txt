First, great job by the first reviewer. He/she really gets across the sinister strangeness of this work of bio-fiction.

The book is hard to come by. It is worth the search, for David Atlee Phillips was truly one of the most important men in U.S. Cold War history. (Probably more important than Presidents such as Carter, Ford & Bush I.) He had a major hand in the creation/implementation of genocidal U.S. policy toward Central & South America, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands. He organized the overthrow and murder of Salvador Allende in Chile. He failed to do the same with Fidel Castro. He exterminated the socialist democracy of mid-1950s Guatemala. He most probably had a hand in the national security state entrapment of Richard Nixon. (AKA "Watergate".) And -- certainly his crowning achievment -- he managed the 1963 Dallas coup d'etat which took the life of John F. Kennedy.

Of course, this book masks all that. Or does it?

Worms are eating him now. It's too bad a man can die but once.
