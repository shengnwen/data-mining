I cannot tell a lie. Along with Michael Badham, I wrote SAILORS' SECRETS. Aside from learning the tricky placement of the apostrophe (for &quot;sailors'&quot; to make it plural) in the title, the toughest part was &quot;what to put in and what to leave out&quot; after five years. We went after under-known gems of wisdom and expertise from sailors who had been there. We got them, by the boatload. It's a bit hard to use the index and/or the table of contents diasl up a particular reference. Maybe that's because, after five years of interviewing sailors, assembling biographies, doing illustrations, collecting permissions, and organizing the work into &quot;commandments,&quot; for the average guy, I (we) found it hard to pour still more time into refining and cross-referencing our opus. Other than that , however, SAILORS'SECRETS has stood the test of thousands of readers and the passage of another five years with superior results and reviews. Trendy as sailing can be, our book hits the basics of racing, cruising and boat owning that aren't likely to go out of date
