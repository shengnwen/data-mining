Forever after you read A Ring of Bright Water, the beauty, wonder, and humor of this book will gently surface with a ring of bright ripples in the waters of you mind.  I am never able to remember this book without simultaneously wanting to laugh and to cry-and always with a sense of awed wonder.  This is the true story of Gavin's befriending of otters (or perhaps we should say of the otters' decision to befriend Gavin.)  In one scene, on the first night Gavin has one of the otters in his home, the otter carefully watches Gavin get into bed and pull the covers to his chin.  The otter then crawls in beside Gavin, lies on its back, and pulls the covers to its own chin.  Other scenes describe Gavin's losing efforts to make certain parts of his cottage off limits to otters.  Gavin never for the rest of his life produced prose that so translucently coveys the beauty of the waters around his cottage, or the sense of his own evolving life and emotions. Reading this book is giving a gift to yourself. It is one a dozen that I always look for used to give to friends
