I inherited an entire, almost complete set of vintage Hardy Boys mysteries from my dad, and because I am an avid Nancy Drew collector, I dove into them. Big fans of vintage mystery series like Nancy Drew or Tom Swift or The Happy Hollisters, should have no trouble opening up and letting the Hardy Boys in too. The Tower Treasure is a great opener for the series and introduces Frank and Joe and their friends and family. It's a great story and good on a rainy day. I'm about half way through the whole series right now - there are a lot more Hardy Boys than the original Nancy Drews - and I am enjoying it almost as much as I do Nancy.
