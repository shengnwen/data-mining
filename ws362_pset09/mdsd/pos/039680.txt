Lindsey Davis' Marcus Didius Falco series of murder mysteries set in ancient Rome (AD 70-73) is spot-on. Besides being riveting mystery novels, Davis' historical knowledge is both extensive and up-to-date. (I should  know. I have recently received a doctorate in Roman history and am whiling  away the long wait for an academic post.) &quot;Fountain&quot; offers an  almost painless introduction to the supposedly tedious subject of Roman  aqueducts and water management. In the novels, obscure facts of Roman  history (such as the organization of the vigiles, Rome's firemen and  police, or the Maiuma, a religious carnival involving nude bathing - in  &quot;Palmyra&quot;) come alive. What's more, Davis does this with humor  and a light touch. She completely undercuts the supposedly stuffy image of  the ancient Romans with Falco's irreverent perspective. Davis is 1000 times  better than Colleen McCullough's bloated &quot;First Man in Rome&quot;  series
