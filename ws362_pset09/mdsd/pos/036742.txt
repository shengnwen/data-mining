A.  You have to like Dave Barry's style of humor.

B.  You really have to know something about computers (old ones using Windows 95 more appropriate than you can imagine!).

C.  If an Apple user, you must have at LEAST a friend who has complained to you about PCs.


Good book with lots of humor.  A few pages rated PG-13 for language (if you know Dave Barry's work, it won't surprise you).  This is a good book to drop into a time capsule (Time Capsule seems a good name for a rock band)
