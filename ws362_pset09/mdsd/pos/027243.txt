My daughter spotted this book at the library and said "look its a badge book."  We are reading Caldecott Honor books to earn a badge from the library.  I thought the content was a little advanced for a 3 year old, but she said "mommy this is an interesting book."  She wants to read it again tonight before we return it to the library.  I am ordering a paperback copy for at home and for future reads.  I think she will understand the content and meaning more as she gets older.  I am certain she doesn't know what riots are but she liked the tie-in with the 2 fueding cats becoming friends in the end and sharing a bowl of milk at the shelter where their families have been relocated during the riots
