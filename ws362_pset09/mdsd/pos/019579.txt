I read this book a few years ago because my sister-in-law ordered it, and accidentally mailed it to our house, all the way across the country.  It looked interesting, so my wife and I called her, told he that Amazon had shipped it to the wrong address, (she had used our account to order it), and sent her replacement copies.  Few books shake me to my core.  In fact, I think this is likely the only one that had me so shaken, so moved by the end, that I actually cried I had no more to read.  Eldredge hits the nail on the head, repeatedly.  Men are meant, by design and disposition, to be dangerous things.  We are meant to have adventures, to seek the love of a dear woman, and to have a cause.  Eldredge points this out, and shows how we have been immasculated.  Women, for the last hundred plus years, have sought to make men more into their image, creating the "metrosexual" trend, and at first cheered about it.  Now women bemoan the facts, "where are all the real men?!"  Um, darlin', you crushed our manhood over a hundred years, you don't want us to be warriors, you don't want us to be dangerous, you don't want us to be who we are designed to be, you yell at us when we try to be leaders, and you want to be angry that we are NOT adventurous, dangerous, or leaders?  Rediculous!  Read this book, men, and live it.  Your wife will love you for it.  Trust me
