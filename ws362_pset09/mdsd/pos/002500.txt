Dallas Willard's "The Great Omission" is a well-written and powerful work on a subject that the Western church has chosen to ignore for over a century. Our bend towards easy-believism in the American church has caused us to ignore what our Lord commanded us to do. Rather than seeking to make disciples, we have sought to follow our own path of watered-down half-hearted commitment to the gospel of our Lord. Willard's words resonate with Bonhoeffer's demanding call to biblical discipleship in his classic "The Cost of Discipleship". He challenges us to follow the example of our Lord and to obey His call to each of us. This is a must read for any who are earnestly desiring to seek to lead the church towards proper course of biblical christianity
