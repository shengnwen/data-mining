After leaving my 18 year old daughter at a college 9 hours away from home this fall, I didn't anticipate how hard it would be. I was excited for her to have this experience in a great college town. I was unprepared for how I would feel like I had lost a body part, how I had to keep reminding myself that she didn't die, she's just away at college. This book verbalized many of my exact feelings about this experience. It was very helpful to me and made me feel better. The daughter in the book reminded me of my own vegetarian, jewelry wearing, intelligent, independent daughter. I recommend this book to other parents going through this life passage
