These two novellas do not disappoint.  Both are fables written for adults.  If you feel like simply being entertained, read them as such, laugh and go no farther.  If you want to delve a little deeper, read these as wonderful stories about the existence of the human soul, war, and morality.  Either way, they are plainly speaking fantastic.
