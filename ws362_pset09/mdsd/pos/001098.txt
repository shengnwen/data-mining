     I picked up this book at a Friends of the Library sale.  What an enjoyable find!  I was intrigued and caught up in the story of phschic Zoe and her at first pretend but now real (she hopes) marriage to private investagator, Ethan Truax.  The two are settled in a town called Whispering Springs and have an interesting mix of family and friends.
     This book was interesting enough that I have now ordered its predacessor,Light and Shadow, and the follow up novel, Falling Awake.
