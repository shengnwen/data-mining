Intrigued by the new show, "Bones" on Fox, which is based on the writer's life, I picked up "Monday Mourning".  I have found a new author.  The heroine, Temperance Brennan is a forensic expert who determines dates and causes of death by observing the bones of the deceased.  When a number of human bones are found in the cellar of a Montreal pizza parlor, Tempe is called to the scene.  The evidence found at the scene suggests that the bodies could be from the 19th century; however, Tempe is convinced that the bodies are not nearly that old.  With the help of her detective/boyfriend Andrew Ryan, Tempe follows a trail that leads to some frightening details regarding the case.  Good read, solid characters
