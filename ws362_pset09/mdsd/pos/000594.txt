Child and Preston know how to write thrillers.  This was my first book by the two, and I enjoyed it very much.  FBI Special Agent Pendergast is like James Bond, a super hero who knows everything and has no fear of anything.  He perfectly complements NYC Police Lt. D'Agosta.  The book is full of nasty or idiotic people, and you can pretty well figure who's going to be eaten by the monster, but there are so many surprises along the way that it doesn't matter.

The science (or pseudo-science, whatever) is fascinating, whether any of it is real or not.

The book builds to a superb climax where basically all hell breaks loose.  There are some comparisons to Jurassic Park, but the book can stand on its own merits.

If the rating system had more steps, I would give this a 4.25.

It's just a shame that the movie version is so limp compared to the book
