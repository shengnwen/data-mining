As someone who daily works with seniors, I found this book to be an excellent overview and comprehensive study into this subject.  The author's experience and specificity of the issues involved is very informative.  I especially liked the manner in which the many relevant subjects were covered.
     I highly recommend this not only to those who work in this area, but anyone who has contact on a continuous basis with this generation
