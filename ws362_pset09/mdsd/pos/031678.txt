About three years ago my business coach recommended this book.  An avid journaler and reader I figured it was right up my alley.

It was and it is.

As some other reviewers mentioned -- using these techniques may be a bit like Dumbo flying with his feather -- but in this day and age it's not so awful to want to cling to the feather in the first place.

The book helped me create a space and a reverence for the time I take in reflection and goal setting.  I learned to clear my head and respect my ideas and thoughts, my goals and my dreams -- even when no one else did.

My life continues to be a great source of joy and success -- is it because of THIS book? nah.  It's because of a dedication to living with the basic tenets of this book (and many others) in my heart.  

It's quite possible that you simply stumble upon this book when you are wondering where you are going with your life and why...it's possible that you are on a constant quest for your right life.  Use this book as the tool to help you move your mindset to a slightly quieter space and give yourself permission to Write It Down so you can Make It Happen.
