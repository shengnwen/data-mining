A facinating book. About modern Brazilian folklore about animal transformation, particularly the were-dolphin, but also includes were-pigs, were-horses, were-snakes, were-jaguars and the werewolf. Many Brazilians  still believe that many of the Amazon river dolphins are human beings who  have temporarily transformed. Refreshingly, we don't hear any of the  standard European &quot;cannibalism&quot; and &quot;devil worship&quot;  theories that are so often associated with the werewolf and were-animals in  general. Instead, those who transform are usually nothing worse than  spooky... the were-dolphin is notoriously fun-loving, often plays a musical  instrument in human form, and is very seductive. The folklore is saturated  with folk beliefs centered on shamanism, and the stories are a facinating  look into the belief systems and views of these people. It's nice to see a  non-western viewpoint of the shapeshifter
