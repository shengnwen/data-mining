This version of The Phantom of the Opera is an excellent one for beginning readers and adults as well.  For beginners, it is an easy-to-understand way to introduce the classic work.  But this is also true for older readers.  The unabridged version is an excellent book, but it might be hard to follow or just plain intimidating for many readers.  Reading the Stepping Stone version first will give a clear understanding of the book.  For instance, time jumps around in the regular version - and the history of the Phantom isn't even given until the very end.  The Stepping Stone version proceeds from start to finish with the normal time frame.  Readers who enjoy the book, will find the transition to reading the "real" book much easier.  Stepping Stones are a great way to ease kids and adults into classic reads
