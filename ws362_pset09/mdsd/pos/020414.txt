The story is of course, about the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1912. What the book is really about is the people who perpetrated the crime. This is a fairly good book, a fast read with no spiritual crises, deep insight, or anything else of that sort to drag it down. I enjoyed the pre theft stories of the master thief and conman, the Marquis de Valfierno, and how he elegantly swindled his &quot;clients.&quot
