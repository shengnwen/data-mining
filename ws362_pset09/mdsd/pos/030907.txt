i know that a lot of people who read this book was offended by it. it certainly isn't for everyone. the baali doesnt have to exist in each and every soryteller's game setting but, if it does, then this book is a great  help. it gives in-depth information about the baali in an intelligent,  three dimensional manner. not an &quot;evil for the sake of evil&quot; but  gives real reasons why the baali do what they do and what they are. my only  problem is that the book does not give enough daimoinon powers but it is  rich in historical content and the philosophies of the baali. for me, i  don't regret purchasing this book
