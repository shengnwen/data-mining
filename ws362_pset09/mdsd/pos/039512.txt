This is a great book for kids who are interested in cartooning and comics. Any kid who thinks they might want to draw or write comics will love this book-  I know I would have!  I  have taught several comic-book art classes in the upstate NY area, and I would recomend it to any art teacher who wanted to do a comic book project. The design, layout of the book, and illustrations (Some by teen cartoonists and younger!) are very fun and exciting.  Well done
