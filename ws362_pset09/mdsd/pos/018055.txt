The book is very well written and it teaches very good techniques for cooking wich gives more flavor to the food.  I have tried several of the recipes following the instructions as exactly as I could, but I am a bit dissapointed because they did not seem to me very tasty.  I expected to obtain results similar or equal to the dishes you have at Italian restaurants, but there are only, perhaps,a few of them.  However, the flavor is not bad either, and I love the techniques given, is just that I expected more.
