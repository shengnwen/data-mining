Crichton is one of my authors I have to be in the mood for. I tend towards his early medical stuff, just as I tende towards the earlier versions of ER (actually quit watching it years ago). Chrichton is an intelligent writer, and as this is one of his earliest books you can see for yourself how he has developed as a writer.  In some ways, I think he earlier stuff is better, partly because he is writing closer to his 'area of observation?' 

The book is about a touchy subject, abortion during the sixties before Roe V Wade. It was known to be done, both inside and outside of hospitals, and though I am personally not pro-abortion...I would not want to go back to the era before that when women died having abortions. This is a personal choice area, and Crichton was obviously working his way through his own feelings on this subject. This whole area doesn't just start with the abortion; it starts with parents teaching children responsibility, families that act as families, the whole thing. To debate here or in one book would be senseless.

Crichton mystery had me going in several wrong directions before I finally understood what was going on...which is good. I don't like knowing 'who done it' three pages into the book.

Interesting, older read for summertime reading...
