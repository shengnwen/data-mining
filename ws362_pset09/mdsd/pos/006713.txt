I am 46 years old and searching for a way to make the second half of my life even better than the first. I have things I haven't done yet, ideas to nurture into reality, and relationships to develop! But all these negative tapes in my head developed over the first half of my life, are holding me back from the second. The beauty of this book is it gives us actual stories,exercises and a CD of visualisations to help me reprogram the old stuff and create the life I want! How perfect. The Guide To Fearless Aging is making me so excited about the possibilities again. I haven't felt this great in a long time.I have joined a group that uses the ideas in this book as a springboard into a joyous and productive midlife. I have never had such support. You have to read this book.Thank you Nancy and Marilyn. Finally!!!
