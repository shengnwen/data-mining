The atlas is fine, has lots of information, well-organized, nice labels, good coverage, good index, can't imagine any improvements.  Except the proof-reading could have been much better.  There are four errors on the two pages centered on San Luis Obispo alone.  San Carpoforo is spelled San Carpoford.  Prefumo is spelled Perfumo.  Never seen such carelessness in a map before.  It's a shame
