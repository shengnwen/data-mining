Whether you're involved in business, the arts, or multimedia productions, you have to consult FAIR USE, FREE USE AND USE BY PERMISSION: HOW TO HANDLE COPYRIGHTS IN ALL MEDIA. Where other books narrow the focus to copyright protection in the Internet era, FAIR USE discusses different types of copyright issues, from how to verify what copyright law 'fair' use falls under to gaining permissions, negotiating licenses, securing releases, and more. Chapters even delve into how to locate copyright holders, how to request permissions, and how to understand copyright status of a work. Far more comprehensive than competitors on the topic, this is a 'must' for any public, art or business library.
