The most significant contribution of James Davison Hunter's Culture Wars resides in the controversy and extensive scholarship that followed the publication of his book.  In this work Hunter examines the discourse and  methodologies of contempporary social movement organizations, and arrives  at an interesting conclusion: while denominational differences may have  declined in the second half of the 20th century, significant struggles  within the realm of religion remain.  The main divide that the author  focuses on is that between the &quot;orthodox&quot; and  &quot;progressives.&quot;  While the author does an admirable job of making  connections between politics, religion, and social movements, his final  anaylsis seems a bit simplistic.  Hunter suggests that most of the current  debates within American public culture can be expressed as struggles  between two monolithic groups.  However, other authors who have responded  to Hunter's work have taken issue with this point, arguing that in terms of  attitudes toward economic justice, the alignments that Hunter describes do  not hold.  In general, Hunter has provided an accessible, provocative  account of contemporary conflicts in the public realm.  His conclusions  about what these conflicts mean for the future of American democracy are  also quite insightful.  The main limitation of the work is that his  analysis may be overly simplistic, with not enough attention paid to the  nuances of the debates that he describes
