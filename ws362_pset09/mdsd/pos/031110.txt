I really enjoyed this book. I have an hour commute daily to work on the train and I actually looked forward to it.  I really couldn't put it down and echo the sentiments of the other reviewers when they said they felt they really knew the characters.  I would also love to have a margarita (or 3) with Augusta Holderfield and Dean Lynch on the porch of Mimosa Grove.  Also makes me want to learn to play the dulcimer [...].  

Please pick up this book and enjoy the well written, fully developed characters and setting
