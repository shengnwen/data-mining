Evidence is the key word in E IS FOR EVIDENCE, from evidence planted to implement another, to lost evidence, etc. Grafton likes E words because there are lots of them in here to accompany evidence: We have ex-lovers, evasions, enemies, exoneration and endings.

Wow, are you as confused as I was when reading the back of this book?? My advice is not to read the back and just jump right in to it! This is the book where we see that Kinsey Millhone is not a super woman action figure, but can go through the normal garbage that we all experience. Except with Kinsey it's on a much grander scale. E IS FOR EVIDENCE tells a little of Kinsey's background, that she's thirty-two and had been married twice and divorced twice, used to be a cop, doesn't have many close friends (except for Henry) and usually takes the case of the underdog. 

Grafton delves more into the personality behind her heroine and lets the reader see more of the real Kinsey Millhone, but so as not to bore you, she also brings us closer to Henry and others with glimpses into their homes and lives.

Another winner for Grafton!
