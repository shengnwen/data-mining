Around the time that Desperation & The Rugulators were floating around for the public to view and decipher, Stephen King decided to take a gamble on a long lost form of publication known as the serial novel.  Back in the days of Dickens, people in America used to wait months and months to get Dickens' newest novels one piece at a time.  Sounds like torture.  Well...it was sort of exciting.  Supposedly Steve-O himself didn't know how the whole thing was going to turn out.  So we got a longish yarn in six parts.  

John Coffey is a prisoner on The Green Mile (death row) in for killing two little girls.  Soon he's got a date with old Sparky.  The story is told through the recollection of ex-prison guard Paul Edgecomb.  Coffey is a large, quiet black man who doesn't seem to fit in on The Green Mile.  He's so gentle and kind and soft-spoken.  You gotta wonder what drove him to kill those two sweet little girls.  And he has a special gift.

This is King at what he does best, pure story-telling.  When he gets into his groove, there's no one better at spinning an enjoyable yarn.

After the dry-spell of '92-'96 with some of King's worst novels ever, The Green Mile was a welcome change back in the right direction.  Shades of brilliance, King still surprises us Constant Readers after all these years.
