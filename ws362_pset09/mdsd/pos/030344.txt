I should have read this book before traveling to Israel.  Donna Rosenthal is a skilled writer and her antecdotes are often hilarious.  Read "From Beirut to Jerusalem" for the politics and the views of the leaders, but read "The Israelis" to understand the opinions of everyday Israelis and to get a glimpse of what to expect when you're actually there.  It's well worth a read.
