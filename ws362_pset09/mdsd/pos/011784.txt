This is one of those classic books, that never get old. I grew up watching the movie, and did not read the book until I was 17. I thought, oh, this is not going to be nearly as good. Quite the opposite! This was such an enriching, lovely drama. Tragic, sure. Yet, there is hope, love, and all things enternal to human lives and love. 

Read this book if you are a huge fan of the movie. Its better than the movie in so many ways. You learn more about Mary Carson, you see more of Fee's true character (and her family!!), and why Frank and Paddy are the way they are. Of course, you see in full play Meggie & Father Ralph as they grow up together, and fight the other through love, time, & religion. 

So worth your time! I read it at least once a year!!! :
