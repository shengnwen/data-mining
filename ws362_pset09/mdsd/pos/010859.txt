"We have plans.  Then something happens."  Sammy has plans: to go to college, to get out of the barrio, to love Juliana.  Although Sammy and Juliana in Hollywood takes place in the Hollywood barrio of Las Cruces, New Mexico, in 1968/69, it is a timeless story of teen hopes and fears, love and loss, and what it is like to grow up poor and of color.  Sammy, called The Librarian by his friends for his scholarly ways, falls in love with Juliana the summer before his senior year.  By summer's end, she has died tragically and senselessly, and Sammy "[doesn't] care.  Not about anything.  Not anymore."  But despite his anger and the pain of his loss, the demands of his friends and his family only increase in his senior year and Sammy is pulled into their lives.  These are real teenagers, who drink, party, take drugs, have sex, swear, push the limits of school administrations and the law.  Sammy agrees to be campaign manager for Gigi who is running for student body president on a platform of "shakin' up the school."  Some of his friends face the draft and service in Vietnam, and everyone knows that poor Hispanic boys of Hollywood come back in pine boxes.  Two friends are brutally beaten for being gay.  One friend dies of heroin addiction.   His father is injured in an automobile accident.  Things happen.
Sammy maneuvers through the minefields of student elections, drugs, protests, racism homophobia, and loss and finds a resiliency he doesn't know he has. Like all teenagers, he thinks his life will start when he gets to college.  But he is deeply involved in the life of Hollywood.  Saenz has found an authentic voice in Sammy who is full of the angst and confusion of all teenagers but is also perceptive, sensitive and compassionate.  This is a beautifully realized story of what it meant in 1968 to grow up in the barrio.  Today, teens growing up in the ghettos face the same problems Sammy and his friends faced.
