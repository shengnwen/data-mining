This is a good book to help you think about food in a different way, more as fuel. 

For the reviewer who had a concern about the term "energy dense", look at it this way: If you're out backpacking, where you're carrying all your own food and water on your back, yes, ounce for ounce you want the most concentrated sources of energy you can get. And you will need that energy as you hike through the woods or wherever.

On the other hand, when you're at home sitting at the computer, you do not need so much energy. However, your mind still thinks it "should" have a certain amount of food, weight-wise. So what Volumetrics does is help to reconcile what your mind would like (a full dish of something), with what your body needs (salad or soup or a healthy-prepared entree). This is not to say that you shouldn't still practice portion control, but if you eat more of the "calorie bargain" foods, you can still have decent portions (not the miniscule portions they show in pictures) of the good ice cream or chocolate or cheese when you like.

The Volumetrics Eating Plan is better, but this one is still good for the "science behind the plan"
