Malamud's book is the story of a man who moves across the country to try a new life as a college instructor. As a college instructor myself, the politics he deals with rang true. I was mainly impressed, however, with the  thoughts inside this characters head. I often read novels in which I come  across something and think &quot;No man I know would ever think this&quot;,  but I never felt that way here. I didn't like the ending (I thought the  character made a bad choice) but Malamud is under no contract to clear his  endings with me first. A good solid read
