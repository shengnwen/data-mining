Once again De Mille has written a provacative novel. It is both enertaining and thought provoking. I could hardly put it down. It is one of his better pieces of work.

The theme in the book is that a very rich,powerful and deranged  individual could bring about a nuclear tradegy. Moreover, that this might even be encouraged behind the scenes by our government. The story raises one's conscienciousness regarding the fact that either domestic or foreign terrriosts could destroy our world. That, infact, bellerent governments might enable it to happen. The book also points up the lack of cooperation that sometimes prevents our national security agencies from stopping such a holocaust. But DeMille's main character ignores the protocol and red tape of such bureauracies and cuts to the chase.

The book is also very funny as De Mille's protagonist is both cynical and smart.This book is far better than his last, although becomes redundant at times. 

Wild Fire left me wondering if in fact a war mongering government might have used such trickery to give us an excuse to invade the Moslem World or might do so on a grander scale to attack Iran or North Korea in the future. I"ll take my chances with diplomacy, thanks.

De Mille mixes fact with fiction, as so many novalists like to do today. But as we have seen since September 11th, truth is stranger than fiction.
