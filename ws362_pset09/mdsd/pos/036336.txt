This was the first of Anne Perry's Victorian mysteries that I have read, and I enjoyed it greatly. She combines historical details with fictional ones to create an excellent combination of history and mystery. 

In England, an election is about to take place, which creates tensions between everyone in London. From the streets up to the manor houses in which the wealthy live, no one can talk about anything else. There are two major candidates in the election who stand out: Charles Voisey and Aubrey Serracold, both running on different platforms in different political parties. The bizarre murder of a seance woman in Southampton Row is linked to the election, and it is up to Thomas Pitt to find the killer while at the same time observe the election. 

This is a fast-paced book with a lot of political intrigue- its definitely not your typical murder mystery. While Charlotte Pitt, Thomas's wife, is not as present in Southampton Row as she is in other mysteries, the presence of women can be felt, and Perry gives a valuable insight into the lives of women and their position in society in Victorian England. This was a well-written and perceptive novel, and I look forward to reading others in the series. A side note, however: if you are a first-time reader of any of the three series Perry has written, I suggest that you begin with the first book of each- because some of the books discuss things that took place in previous novels.
