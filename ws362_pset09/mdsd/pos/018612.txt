Louis Menard points out his excellent introduction to The Manchurian Candidate that Richard Condon's novel is about control, conditioning, and manipulation.  Raymond Shaw and his fellow G.I.s are captured in Korea, undergo "brainwashing", and are released believing that they, through the heroism of Sergeant Shaw, have been saved from a company of enemy infantry.  The encounter never took place, of course, but that's the story that will win Raymond the Medal of Honor.  However, Raymond has been conditioned to be the ulimate assassin.  Meanwhile Major Marco, Raymond's commanding officer in Korea, has been having terrible nightmares in which he sees Raymond killing two members of their patrol in cold blood.  He also sees himself and his patrol on a stage facing some high ranking Soviet and Chinese officals. The staggering nightmares cause Marco to start wondering if he, Raymond, and the others have been brainwashed.  This leads him on a frantic investigation to discover the truth before something disastrous happens.  Raymond can't recall any of what Marco has been dreaming about.  He has been completely conditioned twice over -- once by the Pavlovian doctors and also by his mother, Mrs. Iselin, probably the most evil villainess in all of literature.  She is the embodiment of Control and she savages anyone who gets in the way of her plans for domination.  The Manchurian Candidate is very fine writing.  Condon's style is eccentric but it is perfect for the bizarre, paranoid tale he is telling.  His portrayal of Raymond as a damned soul is moving.  Raymond, who is cursed with "crushing contemptuousness", is "impossible to like", but we can't help but be sympathetic to this young man who was never allowed to be himself, who was never allowed to feel.   Mrs. Iselin is over-the-top, but who cares?  She sends chills down your spine while providing some wicked humor.  The Manchurian Candidate is a Freudian cocktail that will give you lots to chew on.
