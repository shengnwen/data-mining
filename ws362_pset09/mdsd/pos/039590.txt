  T. Gallagher has written an outstanding book on the films of John Ford from his primitive Westerns of the silent era through his last film "7 Women" in 1965.
  Gallagher includes biographical information on the enigmatic Mr. Ford-tough guy; closet intellectual; painter of superb movie landscapes and all around genius!
 Gallagher's main focus, however, is a close study of all the John Ford movies. His commentary is to be read slowly (a dictionary to look up the abstruse words he likes to use can also prove handy!). Gallagher's writing is often academic (using big words and jargon of film scholars), pedantic and obscure.
However, overall he does a good job at getting at the essence of a film's worth. Gallagher helps you to "read a Ford film" giving you new insights into the neglected genius of the fiery Irishman who made the best American movies of his time.
   If you want a biography of John Ford turn to the excellent biographies by Joseph McBride or Scott Eyman among others. If you
want primarily a scholary study of the movies made by Ford then
Gallagher is for you.
   I enjoyed the book and recommend it to fans of Ford or for anyone wishing to know more about this legendary director of such classics as "Rio Grande"; "Fort Apache" "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" "The Grapes of Wrath"; "Drums Along the Mohawk"; "Young
Mr. Lincoln"; "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence" and countless other classics!  Well recommended
