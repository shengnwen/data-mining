This book by Christopher Golden can be placed on a shelf next to two Neil Gaiman books, American Gods and Anansi Boys.  Although not as good as American Gods, this book does fare well when compared to Anansi Boys.  All three books deal with mythological beings and parallel worlds where the magical beings exist.  In all of the books regular people are drawn into the 'reality' that the old stories did indeed have a basis in fact.  The action in Myth Hunters is excellent, as is the world setting.  What is missing is the taut dialogue that Golden used so well in his Vampire series.

I recommend this book, and will be back to read the sequel
