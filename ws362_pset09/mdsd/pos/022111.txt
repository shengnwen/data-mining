This book is about bespoke handmade shoes for men - but not about any of the major ready-made brands. The book presents a great introduction to the more than 200 steps from measuring your feet to the finished shoe. Chapters include taking size, making lasts, the different shoe styles, the different parts of the shoes and how to care for your custom-made shoes. The book also includes superb features on the world's most famous workshops including Lobb, Berluti and Vogel. The author Laszlo Vass is the owner of the well-known Vass shoe workshop in the center of Budapest, Hungary. If you are a shoe connaisseur or affictionado and also think that &quot;elegance begins with shoes&quot; then this book is the right choice for you
