If you love raptors, then this book is a great way to get you started learning about them.  The drawings and full color paintings are superb.  The information is more than enough for a good introduction, and if you like bird carving, then this is one of the best reference books you can have. I got one for myself, and gave the kids their own. It's not just a coloring book, the activities are designed to get the reader thinking and doing, especially observing nature and not television. Perfect for home schoolers
