I enjoy cookbooks not only for their recipes but for the stories behind them. The Provence Cookbook is that and more, and you will never get tired reading it from cover to cover. Inside you'll find a guide to markets, shops and restaurants as well as personal insights that introduce you to a Provence full of flavor and culinary creation. True cooks will enjoy delightful recipes that are divided into chapters with selections ranging from appetizers to salads, soups to fish, poultry and rabbit. And of course, no meal is complete without wine, so the thoughtful wine suggestions were appreciated and reminded me of wonderful meals when I lived in France!
