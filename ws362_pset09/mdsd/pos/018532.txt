  Although there are a lot of cartoons in this book;its purpose is not only to give a collection of cartoons.
  Mankoff attempts to analyze cartoons and show what it takes to make a cartoon funny.He goes through the process he uses in developing a cartoon.Obviously creative thinking is fundamental in any cartoon.
 An approach of showing a drawing without a caption;and letting others create a caption.This can be a lot of fun and I have often tried it.As a matter of fact,I like to put aside the caption and come up with another.You don't really need a cartoon drawing to do this. Any picture with people in it will sufice.
 He also stresses that the cartoon should be viewed from left to right and the simpler the better.
  I notice that there are mixed reviews on this book.I guess that is little wonder.Mankoff tries to disect a cartoon as one would using the scientific approach.He really proves that it is not possible ;because the human element takes over.No two humans are alike;therefore how different people see a cartoon will likewise vary.
 Nonetheless,this is a good attempt by a professional cartoonist to show what makes a good,average,mediocre or excellent cartoon and after understanding what he talks about;you will be better equipped to enjoy a cartoon
