I went on a Tom Robbins kick after I read Jitterbug Perfume, and I like this book the best of all of them. Sometimes he gets a little to, like, philosophical or something, and I found myself kind of skimming ahead for the interesting stuff, but mostly I thought it was fantastic. It actually made me think about political stuff maybe for the first time. Even though it was written a while ago, it seems perfect for today with all the middle east and Iraq stuff going on.

But mainly I thought the book was funny, weird and great. If someone told me I was gonna like a can of beans and a spoon as the characters in a book, I would've said they were crazy, but there's something amazing about how Robbins' characters talk. Can't wait to read more
