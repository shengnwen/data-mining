Randy really shows many of the idiocies of today's legal system.  He doesn't play favorites, writes clearly and concisely, and, perhaps most importantly, he offers excellent suggestions on how improvements can be made.  My only criticism is that many of his examples are so new that final dispositions are still in progress.  Of course, this also can be used to show the problem with the system is still with us, not a historical relic.  This is definitely a book for anyone interested in improving modern society or who just wants to read about some of the unbelievable things people will sue over
