This is a wonderful collection of philosophical essays relating to Monty Python. It appeals to fans of the Pythons, but also philosophers of every stripe --essays range from analytical 20th century philosophy to Buddhism and all points in between. Well done! 
Some of the other reviews here at Amazon, almost read like Python sketches. Totally nonsequitur!  Let me add my own irrelevant comment: In addition to the terrible treatment of Richard Pryor herein, one wonders why there is almost no mention of Eskimo people in the text. Why do the authors hate the Eskimos? The book is an outrage to all decency! Etc. etc..
