I found this an excellent, well-written overview of the history of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).  Not only are major players and products covered (the Alto, Smalltalk, Alan Kay), but the background and collateral history appears as well (DARPA, Vannevar Bush, J.C. Licklider, The Spacewar article in Rolling Stone).  Much like Steven Levy's book Hackers, reading this book makes you feel like an expert, like you were there.  Moreover, there is so much context and excitement, one feels compelled to find out more about the secondary characters mentioned.  Fortunately, electronic copies of such seminal pieces as the Spacewar article and Bush's "As We May Think" essay are easily found online, making quick diversions into supplemental reading not only of interest, but also possible and highly recommended.  That is the real beauty of this book: it provides enough information about other relevant topics without wandering too far down tangential paths.  I really felt that I learned a lot by reading this book, and my learning wasn't limited to Xerox PARC.  

That said, while there is a strong focus on the early history/founding of PARC, it seems that the more recent history is skimmed over if not omitted.  After the rich background I encountered in the book's early chapters, I felt as if things were moving a bit fast in the later ones.  

Bottom line: If you are interested in the history of computing then this is a must read book.
