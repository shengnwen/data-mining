What a fun book! It adds an extra storyline to the popular Piggy nursery rhyme. Everyone we've given this book to has loved it too. Though the book is pretty durable, when my daughter was younger, she did rip many of the pop-ups. That's okay -- we just bought another one now that she doesn't rip books anymore. :
