My twin foster children have been with us for almost two years.  When I was Christmas shopping my foster son(we plan to adopt both)he spotted this book.  He read two or three pages and insisted that we had to have this book.  I of course was trying to keep from crying in the store after 3 pages.  My son came home with his prize and proceeded to read the whole book outloud to the family.  Both he and his sister got more excited as he read. He had other things to add to what was in the book too.  I basically was a blubberly mess.  Not just a sentimental book though, there are a lot of very deep things in the book.
