The most motivational part of the book is in the forward when Robert Kiyosaki quotes his rich dad, "The richest people in the world learn to buy and sell businesses, not work for them." 

What the book lacks in motivation it makes up for in facts and detail. I would say it's more for someone that has already decided to buy a business and is working through the details than someone looking for the motivation to make that leap from an employee to a business owner. 

There is a great Henry Ford quote, "Never complain, never explain." 

The topics covered are basic in a business 101 type of layout, sort of like a text book, but well worth pushing yourself through for the basic knowledge you'll get. 

Get the foundation with this book then move on to some biographies of business whirlwinds who give you the real drive and push to start doing deals.
