     Ask your favorite Liberal or Socialist the following objective question and you'll quickly find out how totally vile many Liberals, Socialists and Do-Gooders are:

     "If you, as an elected Government bureaucrat could send
a poor, black child to a violent, academically inferior Government public school (K-12) for $15,000 per child per year of taxpayer money,
     OR, send that same poor black child to a nurturing, academically superior Private or Parochial school (K-12) for
$7,500 per child per year of taxpayer money

     To which school would you, Ms. Liberal, send that child?"

     For over 13 years Liberals, Socialists and most Do-Gooders
have bravely answered:  "I, as a good Liberal, would send that
poor black child to the violent, academically inferior Government School!"

     Save a poor black kid for $7,500 per year? or Destroy a poor black kid for $15,000 per year?  And most Do-Gooders and
Liberals choose expensive destruction?

     Have fund asking your Liberal friends the above question
and watch the squirming.
