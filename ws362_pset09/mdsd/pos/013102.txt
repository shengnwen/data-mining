In the first book of their Vulcan's Soul trilogy, "Exodus" (Aug. 2004), Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz extrapolated from what little is known of Vulcan history to depict the Sundering.  In their newest novel, "Vulcan's Soul, Book Two: Exiles", Sherman and Shwartz portray the long and perilous journey that the exiles undertook and the story is nothing short of remarkable.

Just as in "Exodus", the authors employ dual storylines in Exiles: one that illuminates the past and one the present.  Almost two months have passed since Admiral Pavel Chekov was presumed dead in an encounter with the Watraii, the mysterious race who claim that the Romulans seized Romulus and Remus from them. When the head of Starfleet Security Admiral Uhura receives word that Chekov is still alive and is being held by the Watraii, who also have in their possession a rare artifact that could hold the truth about the Watraii claims, Uhura calls upon Spock, Saavik, Scotty, Data and Ruanek for a covert mission to recover Chekov and the artifact.

Meanwhile Karatek, reluctant leader of the exiles and the keeper of memories, provides the account of the long journey undertaken by those who fled Vulcan, some voluntarily, some not.  Along the way many ships and lives are lost and the various factions who boarded the ships become more and more fragmented as time and hardship takes its toil on the survivors.

Although the Sundering of the Vulcans and Romulans has been touched on before in a few of the novels, "Exiles" will set what you previously might have imagined on its ear and leaves you anxious to find out where the story goes from here
