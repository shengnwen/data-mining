Six years ago I was cleaning out my grandmother's house to be sold after she passed away.  I came across letters written around the same time period that this novel was to have taken place. When I read this book, the dialogue was so familiar.  The letters were written phonetically much like the book. Reading them did make it difficult to comprehend and just like the book, at first it slowed the reading process for me but it began to sound like poetry. A previous reviewer said it best  "the dialogue captures the southern drawl and syntax to its truest form."  I had never heard of Hurston before this novel and probably would not have had it not been promoted by Oprah. I did not see the movie so I cannot compare.

Some will not like the dialogue and find it hard to follow and some will not be able to relate to the characters or the life as it was at that time. This should be included in reading list for schools. This is fiction but this represents a time and a people and the reality that should not be lost in history.
