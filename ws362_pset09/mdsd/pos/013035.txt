In the Line of Fire is an honest account of the life and times of General Pervez Musharraf and a brief history of Pakistan and its political and internal problems.  Pervez Musharraf gives his opinion on almost every past ruler of Pakistan except General Ayub Khan.  For some reasons he neglects to mention the contradictions and similarities between his rise to power and the rule.  Both were Commander-In-Chiefs of the armed forces. Ayub Khan took the country over by a pre-planned coup, whereas Pervez Musharraf acquired power by default.  Both Ayub Khan and Pervez Musharraf brought the country out of a failed democratic system into a stable military system and both gave the country stature and respect around the world.  

While the West loves "democracy", it is not a source to cure the ills of the illiterate masses. When the masses go to the polling booths (like in India, the so-called largest democracy in the world) the people are forced by the local gangsters to put a check mark next to the picture of the candidate who paid them the most money to get them elected (as most people cannot read or write, or understand who they are voting for).  In such a situation, what the country needs is an honest dictator who is doing well for the country and the people.  Pervez Musharraf happened to step in by a stroke of fate to save the country from an economic disaster that was augmented by 9/11.

I think that this book is a sincere presentation of the facts and the relations and the dilemmas with the Pakistan's neighboring countries, including the Kashmir problem which India who likes to talk about it but refuses to solve the problem working on the adage "possession is nine-tenths of law", while committing un-bearable atrocities on the Kashmiri people.  To learn more about the situation in Kashmir I would recommend reading the book "Kashmir: Happy Valley, Valley of Death" by Dr. William Baker.
