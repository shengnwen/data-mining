In my teens and early twenties I was a passionate reader of classic science fiction.  In those days I read most of the greats--Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Bradbury, etc.  And, of course, I read Philip K. Dick.  The Man in the High Castle remains one of my favorites.

I had read A Scanner Darkly probably twenty years ago.  I decided to read it again before I watched the movie on DVD.  I'm glad I did.  There's a lot to like about this book.  The plot is clever and it still speaks powerfully to the drug culture and government/corporate intrigue.  Plus, there are some nice science fiction touches.  I'm particularly fond of the scramble suit.

On the other hand, some of the cultural touches (which Dick lifted from his own experience of the drug culture of the seventies) are starting to show their age.  Some of the dialogue, in particular, could be lifted right out of a B-movie from the era.  It's a bit jarring in a book with so many nice futuristic flourishes.

In the end, however, a reader shouldn't let that stand in the way of experiencing this novel.  It may be one of the best looks at drug culture ever put down on paper.  It certainly is one of the best drug culture novels in the science fiction mode of which Dick was a master
