This book although old...has nothing but priceless counsel for the believer who eagerly yearns to experience a daily dying of the sin nature & to see all worldliness washed away. I've owned this book for 15+ yrs..& it's still one of my very favorite Christian books.  I continually go back to it for guidance, spiritual refreshment, encouragement & discipline. De Sales  obviously had a heart burning with desire to please & elevate Christ to the highest possible place in every area of his own life. He also addresses his brethren as "Philothea" throughout the book..speaking to us lovingly..with a pure heart to see each reader transformed. That theme of love is prevalent throughout this book..& although there's some unusual Catholic sayings...thoughts & ideas within the text that are outdated...it in no way takes away from the impact & power of this mans witness. De Sales mercilessly, efficiently & repeatedly tears the common man's most pitiful vices..limb from limb...so as to leave one no choice but to surrender. De Sales gets into every nook & cranny of our being..leaving nothing in the dark...exposing those things we try so hard to hide.  To read this & act upon it..can only mean allowing our Lord to reign supreme over every facet of our lives. Read this book regularly...with an open mind & heart.. let it do the deep & painstaking work it was intended to do...to help believers relinquish all control..& begin living a holy & devout life..to the glory of God
