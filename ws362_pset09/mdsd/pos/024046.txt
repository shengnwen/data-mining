I'VE JUST COMPLETED THE BOOK AND GENERALLY CONCUR WITH THE OTHER POSITIVE REVIEWS. IT IS GOOD TO READ A BOOK BY A GENERALIST WHO IS ACROSS SEVERAL SUBJECTS AND DISCIPLINES AND INCORPORATES THAT INTO HIS/HER WORK - WHICH IS WHAT WINCHESTER DOES SO SUCCESSFULLY HERE.

MY QUIBBLE IS THAT VERY EARLY IN THE BOOK WINCHESTER MAKES A VERY BIG STATEMENT WHICH IS NOT ACTUALLY BACKED UP. ON PAGE 5 HE STATES THAT THE MUCH LARGER VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS (TOBA, TAMBORA, TAUPO, KATMAI)HAD MUCH LESS DIRECT EFFECT ON HUMAN SOCIETY THAN KRAKATOA. HE BASES THIS ON THE OBSERVATIONS THAT BY 1883 HUMANS WERE MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED - THERE WERE TRAINED OBSERVERS, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS (TELEGRAPH IN PARTICULAR) WHICH LINKED THE WORLD. 

OK, ONE CAN ACCEPT THAT THE 1883 ERUPTION WAS HUGE, DEVASTATING ETC BUT TO VIRTUALLY SAY THAT IT OVERWHELMS THE OTHERS IS A TRULY HUGE STATEMENT. 73000 YEARS AGO THERE WAS A VAST EXPLOSION AT TOBA IN SUMATRA THAT MAKES THE 1883 EXPLOSION LOOK MILD. TOBA SEEMS TO HAVE ENDED AN INTER GLACIAL PERIOD AND USHERED IN A LONG VOLCANIC WINTER WHICH CREATED A "BOTTLENECK" EVENT WHERE THE VERY FEW SURVIVORS (AS FEW AS 1000-3000 WORLDWIDE!) GENETIC MATERIAL BECAME PREDOMINANT. THIS WAS AT A TIME WHEN HOMO ERECTUS AND OUR SAPIENS ANCESTORS WERE SPREADING AROUND THE GLOBE.

BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK THAT FAR. IN 1815 THERE A BIGGER EXPLOSION AT TAMBORA WHICH KILLED MORE PEOPLE, CREATED A YEAR WITHOUT WINTER (1816). THIS WAS IN RECORDED HISTORY BUT NO THERE WERE NO TELEGRAPHS.

THE ERUPTIONS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AROUND 500BC AND THE EARLIER KRAKATOA ERUPTIONS (ESPECIALLY THE AD515 EVENT) WERE BIGGER AGAIN. WINCHESTER DOES DEAL WITH THE EARLIER KRAKATOA EVENT BUT IN A RATHER CURSORY AND DISMISSIVE WAY. AND YET THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THE 515AD EVENT KILLED OFF A CIVILSATION IN JAVA. THERE IS NO SUGGESTION THAT THE 1883 ERUPTION DESTROYED ANY CIVILISATION AT ALL. THIS IS A MODERN HISTORICAL BIAS - THE ATTITUDE THAT WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED RECENTLY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT WAS NOT REPORTED EARLIER.  

THIS CRITICISM IN NO WAY DETRACTS FROM THE EXCELLENT STUFF THAT WINCHESTER HAS INCLUDED IN HIS BOOK. HE PAINTS A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF WHAT WAS A CATACLYSM, BUT TO SAY IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT GLOBAL CATASTROPHE IS NOT CORRECT.
