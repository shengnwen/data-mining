I read this book in fifth grade once for a book report.  Once you get into it, you can put it down.

It is about a Navaho girl who's mother gave her a flock of sheep.  Then two Spanish Slavers come and take then away.  When they escape, they take some horses and start to arrive back to their village.  Then the Long Knives come and burn down their land and take them away.

You will have to read the rest of it to find out what happens.
I think this is a great book to read anytime.
