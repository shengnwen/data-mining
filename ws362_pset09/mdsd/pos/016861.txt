I have been interested in reading something by Grisham for quite a while, but I was recently "pushed" to actually read one of his books when I saw the movie version of "A Time to Kill". The obvious book to start with was "A Time to Kill". I had heard that Grisham is good, and I really enjoyed the movie, so I was expecting a lot. I was not disappointed. This book brings out some very interesting ideas about murder and the justification for it. It also gave a very large amount of information about the legal system in general and trials in particular. This legal iformation was probably my favorite part.
Throughout the book, I found myself thinking through how I would try to convince the jury to free Carl Lee. The book was obviously "prejudiced" in that it was written from the aspect of Carl Lee having adequate reason to murder the two rapists, but even so, there is a lot of material having to do with proving that.

Overall, this book isn't perfect, but its problems are relatively minor and do not detract from the book. The entire book flows rather smoothly and it really keeps you intrigued. I highly recommend this book, as well as others by Grisham. I will be reading more of his books soon. Also, I would recommend the book "The Sacrifice" by Robert Whitlow. It is a very intriguing legal thriller that is somewhat similar in style to Grisham's writing. I just finished reading it earlier today and it is great. Read and enjoy
