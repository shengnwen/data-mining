As the other reviewers write, this is a great literary companion, especially to Ulysses. Nabokov writes wonderfully.  I can imagine that most people would read this book as they read Mansfield Park, Madame Bovary, Bleak House, etc and would flip back and forth. However, my paperback copy was very poorly bound and fell apart. So my advice is get the hardcover edition
