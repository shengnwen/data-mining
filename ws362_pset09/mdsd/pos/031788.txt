I love Nora Roberts, and I think she went above and well beyond with this book.  This trilogy (as well as the "Born in" trilogy) make me want to move to Ireland.  

I fell madly in love with Shawn Gallagher in this book.  And though I am a supreme girly-girl I love Brenna and her take charge attitude.  

I absolutely love these books and have recommended them to everyone.  I have friends who are not romance fans who have loved these books.  

Run, run, run to the store (and or library) and get these books
