This book is one of the most comprehensive books on intestinal yeast and its trauma I have seen to date.  Just by taking some of the recommendations: acidophilus, a multi-vitamin, and severely reducing the  sugar, yeast and pasta in my diet has made an incredible difference in my  symptoms and the way I feel in the past month. I recommend this to anyone  with intestinal yeast because the improvement, though not 100% is very  drastic!  I am feeling better every day
