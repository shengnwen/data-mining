This is THE best coaching book for beginner to intermediate coaches I have  EVER read.  I think so highly of this book that I feel all coaches should  be handed a copy as soon as they sign up for a coaching job.  This is the  book that basically made me the coach I am today.      When I first began  coaching high school hockey, I sought coaching education in all the books I  could find.  But for a beginning coach, many of these books fell short with  the simple fact that new coaches need to learn from the bottom up.       This book not only remembers to teach you all aspects of coaching you will  need to get started in coaching but hits on a lot of the aspects that you  may not even have considered.  This is the first book I read that hits upon  the idea that coaching is more that X's and O's.      Many coaching books  fail to realize that organization is the key to successful coaching.   Practice and season planning are covered in a way that a new coach can  begin planning their season immediately.        Physical conditioning  planning and teaching plans are covered in a way that no matter what the  sport is that you are coaching, you can apply the lessons taught.  From how  to make up your season outline to how to set and reach your team objectives  are covered to the point where you can gain the confidence you need to  succeed.      But also covered are things such as how to avoid legal  problems, how to deal with parents and how and when to run meetings with  both parents and players.  These are the very details that most hockey or  coaching books seem to leave out.  And these are the very things that all  new coaches need to get information on BEFORE they begin.  And after  coaching for four years on the high school level, I have needed ALL of the  information I gained from this book.      I can not recommend this book  enough.  EVERY COACH IN EVERY SPORT SHOULD OWN IT
