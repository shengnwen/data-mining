Have you ever seen Green Pastures, or Hallelujiah, or any of the other Studio made films of the Golden Age that feature all black casts?

I have.

Have you ever seen any of the Independent Films with all black casts made during the same period, but only seen in theatres catering to black audiences?

I have, sadly, not.

This book opened my eyes.

Forget the familiar actors of the 80's to the present day, even the great ones, this book will open your eyes to the rich heritage of black actors, and film, between 1955 and 1975, but more importantly it will reveal to you the complicated, yet glorious, world of these films, and actors, in the Golden Age of film.

If you belong to Netflix, or some other similar service then search out the films, and actors mentioned here if they are available and rent their films.

You will not be disappointed
