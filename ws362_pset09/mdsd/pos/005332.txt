One of the things I learned was about personal commitment to one's self.  By regards of others I may not have a huge amount of weight to lose but I've benn procrstinating about it and worried that this will become a lifestyle choice.  Sure I look fine now but I'm still pretty young and this has to be a lifelong commitment.  I got moving with Oprah and Bob in the 90's and did a massive turnaround but then I got into the work swing and got complacent, not to mention being so close to Delmonicos!  I love food, to eat it and to cook it but the simple mathematics is that I have to exercise more calories than I consume.  Simple as that.  And something really BIG, you're suppose to feel slightly hungry.  I think thats a great point, most peopel believe you're suppose to constantly be full
