Chapter Eight of this book is worth the price of the book.  The chapter is a simplified version of some of O'Shaughnessy's best strategies from his prior book, What Works on Wall Street.  The book is a good introduction to the practice of investing.  It lays out a strong case for using a disciplined process in choosing investments (rather than hunches).  One's disciplined process should be backed up by historical data (not based on what's worked best in the most recent years or even decade).  The six stock selection strategies featured in chapter 8, including the Dogs of the Dow, greatly peaked my interest.  The only suggestion I have now is: James, get in touch with PowerShares to market ETF's for each of your featured stragies.  I, for one, would buy them.  Or create a mutual fund in which you implement your Custom Allocation (from page 212) on our behalf.  This fund would weave together all six of your featured stategies.  You convinced me that this is a powerful way to invest.  Great book
