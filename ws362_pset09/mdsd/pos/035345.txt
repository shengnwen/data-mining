This book is worth perusing, if only for the very large number of vivid examples of branding success and failure.  

Some of the underlying principles are open to critique, most notably the authors assertion that perception determines buyers decisions rather than product traits.  Many would say that `perception' is, of course, determined to a large extent by the customer's relationship to the product's traits.  However, Haig is on track in so many other areas, and the case examples are so valuable, that the book is worth a look anyhow.  

Branding can be such a confusing, abstracted issue, that the concrete examples here can provide a much needed reality-check.
