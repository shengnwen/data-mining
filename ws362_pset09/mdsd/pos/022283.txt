I have read that book twice, a "should read book" for people who likes physics.  But historical citation lacks for Chinese and Arabic contributions.  Algebra is very important for the science, but not even mentioned in this book.  To make this book complete, I guess, there should be at least few pages about developments in math and medicine by spain/endulis government.

Around 1200 BC in Egypt, people was using math to measure the length of walls, trees (and so on) by artimetics.  And they had used the shadow of the sun to measure the radius of earth, and they used that in 2piR to see what happens by few percent error!  That means they knew the world was round.  Almost 2000 years before somepeople at north of them!  But such things were ignored in this book.

Also, chinese additions are almost ignored too.

General belief of those era of 3000 years are gathered and made belong to Greeks.  Ignoring other races like Egyptians and Hittities.

Maybe it would be better not to be "so" exact on things happened 3000 years ago.

Its name is God particle but God was also ignored :)  You will not find any philosophy on the topic, but plain explaination for high school children.

But, this book is still an "a must to read" for high school students and especially for politicans.
