If you're a fan of &quot;Black Sheep Squadron&quot;, a WWII: Pacific Theatre buff, or just like interesting stories, read this book. Lt. Col. Gregory &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington, a multiple Marine Ace and Congressional Medal of Honor Winner, wrote this book about his experiences just prior to, during and just after WWII. His adventures and misadventures make a good read. Some of what he describes may have been embelished, but I defy anyone to tell me which parts are true and which parts aren't. His descriptions of aerial combat, being shotdown and captured, as well as his time as a POW are riveting
