LOVED it. I've seen his books all over- bookstores, libraries, friends' houses, and yet I always resisted reading him. Why? I'm not sure. I didn't care for the cover (), and I usually REALLY hate stories about animals. A few years back, I read of a homeschooling family reading his work out loud, and when I came upon this book at a yard sale, I stuffed it in my sack to buy- I had an idea of my son and me reading it outloud in the distant future. I picked it up the other night because I was bored, needed something to read, and felt that I 'should' read this. After about two or three chapters, I was hooked. His stories are simple but charming, detailing the daily life of a country veterinarian. He was able to make me visualize riding along as his passenger as he drove from farm to farm, treating cows, pigs, sheep and domesticated pets. So many of his stories have funny endings. I really truly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the first one, "All Things Bright And Beautiful.
