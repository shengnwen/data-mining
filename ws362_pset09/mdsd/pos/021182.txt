Only one regret...that this wasn't made into a complete book!

The story was typical Bentley Little [although he didn't think so], fast paced, full of suspense, and a twisted ending...I gulped it down like a cold glass of water on a hot day....fast and smoothly, wanting more. I was extremely sad to have it end so quickly, but then again that's what "Shorts" means huh..lol...still I would gladly have bought this in a "long" book format.

Great, great story line!

Loved it!!!!!
