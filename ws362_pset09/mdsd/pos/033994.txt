This book may not be quite as thought-provoking as the first book in this miniseries, (&quot;Ancient Blood&quot; by Diane Carey) but it is definitely better written and more entertaining than the vast majority of Star Trek books, and worth the read for anyone not inimically opposed to reading a Star Trek book. The characterizations of the regulars seem well-handled, and if none of the minor characters really shone, they at least had an opportunity to make more than a walk-on appearance. Meanwhile, the antagonists were fairly standard, but they weren't really the point of the story, and if the concept behind the new alien species wasn't all that new, that wasn't much of a detriment to the story. It WOULD have been nice if the concept of &quot;honor&quot; was a bit more central to the story, rather than mostly being a series of plot devices that the characters had to work with and/or around. But overall, this book is very good, falling just short of the five-star mark
