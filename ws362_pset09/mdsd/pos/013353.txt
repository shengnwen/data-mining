I knew nothing about the battles of the Pacific theater of World War II, so when I purchased this book I expected to learn a lot about the Battle of Iwo Jima and the men who raised the flag in the famous photograph.  My expectations were completely fulfilled.  The story of the Marines on Iwo Jima is horrendous and inspiring at the same time, and now I understand fully why Truman had to drop atomic bombs on Japan.  Anyone who believes that atomic bombs were unnecessary needs to read this book.  Everyone else, read it for knowledge of an important part of our past.
