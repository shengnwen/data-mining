Originally, I became interested in this book by reading an excerpt printed in Wired magazine.  Wired only printed the glossary of the book but that was enough to pique my interest.  In general, I think that is how the book  should be approached.  It is thought-provoking and interesting but should  not be taken too seriously.  It is certainly enjoyable, especially if you  enjoy Wired
