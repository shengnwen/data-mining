This was a great novel.  I read it in a unit that included Tim O'Brien's _Going Ater Cacciato_, and that combination was fantastic.  I think of the title of this book as kind of a question, and the entire novel defines exactly what the sorrow of war is.  Loss, of friendship, of love, of virginity, of innocence, of years of one's life.  Although written from a foreign perspective, this can be understood no matter what the culture.  War has a terrible effect on everyone, not only the men and women who fight, but also those who are left behind at home
