I'm shocked to see the mediocre reviews of this Lee Child/Jack Reacher novel and fascinated to read the reading history of various reviewers. I want to comment on mine and other readers reactions to this series--and offer a theory--rather than really review the book.  Often, perhaps, most of the time, the first  book you read in a good to great series becomes the readers standard.  Echoe Burning was this for me.  My first by Child-- and out of nowhere never heard of the auther or character retrieved from a discard pile by accident--I began it and  was  enthralled, captivated, enthused.  Now I've  read many others, some almost as good the current but I  recall it as  brilliant  and groundbreaking.  Travis McGee meets Lucas Davenport with alot of coffee. Subsequent books in the series almost but don't really measure  up.  And KILLING FLOOR, my current read isn't on the same level at all. So these reviews are fascinating.  Alot of fives.  Many 1's and two's perhaps depending on where it has been read in the reader's sequence.  Try this theory, for example, with Tom Robbins.  I read Even Cowgirls Get the Blues  first and consider it the standard and masterpiece.  Those who started with Another Roadside Attraction seem to feel the same about that.  Theory is fun but in sum, this was a great and worthwhile book.
