When my wife relapsed into depression, I knew what it was because of our previous experience.  But I was surprised at how unprepared I was to respond to her.  I found myself sinking into my own depression.  

When I went to a psychologist to get advice on how to draw her out and get her to a doctor, I found little help.  All his "exercises" for dealing with depression were aimed at working WITH the depressed person, AFTER they recognize their need for help.  But he offered little help in the process of convincing the depressed spouse that they have a problem and need to see a doctor in the first place.

This book was a breath of fresh air.  It helped me understand what is going on inside my wife's head, and why she reacts to me the way she does.  It also helped me to understand how I can gently nudge her in the direction of getting help.

My biggest disappointment with this book is its cavalier attitude towards marriage.  Marriage is treated as nothing more than a live-in relationship with some extra legal paperwork involved.  The decision to "leave" or "stay" with your depressed spouse is treated as an abstract decision.  If you are committed to your marriage, you should skip the chapters that deal with "mending or breaking" the bond.
