Millicent Altford of Los Angeles is a Democratic Party insider of long standing.  A $1.2 million slush fund has been stolen from right under her nose and she is determined to get it back.  To assist her in this task, she hires an ex-Army major by the name of Edd "Twodees" Partain.
Meanwhile back in Washington, D.C., two active Army officers, a colonel and a general, plot to have Mr. Partain rubbed out.  You see, he has information linking them to some very serious crimes committed in El Salvador some 3 or 4 years earlier.
Ah, Treachery! has a lot in common with many other Ross Thomas novels.  Deliciously bizarre characters, intricate plotting with an abundance of surprising twists and very engaging dialogue are all here, just as we've come to expect from Thomas.
Darkly funny with a body count that steadily increases as the narrative unfolds, Ah, Treachery! is a very entertaining book.  The dialogue is exceptionally good and there's plenty of it.  I particularly enjoyed a scene where Millicent Altford tells the political facts of life to a newly elected Congressman and a wet behind the ears subcommittee counsel.
This is the last novel Thomas wrote and it is a very fitting finale to an illustrious and prolific writing career. Age did not diminish his literary prowess one bit.
