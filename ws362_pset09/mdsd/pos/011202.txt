I think that this book is a very real and interesting novel. I learned more about myself than anyother book could have evey shown me. But the real reason why I'm writing this review is because of the reason why I bought  it.I was looking in Barns and Noble book store in pittsfield massachusetts  and found this book on a shelf and to my suprise I was on the front  cover.How strange right! Well my name is Daniel Tucker and go to M.C.L.A,  which is a state school in North Adams MA. Also if it is possiable I would  like to know when my picture was taken and why its on this great book. It  would be great if you could e-mail me
