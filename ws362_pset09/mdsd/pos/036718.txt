This is something a new mom can read in niblets, here or there, in those precious moments of solace.... you get the idea. I bought the book because when I opened it randomly to read a page, it said *exactly* what I was feeling that moment standing there, in the bookstore, with my colicky newborn pitching a fit.

Sometimes the book is a little over-the-top with spirituality, but this is an honest, frank, meaningful, and refreshing look at those first few months with a new baby. My son is now 3 months old (and over the colic), and this book had me laughing hysterically at parts, sad in others, and in the end, I felt like motherhood itself had been affirmed. 

I read a review here that said something to the effect of "it's just too painful" for first-time mothers... I'm kinda shocked at this because this was just what I needed as a new mother, something I could relate to
