This is one of the most enlightening modern day commentaries I've ever read. Throughout the book I kept saying things like: "So that's why this is this way!" and "I recognized that before, but couldn't explain it as well and with so much good documentation!" If you would like to know (at least in considerable part) why we are experiencing a moral and cultural decline in this country, and why today's young people have no sense of right or wrong, READ THIS BOOK
