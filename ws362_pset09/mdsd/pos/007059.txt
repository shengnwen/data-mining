A true thriller - lots of medical gore, and Kay finds plenty of layers of deception among her associates as she solves yet another perverse crime.  She is a self-assured woman, often living in a men's world, asserting herself with uncooperative officials as need be as she goes about her medical detecting, while the rest of us cheer from the reading stands. This book is as engrossing and involving as any other book I've read by her, with a lot of psychological touches about what makes both good and bad people keep secrets.
