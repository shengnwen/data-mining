This is the 8 CD Package Family CD Pack.  I don't know why they added the word "abridged" to the title but it includes everything that was on the cassette tape set.

Here's the contents -
CD 1 - for parents, with guidelines on what to expect and what to say.
CDs 2-7 - for young people ages 9 to 14, covering important topics.
CD 8 - for parents to listen to first, with answers to the questions young people ask.

This is a *great* series created by a man who is a medical doctor, a family councelor, a father and a Biblically based Christian.

This series covers *everything* to help your child (and yourself) survive the approaching adolescent storms.
