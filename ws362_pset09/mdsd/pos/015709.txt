Beverly Donofrio's love letter to the Blessed Mother of Jesus Christ is sometimes rambling and disjointed, but always interesting and often very moving.  Mary's gentle pull upon her human children is vividly depicted through Donofrio's personal experiences and spiritual growth.  Like any good mother, Mary uses our broken nature and countless faults to advance into our hearts and souls.  In witnessing Donofrio's transformation unfolding through the pages of this book, I can only agree with her that Our Lord is very wise to put such a strong and persuasive presence as His Mother Mary on the front lines of the battle for souls.
