I had no idea of the style or subject of 'Lucky' until I started reading it: I'd bought it purely on the strength of Sebold's earlier novel, 'The Lovely Bones'. 
That being said, I found myself captivated by this remarkable account of Sebold's teen years and, of course, her rape - the cataclysmic event that has so shaped her present and, it seems, will continue to affect her future. (As I was reading, I was getting my daughter ready for her first year at college and this book has gone with her.)
Sebold deserves copious praise for her courage and clear-headedness, not just in having dealt with the rape all those years ago, and its effects on all who were and are still close to her, but also in dredging it all up again to present this ordered, sensible, well-written account. 
Particularly admirable is the no-holds-barred way she presents herself. It would have been so easy to slip into 'poor little me' mode, but she has avoided that self-pitying tone so successfully that at times I almost disliked her, feeling so very, very sorry for her all the while.
It's not a comfortable read by any means. But it is a strong one, and worthwhile, for Sebold's well-delivered perspective on the psyche of rapist, victim and what may well be a lifetime of shattered relationships.
