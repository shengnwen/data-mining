This book was very well researched and written. Even if you have very little knowledge of Afghanistan, you can understand and easily read this book. It is full of interesting history, along with it's excellent explanation of the military information that is the center if it's purpose.
Not being a military history buff, I was pleased to see that some of this country's history, it's native peoples, and some their customs were also covered.
It is good reading.
You must be interested in Afghanistan and it's history to read this book, and if you are this book is a winner for you.
The only drawback is that you can get lost in all of the names, battles and locations happening at once, especially during the Alexander period. If you have the patience to reread some passages over again, you'll be fine.
Lots of good information.
