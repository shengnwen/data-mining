This is my second Trollope, chosen after reading and enjoying The Warden earlier this year. With The Warden, I was surprised how modern it was and by how much I enjoyed the novel. (I had avoided reading Trollope forever, thinking it was just too dusty and Victorian) I am so glad that I picked up The Way We Live Now as my second outing with the author.

The long format (800 pages) gives Trollope time to show his amazing skill with characters. I can only add my voice to the chorus of people justly praising his skill with female characters-- particularly when compared to other writers of the time. Marie Melmotte is generally singled out for praise. I have to confess that I was quite fond of Winifrid Hurtle. This woman has been more sinned against than sinning. She is complex and dignified, and may be the best character in the book.  

In fact, although the novel is ostensibly about Augustus Melmotte, I would be willing to argue that an even larger part of the book is about women finding happiness in less than typical ways. Whether it is Georgiana Longstaffe or Mrs. Carbury, the woman in The Way We Live Now are making the best choices that they have available, given limited circumstances. I thought that in this sense it was still topical, and very brave.

I would recommend The Way We Live Now very highly. It does have a lot of pages, and requires some patience. But, it doesn't require as much patience as one may expect. I promise you, that once you get into it, it is not an effort at all to read. The Gilded Age by Mark Twain could make an interesting counterpoint to this book, dealing as it does with such similar material but from a very different perspective
