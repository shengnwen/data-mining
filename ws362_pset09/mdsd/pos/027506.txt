It's great to see Mencken's translation back in print. All considerations about "The Anti-Christ" aside, this translation is a relic of sorts seeing as how it was the first american translation. Though perhaps not the best (i.e., most scholarly) translation, the only great flaw I see in it, taking the book for what it is - a translation by an aficionado-, is the publisher's handling of it.

Mr. Bufe encumbered himself with dumbing down Mencken's introduction and parts of the translation. As he himslef admits in the publisher's note, he translates all french words to english. And for what reason? Apparently they made the text incomprehensible. Poor Mr. Bufe seems to underestimate the readers: it's quite obvious that anyone that has the brains to read this book can easily overcome the language barrier posed by a few words (not to mention the fact that they might know how to speak another language). 
"I translated them because they were impediments to comprehension, and because there is no real point to having untranslated French terms in an English text; its only purpose is to make those who can read French feel like members of an elite club." This seems like a rather biased statement. If Mencken and Nietzsche used French words (or any other non-English words), it wasn't to be snobish; it was their style, just like so many other authors. For someone who says he admires Mencken's work (inspite of his "clear signs of anti-semitism"), it's a rather blatant sign of disrespect of the translators work to edit his style in such a way. Were he around, I'm sure that H.L. Mencken would not stand for such a thing.

So again, it's not that he makes the text any less inteligible with the edits, but rather that he takes away from the richness of it, diminishing somewhat the experience of reading such a work
