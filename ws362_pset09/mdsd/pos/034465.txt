If I'd been writing this book, I wouldn't have started with the teaser scene Thayer chose (and it was extremely confusing that the date at the top of the first chapter was an error--it should have read September 2000 rather than August 2000--who did the line edit, anyway?).  After reading that first scene, I didn't want to go back a month and read what led up to it.  I suspect that's why some readers found the beginning slow going.  If Thayer had just started the story earlier and told it chronologically, it would have been a more satisfying read.  Frankly, I didn't want to know what she revealed in that first scene.  I'd have preferred to find out who the man in the custody case was on my own.  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Thayer's strength is characterization, and these characters were three-dimensional and compelling.  Ann was particularly fascinating, and Tessa was wonderful.  I was a bit disappointed with the end of the book, though.  Thayer wrapped things up a little too quickly, I felt.  We never did get to see Ann's turnaround.  I just couldn't buy into the idea that a woman so driven and obsessed would so quickly acquiesce to the changes wrought by the judge's decision.  I also wanted to see more of how Tessa felt afterwards.  Still, I would recommend this book and anything else Thayer writes
