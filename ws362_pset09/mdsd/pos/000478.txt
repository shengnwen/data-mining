The book gives us an understanding of the way in which our minds absorb and store knowledge of the type we cannot easily describe in words. The example of the way in which we recognize a face of someone we have met, without our being readily able to describe the features that allow us to recognize the person's face, is a good starting point. From this Mr. Polanyi deepens the discussion into a generalized idea of knowledge, some of which we are quite unaware of. 

The book is somewhat heavy going but otherwise very readable.
