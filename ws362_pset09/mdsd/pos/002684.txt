This book is great for anyone who is interested in Irish Culture, not just those who are planning a wedding. They say you can tell the most about a culture from the way they celebrate, and the extensive research Ms Haggerty has done has given us a great view of the Irish. Having lived there for several years I recognized quite a few of the wonderful sayings and traditions, but they're sadly falling out of use now in modern Ireland. I would think this book would be just as useful to Irish brides who want to recapture their heritage. And if you ever get a chance to go to an Irish wedding, don't miss it- but get plenty of rest beforehand
