I enjoyed this book.  It is well-written, literate in its allusions, sometimes amusing and always modest.  Yet it disappoints because ultimately it is no more nourishing or exciting than "comfort food" for those of us who are mired in middle age and welcome any reassurance that on issues of money, sex, health, and personal loss we are little different from others in our feelings of insecurity and diminished expectations.  There is little drama or development in this book.  It also would have been improved had the author been willing to delve deeper, to be less coy and a little more concrete.  Thus, by way of small example, Atlas might have informed the reader that he went to college at Harvard and not forced the reader to deduce it from his many references to Cambridge and the 25th Reunion Report.  This might have begun to explain some of his initial delusions of grandeur and his subsequent disappointments
