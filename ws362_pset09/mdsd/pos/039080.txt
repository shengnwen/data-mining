I was surprised by how I got hooked into this, because I don't like this whole milieu.  But the author has kind of ironic tone, always bordering on the satirical.  I agree with some of the reviews that he lost it at the  end.  It seemed to me like someone required that the book end with a  &quot;bang,&quot; and therefore it lost its sense of humor.  But I still  thought this author was talented.  There were flourishes of good writing  and a very good sense of characters living on the constant verge of  humiliation.  I look forward to another book
