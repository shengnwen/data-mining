Not only is this an excellent introduction to Psychology, as these other reviews will attest, but the people behind it are a far better bunch to support than the major textbook publishing companies.  The authors, for instance, donate all royalties to charitable organizations.  I am not (officially) a shill for them, but it is hard to find something like that in the textbook world.  If you teach and are looking for a book, that's an added reason to choose this one
