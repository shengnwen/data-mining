I can easily see why Look Homeward, Angel is an American classic.  

The story is rambling and diverse, with a host of characters who are strong-willed and self-assured yet deeply flawed.  This strongly reflects the character of the American people, as well as the nation itself.

But the strength of Look Homeward Angel is in the prose.  Wolfe's writing brings to light those passing moments in time that stay with us forever but which we don't recognize at the time as significant - the glory of the air in an early spring morning, the sensual stimuli that are all around us walking down a dark street late at night, and many other unforgetable scenes.  His writing has the power and vitality of Faulkner, without the sometimes impossible sentences that cause one to lose track.  It is challenging and rich.  Look Homeward, Angel is a masterpiece of place, time, and style.
