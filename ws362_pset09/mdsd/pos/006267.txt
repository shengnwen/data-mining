I loved going through this book. There are tons of great ideas, a lot I had never thought of. There were some that seem like common sense in a loving relationship. What I didn't like was there was a LOT of repetition of ideas and a lot of ideas for millionaires. Sorry, but a unlimited shopping spree on Rodeo Drive or hopping a Concorde to Paris are just not in my budget. But, there were some cool phrases you could say in different languages and lots of romantic movie and song ideas. I definately recommend getting this book.
