This series featuring CIA counterterrorism operative Mitch Rapp gets better and better. Not only must Rapp find and neutralize two nuclear bombs smuggled into the U.S. and destined for New York City and Washington,D.C., but he must also fend off the efforts of liberals in the government who want him to follow all the rules and regulations as he pursues the enemy. Never mind that the terrorists are planning to kill millions of innocent citizens. Let us make sure to preserve their every right. Of course, Mitch Rapp does what has to be done to bring things to a safe conclusion. Hooray for a modern day Hero
