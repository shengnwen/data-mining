Ok, so the book starts out a little slow, but I must say that is because the book is written from the first person stand point, the only starwars book I know of to be written from that perspective. This story follows Corran Horn from Stockpole's Xwing series on his journey to become a jedi knight. Corran's wife Mirax is missing and in order to find her he must come to terms with his heritage. So he changes his name to Keiran Halycon and joins Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy as one of his first students. The story goes right along with the jedi academy trilogy and then precedes after Exar Kun's defeat to Corran leaving the academy for his own reasons ( he doesnt like how luke runs the academy, it doesnt work for him) to continue his search for his wife. But in order to save her he must make a choice join the dark side or lose her forever. You will have to read the book to find out what happens there. But if you know anything at all about star wars you know everything usually works out in the end
