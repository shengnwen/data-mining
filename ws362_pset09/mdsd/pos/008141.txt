As many other reviews have already indicated the plot is a predictable one used many times over. In that you have an heir that no one knows about, he shows up already successful in his own right.  There is a murder and he is the number one suspect.  What muddles the story is the incompetence and arrogance displayed by some of the characters, mainly the states attorney that wants to prosecute simply b/c the deceased was part of his circle and the heir was an unknown. Nonetheless, it is still a well written story.

However, take that out of the equation and I think you have a much better story. The romance between the main characters, Kate a self made restaurateur and the heir Mitchell is very powerful.  They meet on vacation and the attraction is immediate, however because of pride, misunderstandings and miscommunication they are separated. This is the story of two very strong willed proud people who let their pride get in the way of their love for one another.
