I am yes one of those fans of Da Vinci Code who was just dying to read something else by Dan Brown. First, naturally I turned to Angels and Demons which was very impressive and encouraged me to find another one of his novels. I worried how well his stories would be without Robert Langdon in them from A and D and Da Vinci- but this novel surprised me. 

It actually is quite strong like the other two, and keeps you as always guessing and searching for the answers; keeping you pretty much at the edge of your seat. I myself actually thought another character was behind the deceit done in this novel (I won't give anything away) but I was plain wrong- that is the mark of a good mystery. The ending for me was not obvious and the plot was carried out in an thrilling way. The characters as well were quite strong and memorable and I definitely found myself caring about certain people in this novel and how they would end up. 

The only thing is that this is not his most exciting story he has written to me. Da Vinci's and Angels and Demons' plots were more exciting- but some may love this plot a lot more than Da Vinci- it's different for everyone. Deception Point was nonetheless interesting and, as said, always kept me guessing and thus not being able to put the book down. 

All in all Deception Point is a very well- written, entertaining read. Dan Brown did it again. 

4.5/
