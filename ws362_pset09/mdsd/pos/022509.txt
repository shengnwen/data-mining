This book was an excellent read.  I enjoyed the historical parallel to events that all black people are aware of and their impact on the lives of folks in Oakland, CA.  The book also had many pictures of the older motorcycles.  I felt that the book either was sanitized for publication, or our idea of motorcycle gangs (black or white) was a little flawed.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about the three "B"'s (Blacks, bikes,and brotherhood)..
