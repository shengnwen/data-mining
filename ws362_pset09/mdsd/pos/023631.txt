This book offers a serious, well-informed, insider view of the hotels currently at the avant-garde of interior designing. Many of the properties illustrated represent "la creme de la creme" of the hotel industry in the past decade; and least to say are well worth staying at. 

I would particularly recommend this fascinating book to the experienced traveler who takes pride in indulging him or herself in an ambience of exclusiveness and inspiration. A must have
