The outside of this book may seem like it points to light-weight and light-hearted content but you're only half right! Every page, every chapter is full of excellent tips, ideas and step by step instructions on how to become a successful CLNC.  The environment surrounding this very important and helpful account of "how-to" is whimsical, fun, and revolves around the theme of magic, ferries and all things "abracadabra".  It IS light-hearted but it's certainly NOT light-weight. I highly recommend this book to all aspiring Certified Legal Nurse Consultants!
