&quot;Fishing for Amber&quot; is one of those enchanting books one  secretly hopes to acquire every time one purchases a book. It is a  treasure-box filled with wonders, each more delightful than the last. Part  James Burke's Connections, part Umberto Eco, part Chet Raymo and all  delightful, the book is a melding of poetry, fact, and all the stops  between. The text meanders through ancient mythologies of the Greek Gods  and their progeny, ghastly Irish yarns of bizarre encounters with the Fae,  baroque histories from when the Netherlands were the cultural and  intellectual center of Europe, and reflections on the author's own father,  an Irish storyteller himself. Magical and haunting, it is a wild ride on  horseback at midnight not to be missed
