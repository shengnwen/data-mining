Nice adventure.  Reminds me of sitting on  a deck listening to a good storyteller-real stories.  True to life. Honest.  I felt the small town as many seperate tales as opposed to a story about a small town.
might be to real for some- but it portrays a stark reality for those of us who aren't exposed to the many ways life does happen.  Enlightening and endearing
