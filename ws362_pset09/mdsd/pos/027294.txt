Pepper is intelligent and fully dimensional, a man still on the search for who he is.  There are wonderful relationships between him and his family and friends, and well as some good humor.  I even learned something about fractal geometry and philosophy along with way without it miring the plot.  There's not a lot of suspense, but it's the characters that drive the story and the killer is a complete surprise.  I also enjoyed the inclusion of small towns and cities settings; Nederland and Boulder, Colorado; Lincoln, Nebraska and Walla Walla, Washington.  I really enjoyed this book and will be interested to see where the series goes from here
