This book should be a mandatory read for every parent & parent to be.  What an eye opener!!!  This book gives you things to look for in predators...how they operate.  There are comments from real predators as well as victims.  The book can be difficult to read at times.  People are truly sick!  But it gives parents power in what to look for & how talk to your child(ren).  MUST READ!
