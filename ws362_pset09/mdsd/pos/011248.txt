Jim Haskins' book is a great introduction to the study and potential practice of voodoo/hoodoo, which should be the essential building block of any library on the subject.

The book is divided into two parts:  the first section deals with the original West African belief systems as practiced at the time of the slave trade (and more or less until today in some areas), the transition to the Americas, and how interaction with whites and other immigrant peoples affected these religions.  The roles of the priests of the old religions, the magic workers/conjurers and herbalists are all examined.  Haskins has a good grasp of the various contexts in which the white and black religions interacted, between Catholic and Protestant, French vs English or Portuguese, large vs small plantation environments, etc.  This is the stronger of the two sections.

The second part is likely the reason most people buy this book, i.e. the actual spells with ingredients and instructions to follow to bring money, justice, luck, or love into (or out of) your life.  A chapter each is devoted to bringing ill to others, good to yourself and others, the courts & law, and finally love.  Some of these can be done by the reader/individual, others would require an intermediary to 'successfully' complete.  Reading the spells, taking up over half the book, is interesting and amusing, and brought to mind nothing to much as Phil Hine's books on (Western and G.D.-based) Chaos Magic, the point being that if you believe it, put enough energy and intensity into it, ANYTHING can be a tool for magic and caused change.  My guess is that if you need this kind of instruction manual in the first place, you have no business attempting this kind of work.  But no doubt every reader will make up his/her own mind.

The book reads well, and is an excellent primer.  Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in the origins and practice of voodoo
