I have to say that there isn't two people in the world like Dennis Rodman! You have to read his book to understand who he is. This book isn't the best biography out there but it's Dennis Rodman... he tell you what he knows about him self not all cause he has still have many questions unsolved about him self and his sexuality for example! what i liked in this book is that, no matter what some revieuwers told here, this (...)always kepped real, ok, he got a big ego, that's the case with all the famous people, and i have to say everything he predicted in his book has happened Chicago bulls became the biggest team of nba history (72 victory), David robinson never win a championship alone(Tim Duncan was the man in the Spurs victory),Madonna is a mamma now(isn't trash nomore) and he is in the truth we he say how much David stern and the nba hate on some players, he talked about him, but there is Allen Iverson case. what i regret with this book  is that sometime he doesnt say much,..., like about the women and him , the sex,..., that' s still a good book for all the people who really want to understand Dennis Rodman
