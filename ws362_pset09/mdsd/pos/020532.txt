This book serves as a primer on the history of the Middle East.  It provides valuable information as to the origins of several disputes, the attitutes of the world's powers and superpowers throughout history, and the so-called &quot;Post-Ottoman Syndrome&quot;.  Moreover, Mr. Shlaim provides accurate accounts of the attitudes of several US Administrations vis--vis the Middle East, with a special emphasis on George H. W. Bush's administration, and the Gulf War.  Shlaim, accurately in my view, discusses the pros and cons of that war.  Though Shlaim is, in my judgment, excessively anti-Israel, his book is relatively impartial on all the issues concerning the Middle East.  The best thing about this book is that in reading it, you learn so much in only 146 pages.  It is concise and easy to understand.  Overall, a good book for anyone curious about the Middle East's history and conflicts
