A wonderfully entertaining book that chronicles the history of one of New  York City's most colorful residences.  The early chapters are particularly  enjoyable, with tongue-in-cheek descriptions of the (often ludicrous)  rituals of high society during the Gilded Age.  The last quarter of the  book is not as interesting, with sometimes overlong discussion of the  building's modern-day residents.  As a whole, however, &quot;Life at the  Dakota&quot; is a vibrant and ingratiating portrait: not just for history  buffs and not just for New Yorkers
