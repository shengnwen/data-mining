There are no greater storehouses of modern art in the world than MOMA in New York, a treasure house of many of the greatest works of the century. Any place you can find Dali, Magritte, Pollock, Picasso and Warhol rubbing  shoulders is fine by me so this book is a real delight. For those of you  who love the work of the 20th century, this is a must. For those of you who  don't get it, get a life and get this book
