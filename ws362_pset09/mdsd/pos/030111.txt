This one seemed to be less surface with Dirk, more about what drives him, less of Dirk keeping all the secrets til the end of the book where he shows the villain how he knew all along (which I didn't really mind--I love Pitt's notorious witt and ego).  He had more depth in this book, maybe because it involved a woman throughout instead of in periphery.  I did feel that the book, in general, flowed a bit less smooth than the previous few, but Cussler did spend much more time than usual in the eyes of other characters, and that could be why.  Overall, a solid read--highlighted with a couple very nice copter scenes
