It is very interesting to read this kind of book, especially about eunuchs in Byzantion. However I think it is easier to compile such an omnibus-styled collective volume. I prefer monographic coherent book written by one author , e.g. John Boswell's &quot; Christianity, Social  Tolerance and Homosexuality &quot; et &quot;Same-Sex Union &quot; , Eva  Cantarella's &quot;La bisessualita nel mondo antico&quot; , Bernard  Sergent's &quot;L'homosexualite dans la mythologie grecque&quot; or so.  This book contains various &quot;Third Sex&quot; like stereotyped berdaches  in America, hijuras in India, transvestists in Europe etc.---- Each article  is interesting of course.  Although in Japan  our ancestors never  introduced eunuch-system from China , we have many books exclusively  concentrated on eunuchus.So I'd like to read special works focused on  Greco-Roman &amp; Byzantine eunuchs. If somebody knows these kinds of  subject series,please kindly tell me the titles
