This is a very good book with detailed information for photographors. It gives photo advices, time estimation, etc, which can be very helpful for planning your trip. I give it 4 stars for two shortcomings: the first is that it doesn't have colorful pics, although you can buy the accompanying CD; the second is that it doesn't contain any maps, so you'll have to figure out by yourself where the places are. I'd suggest you also look up one other title by Joseph K. Lange: Photographer's Guide to the Grand Canyon and Northern Arizona. In my opinion, that one is even better.
