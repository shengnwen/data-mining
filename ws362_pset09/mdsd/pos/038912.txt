I enjoyed the book.  The storyline was good but I thought the characters could have been developed a little more.  This is a medical mystery.  Cassandra Kinsley, who had been a pathologist resident but had switched to psychiatry because of her failing eyesight, is married to the top heart surgeon at the hospital.  Their marriage is getting a little rocky and Cassandra thinks its her fault and then she discovers that her husband is taking drugs to help keep him going with his hectic schedule.  To top it off, patients have been dying off that she and her former pathologist partner think is suspicious, but they haven't been able to discover how it is being done, then the pathologist dies after he has surgery and then when she has eye surgery she is almost killed.  The book is action packed to the end
