I wish I had written this book.  I'm a professional bird conservationist, and this book really provides the best introduction to the many ways that our lifestyles impact birds and the environment.  Its a beautiful little book, with great ideas, fresh writing, and a cheerful tone.  Laura manages to suggest 101 ways to improve your lifestyle, without loading on the guilt.  A bible for bird lovers.  Very informative, inspiring, and motivating.  If you are one of the 50 million Americans who watch birds in your yard, or you just want some practical ideas on how to make your lifestyle more sustainable, do yourself a favor--buy the book, find something new to try, then buy copies of it as a present for those you love.
