Did you ever wonder how your favorite Christmas hymns and carols came to be written?  Where were they first sung and why?  Who are the people behind them?  What events in their lives, what discoveries of faith, inspired these beloved songs into being?  Ace Collins has complied a lovely little book to help you find out.

For instance, here you will find everything from "Angels from the Realms of Glory" to "White Christmas". (Yes, there are some popular songs sprinkled in among the hymns and carols!).  Do you know...

...What favorite hymn was written the Christmas that the church organ conked out?  (Yes, I know some of you know the tale, but it is here for those who don't).   

...Which one was a faithful Christian's response to the carnage of the War Between the States?  

...Which hymn was penned with a visit on horseback to the village of Jesus' birthplace fresh in the writer's memory?  

Ace Collins relates the stories, both familiar and fresh.  He helps the reader not only wonder as they wander through the holidays but also figure out who Good King Wenceslas was and why he is worth singing about after all these years.  Collins is the author of over fifty books including "Turn Your Radio On" and "The Cathedrals".  All of these stories are accompanied by the words of the carols and hymns, so you can sing or hum along as you read about them.  

This book would be a great devotional book or family conversation starter to use throughout the Advent season, with 31 different stories to inspire your heart and mind throughout the wondrous season.  It is small enough to serve as a great stocking stuffer and lovely enough to be a stand-alone gift for any number of people on your Christmas list.
