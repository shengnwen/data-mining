As a Biblical scholar, I found this book of immense importance in that for people just now delving into Judaism and the oral tradition of Judaic Law, it contains substantial (though not exhaustive) information of the  historical as well as cultural evolution and development of the Talmud. The  significance of the numbers of people involved in it's development and  their roles in all renditions I found encapsulating. It is a first step to  further study for those who have any investment in Judaism and/or searching  for a further truth
