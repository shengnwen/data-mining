First let me comment that I am a "cautious" Bible prophecy reader.  Do I believe that Jesus will return in the Second Advent?  Yes.  Do I believe in what is commonly known as the PreMillennialist interpretation of Bible prophecy?  Yes.  Do I see every shadow and say "it's the antiChrist, run!"...No.  Nor do I worry that I will go to the doctor tomorrow (hypothetically) and they'll order me to have an implant in my hand or my forehead.  Again, I am a student of prophecy, but I don't worry about every shadow that may cross my path.  Now.  What I do believe though is that events are occurring in the Middle East, with Israel at the very center of events, that have been foretold in Bible prophecy.  Further, I believe that, just as events are occurring in Israel, so too are the people of Israel being readied for the next earth shocking events in Bible prophecy.  I believe that the covenant God has with Israel will culminate soon, maybe in my life time, maybe not...but the events are happening and they are happening now, and happening quicker.  Thus the need to read Joel Rosenberg's Epicenter.  This is a fine book that shows the background story of this man's fiction writings...thus the "truth behind the fiction" to use an already coined clichï¿½.  Epicenter focuses on what is happening right now in the Middle East and has been happening already in the Middle East and what just may be happening in the Middle East, tomorrow.  Israel is the true foci of God's prophetic plans for the human race, all the way back to Abraham (and even, in some respects, the prophetic historical periods between Adam and Abraham).  Blessings and judgment will God's plan for the human race, through Israel.  Blessings toward those nations that see the truth in Yahweh through Christ Jesus, and curses toward those nations that curse God's people--both the Jews and the Christians.  Any one who wishes to see what is going on in the Middle East needs to read this book, even if you do not come to this book in the desire to study Bible prophecy--if you just come to this book to see the social and the political and the military apocalypse that is building up in the Middle East.  This is an important work for all to read.  It isn't perfect, and you might not agree with everything Mr. Rosenberg has to say, but I will hope that you at least give him a chance to speak his mind while reading his book.  You might just learn something that will not only save your life, but also your soul
