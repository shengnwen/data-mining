I have always liked J.A. Jance's J.P. Beaumont series much more than her Joanna Brady series, and Long Time Gone is no exception. In this book, Beau is working for the Special Homicide Investigation Team, a branch of the Washington Attorney General's office that investigates crimes involving police officers and other politically sensitive homicides. Upon returning from his son's wedding in Hawaii, Beau is handed a case involving a nun who, while under hypnosis, has remembered details of a brutal homicide from her childhood. At first Beau is skeptical but as he begins to check into the nun's story, he realizes he has an unsolved murder from many years in the past on his hands.

At the same time, Beau's best friend, Ron Peters, gets involved in his own mess- his ex-wife is shot and killed after she decides to seek custody of their younger daughter, Heather. At first Ron is the chief suspect, but the investigation quickly moves to focus on Heather, herself as the possible killer. This case is also being investigated out of Beau's office, but because of his relationship with Ron, he is warned to stay out of it.

Beau being Beau, however, when his friend needs him, he can't stay away. While he tries to maintain his focus on the unsolved homicide, he continually gets drawn into the investigation surrounding Ron and his family. He also still has to deal with officers from his old investigative unit, including Captain Kramer, who, newly elevated to captain, enjoys holding his position of authority and tromping over everyone he meets.

Jance does a masterful job of drawing all of the characters in her book. They change and grow in a realistic fashion, and move on to new stages of their lives.  If the resolution to both of the murders is a little stretched, it can be forgiven in light of the other strengths of the book.
