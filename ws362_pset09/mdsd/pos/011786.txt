I love this book, which is a reflection of the voice in which it was written.  

The book has an aesthetic sensibility which supports its heartful message.  The information is succint and with depth.  It may not be the only book a person would use as a reference for flower essences, as it is aimed primarily to linking the flower with the specific meridian site.  Yet, I can see that it may be a nice book to begin with also.

I really appreciate the photos of the point locations.  They are not the usual dry diagrams normally encountered.  A nice addition to an already established library of knowledge.  

It's been helpful in my own journey and personal research with flower essences.  Thank you for writing it and crafting its presentation.

One of the other reviewers commented on the limitations of the science behind the research. I see this book as a very useful addition to a skilled practitioner's library or worthy of exploration for personal use.  After all, what people really want is results.  I've been using plant extracts topically for years and this is a nice light to understanding my own experiences.
