This was my first book in Linda Barnes' Carlotta Carlyle series and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Carlotta is similar in ways to Stephanie Plum.  In this book she follows her "little sister" Paolina to Colombia where she believes Paolina's Father may have taken her following Paolina's disappearance from Boston.  I was totally taken in by Carlotta's adventures and the unravelling of mysteries. I look forward to Linda Barnes' next book to see what happens to some of the enticing characters she introduces us to
