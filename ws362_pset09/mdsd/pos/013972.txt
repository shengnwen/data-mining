Just when I figured I had seen it all, "Now Discover Your Strengths" comes along with a new outlook and a dynamic paradigm. A unique difference from others in its genre is the "Strengths Finder Profile" (can be interfaced on the internet).  It covers many different personalities of leaders with concentration of five dominant traits.  Chapter 4, page 83, does a fascinating job with detail explanations of thirty four "themes" of leadership.

 If I may paraphrase Vince Lombardi (the legendary football coach): "In practice I do not worry about what other teams are doing. If we concentrate on what we do best, the game will take care of itself." I found that philosophy to be the essence of this book.  Focus on your strengths instead of trying to change weaknesses.  

It is amazing how many companies make this mistake with their employees.  When trying to improve sales, and reduce turnover, they focus on the weakest link (the bottom) when more productivity can be realized by rewarding, emulating, and promoting the best producers.

Those who have been obsessed with what is wrong in their lives will discover a better way is to learn what works best for themselves and others. The authors' ideas are motivational, inspirational and can be implemented by anyone. 

There are some revealing comparisons in the book to another prototype leader (Warren Buffett). Readers will be surprised and infinitely impressed with the key reasons for his success.  

This book should be a must read for anyone in a leadership position looking to improve the bottom line. It is very well done and has no comparison.  Reading it gave me strength, buy it and discover yours!
