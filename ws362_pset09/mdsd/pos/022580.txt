Having taught for more than 5 years and worked in impoverished schools, I can say that the schools depicted in "Savage Inequalities" are all too real.  Those who dismiss this book as "liberal propaganda" are either completely ignorant or blind.  

The lack of equalities in our schools in America is a tragedy.  Jonathan Kozol documents specific incidents of this tradegy in Illinois, New York, New Jersey, and San Anontio, Texas.  While many of these cases in the book are worst case scenarios, the reader must ask why this happens.  The richest country in the world should not send children to schools that are grossly ineligible to meet the children's needs.  Particularly in the age of that illogical document "No Child Left Behind", some schools can not meet the standards if they can not even provide enough books or a warm safe place.  There can be no equality in this country unless a basic education is available to those most willing to learn.  

What disturbs me most about this book is the blatant racism that excludes impoversished students from better schools.  Even though a student may have the skills to succeed in the "rich school", they are denied because of an imaginary line established by a politician.  Without the ability to attain the best education, a young mind is being starved.  The social mobility promised by this country is non-existent until this is changed.

"Savage Inequalities" stimulated so many thoughts in me that the space allotted for this review is inadequate.  Even though the book is dated, I hope it makes as many of my fellow Americans angry as it made me.
