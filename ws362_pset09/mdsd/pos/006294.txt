This is the fifth of Rabbi Kushner's books that I've read.  The first four that I read were full of unexpected and unique insights.  However, I delayed buying this book because my present precarious impecunious state requires unusual thriftiness and because I couldn't imagine what new exposition could be possible for the 23rd Psalm.
Well, I bought another book that I HAD to have, so I bought this one along with it to qualify for free shipping.  How glad am I?  Very, very.  As his other books, it has wisdom that applies to everyday living that I didn't think of before.  It is simple, direct, and profound.  I especially benefit from his explanations of the Hebrew meanings of words and phrases that don't translate easily into English.
I hope he writes many more books.
