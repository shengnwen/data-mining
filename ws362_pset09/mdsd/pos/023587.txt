This is a unique book.  I didn't guess the ending.  But, I didn't like the characters as much as I did in her other books.  Also, a little swearing.  I was looking for a book for my daughter.  If your daughter doesn't mind mild cursing, then go right ahead.  I feel this book is more adult than the Howl's Moving Castle books
