The author has taken a heavy-duty subject, full of complexities, and made it into an interesting and informative book.  Unfortunately, many people probably won't read it because they'll think it's "boring."  It was, indeed, fairly intense reading, but I found it well worth my while.

Those who would most likely benefit from it, Christians of orthodox theology, probably will not touch it with a hundred-yard pole.  That is entirely their own loss.

As this book takes pains to make clear, heresy is in the eye of the beholder.  In Holy Writ, as well as in secular history, the winners get to write the history, and the losers' point of view is largely ignored
