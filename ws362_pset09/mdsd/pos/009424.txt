Good book for those wishing to know more about the field or not knowing where to start.  When you get serious, you'll want to read some additional books on working with the publishing world.  From what I've understood, very few agents will touch children's books.  So, you'll likely be going it alone up until you really get established, if you do.  That means you will be working directly with the publisher/editor yourself.  As a result, you will need more information under your belt about the publishing world than what this book contains, but this is an excellent source to learn about everything else.  It does include some starter info about the publishing end of things
