I lived in Kentucky for 10 years, and I heard of Thomas Merton. I was afraid to try to read any of his works as I thought that they would be so deep I wouldn't be able to relate. Thomas Merton has shared with us his journey into Cistercian life that was easy to read, and I found myself not wanting to put it down, and when I finished I found that I wanted to hear more from him. It reminded me of the life of St. Augustine.
