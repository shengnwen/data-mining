I haven't picked up one of Niven's new books in more than a decade. I am glad I did with this one (okay, it was in the library). Chewy morsels of stories that I would have been completely oblivious to as a teenager. Funny, but with a twist or shading that gets easily to be uncomfortable. As a middle aged adult, I appreciate this sort of joshing. And I can wake up and say, "hmmm, I should consider that today (and forward)". Whatever his recent works are directed toward, this collection shows that Niven doesn't spend his time thinking about marketing all of the time. 

I would like to introduce my kids to this sort of extrapolation of the future. I liked Asimov, but he's not quite far enough, anymore. Niven is still waiting for someone to produce the movie. Imagine trying to do "A Mote..." ugh, it is almost dreadful. Ringworld has potential, but only the way Tolkien had potential - with great time, effort and risk. Well, maybe. Herbert's work was dismal on screen, but it was a much more psychological work to begin with. Niven is much more accessible, spectacular. Anyway, my mental images of "World Out of Time" are lasting. In the way Hemingway is, or O'Neill or Faulkner. Things that flash on me unbidden, not for the words necessarily, but the imagination and detail that suggest montages I could put myself in. 

Good. Good to read, good to think about
