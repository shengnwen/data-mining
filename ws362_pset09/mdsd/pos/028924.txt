WOW!  I am sooo excited about using HOW this year.  At the end of spring I began praying about what the Lrod would have me use for curr. this year.  I was throughly researching the Veritas Press and HOW;  after reading all I could about veritas and the HOW book, I have a firm conviction that the Lord wants us to use the HOW for our family from now on!  I have throughly enjoyed all the knowledge and wisdom that I have gleened from reading Sections 1 and 2 about rethinking christian education.  It has really been a blessing to be challenged to think about the methods by which we educate our children.  I truly desire to pull away from the greek and secular worlviews of teaching and to embrace a more Hebriatic way of educating.  There is so much to learn and I know that Robin Sampson has worked very hard to create such a through rescource; but I am very anxious to begin learning with my children all the things that I was not taught in my education; wisdom!!!!!!!  A must read for any homeschool parent!!!!!!!!
