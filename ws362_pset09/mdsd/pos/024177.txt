After reading about this book, I decided to purchase it...though we are not dieting, we found a healthier way of eating.  The recipes are delicious! I don't know which we like the best, but the turkey with cranberry and prunes is a favorite.  We don't follow the diet, however, I always have a cold cereal, usually one of the cereals by Kashi..a mid-morning snack consists of a piece of fruit or yogurt..and then one of the dinner recipes.  We have not tried any of the desserts, as I usually have fruit topped with fat free yogurt. We have not had any sugary desserts in a month and don't miss them. We are eating healthier, without a lot of processed foods, or high cholesterol food.  Without the breads and sugar, my stomach has flattened, we have more energy and feel great.  Thank you Dr. Katz
