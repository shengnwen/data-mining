I like this reference a great deal, especially because it is laid out in a clear fashion. The stroke order of the characters are given as are both the printed and cursive forms. The combinations are given in a logical order. I  especially like that the combinations are listed down the page, not running  across the page, one after the other, as in other dictionaries. The  characters are also printed very sharply, whereas the printing in many  dictionaries is not good at all. These features make this a pleasure to  use. Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't mind the romanized style of  index at all, but it would be handy for the beginner if all pronunciation  variations of kanji readings were consistently given. (For example, if the  kanji is in second place in a combination, &quot;se&quot; might become  &quot;ze&quot;, but the index seems to only give pronunciations for the  kanji when in first position.) My one serious criticism is that there are  not enough entrees, but that is probably one reason this is a  &quot;Beginner's&quot; dictionary
