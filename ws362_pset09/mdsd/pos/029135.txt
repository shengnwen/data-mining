David Taylor got it all wrong.  Being European, I actually felt a little pro-American bias about the book...but not much.  Nowhere did Schwartz say that the US is a rogue superpower.  What he says is that there is a "growing distaste" of the US as a "rogue superpower", and this is a fact and not a biased opinion.  It is not even an opinion at all
