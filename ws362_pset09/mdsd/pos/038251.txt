I am not a big reader but when i picked this book up, I couldn't put it down. It shows two boys and their struggle with their sexuality.  The character James, was such a real down to earth character. The whole book keeps you thinking wether or not Link and James are gay, or if their in love. It was a great read! Highly recommended!!
