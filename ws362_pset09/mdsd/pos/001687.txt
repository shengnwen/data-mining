"The Codex" is the type of novel you can't take too seriously.  As is the case with Matthew Reilly novels, "The Codex" is all about over-the-top high-octane action that truly stretches our suspension of disbelief.  If the reader just relaxes and is willing to disregard the highly far-fetched action sequences and plot twists, he or she will be in for a memorable ride.  However, if the reader is nitpicky and demands plausibility, he or she will be sorely disappointed.  With this novel, Douglas Preston is not aiming for accuracy or believability.  He simply wishes to mesmerize us with action that is jarring, dense, and utterly enjoyable.

Most of the plot transpires in the thick Honduran rain forest, where three estranged sons of an American magnate face impossible odds.  The magnate in question - Maxwell Broadbent - was a larger than life figure that amassed an impressive fortune and over half-a-billion dollars of precious arts, gems, and artifacts.  In an attempt to emulate the pharaohs and Mayan sovereigns of old, Maxwell buries himself with his treasure deep in the Honduran rainforest.  If they wish to claim their inheritance, the sons must overcome tremendous difficulties and find the tomb.

Sit back, relax, and enjoy the thrill ride... And don't take it too seriously
