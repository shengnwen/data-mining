Littell does an amazing job of storytelling involving characters from the CIA, KGB, post-World War II factions from countries still trying to heal, and gives the reader a view into the extremely slippery and tricky business of those responsible in determining facts from disinformation, truth from lies, moral from immoral, to protect their own and their nation's interest.  In doing so Littell made it "almost" possible for the reader to see strands of good in the objectives of the Soviets, and others who were (and still are) enemies to the United States.  There are times when I would think that for how much has changed from so long ago, so much remains the same.  This is a long book which spans generations and enables the reader seem to have known the main characters for a life-time.  It goes without saying that not everyone is who you think they are or should be.  The suspense is constant and each period of time in which major events happen seem to have heartbreak along side of triumph.
The only aspect of this book that I did not care for was the author's amplification of the shortcomings of our Presidents.  They are made to appear weak or incompetent, whether democratic or republican.  Toward the end, though, it became painfully obvious his opinions favored democrats.  President Carter was never mentioned and he makes President Reagan sound literally retarded and as if he used SNL scripts to formulate Reagan's persona.   This is why I did not give this book a five.  I was surprised and disappointed to see the story take this turn after so far into the book.  It adversely affects the ending to this epic making it come across as flat and more fictitious than it needed to be
