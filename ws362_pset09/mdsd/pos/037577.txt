First of all, I know this is not an autobiography based completely on facts...........I DON"T CARE!!  This is his interpretation of his life's events and so he dramatizes them, presents them in a way that is more memorable..........the point is that the story is excellent!!!!
My Friend Leonard picks up where A Million Little Pieces left off.  James is released and goes off to find his girlfriend and things are not happily ever after.  He copes with his addictions, with loss and with his inability to move forward.  He faces challenge after challenge and just when you think he is on the verge of collapse, he pulls through.  Leonard enters his life and offers him an opportunity to better his circumstances and although he is not quite comfortable with it, he decides to take another chance on the unknown.  This is a compelling story that has an open and honest quality to it.  This is not to say that the author purposely misleads anyone, what he does do is to take his life experiences and adapt them enough to keep you riveted to his story. It is a tremendous tale of dealing with the harsh realities of addiction, personal relationships and the multitude of choices that are laid before people on a daily basis. It is a story of consequences and responsibility and it is a story about finding faith in the future and hope in the present.  I think that this author has faced a lot of criticism that he attempted to fend off in a manner that came back to smack him, in the same vein, he faced the criticism and dealt with it after the first book and deserves the recognition of being a talented and gifted writer
