I really enjoyed this book.  The author does a solid job of explaining everything you need to know to write games for MIDP devices.  If you are familiar with Jonathan Knudsen's book on J2ME (probably the best book on the subject), this book expands the single games chapter into a fun and interesting book.  

The book starts with a quick sample showing us how to use the Sun IDE and how to run our games on the emulator and how to download our games to a phone.  The author shows a couple of example games, a maze and a jumping game, that give a good overview of the basic techniques games use on MIDP devices.  She then expands those examples by showing proper use of threads and shows how to play tones and music during a game.  Storing information (such as high scores or user preferences) is demonstrated.  Downloading game enhancements such as new levels for a dungeon game are also demonstrated.  The book is full of well-commented code samples (worth stealing) that show the techniques being discussed.

The author of this book has a nice, easy to read style of writing.  Her enthusiasm for the topic comes through and makes you want to try the many sample games.  If you have been spending too much time on enterprise programming then playing around with some MIDP games might be just the antidote and this book will get you started on the fun.
