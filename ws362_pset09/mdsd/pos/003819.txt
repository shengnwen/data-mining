This work by JD is really fast-paced and intricate at the same time! a page-turner if you ever saw one! if you're a native of NYC as I am, you'll like the way he describes the Village and Downtown Manhattan! really accurate; the story is fast-paced; Rune is kind of ditzy but determined to get what she wants regardless of the consequences.  If you want to pass sometime and have some fun-reading, this is the book for you
