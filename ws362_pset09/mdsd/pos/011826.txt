In researching AJAX-specific books, I found they all covered the raw core stuff (what XMLHttpRequest is, what it does, and how to use it) but most of them gave only passing coverage to the frameworks/toolkits available for AJAX and DHTML processing. (e.g., "XYZ is a very nice new toolkit for building AJAX-based web applications. Go to the XYZ web site and read the documentation that isn't there yet to see non-existent examples and learn how to use it.") "AJAX Hacks" came pretty close with some good examples, but without enough breadth and depth. (It is, after all, a "hacks" book.)

Just the presence of good examples and good coverage of Prototype, script.aculo.us, and DOJO in this book is enough to make it worthy of note. But the focus of the book is using AJAX with Java frameworks like Struts, Spring, and JSF, and in that regard it also does not disappoint. So you get not only some nice coverage of the client-side toolkits/frameworks that make Ajaxian things happen in the browser, you get a solid grounding in how to connect them to server-side applications using these Java frameworks.

Some deeper coverage on things like JSON and REST would have been nice, though
