The best part of this book is the photographs. They are plentiful, taking up as much room as the print, and useful, too. They help you to see which  of the styles of architecture is which, the layout of a Greek home, and  many other things that would be hard to visualize if told only in words. 	 This is a convenient book to have at home -as are the other eyewitness  books; a quick reference, and also a plain fun read. Though it is supposed  to be for children aged 9 to 12, I think many teens would enjoy this book
