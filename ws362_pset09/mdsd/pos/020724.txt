Let me just start by saying that I don't agree with people who use the word &quot;trash&quot; when describing the work of Jacqueline Susann.  Her  books indeed did involve drugs and sex, but they show the DARK sides of  drugs and sex; nothing glamorous about it.  The language she uses is very  straightfoward and &quot;in-your-face&quot;, and above all, very real.  A  lot of people use the fact that the &quot;f&quot; word is used often as an  excuse to call it trash, when, in reality, the &quot;f&quot; word is a word  that is used often among the types of people in the book.     As in all  Susann novels, you'll find a bit of Jackie in the novel, and you might also  find a bit of yourself
