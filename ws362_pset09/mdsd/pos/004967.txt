Spirit of Place provides an excellent overview of travel photography.  It is well organized, written clearly and concisely, and is filled with beautiful photos to help illustrate the points made in the text.  The author discusses techniques to help you deal with various difficulties from how to find the best vantage point when shooting tall buildings to dealing with people that you may want to photograph.  One thing that I really appreciated was that he also gave advice on which equipment to use in various settings and situations.   

If the book has a weakness it is that it was written back in 2000 by a photographer who obviously didn't so much as scan his slides for further editing.  This is strictly centered around film photography and that definitely limits the usefulness of the material focusing on film selection if you use a digital camera.  Forturnately, most of his advice is sound regardless of whether you use film or digital so I would still highly recommend the book
