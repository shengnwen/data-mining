Is there hope?  Can we change the world?  Is globalization a benefit to the world or a curse?  The western world look at globalization as a curse (the loss of wealth and power status) while the rest of the world looks at it as hope for life and quality of life.  Social Entrepreneurs have these and many other issues to contend with.  This a good book and highly recommended.  Also, Stop Working by Rohan Hall which deals with globalization and entrepreneurship is an excellent companion book that also deals with these challenges
