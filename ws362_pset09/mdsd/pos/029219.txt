"Bombardment, barrage, curtain-fire, mines, gas, tanks, machine-guns, hand-grenades - words, words, but they hold the horror of the world."  All Quiet on the Western Front, by Erich Maria Remarque, is a novel about WWI.  Paul B�umer is a German peasant on the front lines.  He is the narrator and protagonist of this literary work of art.  Good art reflects the culture in which it was created.  Great art shapes culture.  This book does both.
	B�umer's powerful story reflects the culture of the front lines and trenches of WWI.  It confronts the reader with vivid images of danger and violence.  Paul speaks of "men living with their skulls blown open" and soldiers running "with their two feet cut off."  He conveys the desperation and helplessness of life on the front.  To the foot soldier, "the front is a cage in which [they] must wait fearfully whatever may happen."  The story reaches beyond details to reveal the psychological impact that war has on men.  First, their youth is taken.  None of the men are "more than twenty years old.  But young?  Youth?  That is long ago."  They are forced to become "hard, suspicious, pitiless, vicious, tough."  But this is good, "for these attributes were just what [they] lacked.  Had [they] gone into the trenches without this period of training most ... would certainly have gone mad."  
In the trenches, there is no outside world.  It is a culture of isolation.  Paul describes himself as "so alone, and so without hope."  It is also a culture of silence, where "a man cannot talk of such things" as death.  When Paul loses his best friend he admits that it "was very hard.  But a man gets used to that sort of thing in the army."  By the end of his narrative, Paul has become so accustomed to the death of his comrades that the reader numbly accepts their fate as well.  This is an eloquent way to communicate the tragedy of war.  Yet, it saddened me to be reduced to that state of callousness - as if I were not paying the men the honor they were due.
	On the home front, honor is the only focus of a patriotic society.  The men's schoolteacher, Kantorek, gave "long lectures until the whole of [the] class went, under his shepherding" to enlist.  And if any men hesitated, "even one's parents were ready with the word `coward.'"  When the men were on leave, all anyone wanted to talk about was the front.  Paul's father wants him to tell "about the front," Paul's German-master's first question is "Well, how are things out there?" and even a head-master asks, "So you come from the front?  What is the spirit like out there?."  There is also the assumption that "Naturally it's worse here [Germany]" because it's "the best for our soldiers, every time."  After all, while the teachers teach that "duty to one's country is the greatest thing," the men learn "that death-throes are stronger."
	One hopes that All Quiet on the Western Front is sufficiently dramatic and unflinching to alter our culture's understanding of the cost of honor, and war. The cover of the Random House edition refers to it as "The greatest war novel of all time" - and it may well be.  It teaches the futility of war, and the irony that "the culture of a thousand years could not prevent this stream of blood being poured out."  Paul is resigned to being twenty years old, yet knowing "nothing of life but despair, death, fear, and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss of sorrow."  He talks of seeing peoples "set against one another, and in silence, unknowingly, foolishly, obediently, innocently slay one another."  After reading this book one cannot merely think of war as glory and victory and heroics.  One must face the horrors visited on the individuals who participate, willingly or not.
	All Quiet on the Western Front reflects one culture and has shaped another.  However, in spite of its impact, not enough has changed.  We still fight today with the same human cost.  When the book was first published, a review in the French journal Le Monde said, "It should be distributed by the millions and read in every school."  WWI was to be the war to end all wars.  How many wars have occurred since then?  Obviously, this book needs more readers.  As Tjaden so aptly puts it, "what exactly is war for?."
