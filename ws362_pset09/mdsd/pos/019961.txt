This was just the information I had been looking for.  After following the 3 Day Plan I couldn't believe how great I felt - and I lost weight.  The science behind why we overeat was truly revealing - now I understand much better why I can't just &quot;make&quot; myself do things - afterall, if behavioural change were easy we'd all be perfect.  The information (methodology) for creating the behavioural change is included and is remarkable.  There's also a website where you can visit for additional information and support.  I can finally make sense of what I've been battling for the past 33 years and I have found a way out of the mire - I am so grateful for what this has brought to me
