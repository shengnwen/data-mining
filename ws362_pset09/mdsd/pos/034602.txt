I could hardly wait to get my hands on this book once it came out in paperback! The sequele to Light in Shadow, Truth or Dare rapped up all the lose relationship strings. Arcadia's 'deciesed' husband showed up and her relationship with Harry finally cemented. Bonnie and Singleton movied further along in there progressing relationship and Eathan and Zoe finally solidified there marrige.

Jayne Krentz's book provids twists and turns that just when you think you have the protaganist nerrowed down she unfold some new clue that makes you second guess yourself.
