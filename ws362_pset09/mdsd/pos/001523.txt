I am ashamed to say it took me a couple months to get through this book.  I have read lots of C.S. Lewis' other work, but for some reason the first few essays were a chore to get through.  I was lost and confused, and no matter how slow I read it or how many times I read it, I just got more and more frustrated.  I think I was kind of intimidated by it.

Finally I got tired of seeing this book lying around and paying overdue fees to the library, so I bore through and read the ones I was having trouble with, without fully understanding them.  And then - happy light on the other side of the tunnel!  I could not put the book down.  My brain was working overtime with new ideas.  My heart was comforted at the wisdom I was understanding.

Honestly, this was difficult for me to get through in some places, but it was definitely worth it!  It was a challenge.  It helped me to reason better.  The things I learned are principles that help me spiritually.  It's worth it
