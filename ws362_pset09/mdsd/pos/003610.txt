This is not made clear in the marketing for this book -- it is written expressly for clinical psychologists and other mental health professionals, and not for people who are living with narcissists or who suspect that narcissism might be the root of their troubles. (HINT: If you think you might be a narcissist, you probably aren't.) That said, this is a fun and entertaining read by a well-known name in the field. Dr. Lowen is a bit &quot;out there&quot; at times, he can get very Esalen all of a sudden, but generally this book has good theoretical foundations and will be of help to any clinician who is treating a narcissistic patient
