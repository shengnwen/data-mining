Conceptually, the answer to many of health care's challenges lie in the use of new information technologies.  Knowing this is the case and making  it happen are two very different entities.  This book ably bridges these  two entities.  The devil, as always, is in the details and the authors  deftly elaborate the problems and provide solutions.  I recommend this book  to practitioners, administrators, managers and policy makers who are  energetic and enthusiastic about the future direction of health care.   Errol L.
