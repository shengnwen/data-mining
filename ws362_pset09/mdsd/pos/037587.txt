I didn't really know what to expect when I came across this book, but it has really shown me a new way to approach my faith.  As a fairly new Christian, I haven't always allowed God to do his will in my life, but through Mr. Esau's stories, I have a better handle on how to allow God to 'surpise me' in my own life, by seeking his will more fervently.  A good read a person at any point in their journey with God.
