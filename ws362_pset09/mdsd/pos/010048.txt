One of my favorite books. I read this again a couple of months ago. Florentino Ariza's 50 year unrequited love for the haughty Fermina Daza is an amazing allegory of human love. When Fermina marries another man, Florentino doesn't ever give up. Doggedly he spends his life planning for their eventual getting together. In a way he is a ridiculous Don Quixote, undaunted by reality, pining over a lost cause. Somehow this bizarre little man hopes on. No, he doesn't hope. He insists. He becomes president of the local shipping company, he redecorates his childhood home with his love in mind, his love of the arts mirrors his love for her. Why does this work? Marquez is just a genius. He simply lets the characters tell their story and he writes down their words. And so they come to life
