Despite the fact that I enjoyed the first book 'Tithe' quite a bit better than this one I was still pulled in and enjoyed this book very much. The characters are alive as I've said before and Holly Black is very good at making real events magical. It starts out realistic and ends up in a dark fantasy plot which I really enjoyed. But the book is about...

A seventeen-year-old girl named Val is just normal. She's on the school lacross team, has a boyfriend, etc. Until things go wrong. A normal day when she's about to leave for a game she ends up finding her mother and boyfriend, Tom making out in her living room. At that point she runs away. Wouldn't you? She ends up in New York and finds three street teens named Lolli, Dave and Luis. Luis is different though. The fact is that he can see faeries...

The plot continues from there. Val ends up working for the same troll Dave works for, Ravus. As she continues to work their are murders or deaths in the land of faeries and they all blame Ravus. They think that the medicine he gives them is poisonous...but Val knows better. She must find the killer, defeat the killer and get back before something terrible happens. What an adventure! 

I hope that you try out and read this book because it's an excellent read for dark fantasy lovers, romance fanatics and action cravers. ENJOY
