Like many books that promise to "take you to the next level" this one is just slightly disappointing.  Don't get me wrong, the book is pretty darn good but not jammed with all kinds of breakthrough ideas that nobody's ever presented before (as some reviewers claim). The book focuses on building a team atmosphere and moving away from a business that is based solely on one person; "the star".  The book talks about the "No Sell-Sale"TM that is supposed to help you transform prospects into clients seamlessly.  It's not bad but it's not great either.  It pretty much reminds me of the training I received as an entry level life insurance salesperson.  The key to the system is to generate referrals and the book has some good advice on the subject.  The book does provide a vast appendix filled with template letters and flowcharts.  It seems like I'm being a little harsh so let me finish by saying that I would still recommend this book to any financial advisor.  There are plenty of ideas to warrant the very small purchase price.  In fact you'd have to be pretty high on yourself not to get some great stuff out of this effort.
