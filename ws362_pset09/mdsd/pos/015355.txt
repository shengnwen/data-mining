My problem: hip bursitis and piriformis syndrome. I'm three days into the stretches that this book recommends. Already I've received more pain relief than I ever got from anything I tried before, including physical therapy,  acupuncture and a cortisone injection. I'm very hopeful that I will soon be pain-free.

Update: five months later, my piriformis syndrome is very much under control. I'm back to working out on a stair-climber, back to long walks with the dog, back to being able to sleep w/o pain killers. I still get twinges of pain, and must continue the stretches, but I'm so much better
