Treasure Island has, by all means, a good plot. Fairly good character development and adequate/interesting setting. However, the language is a bit tiresome. 

I felt Stevenson interjected far too many adjectives, and many sentences (and even paragraphs) seemed completely purposeless. The writing style turned me off a bit.

With that said, I will also say I do not hold Stevenson at fault too much, considering the time period in which this book was written. Nevertheless, it definitely does not help anything.

TI is a classic though, and John Silver is a villian for the ages! Aye! So 'ee is
