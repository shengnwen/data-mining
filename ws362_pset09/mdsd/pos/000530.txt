When I first came to Yellowstone to work in the summer of 1998, I was a little overwhelmed by the number of trails in the park.  I had never been hiking before, either.  Thanks to this book, I had a wonderful summer of  hiking, and I now have a new hobby.  The book has hikes for nearly every  mile of trail in the park.  The hikes are listed by trip, not by trail, so  you have several options on each stretch of trail.  For each hike, there is  a handy elevation profile, list of key points and mileages, suggested  itinerary, hike options, and a detailed description of the hike itself.   There are also many nice photographs.  I highly recommend this book for  beginners or old backpacking pros.  It has hikes for everyone
