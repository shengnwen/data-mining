i bought this book on a whim becusae i knew i needed serious help. I used to have an insanely messy room, but this book was incredible! it is really easy to read and actually explains how to get organized in a way that suits you. its so inspiring and has great stories that make you feel that your not the only disorganized teen in the world. after reading this i completly oprganized my room and everyone was shocked that they could see my floor again!  I also have an insanley busy shecudle and this book really hjelped me figure out how to organize my time! it was really a fabulous book and the only thing that ever helped me prganize my life-much more effective then my mother nagging me
