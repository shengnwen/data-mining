I loved reading this book, having been a woman who's done almost all the stupid things mentioned! I bought the book to pass around to my daughter (21) and her friends.
I love the easy to read format... a quick read which makes great points. My daughter doesn't want to read it! she says she wants to make her own mistakes! sigh! So maybe it defeats the purpose, as I find most of us don't understand these stupid things until after the event! self delusion seems to be what young women do best!! Anyway, I loved it! thank
