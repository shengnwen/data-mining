If you are a good parent you must get a copy of "Where The Wild Things Are". This is a story of a very bad boy's day of imaginative roll playing and final acceptance of his place in the real world. I love reading it to my children and watching as their little faces lit up in recognition of adventures they had endured during their own periods of bad behavior... Check it out and get it for your little "darlings". 
Another MUST HAVE for your children is the series "Why Some Cats are Rascals" . Very captivating and touching stories showing the world with cats eyes.  Especially good is Book 3.
