Gower Champion!  Forgotten name as the parade passes by.  His greatest achievements on the stage failed to make it onto the screen, though shreds of his glory can perhaps be glimpsed through George Sidney's sensible restaging in his film of BYE BYE BIRDIE.  And something of his flagwaving spirit makes it through Gene Kelly's otherwise terrible treatment of HELLO DOLLY.  But alas, MGM never did make CARNIVAL the way Champion envisioned it.  And actually, who would really want to see a movie of I DO, I DO, or SUGAR?  (I would have enjoyed, however, seeing the film he planned of THE FANTASTICKS.)  He threw away a lot of his pearls in front of a lot of swine.  And Gilvey was there for all of it, or so it seems.  Could he have been?  He doesn't seem that old in the jacket photo.

You wind up not really liking Champion very much.  His sense of self makes even Michael Bennett, Bob Fosse and George Balanchine seem well-adjusted socially, even a bit on the wallflower side.  After reading this book, I admire Marge Champion more and am eager to seek out some of the work she did with Gower in the derided MGM musicals they danced in.

His career seems like an odd amalgam of hard work, talent, and a hell of a lot of luck.  The appearance on Ed Sullivan--a whole Ed Sullivan show devoted to the Champions, just when MGM had dropped them and they were really facing Hasbeen House--seems nothing short of a miracle.

The book gets repetitive and it always takes Gower's side, but the amount of research is prodigious and even a seasoned theatergoer will find something of interest on nearly every page.  It's a book of monsters, but fascinating monsters at that
