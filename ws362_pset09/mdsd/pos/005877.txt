I loved it. Had me laughing out loud several times. Book is more than 125 years old, but still much more believable than that black book most people have but don't read. As a staunch atheist, I loved his writing. Especially liked his response to personal attacks from Christians - (I'm paraphrasing) - Even if I was the worst man in the world, it still would not make the story of the great flood less doubtful
