Well I can't say I read all of the stories but I did read, according to the Little-Brown flap, "the astounding title story, which has already been reprinted in four different anthologies [and is] a masterpiece of remembrance and thwarted love." Would have to disagree. The story, which contains many sentence fragments. Such as this one. Such as lists of brand name candy, collected by children on Halloween. Is based, literally, on a pun. Presumably it is based on the untimely death of the author's sister, and the difficulties of fictionalizing such an event. Memories, circulating around the time of Halloween, are jogged by snapshots. It's a clever story, heartfelt. It's not a masterpiece. "Boys" is another piece of piece of pleasing postmodern claptrap, which, while modestly arresting (each sentence begins with the word, "Boys") contains such boners (in the Nabokovian sense) as "the boysmasturbate constantly....three times a day in some cases...at the mere sound of certain words, words that sound like other words....beast reminding them of breast." Excuse me but this I can't imagine-but then Catholicism seems to be a big theme for Moody, and perhaps there is a screw loose that renders my ideas of onanism nonuniversal. In fact, if I didn't mention, most all the sentences also start with "Boys enter the house..." as in (p. 243) boys enter the house carrying cases of beer." Again, a recognizably Catholic theme. Another story is called Ineluctable Modality of the Vaginal which, except for the obvious nonpretentiousness of the title, I can't get in to here. "Full of deep feeling and stunningly beautiful language," the flap copy continues, "the stories in Demonology offer the richest pleasures that fiction can afford."  Amen. P.S. The book is dedicated to A.L.O., A.M.S., and R.H.S.  (I'm assuming those are three lovers who wouldn't want to see their names together on the same page-I think it was Delillo who started the multiple lover dedication rage.
