I was given this book by a friend as a going away gift.  The day I decided to read it, I was ill and lay on the couch reading it in one sitting.  I was a bit drowsy, but I could not but it down...It made me nervous, excited, sad, and happy...all the emotions that a good book or movie can offer.  Get this if you are a serious reader looking for a fictional escape
