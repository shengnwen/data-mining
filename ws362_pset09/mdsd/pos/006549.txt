I really enjoy this author's new series about the 500 kingdoms and absolutely loved the Fairy Godmother (the first book in the hopefully long series) which is why I grabbed the second book. I was somewhat disappointed only because the story turned out to be somewhat predictable. The loop hole involving George was definitely to run of the mill and seems to be the pervading theme in these books. Which isn't bad I just wish there was a little more surprise going on.  Also the romance between the main character and her honey definitely seemed like an afterthought to me. Like the author thought it was a requirement for the story and so decided to throw it in sometime while the story was wrapping up. 
That being said; the writing and humor was entertaining and the story was interesting. A very nice book for light reading. I'll definitely be picking up whatever comes next
