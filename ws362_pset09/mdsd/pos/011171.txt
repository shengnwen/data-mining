This book will NOT simply change your life. Reading it will only provide you with knowledge. Try to correctly shift responsibility where it belongs (on YOU) and ONLY read this book for necessary and current knowledge about the truth of what can enable you to be happier.    

I am completely astonished at the wisdom and energy of this text. I read it as a four book personal education regarding the contemporary and most current discussions of happiness. This book, behind anything and everything I read of Seligman, is in a league of its own. Dr. Baker is a remarkable man with tremendous insight and understanding of human behavior and happiness. I imagine sitting in his office would be a real exchange with brilliance. 
This book is a thorough discussion of baker's work as a psychologist working with people who seek happiness. Through a presentation of several different cases and individuals, Baker is able to illustrate his points very well. Further, the reader becomes completely convinced that Baker is speaking the truth. Baker's main thesis is that an evolutionary fear prevents us from living a happier life. His doctrine finely complements the great work of Seligman. 
I would suggest this text to everyone. It is practical, accessible, and fantastic. In a class of books that seem to target those seeking happiness and fulfillment, this one is at the top of the list. 

You must read it!
