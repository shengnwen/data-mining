I wanted to read the author's first novel published in 1994 because I really loved his second book, "Middlesex".  In "The Virgin Suicides" I can see the talent that came to fruition later.  It's a young man's book though.  It has its faults.  But there is something haunting and compelling about it.  I found unsettling and disturbing.  But I couldn't put it down and finished the 240 pages in just a couple of days. 

The setting is Mr. Eugenides' native Michigan in the 1970s.  The narrator is a young teenage boy.  He and his friends are fascinated by the suicides of five teenage sisters whose story is told through this boy's eyes.  He writes about what he has seen or heard or has been told.  We learn every bit of the gossip.  But we never ever really get to know the sisters.  And we never understand "why". 

This is a coming of age story for the boy.  The sad neighborhood incident is just a catalyst to bring out his character and that of his friends.  They are obsessed with these girls in a voyeuristic way.  The author is skilled, very skilled.  He describes thought processes that made me really see the narrator as a person.  And he knows just the perfect details to use to move the story along.  Years later he meets some of those boys who are now men.  They talk about the girls and we get even more insights.  But there are no clear reasons.  And, in the end, there are no answers. 

Basically, this a first novel from an author who later went on to win a Pulitzer prize. It's interesting to see how he has developed.  And the book is interesting from that point of view.  However, it lacks his later maturity.  I do recommend it but it doesn't come near the quality of what he exhibited later.  Therefore, if you were to read only one of his books, make it "Middlesex", not "The Virgin Suicides"
