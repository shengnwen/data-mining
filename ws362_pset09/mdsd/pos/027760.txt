I am not much of a reader and when TRY fell in my hands I read it in about 9 hours. I could not put the book down. Being a best friend to a PRCA cowboy and years of Rodeoing myself and living on a Ranch, Try is the closest thing to reality I have ever read. I felt like I was there in the moment through the whole book! I hope there is more where that came from!
