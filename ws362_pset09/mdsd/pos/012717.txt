This book covers a lot more than just the mechanics of how to use a build tool (Ant).  It has a lot of great "best practices" info and a lot of relevant examples.  It is easy to read, and includes a lot of technical information that is simple to follow.
I think the biggest benefit of this book is the strategies it outlines for integrating Ant into a development environment.  Anyone who has been involved with building large scale applications (regardless of the tools used - including make) understands how complicated the process can become.  The author includes a lot of ideas about to create an easily configurable and extensable build environment.  This book should be required reading for anyone involved in configuration management.
The other nice aspect of this book is the chapters later in the book that explain how to integrate other tools into a build environment (such as JUnit or XDoclet).  These chapters aren't complete enough to fully explain these technologies in full, however they are a good introduction to the basics of these technologies.
Overall, I think this is a terrific book.  In addition to providing good explanations about how to use an important tool (Ant), it also provides a lot of "best practice" guidance which has proven very valuable to me
