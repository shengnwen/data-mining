Elaine Scarry presents a beautiful, thought-provoking and in the end, not altogether convincing (but still convincing nonetheless) that beauty is connected to justice, and shouldn't be tossed out of academic circles in the name of political correctedness.

Scarry approaches the subject of beauty and the nature of beauty by first telling the world where people go wrong when it comes to aesthetics.  She gets personal, yes, but she remains philosophically on the mark as long as the reader is willing to stay focussed on the central point of her entire book.  Beauty is not some silly thing we humans should discard and treat as unimportant or not valuable.  On the contrary, beauty is something that tells us much about ourselves and the world in which we live in so it cannot be ignored any longer!  Kudos to Scarry for bringing it back into the discussion limelight.

However, having said this, my only problem philosophically with the book was the way Scarry attempted to tell readers how the idea of justice is something ingrained within human beings and found consciously in human nature yet, the idea of beauty is not.  She is not equating the two as the same, yes, but she is equating the two as being interdependent and so it seemed peculiar to me that she would make such a strong case for the root of justice and act as though beauty is some autonomous thing out there by itself.  A sense of justice and a sense to experience and see and seek out beauty are both things we humans possess.  It's in our nature and I wish Scarry would've made that a little more clearer to the readers.  If she would've done that, her argument would've been so much stronger.

Let the aesthetic discussion thrive on!
