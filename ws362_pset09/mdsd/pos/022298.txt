Hollister's history of medieval Europe is accessable, easy to read and abundant with detail.  More importantly, it does much to dispel the myth that the "middle ages" were a dark period in European history, instead bringing the richness of the time to life.  The ninth edition is a further improvement over previous eds, with its emphasis on medieval women.

Modern Europe is largly the product of its medieval roots - part Roman, part Germanic, part Early Christian.  Hollister's (and Bennett's) masterful treatment of the age (and his ability to demonstrate the relevance of the time) is a rare treat
