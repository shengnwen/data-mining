Reuters correspondent Connie Burns is used to being in the thick of wars and their consequent horrors, but is convinced that the brutal rape and murder of five women in Sierra Leone, is down to a British soldier-of-fortune who goes by various aliases. He is known to be a savage, woman hating brute who kills and mutilates for the sheer pleasure it affords him. Connie is abducted and held prisoner for three days before she is released, unharmed, but is traumatised to the point of incoherent speech and thought. She refuses counselling, as she has been shocked into the very state that her captor wished, that of a shamed, humiliated woman who blames herself for not being stronger. She leases a large house in a small village in an attempt to hide from her tormentor, making the acquaintance of only a small number of the locals who subsequently become drawn into her story and she into theirs. I can see this book becoming a movie thriller with lots of tension and mysterious happenings in the old mansion. It's a great read !
