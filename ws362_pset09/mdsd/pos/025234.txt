I bought this book only because I like Richard Preston's work.  Frankly, my interest in steel and the steel industry (metal in general, for that matter) is nil -- but I just had to see what Preston was going to do with this subject.  I now know more than I ever wanted to know about steel and the men who make it -- and the learning process was funny, suspenseful and gut-wrenching.  This was a DELIGHTFUL book and I'm glad I didn't let my lack of interest in the subject turn me away from it.  I give this book my highest compliment:  I'm glad I read it
