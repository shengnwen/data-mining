I purchased Restless Skies last Christmas and kept it on my coffee table to read through, refer to and admire the photos. It was not just a coffee table book but also became a great resource for the wild and unpredictable weather we all seem to experience. 

Over the course of the year family and friends who were visiting me would often pick up the book and begin reading through it more and more. I then decided that I would start giving Restless Skies as gifts to my friends and family for birthdays and other gift giving occasions

The genuine and sincere number of thank you's that I have received for giving this gift could fill a book in its own right. They not only love the information contained in it but the writing style of Paul Douglas the author and the photography ties the whole package together. 

It is rare to find a great book that can double not only as a resource but have so many awesome photos in it that qualifies for the coffee table in the den or living room. Restless Skies does it for me and all the folks that we bought it for.

A great book and a great read - definitely a keeper!
