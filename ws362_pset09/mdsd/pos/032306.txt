Painfully sincere, and brutally honest.  This poor girl was punished over and over for a decision (mistake) that she made at the age of 14.  It takes an incredibly strong person to survive not only the event, but the horrible, cruel years that followed.  As a young teenager, this girl tried several times to confront her demons and face the problem head-on.  A sad story with what I deem a happy ending
