Most people know Chris Tomlin for the powerful worship music he writes, songs that are sung in thousands of worship services every Sunday Morning.  He is renowned for his talent as a songwriter and worship leader, and now he has written a book.  I was very much looking forward to reading it, mostly because I had read writings of his before, and they were always wonderful, thoughtful, and above all, praising and in awe of God.  This book has a lot of personal stories, lots of scripture, memories of some of the songs he has written, and the verses that brought about those songs, but mostly, this book is about getting you, the reader, focused more on God, and developing a better relationship with him, and becoming who He has made us to be.  Chris' desire in writing this book is to help you along your spiritual journey and share his thoughts from his experiences about God, and what God is wanting from us.  It is awesome.  His writing is easy to read, but without being simplistic; he adds quite a bit of humourous stories and lines in it to keep your attention and connect with you, but honestly, it wasn't needed.  It's a hard book to put down.  Chris writes as he if he talking with you, sharing a one-on-one conversation, which makes this book even better.  My only complaint is that it is not nearly long enough.  Praise be to God for the wonderful people he has put here on this earth, people like Chris who have genuine hearts for God and for others, people who have willingly chose to listen to Him and to follow Him and share His glory with others
