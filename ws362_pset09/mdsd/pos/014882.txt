I'll admit, the book gets off to a slow start - like the first 400 pages are slow. 

But, if you can make it that far, the novel will prove to be one you will love. For the rest of my life, I will never forget the relationship between Dora and David. Dickens' descriptions of David's infatuation with Dora contain some of the most beautiful lines I have ever read: "I loved Dora to distraction."
