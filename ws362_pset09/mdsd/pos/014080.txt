This book had meaning for me and I have been married for 20 years.  Dr. Phil has good advice about ways to improve relationships and allow us to continue to grow.

I wanted to read, "Relationship Rescue" because I find Dr. Phil very entertaining.  I like his no nonsense approach to therapy and find it refreshing.  He speaks frankly and plainly and has good strategies for improving any relationship.   I particularly love that he advocates that  the "Relationship Rescue" starts with you.   He explains that for the relationship to improve and grow, each individaual needs to participate.  Blaming the other persoon for the issues is not the way to improve or have a successful relationship.  Dr. Phil gives easy to follow lessons that allow one to analyze and change their attitude about the realtionsip.  I recommend this book for anyone in a relationship that wants to make it better and stronger.

I also suggest that if you like this book, you should read " How to Create a Magical Relationship" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  It was an even quicker read and had more immpact on my relationship.  By reading this book, my relationship with my husband improved in ways I didn't imagine before.  Both books are very complimentary and will help one create a wonderful relationship
