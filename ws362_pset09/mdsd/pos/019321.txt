To hear Victor Cherkashin's perspective on the Ames, Hansesen, and other espionage cases towards the end of the Cold War.  While the book is not perfect - it is exactly what it is supposed to Mr. Cherkashin's perspective.  (A perfect book in my mind would have had a comparative viewpoint on the various episodes described in the book).  

The book is quite simple in communication style, but that is what makes it quite engaging and difficult to put down.  The selective insertion of Russian words gives the reader a feeling they are there, as part of a conversation or interaction.  

Again, considering this is Mr. Cherkashin's memoir, if you are willing to accept some of the bias of any memoir, this is a fantastic read.  Of course, some of the stories regarding our own CIA, makes you wonder that we ever got anything right.  But he also gives the perspective of disappointment when it is revealed about the vast number of agents within the KGB the CIA has.  

Mr. Cherkashin also provides a good overview throughout the book about the compartmentalization of the KBG and what the various Directorates did/do.  Even though the author sprinkles in a bit of his political leanings, it adds to the book, and helps to understand his personal thought process, rather than becoming a manifesto for the old Soviet system.

The book is a great read - never gets boring with too many personal details about the author's life or the subjects life.  It provides some insight into the thinking of various spies - on both sides of the Atlantic.
