At her best, H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) is a poet. Her novels all display a poet's sense of immediacy, but are sometimes confusing for their interior &quot;scapes&quot; which are frequently all too fluid. Her poetry, however, directs the &quot;flow&quot; deliberately and masterfully. &quot;Notes on Thought and Vision&quot; is a rare example (like Nikos Kazantzakis's &quot;The Saviors of God&quot;) wherein the distinction between poetry and prose evaporates. These &quot;Notes&quot; are intimate and compelling, watery and feminine, mystical and yet (strangely) earthy--composed of octopus, seaweed, and salt. Her language is delicate, but not brittle, her point of view keenly sensitive but never timid. &quot;Notes&quot; is an intelligent reflection on the sub- or un-conscious, and on the source(s) of poetic inspiration, from the only person, male or female, who ever wrote openly of her experience as Sigmund Freud's patient (see H.D.'s &quot;Tribute to Freud&quot;). &quot;Notes on Thought and Vision&quot; is a short book (and a small one), which contains a very large message that celebrates the feminine and the divine as one and the same. A must-read for any woman who seeks to explore her creativity and for any man who seeks his own &quot;anima&quot;
