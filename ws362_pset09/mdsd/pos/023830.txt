Please note:  This book is approximately 75% paraphrased from Eco's &quot;The Search for the Perfect Language,&quot; which contains a more thorough treatment of the material that the two books share.  The material that is new in this book is interesting, making the read worthwhile for the dedicated reader who has already enjoyed &quot;The Search..&quot;.  For the casual reader, &quot;Serendipities&quot; is much shorter and more accessible than &quot;The Search for the Perfect Language&quot;, making it a suitable alternative or possibly an introduction to the longer text.  However, if you take offense at paying to read the same information twice, simply do not purchase both books.  Enjoy
