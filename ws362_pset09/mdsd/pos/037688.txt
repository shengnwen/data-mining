The Complete systems Administrator lives up to the "complete" part of it's name. This book covers nearly every area I could possibly think I'd ever need t look up in a network administration/system administration role.

Unfortunately despite the fact this book is only four years at this point, I believe it already is beginning to show it's age. There is a lot of attention given to HP/UX, and AIX in this book with suprisingly minor attention given to Linux. I think it's safe to say that a typical sysadmin-type employee would be encountering many more Linux systems that HP/UX or AIX these days. 

Information on devices and buses such as SATA is also lacking due to the technology being newer then the date on the book.

That said, this book is still great and recommended but with the caveats mentioned above. I would look forward to an updated version of this book with more emphasis on Linux, updated info on Vista, Server 2003, and newer versions of OS X.
