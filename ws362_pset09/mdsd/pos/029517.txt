For me, the measure of success in a popular mystery novel is whether I want to keep turning the pages. In this book, I did. I'm a fairly fast reader, but I grew impatient with my inability to turn pages as fast as plot twists developed.

This isn't a deep psychological study of a family, but there is plenty to consider about how the truths (or partial truths) of our childhoods shape our lives. Supposedly forgotten events imprint themselves in ways that allow memory to recover itself when the time is right. This story is about how the right time unfolds.

The fast pace develops, to an extent, from the bustling life of a young attorney in Manhattan. She is smart, likeable, and interesting. And the book is populated by similarly intriguing characters, people whom we can easily imagine given their realistic dialog and occasional foibles. 

As I closed the book, a few glitches became apparent to me, but these did not stop or even slow my progress through a very readable mystery. Given the parameters of this story, I do not know whether Laura Caldwell will be able to reprise her characters. But it would be nice to meet them again
