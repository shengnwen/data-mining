  Maybe this book was too contemporary for its 1930's audience.  However, the theme and language are quite tame compared to some of the works of the 21st century writers.  Although there are many people in Georgia who are extemely intelligent and have created the best literature to date (Margaret Mitchell & Alice Walker, for example).  There are still people who are similar to the characters in God's Little Acre in Georgia and other colorful characters in the United States.  This work compares to the writings of William Falkner, who is considered tied for the honor of the greatest writer of the 20th Century along beside Ernest Hemmingway.  It also compares with Billy Bob Thortnon's  brilliance of charater in his writings as well.  The theme is spiritual as well as sensual.  Don't take my word for it...Read it and compare it to Slingblade, The Sound and the Fury, and The Color Purple
