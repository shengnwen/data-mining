To be perfectly up front about where I'm coming from, I haven't read the "Left Behind" novels and I'm not religious, nor do I tend to read much in the way of inspirational writing. Perhaps this will make it clear that when I say "Writing for the Soul" is a lovely and enjoyable read that could teach any up-and-coming writer a thing or two, I'm not speaking as a fan or simply agreeing with Jenkins' religious ideals--I'm speaking as a reader and writer who has had the privilege to review dozens of books on writing.

Jenkins' religious convictions certainly permeate his manuscript; he is unashamed of his beliefs, and his desire to share them with others is the result of a moving personal journey that he also shares within these pages. However, Jenkins also possesses a wry, thoughtful tone and a realistic outlook on life that prevents this outreach from pushing or preaching. I never felt excluded in any way as a non-believer, nor did I feel that Jenkins' advice and words had no relevance to me and my experience.

"Writing for the Soul" is part memoir and part instruction to would-be writers. Much of the instruction is relevant to writers aiming for any market, while some pertains specifically to inspirational or religious writing. Jerry Jenkins has authored many books (fiction and non-), and has extensive experience as an editor and publisher. It is this latter experience that makes his advice particularly insightful and useful to would-be authors. He understands the common mistakes that would-be authors of inspirational material tend to make (such as being overtly preachy!) and offers pointed advice to help them avoid such pitfalls. As a non-religious reader I particularly found myself nodding at his advice; the kinds of things he advises against are exactly the sorts of writing that put me off when I read inspirational material. The fact that I found his book so enjoyable, and frankly uplifting, merely proves his point
