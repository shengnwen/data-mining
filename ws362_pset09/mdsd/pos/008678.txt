SPOILERS!!!
I mourn the end of this book, I just finished reading the last page. I layed down for a moment, the book upon my chest, holding onto the adventures and the love that was shared with me through Fitz's eyes. I got up and looked online at all the reviews, just hoping to extend that feeling. Wow, I have never been so moved by a book. I cried ALOT. The poem the Fool wrote his beloved made me cry so much I kept having to stop, because my eyes blurred so. I missed him tremendously, and I was almost angry with Fitz for being happy, and that is when it hit me. Unconditional love, not bound in any way. The Fool would never stand for my being angry with Fitz for his happiness. As much as I was sad/angry for Fitz, and heartbroken for the Fool,  he was happy for his Beloved, and who am I to judge them?
