There was a lot of things that I loved about Fifty Cents From Pieces To Weight.  The first thing that I liked about the book is that it was a true story about a known rapper that I like.  The book has a lot of action going on in it that keeps me interested in it.  The book talks about sellimg drugs, murder, police chases, fighting, and rapping which all bring the action and crime to the story.  There wasn't really anything that I didn't like was that some of the things that were said were a little exaggerated.  I would recommend this book to others.  If you like action, crime, and rap this is a good book to read.  It is written well and is very interesting.  It's not one of those books where you can fall asleep reading it, because you wouldn't be able to go to sleep you would want to know what is going to happen next.  I would also recommend it because I support one of my favorite rappers and he has a crazy life story to tell.  With all this said, I can say only one thing and that is that the book is great, one of the best I've read.  I recommend this book to people like fifteen and older.  I think that older people would read this book more because they are usually more into superstars and what the book talks about.  It's not that hard of a book to read but little kids should'nt be reading about crack and all types of other drugs and stuff.  I also recommend this book to people that love action and crime.  The book contains some fighting too, so for people that like hearing about fights you should read it.
