This book's value is in letting you know when to be in the market and when to be out.  It is very easy to read and is well written. This book will take the confusion out of hearing finacial reports, and points you towards sources of good information. I use www.stockchase.com . Stock market information is covered quite thourally and it highlights what is the important information to be listening for. Highly Recommended
