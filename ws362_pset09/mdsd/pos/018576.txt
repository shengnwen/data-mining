This is the kind of book I want to see more of for all ages.  I wish I'd had this book when I was a child.  It sensitively and intelligently describes autism.  Children, neurotypical (NT) and on the autism spectrum alike will get a lot out of it.  It is the voice of reason and acceptance.  If you get no other book for young people about autism, be sure to get this one.  It is truly a shining gem!  I love it
