This is the first computer book I actually said down and read, cover to cover. It holds your interest, and each tip gets you excited for the one to follow. I call it my AHA book. All the time you read it, you go &quot;Aha! That's the problem!&quot; or &quot;Aha! That's how to get rid of that!&quot;. Can't recommend it highly enough
