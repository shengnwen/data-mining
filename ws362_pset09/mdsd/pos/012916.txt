Pranks 2 is a timely set of interviews with tricksters who help us see the arbitrary boundaries and nonsensical rules that we so often simply accept without question.  Stories from the likes of Margaret Cho, The Yes Men and the Billboard Liberation Front (and many more) explore the rebellious spirit and authority-questioning that has long been a vital part of the American experience, but seem to be running at an extremely low ebb in the new millenium.  This book will revive your prankster spirit, and inspire you to make the world a more creative and lively place.
