Anna Reid has done a marvelous job of describing the situation in Ukraine in the early 1990s and the historical background of a nation that never existed before 1991.  It was always an area of people, but never was it ever independent.  Reid does a good job in explaining who 'owned' Ukraine, and what happened there during the different periods when parts or all of it belonged to Poland, Poland/Lithuania, Austria, Prussia, Russia, AustroHungary, Poland and USSR.  

She does and especially good job in explaining how during the 20th century, Ukraine at most times was a killing field for some one who despised them.  They suffered after WWI when they were a battlefield between Poland and Russia, then under Stalin, then under the Nazis, again under Stalin.  

As an independent nation after 1991, Reid has done her best to describe it's growing pains.  But the book becomes ancient history without being able to refer to the 'orange revolution'.  It would make for a fabulous book if she would take some time to update it through 2006
