Sullivan's masterful research draws the reader into the battle, fiancially and politically, to keep the Dodgers in brooklyn. This book takes you behind the scenes like no other. It's not just O'Malley packing up and  leaving. I'll guarantee you at the end of this book, you'll be blown away  at the many chances the Dodgers had at actually staying in Brooklyn. Also,  you'll look at Robert Moses in a different way, and how I feel that he is  as much to blame for the move too
