Interesting book, but I cannot find anything funny about Dick Cheney. I guess I don't get it because I'm a disabled Vietnam veteran, Republican, and spent my own money--not a penny of anyone else's money--running for the U.S. Senate in 1992.

Cheney epitomizes the term "incomprehensible evil". Jokes and cartoons about Bush, a capo in the Bush family mafia, are understandable because he's really very insignificant as a person and even more insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Bush is an AWOL druggie. And, like his grandfather and father, he's a sociopath. Cheney's in a different league altogether than Bush; he's one vulgar, immoral, sadistic subhuman. Not since Heinrich Himmler has one so evil walked among us. Even if you systematically practice anti-Semitism, surely, as a human being, you feel compassion for the victims of the holocaust.

"Equinox" published a poll a few years ago that showed that only nine percent of people who knock politicians vote, and that only one tenth of one percent had run for office or assisted a political candidate with their campaign. Considering this, is it possible that ninety-one percent of people reviewing books on Amazon.com are reviewing books they've never read? If so, this would explain in great detail about how people like Bush get elected.
