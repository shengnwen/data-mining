This is a good novel.  If you are a regular Gemmell reader it has many of the things that make his novels enjoyable, but it is also a little differant.  More intrigue, and certainly one of the most original ideas in all of his books.  This is also a pretty dark book and not the happy ending that many expect from a fantasy.  This is also a stand alone novel which ended without obvious room for sequels.  This is certainly worth a look
