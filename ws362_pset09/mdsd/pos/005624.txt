This book is so well-illustrated that the pictures literally pop out at you on each page. It's not hard to imagine yourself in the scenes of a small town filling station or in grandma's kitchen complete with a red formica topped 1940s or 1950s dinette set and a vintage range. The artist admits that he was inspired by Norman Rockwell and his pictures show that influence.

The story is a gentle, nostalgic memory of a boy's visits to his grandmother's house. This book would make a great gift for a grandchild who shares this love of visiting grandma's house. It would also be a pleasant trip down memory lane for any babyboomer generation member.
