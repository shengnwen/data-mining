Brad Free, Handicapping 101 (DRF Press, 2004)

Handicapping 101 is exactly what it claims to be-- a back-to-the-basics primer on trying to pick a winner. Something a good lot of us horseplayers most probably need. It doesn't matter how long you've been playing the ponies (in fact, I'd be willing to bet that the longer you've been playing, the more you need this book), you're liable to find something in here you'd discarded over the years and forgotten about.

Free takes us back to the four factors that are most likely to give us a winner-- speed, class, form, and pace-- and discusses each in detail, then goes over the secondary factors, giving each about the amount of space they deserve, and ties it all together with (of course) copious examples.

A good, solid fundamentals-of-handicapping book. Recommended. ***
