          "The White Mountains" is an exciting Sci-Fi story by John Christopher. It is suited for ages 10-16. If you are in to science fiction this is your kind of book. I do not like science fiction but this book was ok. This is suited for ages 10-16. If you are in to science fiction this is your kind of book. I do not like science fiction but this book was ok.
            It is about a boy name Will Parker, who tells the story, his cousin Henry, and his friend he meets along the way Beanpole. Beanpole is a strange character that has metal over his face but is not capped. Will and Henry leave there town to go to the White Mountains to escape from being capped. Will is a very brave for all that he's gone through along the way. 
           This is an interesting book so if you happen to catch it while browsing through books pick it up and buy it because it is worth the money!!
