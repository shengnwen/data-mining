Most shark enthusiasts have heard of the Jersey Shore attacks of 1916.  They were the inspiration for Jaws and are referenced in the movie.  Michael Capuzzo's book is a non-fiction novel (think In Cold Blood) of those attacks.  Nowadays, the popular opinion is that these attacks were not the work of one shark.  Capuzzo's book is daring because he asserts that they were all the work of one rogue great white shark.  For those of you who follow such things, you know that the notion of a "rogue shark" - a deliberate man-eater - has fallen out of fashion.  Yet, Capuzzo makes a compelling argument - after all, is it MORE likely that these freak attacks were the work of different sharks?

The book does not try to sensationalize the attacks - it doesn't need to.  Just reading a straightforward account is frightening enough.  When the shark cruises upriver to feed on boys who feel they are completely safe, the story has the feel of a nightmare.  The thing is - it really happened.

Even aside from the shark attacks, this book is a fascinating history of the Jersey Shore.  Back then, the Jersey Shore was the American Riviera; the wealthiest city-folk flocked there to escape from the heat.  As the shark went rampaging up the coast, Woodrow Wilson was a few miles away at his summer white house in Long Branch, running the country from a bank office in Asbury Park.  Close to Shore is valuable glimpse into a bygone era.
