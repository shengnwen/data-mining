After the letdown of the previous book in this series, it is nice to see Stephanie Plum back at her real occupation, ace bounty hunter.  Well, maybe ace is not the right term, but let it be.

The characters are fine and funny, as in the first ten books.  The gritty streets of New Jersey are not exactly scenic but they are very real.  And there is an actual plot, rather than a series of humorous sketches that wear thin when not attached to anything.  As for dialogue, that's why Janet Evanovich's fans keep coming back for more.  She has a real knack, an excellent ear for the nuances of street dialogue.

I can now rest easy for a while, knowing the writer has not run out of material.  My greatest hope is that she doesn't have a relapse in the 13th episode, that triskadecaphobia doesn't do in our heroine.

P.S.  This is the very best of the twelve books in the Plum series, and Stephanie holds the record for the most times a central figure is tasered in all of fiction
