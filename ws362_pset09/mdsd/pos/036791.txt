Although the book is great, it speaks for itself and I'm not here to review it.  I emailed the author, or someone who works with her, at the email address I got from Jan's website.  First of all, a little background.  I have a two-year-old border collie/lab who I've had since he was seven weeks.  I adore him.  I have been working from home with the occasional temp job up until two months ago.  I now work 5 days a week outside the house.  I wrote to this person asking advice on certain things relating to walking the dog, and mentioned the hours my dog is being left alone while I'm at work.  My response was that I am &quot;selfish&quot; and unfit to have a dog.  This coming from someone who was once so clueless about raising dogs that she put one of her own to sleep.  I have been looking into getting a dogwalker for my pooch, which as a person concerned for dogs, she could have suggested.    But her only suggestion was my poor dog, I shouldn't have him.  Whereas the book is a good read with good methods, I would suggest a second thought before asking her or her staff any questions personally.  She, or whoever that was, is rather selective in the dogs she'll help according to what she thinks of their owners.  It was a negative experience trying to get any kind of advice from them.  Rather than pointing out something wrong and offering suggestions to rectify it to someone who is obviously open to change, she chose instead to say, Sorry!  Not interested!  Not at all what I had in mind for someone in her position and with her passion
