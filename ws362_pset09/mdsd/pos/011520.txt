I hardly ever cry when I read a book, but I did a couple of times when I read this one, just from the tender feelings and differences between mothers and daughters.  Not only did these families have the usual difficulties due to age disparity between young and old, but there was also the cultural differences between war-time China and the modern USA.  Sometimes it was very funny, and it was always spellbinding to me.  It made me feel closer both to Chinese people and to my mother and also my daughter, who's the same age as the daughters in this book
