Having just finished rereading David Sudnow's &quot;Ways of the Hand&quot; I am reminded of just how much I love this book. I think it is one of the most original books and is quite possibly the finest and most detailed record of skill acquisition ever written. I doubt that there is anyone who describes the details of things that we do the way Sudnow does. Although this is a difficult book, requiring careful examination, the rewards are well worth the effort. The uniquely descriptive language he has created is fascinating to follow as it unfolds in the course of his story.  It is truly a combination of poetry and narrative.  Sudnow creates an excitement in the discovery of why and how the hand can be the agent that delivers the inventions of any artist. Anyone interested in creativity and seeing how an artist comes to let his body take over and do its art should read this book. I loved it- one of the best books I've ever read
