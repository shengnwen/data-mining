 This workout book contains good information with challenging workouts. As someone who is preparing for the Army, I can say that this is most complete workout book for preparation on the market. None of the competitors come close to the full spectrum workouts this book has. You have access to programs with weight training, cals, nutrition, swimming, running, and rucking. You can mix and match certain workouts or just do what is prescribed. I do wish that there was a little more rucking insight other than just generic information. But other than that it is a high quality purchase.
