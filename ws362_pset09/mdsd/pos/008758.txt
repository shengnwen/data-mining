This book is a sweet board book all on it's own.  The illustrations are great and the pace and repetition make it a good read for babies and toddlers.  This book was nearly a daily ritual for my daughter from 9 to 18 months.  It helped reassure her that I would always come back for her whenever I had to leave her with a sitter (and at the worst of the separation anxiety even with dad).  When I was gone Daddy would remind her "Mamma always comes back" and when I'd return she and I would remind each other the same.  I'm sure she'll never remember any of that as an "independant" teen or pre-teen but it's a great book to have during that tough stage
