My daughter got this for her 3rd birthday.  She loves it.  She enjoys finding where the stickers should go.  She needs help peeling the stickers from the page though.  Some of the pages are a little confusing, but help fom mom or dad helps.  I'm not sure how much she's learning from this book ,but she definatley enjoys it.
