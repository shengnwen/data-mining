I freely admit that upon reading the inner jacket flap about magic, alchemy, demons, and a subterranean European city, I was less than excited about this book.  With the opening chapter, though, I was hooked.  This is historical/fantasy writing for the non-genre fan.

Sedgwick truly creates a history-based fantastical reality for the reader to lose his or herself in.  The dark, dank, unpleasant world of The City jumped out and drew me in.  Too often, fantasy keeps the reader in suspense about the nature of the alternate world.  This novel is straightforward about the setting right from the beginnings, and the main mystery is that of the motivations of the master (Valerian) for our main character Boy (a young man of no name, no history, and no family).  The reader joins Boy and another orphan, Willow, as they navigate the dark streets of The City on errands for Valerian.  But does Valerian have their best interests at heart?

This ending leaves plenty of room for a sequel, and I would definitely pick up another book from this great author.  Consider me converted.
