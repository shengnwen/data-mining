While I admit this was a good book and an interesting start for a series, the story was weighed down by unneccessary details. I also would have liked some of the characters to play a bigger role in the story. Like what was the point, rather, of involving Wingo in scenes which did nothing for the story? They were nothing interesting, rather mundane; they should have been edited out.
