This book really is one of the best FF book, i've been reading bsc since i was like 7 years old and its great that they have changed a bit. I enjoyed reading about all of stacey's boyfriends but what i don't like at all is that stacey is always the one with the boyfriends and guys liking her and she knows it, anne should give more guys to the others. But all in all this  is a book you will enjoy
