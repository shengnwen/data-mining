Each time my spirt is down, or I'm going through a situation, I turn to this book.  I hold the book in my right hand by its spine, fan the pages with my left hand to stop at randum. The passages I've read, I have felt its deep spirtual feeling and I understand its meaning.  Then I reflect on my situation and the passage fits.  It helps me to understanding whats going on.  It uplifts my spirit to deal with my situation.  It give me insight to view my problem from a different angle.  It also assures me that what I am currently going through will end.  I will get through it.  In my view, its a powerfull book.  I have read several other books by Iyanla, even watched her talk show (sorry that went off the air), but like the bible, I keep Faith In The Valley near by
