I thought Dave Dowling's "Writing the Right Word" was helpful - "The Wrong Word Dictionary" takes my logophilia to another level!  Dowling's latest masterpiece helps you to effectively sharpen your speech and writing skills in a painless and enjoyable way.  

It's a snap to find the words you're looking for and, rather than bombard you with loads of background information, the explanations are presented in a succinct and effective manner.  This style allows Dowling to provide you with thousands of answers that are accessible and understandable within, literally, seconds of opening the book.  

The only downside is that you will regularly wish that you had the book by your side as you write emails or other documents.  Solution: buy a few copies and leave them wherever you frequently sit down to write or, better yet, maybe Dowling will come out with a pill version that we could swallow and just know the right word automatically
