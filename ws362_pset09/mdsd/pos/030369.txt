This is a very valuable book for those who want to know what Wall Street analysts do, or at least what they did in this period.  As a former Wall Street analyst, I can attest that it has the ring of truth.  The author comes across as being overly obsessed with Jack Grubman, however.  Getting revenge seems to have been one of his strongest motivations in writing this book, and he certainly has succeeded.

Dan Reingold is vulnerable to criticism himself.  He pats himself on the back for putting "Hold" recommendations on stocks that fell sharply, and that he claims he thought were probably going to fall sharply.  Why not say "Sell?"  His defense seems to be that he was spending his time finding stocks that were Buys, and if a stock was not a "Buy" there was no point in writing a report on the stock.

At the end of the book he makes some recommendations about how to reform the role of Wall Street analysts.  He makes well-founded points about the flaws in Spitzer's "reforms".  But his own recommendations are poorly thought out.  He does not seem fully to appreciate the economics behind research departments
