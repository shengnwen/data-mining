Everyday life has become exceedingly complicate.  We don't have the leeway to make mistakes in our dealings with people and expect to learn from these mistakes sometime in the future.  We need to increase our chances of getting it right the first time.  This is where Lynette Padwa's book comes in.  Wouldn't it be better to see a doctor with some prior understanding about how a doctor's office really and how you can maximize getting the best possible treatment?  Similarly, if you've never consulted a lawyer before, wouldn't it increase your chances of having a good experience if you knew how lawyers feel about their clients and how a law office operates.  I found this book to be both fascinating and highly informative, as well as easy to read.  I know I'll use it often
