My husband, son, and I just got back from Disney World a few weeks ago. We planned the trip in just a month's time, and WDW guides were very helpful!

The first two guides we bought were the Birnbaum's 2006 Official Guide and the Birnbaum's 2006 guide for kids. Because these are official books, no drawbacks or negatives are discussed. However, at 273 pages, there's a lot of great basic information on WDW.

For example, this particular guide features lots of colorful pictures on its glossy pages, as well as descriptions. It's an excellent guide for first timers who don't know what to expect and want to pore over the book in anticipation!

In addition to describing attractions, shows, restaurants, and hotels, the Birnbaum 2006 guide to WDW provides several charts--such as the Walt Disney Resort Finder. A picture of each resort is displayed, as well as information on location, setting/theme, what types of people favor a particular resort (e.g. honeymooners, families, conventioneers, etc.), amenities, and more.

The Disney Dining Plan is also described, as is Disney's Magical Express Service. There are directions to getting to the parks from the Orlando International Airport (MCO), the average temperatures and rainfall for every month, park hours, admission prices, new attractions, most/least crowded times and so on.

I found the maps to be especially helpful, and tore them out to use when we went to each of the parks. The WDW Birnbaum guide is a great book for first timers, but I would also get the Unofficial Guide to WDW, as well--especially if you're the type that counts pennies and enjoys strategizing. However, the Birnbaum guide is replete with solid information, great pictures, helpful maps, and feel-good enthusiasm. It's a gerat primer for getting into the Disney spirit
