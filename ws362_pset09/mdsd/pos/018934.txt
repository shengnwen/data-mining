        Many will remember voice performer Foster for his deft reading of "Fantastic, The Life of Arnold Schwarzenegger."  That story was a rich field for an actor, and Foster mined it well, as he easily segued  from one characterization to another.  The same may be said of "Snow Blind," as Foster becomes Detectives Magozzi and Rolseth as they face not just chilling murders but frozen ones.

	It's Minneapolis; it's the dead (literally) of winter, and the idea of a snowman building contest sounded good.  Minnesotans are hearty folk and many joined in the fun, filling a park with their icy creations.  The fun came to a quick halt when the bodies of very dead policemen are found inside two of the snowmen - a shock for all, the townspeople, the entire police department and Detectives Magozzi and Rolseth.

	Within 24 hours there's a copycat discovery in Dundas County.  Is it a copycat or a serial killer?  There's a new sheriff in Dundas, Iris Rikker, and Magozzi with Rolseth quickly head her way despite a raging blizzard. 
 
	These two detectives are pros; they know they need all the help they can get so they call on Grace McBride at Monkeewrench to start searching the web for any hints they can find.

	P.J. Tracy (a mother/daughter team) has done it again - crafted an exciting thriller filled with likeable (and sometimes very funny) characters.  Sit back, listen, and enjoy!
