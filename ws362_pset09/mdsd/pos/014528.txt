as one who can't bear the often/usual cutesy "kitty" tales i expected and was duly rewarded as doris lessing came through with an elegant tale of her life with cats.  her clear-eyed unflinching and therefore loving recitation of life both in the bush and in town with cats is a book i re-read at least once a year.  lessing's cats are dignified and she does not fail them by falsely sentimentalizing their lives.  she looks at and into these animals as they coexist and achieves a truth and charm which would be lost were she to diminish them with saccharine phrases, denying their deaths and lives the nobility they have and exude.  edith ann esbensen.
