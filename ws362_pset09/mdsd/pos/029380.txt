I used just this book to prep for the exam, I read the material once, took the first practice test, then re-read the material and took the second and third tests.  I then reviewed the answers and took the test.  This was my first ever CLEP test.  Be your own judge however when studying, if you are a good test taker then this book should do it all for you, if not then supplement with other material.  The book does a great job of covering the material.  I scored a 72 on the test.  Hope that helps
