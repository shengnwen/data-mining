A wonderful read.

The history of the pony express was fairly brief; for only about a year and a half did it do business.  Author Corbett chooses to give this short history a sufficient writing, thankfully not stretching it past the point to which we would care.  He then spends the rest of the book (over half of it, actually) exploring those who kept the legend alive and profited from it.  Corbett does a stellar job of allowing the reader to enjoy each story (even when he's about to prove it to be bunk) and he gives the famous, infamous, and totally forgotten their due.  Overall, Mr. Corbett has created a very good book about one of U. S. history's more interesting sidenotes
