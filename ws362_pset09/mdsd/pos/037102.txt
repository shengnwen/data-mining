This book's strength is that it is basically an outline of good strategy development. Another reviewer called it the book for "dummies"-like that was a criticism. It provides an excellent guide for real managers trying to get a tough job done in competition with their "real job" requirements. If you need something to impress a teacher, buy something different. If you need to get some strategic planning done in the typical workplace, put this book high on your list of resources
