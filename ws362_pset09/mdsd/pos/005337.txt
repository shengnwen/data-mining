This book is a must have for any gardener!
While I have always enjoyed gardening, it seemed the bugs always ate up my veggies before I could! This book teaches you all about plant "families", and which herbs and flowers are "friends" to the families. It is also very informative on plant diseases,insects, and what nature-friendly things we can do to help.
I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in companion gardening, organic garden, or just wants to grow something
