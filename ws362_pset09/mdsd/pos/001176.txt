I must say, I've found that most books filled with 'creative' exercises and activities fall well short of the mark.  Not this one, though.  The activities here are actually interesting and, I'd guess, pretty darn effective!  There's a whole year's worth of block-busters (even leap year, since there are 366 activities!).
