This book is among those books I feel all managers should read.  The book is very well written, an easy to read book and full of useful information.  It is also a great reference that once you read it you will find yourself referring to over and over.

I am biased as I have long been a friend and manage Peter's web site (www.pscholtes.com) so you can take that into account in deciding how to evaluate my advice (I have recommended the book to many people and those that share there opinions with me have all told me they agree that it is great).  Other books I strongly recommend: Fourth Generation Management, The Improvement Handbook, Creating the Corporate Future and Lean Solutions
