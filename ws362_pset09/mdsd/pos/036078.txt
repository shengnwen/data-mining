         The book Tuck Everlasting by Natalie Babbitt fantastic book.  Tuck Everlasting is about a family of four that drank magic water and lives forever. This story is with a girl named Winnie who finds out the Tuck's secret about life everlasting. The genre of the book is fantasy and adventure. The theme is about the circle of life and how dying is apart of life and the Tuck's are "like rocks on the side of the road" and no longer a part of the circle of life.  The quote I like best is,"Don't be afraid of death but the unlived life." I like this book because it makes me think a little more of life and death. The thing I don't like about the book is how over protective Winnie's family is with her.
