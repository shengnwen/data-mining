From a parent and kindergarten teacher's perspective, this is a fantastic book.  It is one of our family's favorites.  We laugh throughout the book each time we read it.  Bernard Most's simple and clever use of language and illustrations makes it a classic to read over and over. I have recommended this book to many parents and teachers. It is also a wonderful book for pre and emergent readers to read with adults
