This story takes place in a street called Klickitat Street and it takes place somewhere in the past. It takes place in the past because when they go to the store everything is cheap.
  
This book is mostly about a third grade boy named Henry Huggins and his friends Beezus, Scotter, Mary Jane, and Ramona. In the begging of the story Henry is trying to look for a pet. In the second part they put him in a play but he don't want to be in it.
 
In my opinion it was a good book because it tells a lot of what friends do and to care about each other. I  would recommend this book because it says like how to be fair and if you do something wrong fix it
