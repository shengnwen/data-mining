I rarely have a burning desire to learn about the jeans, bags or bras Alex Kuczynski writes about in the New York Times every Thursday. But I do have a desire to read whatever Kuczynski writes. No one is more insightful about how we live under the guise of writing about how we shop. 

And now she has written a book about another subject I thought might be limited to prospective cosmetic surgery patients but is actually about so much more.  Non-fiction rarely keeps the reader up at night, but you won't want to turn the light out until you find out what happens when an routine Botox injection leaves a movie producer's wife with debilitating headaches. Or whether Kuczynski herself is able to squeeze in a drive-by lip-plumbing injection between the funeral of a friend and the lunch after. 

There is masive research to back up little known phenomenon. Who knew the health care system would create an army of nippers and tuckers determined to circumvent the insurance indsutry and slice and dice for cash? Who knew that the person at the next desk was slipping off at lunch time to lose ten years and gain a promotion? Studies show that success goes not to those who feel good but those who look good.  

     Someone pumped up here, shrunk there, the triumphs, failures and excesses of an industry gone wild. Butchers and addicts alike are named. Whether or not you are a shopper in the beauty industrial complex, you will be richer for having read this book.
