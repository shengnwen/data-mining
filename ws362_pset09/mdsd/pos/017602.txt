While our children are being encouraged to "bling-bling" and spend ridiculous sums on their wardrobes, pimping their rides, and on sweet 16 parties; the rest of the world is hard at work trying to raise their nations out of poverty to eclipse the US.  While American parents accept mediocre school curriculums, other countries have set more rigorous standards.  How else could the emerging nation of Singapore trample over the US in Mathematics and Science?  Kudos to them for demanding excellence from their students and shame on American parents that don't demand MORE from their children!

I suggest you buy this book for every parent you know.  It's time we get FIRED UP enough to do something about this problem before it is too late.  Many lucrative, high-tech jobs have gone overseas because our children don't have the qualifications to fill them.  Billionaires like Bill Gates see the handwriting on the wall and they have given generously to create programs to encourage our students.  It is time parents did their part by ensuring their children are properly educated so they can take advantage of these opportunites being created.  

Maybe a book like this will give our teens the kick in the pants they need to wake up!  There's nothing wrong with having nice things, just make sure you put yourself in a position to provide them by getting your education
