I really enjoyed this book, but it helps if you read Hotel Paradise first.  I am still waiting for answers and hope Martha has a sequel up her sleeve...there were just too many loose ends at the end! I just love the way Martha writes and its always such a pleasure to read her...but who was Rose and Mary-Evelyn's Mother
