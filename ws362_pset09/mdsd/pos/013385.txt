This is not a review (I'm a big Bentley Little fan, and as such, I have not disliked anything he's done)---rather, this is a bit of trivia about THE HOUSE for those who like that sort of thing. THE HOUSE is the book Stephen King had with him when he was hit by a van six years ago. (He always has a book with him, and likes to read while he's walking) It was found by the side of the road on which he was hit, probably in a state of serious disrepair, considering the circumstances, I would imagine. I've always wondered if he came back to it after his lengthy recovery and finished it.
