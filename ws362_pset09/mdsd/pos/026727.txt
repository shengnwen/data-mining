Flash Fiction is a book that realy let you read from many different point of views. you can see the imagination of people and the thoughts they may have about something you may not even consider in that sense. It was fun reading this book. I really enjoyed it. It proved to be more fun than it looks. There have been book with short stores in the past which I got the chance to read, but the emotion was not expressed very much as the authors did in there stories in Flash Fiction
