I've used "Chicken Soup with Rice" to teach the months of the year to my kindergartners for the past two years, and they LOVE it.  Each month, I print that month's poem on chart paper, and we listen to the Carole King recording (they clamor for the "Really Rosie" soundtrack) before looking for words we know.  By the end of the year even my lowest readers are recognizing words all over the place!  Lots of fond first-grade memories of my own with this book as well.  Can't recommend it highly enough
