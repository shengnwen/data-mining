E.L.  Doctorow's novel Ragtime vividly explores the lifestyle, culture, and relationship of family, business, and life at the turn of the twentieth century.  Ragtime has a heavy emphasis on progressive ideologies, which serves as a catalyst for the evolution of the historical time period and the development of the characters.  For example, Ragtime incorporates an emphasis on the changing role of women which is illustrated in change of the white middle-class wife throughout the novel.  The wife undergoes a series of changes triggered by her husband's departure for a trip and her reading of female literature that emphasizes women's sexual tendencies and the role they play.  Doctorow deliberately critiqued and placed the families in stereotypical roles so that the reader could understand and follow the transitions which the family went through over the course of the novel.  Ragtime breaks the barriers of race and ethnicities at the turn of the century and interlocks the character's struggles and accomplishments
