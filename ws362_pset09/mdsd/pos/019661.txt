This book is incredible.  I was intrigued first by the title and then even further by the synopsis on the jacket.  What would happen if all your memories came back to you as if you were living them all over again?  If everything you saw or or smelled or did in the present reminded you of all moments small and large in your past.  And is what you remember exactly as it really happened?  Are our memories trustworthy, or are we rewriting them for better or worse even as they happen?  It's amazing the way the author addresses these questions through the characters, and makes you question your own memories.  Right from the start, you are there with these people holding your breath during the &quot;spill&quot; which isn't really a spill, but a release of a chemical into the atmosphere as one of the characters points out.  She draws you in and you can't help but get lost in your own memories just as the characters do in the book.  As you follow these people as they fight to find their way back to the present, and then struggle to move on after reliving their lives through their memories, you see how their memories have shaped and controlled their lives all along.  And how do we break free of the binds that are our memories?  Read the book and you may discover the answer for yourself.  When I was finished I was so disappointed to find out it was her first book because I couldn't wait to read anything else she had written.  Well now there's &quot;Disapparation of James&quot; also a very intriguing book, and I highly recommend that one as well
