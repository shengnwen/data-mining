Suzanne Brockmann and her Navy Seal books are my new obsession.  I loved this one the most because I actually liked all of the multiple storylines.  She usually does a main romance, a secondary one, the obligatory Sam/Alyssa angst (which i adore because I LOVE these two) and a WWII flashback.  In some of her other books there is at least one storyline I skim through because I think it steals valuable time from the better stuff.  Not this time.  I loved all the storylines. 

There are two reasons this one doesn't get 5 whole stars:

First is Ken Karmody.  This character has really changed from the previous books.  He wasn't very recognizeable as "Wildcard" Karmody.  He seemed way too normal in this one.

Second, I know that Sam and Alyssa's path to true love is already tortuous and doesn't need any other help to be even more torturous, but I was disappointed in the Max/Alyssa let's pretend we're together shenanigans.  It just seems so high school.  I think the heart-failure quotient for the Sam/Alyssa fans would've been really high if Max/Alyssa had actually, really tried to be together. Temporarily, of course.

But enough of my armchair fan-fic. 

Great book, great series.  Total recommendation!
