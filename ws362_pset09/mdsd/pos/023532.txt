Bottom line is this is a terrific book to read. It's a great book about horses and of course Nancy Drew!Anybody who loves mysteries will love this book. It's basically about Nancy Drew going to her two best friends'Uncles'house/ranch to have a great time riding horses and solve a mystery. When her friends tell her about all the vandalism that has been going on Nancy knew she had to figure it out. Plus she her friends,and some other people on the ranch have been seeing this so called "Phantom Horse" who everybody thinks is a ghost. Nancy doesn't know if it's really a "ghost horse" or if somebody on the ranch or anywhere else is just doing this as a prank. That's all I'm going to tell you for now, anyway buy this book you will loooove it!
