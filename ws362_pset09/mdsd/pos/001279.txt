This is my third trilogy by Nora and so far so good.  I like Margo, the main character and her relationship with Josh. She is fiesty and fun. The friendship between the women is also nice to read about.  It will be interesting to find out if the dowry really does exist.  I look forward to learning more about the other two women, especially Laura!
