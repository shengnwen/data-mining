Tannen's book is well done and worth the read.  However...  it is also imbued with a subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, bias toward a perspective which presumes female modes of communication and other activities to be inherently superior to those of males.  Of course, this is a patently false presumption.  The examples of female communications/activities are almost uniformly praised and those of males are much more likely to be disparaged, either subtly or explicitly.  

If you read the book, and I recommend you do, you should keep an eye out for this stuff.  You should not have to look far; if you do, that should give you pause.   Actually, it is an excellent exercise in learning to spot this form of sexism.

Overall, still, highly recommended.
