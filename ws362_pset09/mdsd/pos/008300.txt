Oh my gosh, keep these coming.  I love these books!  A very enjoyable read, I find myself laughing out loud and can't put the books down.  I enjoy Aisling as much as I enjoy Stephanie Plum (and that is saying a lot for me, since I'm addicted to Stephanie Plum novels, I think I found a new addiction).  And the dragons..hot, hot, hot!   Katie is definately a favorite author of mine now
