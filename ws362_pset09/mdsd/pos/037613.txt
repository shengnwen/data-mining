I love Jane Eyre for so many reasons. The character of Jane is so amazing: so quiet and humble and patient, yet at heart so passionate and full of longing! She is small and plain, but has more determination than any other character we meet. She has a pure, beautiful heart and a passionate, tender soul. She is the most amazing character I have ever enountered in all of literature!

The book follows Jane Eyre who, despite the stability of her quiet, peaceful life as a governess, is ultimately lonely and longs to experience more of the world. Mr. Rochester is a cynical, haunted man, living a life of sin and debauchery, but whose pure heart yearns for a clean conscience and a chance at happiness. Their love is deep and tender, filling up Jane's lonely life and rejuvenating Mr. Rochester--but true love can never be built on lies. When Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's awful secret, she cannot stay with him. He has lied to her the entire time, loving her completely but selfishly, using her for his own purposes. His feelings are true, but he has to pay for his sins and become upright before God--only then can they be together. Mr Rochester hoped to find redemption in Jane, but true redemption can only come from God.
