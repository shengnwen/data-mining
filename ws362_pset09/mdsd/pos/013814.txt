This book was a wonderful read and highly touching. But everyone already knows that. I wanted to comment on a certain edition printed by Penguin classics. Not only does it have a beautiful cover illustration of the four sisters, it has end notes in the back for an even more clear writing. And the best part is that both parts are in the book, and it is printed exactly like its first publication. There are no altercations and no editing: the book is printed exactly as Alcott wanted it to be. I highly recommend the Penguin Classics edition.
