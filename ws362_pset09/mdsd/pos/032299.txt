A perfec book for residents, is mostly treatment oriented and the Tx part is very practical, dx is oki howevere is very useful. by use of this book you can address your patient's problem very well than I can't say that there is any better source (I compaired this book with Merck manuel, Ferri, Current medical dx/Tx and manual of ambulatory medicine)
