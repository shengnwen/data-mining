ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING is a solid pep talk.  Keith Harrell gives great advice in an enthusiastic manner.  The book is rich with examples from the authors personal experience and those of his friends and associates.  It certainly does the trick in inspiring the reader, however the material is primarily a rehash of material found in other books.  If it is a new or novel approach to life changing steps that you're looking for you won't find it here, however if you are looking for a nice spark to jump start your personal goals then ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING is a solid success.
