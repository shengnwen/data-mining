I found this book in a second hand bookstore without knowing anything about Barry Lopez and passed it over twice before buying it on the hint of finding something of meaning. Each story is a wonderful capsule of  situation and mood and mystery leaving the reader with their own deep  reflections on existence and being. It is the kind of writing that makes  writers want to write. Deeply personal, but intellectually universal
