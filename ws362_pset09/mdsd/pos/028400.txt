I recently read Nick Jans Grizzly Maze with both wonder and bewilderment. The story of Timothy Treadwell and his untimely demise struck a chord with me as I'm sure it has done with other people, in a macabre sort of way that is. We are endlessley fascinated by people who against all common sense  put themselves in situations where death is imminent if not predictable. I cannot help but recognize the paralel between Treadwell and Alex MCcandless; who died of starvation in the Alaskan wilderness after ignoring basic tenets of survival even a boyscout would have known and whose plight was documented by Jon Krakeur in Into The Wild. The sad part about these individuals is that thier stories will be at best a cautionary tale and at worst an amusing anecdote.
