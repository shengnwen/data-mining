Amy Tan creates a small short plot that takes up about 10-20 pages.  The rest of the book is getting the reader very intimate with the characters and the situation of adapting to American life.  

The characters of this book are real.  The situations are also real.  Anyone close to an Asian-American can attest to these types of stories.  Tan does a great job of showing how the children grow up American and are unable/unwilling to relate to their parents.  Teenage rebellion takes on new meaning when you are also rebelling against your parents culture.    Tan does not paint china with elaborate imagery, but paints it in the readers mind with characters and actions that are foreign to western minds.  The story is told in a non-linear method that adds to this foreign feel.  

I would recommend this book to everyone.  There is very little suggestive or violent content.  Amy Tan deserves the praise that she has received for this book
