Jayne Ann Krentz is one of the best writers of our time. Her stories are fantastic and hard to put away. I have read everything that she has written and I still loof for any new ones. I loved this book. The characters were believable and strong. The settings were so incredibly written that I could almost picture myself there. I recommend this book and any other that she has written
