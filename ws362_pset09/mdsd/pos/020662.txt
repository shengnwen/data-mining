My graduate degree is in gifted education, and my son will be 2 in a few months.  I bought this book to prepare for and head off toddler conflicts.  While there are plenty of examples to illustrate the steps, and the steps are presented in logical, simple sequences, the text lacks the personality and humor that would make it enjoyable to read.  My son is still a bit too young for this, but my experience in the classroom suggests these strategies would be helpful with all kinds of personalities.  Still, I wish the writing were more engaging
