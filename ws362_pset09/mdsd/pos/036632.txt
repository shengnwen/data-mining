This book somewhat builds on the anthropic principle, the idea that our planet is finely tuned for life. It follows the long-out of print and highly readable contribution by Augros and Stanciu, The New Story of Science. The authors search the world for evidences of not simply design, but genius, and examine human genius to see what it might look like. Along the way they not only ruminate over a myriad dazzling ideas and observations, but also bring a much-needed cooling down to the pitched debate over intelligent design.

The surprise is how well-written the book is. Any reader dipping into lay-level science tomes notices at once that it's going to be rough going. This book, however, is a joy to read, and the authors take their place with other lively and intriguing science authors like Michael Berlinski, Heinz Pagels, Rudy Rucker and Nigel Calder
