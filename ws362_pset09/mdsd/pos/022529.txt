As a sub-genre of science fiction, alternative history looks at what might have been rather than what might be.  As Harry Turtledove points out in the introduction of this book, it is a genre that can trace its origins as far back as the Roman historian Livy, but it is only in the past few decades that it has come into its own, with variations ranging from straightforward "what if" stories to ones where time travelers create (or are transported to) alternate futures through their intervention.

Many readers familiar with alternative history tales might quibble (as some have in the other reviews) with some of the selections that Turtledove and Martin Greenberg made for this collection.  Regardless, this book offers a good sampling of tales, ranging from an alternative account of the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (Kim Stanley Robinson's "Lucky Strike") to what might be considered the first cyberpunk alternative history story (Bruce Stirling and Lewis Shiner's "Mozart in Mirrorshades").  What makes this collection worth owning, though, is Ward Moore's classic novella "Bring the Jubilee", one of the first (and possibly still the best) tales based on a Southern victory in the Civil War.  Moore's story alone makes this book a must-have for any fan of alternative history, and a good read for anyone who enjoys science fiction
