Alfred P. Sloan's account of his time with General Motors is a &quot;just the facts, ma'am&quot; telling of how the world's largest manufacturing concern teetered, tottered, and eventually overcame it's problems to become the symbol of American Industrialism that it is today. It's not a fast-paced nor exciting read but it is splendidly written and full of information that could only come from who was arguably the best leader of General Motors
