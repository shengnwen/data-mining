Melville's short novel, Billy Budd, relates the late eighteenth century story  of a  naive, innocent, young sailor, who is hated by John Claggart, the ship's master-at-arms. Good versus evil, the individual versus society, absolute law versus mercy are all themes in the novel.  Billy Budd contains many Christian allusions, and some commentators have suggested the novel is a Christian allegory that depicts the sacrifice of an innocent man.  The narrator repeatedly draws comparisons between Billy Budd and Christ and Claggart and Satan.  Although the reader must be willing to wade through many unfamiliar allusions and difficult vocabulary, the novel has a simple, but gripping plot line with  universal themes
