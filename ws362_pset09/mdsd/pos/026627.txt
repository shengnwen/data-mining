While the pictures are terrible, the information is provided in a very straight-forward manner, with good, but not overly romantic descriptions of the various roses.  I'm a newcomer to roses, and I've been frustrated by the tendency of most writers to describe every rose in very general terms.  I've grown weary of reading:  "One of the best of it's class."  Allen does none of this; moreover, she is up front about what probably won't work well.  Bourbons, she says, are likely to ball and be a disappointment in the rainy parts of the PNW.  Now, for someone like me, just getting started, that's very useful information I have not seen elsewhere.

I'm withholding one star because of the pictures.  It's just a guess, but I think the printer, not the photographer is to blame for the poor qualit
