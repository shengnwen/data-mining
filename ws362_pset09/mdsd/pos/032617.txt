Using the Iwo Jima memorial image to depict New Republic troops raising a banner on Coruscant was...um...interesting. But I was absolutely floored to discover that Britney Spears was a Jedi Knight (page 34).

I did however enjoy and appreciate the book's coverage of all the myriad sources; even the computer games and old Marvel comic books. I remember reading once that Lucas wanted Star Wars licensed fiction to differ from Star Trek in that everything would be tied together and cross referenced, and it looks like they have managed to hold up to that challenge
