Schivelbusch's Tastes of Paradise provides a refreshingly light-hearted,  yet engaging glimpse at some of the substances which, through  our  stomachs, lungs, and palates, have played a not insignificant role in  personal and cultural interactions of European civilizations.   Concentrating primarily on western societies between the sixteenth and  nineteenth centuries, Schivelbusch devotes over 50 pages to each of the  subjects of coffee, tobacco, and alcohol; he also includes ample discussion  of the historical role of chocolate, spices, and nineteenth-century  opiates.  I read this book as part of a college-level World History class  (middle ages- present) and found it to be an enjoyable and worthwhile  complement to novels, primary sources, and textbook readings we studied.   Spread out in small doses over the course of the semester, it provided an  unusual vantage point from which major themes such as Industrialism,  Christianity, Romanticism, and social class structures could be more  readily understood.  Over 100 black-and-white reproductions of period art  enhance Schivelbusch's lively discussion of the material.  Without  suggesting that these substances played an unrealistically inflated role in  history, Schivelbusch offers a highly accessible discussion equally  suitable for the student or casual reader
