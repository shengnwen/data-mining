Fabulous is the word! I think I look at this book at least 10 times, and everytime brought me something I didn't see the previous times, because my eyes weren't wide enough to see all the details! If you loved, I mean really love country, you will love this book. It will become a good reference for good ideas for your kitchen.
I think it is one of my favorite book in my whole collection of books! Give me some more like this one and I will surely buy them!
