I'm not a professional presenter, but as a manager I'm constantly faced with this challenge. The book is the first one I purchase on the subject and I'm quite pleased with what I red. His tips are well presented and structured with useful real world examples. The reading is easy, logical and builds up. Overall I definitely think is worth the money. Again, it may not be material for a professional, but if you want to improve your daily presentations (very interesting point of view that this book introduces) and sail a little easier in life, definitely worth your money.

As daily presentation he points out that every time we have an important speech (and for him this may be you daily review with your peers, boss, staff, or a chat with your neighbors, wife, etc) if you spend a little time preparing for this you can gain tremendously. It makes sense, and is actually very wise. Something we take for granted and pay very little attention. I've already started to "prepare" for phone calls with my boss and staff. Runs much easier and I'm gaining trust from my staff and growing under my boss's eyes.
