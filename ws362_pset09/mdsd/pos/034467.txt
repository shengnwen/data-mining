Fast-paced and a fun read.  All of the usual cyberpunk elements are there, with the addition of some complicated socialist politics.  Long on action, short on characterization.  Several different cultures that aren't explored in depth.  Major historic events, any one of which would probably be a book in itself, that seem more like backdrop than real things happening to large numbers of people.  (A major change in America happens just like that.)  Like a lot of cyberpunk, the treatment of computers and AI is a bit too magical for my taste.  But certainly good enough for an action movie - err, book
