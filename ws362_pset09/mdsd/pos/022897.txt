I have tried four of the recipes from this book and have enjoyed them all.  The ingredients are common or easy to find, and you don't need any special appliances besides a toaster oven.  Great for one or two person meals.  For groups of people, the appetiser section has good ideas, so you can cook the meal in your main oven and heat appetisers in the toaster oven.  Most recipes can be put together and cooked in under an hour
