Judy Jance was my neighbor in Seattle when she wrote her first book.  I've read everyone of her books and they are great.Her books are easy to read- and fun mysteries...The Beaumont Mysteries, which take place in Seattle are among my favorites. She also writes a Joanna Brady series (A female Sheriff in Arizona) and now that I live in Arizona, I really enjoy those.
