My son and I first came across this book at the library when he was 2. He loved it! Then we didn't read it for over a year and recently came across it again, he is now 4. We read it every night. He repeats all the bunny sounds and what Mr. McGreely says. He asks lots of questions about what is going on in the pictures. This is a great book with fun repetitive phrases that kids latch onto.
