This is my third Jodi Picoult book, the first was "Plain Truth" which I found completely amazing and engrossing. It's difficult for me to explain exactly why I love this author so much - because it's sometimes an inner battle to even read her stories, because the topics are often painful or disturbing.  But that's what makes her so good - and although I am admittedly an "escapist" reader who usually reads just for entertainment - reading this was still pure pleasure.  A few other reviewers complained about implausibility in this story; I enjoyed the presentation of characters who were very diverse and accomplished, yet still flawed in such basic ways. I also enjoyed the method she uses in this story, the piecing together of the character's past in flashbacks.  Good imagery, interesting characters, a great ending.  Definitely worth reading, in my opinion
