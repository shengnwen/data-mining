years ago, on NPR i believe, i heard someone put this book down as an exception to vonnegut's otherwise fine books. I felt stupid hearing that, because i always thought this was my 2nd favorite vonnegut book (after slaugherhouse-five). so I went back and read it again, and I WAS RIGHT; this is my 2nd favorite vonnegut book. and this is a very funny book, if you have a mind tuned to the finer, darker, dryer side of humor, that is. people without a very keen sense of humor will probably not get it, it is above them. or rather their brains will not tune in the frequency on which this kind of humour rides. anyway, this is a great book, which needs no synopsis rehash here from me. if you have a discriminating sense of humor & a weariness with the way people are handling this earth, then this is a must for your soul.
