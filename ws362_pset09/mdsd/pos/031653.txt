The beast! The beast! I read the book.
Do the same, take a look.

 I read the book for kids, grades K-3.
 &quot;Read it again,&quot; they beg and plea.
 
 The pictures are beautiful, bold and bright.
 It adds to the story, charm and delight.
 
 The beast! The beast! I read the book.
 Do the same, take a look
