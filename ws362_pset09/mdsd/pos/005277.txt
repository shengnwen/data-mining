While this was a good book, I was slightly dissappointed with it. There is alot happening, which is good in the sense that you won't be bored, but bad in the sense that it is very easy to lose track of characters. I enjoyed the book overall, but I must say that the ending was a bit to neat for my taste. Murders from two countries, two states, and Tempe manages to be present at the unveiling of all of them? And this is all tied to a case that Tempe is working on from roughy 100 years ago? A good book, has some flaws, but still overall a good read
