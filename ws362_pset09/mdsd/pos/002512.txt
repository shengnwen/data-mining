If you're a beginner, beware: the Bible won't walk you through some of the basic stuff you want to know.  The basic samples, etc., are actually pretty advanced. I still give this book a high rating since it contains more detail--and is more up to date--than the other five I've bought.   If you are developing your first Palm OS app, make sure you have this--but you should expect to create your own sample app using the book's general priniciples first
