This is a terrific book about two children growing up.  It has a different subject in every chapter, so it doesn't get boring.  Mitch, a boy, has a sister named Amy, and they have fun, friends, foes, and many problems in  school, at home, or playing outside.  You'll probably like other books by  Beverly Cleary if you liked this.  In my opinion, this is one of the best  books that I've read
