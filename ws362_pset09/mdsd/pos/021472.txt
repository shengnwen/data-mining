I just finished reading "The active side of infinity" for what might be the 12th time and quite simply it is every bit as riveting as the first time I read it.
The concepts in this book e.g. recapitulation,inner silence and the foriegn installation etc resonate at a very deep and abstract level which continues no matter how many times I read it open up new views from within me.
I have found that piecing together Carlos Castaneda's material and insight difficult at times but recently I read "The Art Of Stalking Parallel perception" by Lujan Matus which seems to effortlessly expand and fill in area's of Castaneda's material not to rate one over the other ,but I would strongly reccomend reading and intergrating the Useful and purposeful information from "The Active Side Of Infinity" with "The Art Of Stalking Parallel Perception"
