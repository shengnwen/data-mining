In this collection of 22 short stories and vignettes, Joanne Harris gives us insights into some strange stories and some strange people.  Not all are strange, but those that aren't are at least out of the ordinary.  Most will not give you nightmares or make the reader uneasy.  Well, except . . .

"Waiting for Gandalf" may be a bit predictable, but maybe that's the problem.  In "Fish" it seems like the newly married couple are getting what they deserve.  The characters in "The Little Mermaid" are more than bizarre, but it's easy to be sympathetic to some.  The most positive story is "Faith and Hope Go Shopping," whose elderly characters are delightful.

This collection is a quick read and very different from the usual run of short stories.  Harris has a talent for making the bizarre seem almost ordinary
