This little book is packed with information about America's tilt to the left which has led us off course and is jeopardizing our future. I learned so much about how Washington really works and it was not very encouraging. You will be astounded at how our tax money is being spent. You will be dismayed at how our national unity is being eroded.  You will be angered at how politicians sell out our military for personal gain. You will be sickened at how American citizenship is being devalued and how even illegal aliens are voting in our elections.   

The only way we are going to retain our position of strength in the world is if citizens get involved and demand change in Washington.  This book is a call to action for Americans who love their country.  Legislators must be held accountable for the mess we are  in and we must make them understand that we will no longer tolerate the back room deals, the favors to the special interests, the pork barrel spending, the namby pamby immigration policies and citizenship requirements.  If Americans continue to be apathetic, things will go on as usual in Washington and the people will be the losers. Every American should read this book and then make their voices heard.
