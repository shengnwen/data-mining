Rollo May was personally very familiar with the creative process: he was not only a pioneering psychotherapist, philosopher, prolific and poetic  author, and sought after teacher and lecturer, but also a gifted  watercolorist with great appreciation for art and music. So, in these  hundred-or-so pithy and entertaining pages, he shares with readers some  core truths about creativity and its psychology. Courage, as the book's apt  title implies, is at the very heart of creativity, since to be creative  requires us to risk seeing reality anew, and to try (typically not wholly  successfully) to express our experiences in creative work, despite the  anxiety such soul-searching and self-revealing endeavors inevitably  engender. Creativity always requires taking a chance on one's self--  meeting one's unconscious, or shadow, or what May called the daimonic--and  moving ahead despite self-doubts, discouragement and anxiety. Courage, as  May makes clear, is not the absence of insecurity, fear, anxiety or  despair, but resides in the decision to move through these feelings as  constructively or creatively as possible. For anyone struggling with the  creative process, this classic meditation on creativity can provide welcome  encouragement
