If you are just getting into digital photography or are at the intermediate stage this book is for you. It is probably the most complete book on digital photography that I have seen. It has 698 pages of valuable information that is sure to aid you in becoming a more knowledgeable and better digital phothgrapher. It begins with "Why Digital" and from there covers everything imaginable dealing with digital photography. If you use "Photoshop", you will be pleased by the amount of detail that has been given to users of this very capable program. The book does not cover everything that can be done with this wonderful program but it does provide enough detail to get you well on your way. This book was published in 2004 and is a little behind on some of it's information. For instance, it referances Photoshop 7 and CS while CS3 is just about to be released. I would still highly recommend this book. It is a little pricy but I believe it is well worth the price
