I'm the type of person who when I learn about things around me, I see them differently ever after that and they become part of me.

It was touted as an innocent &quot;soft&quot; drink.  In 1903 the Coca Cola company (without announcement) removed all traces of cocaine. This is one of those books which increases your awareness of the world around you
