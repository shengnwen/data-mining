I found "Tactical Shotgun" to be a useful review of material that any responsible shotgun owner should know anyway.  From gun selection to ballistics to a range of techniques, everyone should be able to find something useful here.  Even if you're not into the "tactica" side, if you own a shotgun the sections on marksmanship and reloading are worth the price of the book.

Say what you will about Mr Suarez as a person, he definitely has the technical knowledge and real-world experience to teach about firearms
