If you are new to Flash this book is an excellent choice.  As the title should suggest this is not a definitive guide, but rather it is a series of lessons geared towards getting you going with Flash.  I went through the lessons in this book and was able to quickly grasp the general concepts and abilities of the program.  When I was done I had more than enough knowledge to start planning my first flash documents.  As other readers have mentioned this book alone does not cover every Flash feature in depth so you will probably want a book like "Flash MX Bible" by Richard Reinhardt as a reference as well (a great reference book, but not great for learning from). Flash MX HOT is put together in sensible manor, has well-organized lessons, and covers the important bases for those new to the program
