Good examples.  Fairly comprehensive.  Good discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of forming a California corporation.  The Corporate Tax section has some good pointers.  Good writing style! It flows.  But the  diskette has only a fraction of the business and corporation related forms  compared to &quot;Small Busines Kit for Dummies&quot;.  Overall, I  recommend this book for a new commer.  Well worth the money
