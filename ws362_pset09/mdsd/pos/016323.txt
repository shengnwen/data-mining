I remembered reading a book I found in the back of the library about Unicorns when I was in middle school. And after reading this book, I knew that was it. For nostalgia, I thought the book was good. However the book is not written very well. Perhaps good enough for the middle school and under student but the book is dry at parts, has poor transitions, and leaves something to be desired. But that aside, it's a interesting idea and Unicorn lovers will probably enjoy this story
