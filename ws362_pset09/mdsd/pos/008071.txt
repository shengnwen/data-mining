With every turn of the page, my son laughed. This book was great. I have a paperback from Scholastic magazine, but I feel the hardcover book is well worth the price as the naughty monkeys get into all sorts of trouble. Several of the naughty monkeys do things that my son has gotten into trouble for, like cutting his hair and drawing on the walls. Great for letter recognition, and beginning letter sound. Each monkey has a name that begins with the letter sound and each monkey gets into trouble also reinforcing the letter sound. My son likes all the naughty monkeys, but one of his favorites is Robin. "Naughty little Monkey, Tracking up the rug. Her feet are very muddy from some holes that she has dug." Robin is carrying in a shovel full of dirt and you can see out the open door that she has dug holes in the yard and she has muddy foot prints all over. Very funny and very good art work.
