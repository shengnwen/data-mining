First of all, I'd like to share a few comments about the previous reviews. Although I agree this book is really geared towards the rock/pop scene, I do believe the bias is justified. Even today, classical and jazz recording techniques don't really employ the more radical innovations in production  approach generated by the demands of rock/pop projects. Let's remember that  multitrack classical recordings are a relatively new thing (The Zappa LSO  recordings in the 80s are a fine example), and moreover, the role of the  record producer is not so proeminent in such enterprises. Also, another  complain points to the greater coverage of the UK scene. The book deals  with the early days of multitrack recordings (Les Paul), then moves on to  Phil Spector's 'wall of sound', Motown, Muscle Shoals and stops at Brian  Wilson's efforts. Of course it's an incomplete US panorama, but then again  the book does justice to important (and sometimes overlooked) names of the  trade, like Joe Meek, Gus Dudgeon, Tony Visconti and David Hentschel. The  idea of centering the chapters around a particular studio is nothing short  of brilliant, giving the author the opportunity to comment on the evolution  of recording technology and techniques, generated by the demands of their  particular clients. Another fine addition to this book (in comparision to  Buskin's book 'Inside Tracks') is the abundance of historic photographs and  the presence of 'real-life' cases, where a particular producer shows the  approach he used to achieve a particular result. Add a wealth of anecdotes  and behind-the-scenes stuff aplenty and you get a sure winner
