I've only watched the show "Desperate Housewives," a handful of times in the couple of years its been on tv.  As I read this book, I found my mind comparing what I was reading to what I had seen on those few times I did chose to tune into that particular tv show.  The story sort of has that feel to it.

The story is about Paige Atwell, our soccer mom.  Paige lives in a suburb of Denver, with her husband and her two kids.  Paige is content with things in her world, until one day, her friend Karen confides that she is having a passionate affair with a Spanish model from her art class.  This news sends Paige's mind reeling, as she comes to the conclusion that her life is too plain and simple.

Paige begins to obsess over this reveleation, wondering if maybe she needs to commit adultery to spice up her own life and happiness level.  Soon after, Karen is found dead in her garage, suffering from a head wound suffered during and apparent accidental fall.

Paige doesn't buy the fell down and conked her head theory, knowing the secrets about Karen's life that she knows.  What ensues is Paige's desperate attempt to solve the murder of her friend, get her own life back on track, and keep her sanity.

The story is cute..several times I actually laughed out loud as I was reading.  It reads very quickly and keeps the reader pretty engaged throughout.  This would be an excellent book to take on vacation with you, or just to curl up on the couch with one snowy afternoon.  You'll laugh and you'll shake your head just like I did at Paige's antics.
Overall, a decent read.
