This book is the classic in practical heat transfer design.  The first few chapters cover theory, while the remainder of the book is devoted to specific design problems...accompanied by fully detailed examples.  Some readers may argue that it is too detailed (in today's age of computer simulators), however, stepping through details helps the designer gain an intuitive understanding of heat transfer design considerations.  From single component to multiple component heat transfer with phase change (including accounting for the presence of non-condensibles), it's covered, though dated in its approach (the book was first published in 1950).  In summary, if you are looking for a book that bridges the gap between theory and actual operation, look no further
