I myself am just starting to study South African history and I would certainly recommend this book. It is very readable and full of useful information. It focuses less on the actions of famous individuals and concentrates on the major movements and trends. While I was not used to historical writing that contained so little biographical information, the book is still very thorough. This book is a great starting point for students and scholars
