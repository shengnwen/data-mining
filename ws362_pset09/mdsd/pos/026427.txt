As someone familiar with Russian history, I enjoyed this book.  Among others, it debunks the myth that Stalin was weak and out of touch at the time of his death.  The fact is he was clearly in control up until the time he died.  Reading this book also raises more questions than it seems to answer.  For example, how does this plot fuse with his foreign policy?  The military?  Was this strictly an internal affair or actually a prelude to Nuclear War with the United States?   Although beyond the scope of this book, the reader was left wondering how Khruschev, Beria, Malenkov, et al worked out  power arrangements after Stalin's death.  We know, of course, that Beria was shot in December 1953; but what formed the BASIS for each person's power in what was clearly a lawless state
