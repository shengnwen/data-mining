Alex McKnight carries many burdens from his past, and more guilt than most of us can imagine.  A STOLEN SEASON does nothing to ease those burdens or lighten that load.  McKnight attracts unpleasantness like a country road is a skunk magnet.  One wonders if moving to Hell, Michigan would turn his life around, since living in Paradise seems to bring McKnight just as much pain as pleasure.

A STOLEN SEASON is, in terms of plot, about smuggling.  Guns and drugs, to be specific.  It's also about McKnight coming to terms with how much he cares for Valerie, and his friends in Paradise.  All these relationships will be tested yet again.  

Hamilton is a writer who just keeps getting better.  McKnight changes in each book, and those changes are true to the character.  Hamilton's descriptions of northern Michigan are true, in the way that descriptions of a loved one are true: the bias is evident in the way the flaws are handled.
