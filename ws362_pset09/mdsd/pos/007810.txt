There is a lot of good information in this book for the experienced programmer who is new to Java.  I just moved to a new team that is doing Java development although I come from a C++ background.  This book is especially helpful to people coming from a C++ background because it calls out places where the languages differ.  In the early chapters, you could skim the topics and read just these to get up to speed.  However, it also has the details for people with other backgrounds such as Visual Basic or COBOL.  The first six chapters deal with the fundamentals of the language.  However, chapters 7-10 deal with Swing and Applets.  I do not consider either of these to be truly fundamentals, and the examples in chapters 11-13 are cluttered by Swing.  I would prefer that these topics have separate treatment in Volume II.  It is also odd that JAR files and Properties are buried at the end of chapter 10 (Applets).  However, these are minor complaints on an overall solid introduction to the Java programming language.  If you find yourself at the point of making the switch to Java, I think this is the best book available
