What a mixed bag this book was. it was typical Left Behind fare: 400 pages of theorizing, agonizing, and evil antichrist mischief in the face of God's chosen people; but still, things are slow in the LB universe at this point, so while it is entertaining, nothing really of note happens in this book. Nothing concrete, anyway. This is the book, though, where a LOT of things get rolling, though. 

Thumbs up for Apollyon
