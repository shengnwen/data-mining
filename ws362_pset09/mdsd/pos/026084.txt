The Green Mile is the first Stephen King work I have read and like an illicit drug I'm hooked on the first hit. I'd heard King was a good novelist before but I was faced a serious dilemna over the fact that I would've acquired insomnia if I had read any of his more morbid tales. Still filled with the supernatural but not so much the macabre elements of Stephen King, The Green Mile was my compromise and an excellent compromise at that.

Mainly set in 1932 at Cold Mountain penitentiary's death row the story is about a man who is sentenced to death for the rape and murder of two young girls. But as the head prison guard, Paul Edgecombe, soon finds out his newest prisoner is much more than a six foot eight black convict who can hardly string together a sentence. So much more that Edgecombe is soon convinced that John Coffey (like the drink, only not spelled the same way) is innocent of the horrible crime he is accused of commiting.

King spins his tragic tale with vivid imagery, powerful metaphors and suspenseful foreshadowing provoking not only sadness but also equally strong feelings of anger. He builds the tension gradually and this may turn off some readers but this same technique heightens the enjoyment of the action near the end of the story.  

Ultimatley, The Green Mile while slow paced, is a heart rending story of an amazing man with an even more amazing gift and will always be a timeless literature classic
