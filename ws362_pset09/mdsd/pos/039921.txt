I was very glad to recieve this book. As a fan of Timm's artwork more than the comics themselves, i was very interrested in his history in the industry and his journey from Filmation to the Batman series'. It is a good read with lots of images and characters, storyboard images and a selection of full colour pages of his art work....although i must admit i would ofloved some more...but thats just me. Its a great book in the series of Modern Masters of a really cool stylistic artist
