Despite the authors' distance from Hollywood and lack of produced experience as screenwriters, they've done a fabulous job--partly because of the excellent rubrics of the SquareOne Writers Guide series--of putting together a solid overview of what's involved in making a screenplay sale. The book contains invaluable sidebars--from sample collaboration agreement to sample query letters--that alone makes it worth the cover price. The systematic approach to marketing, glossary of industry terms, along with advice on containing your ego and controlling your emotions-all add up to making this a must in the Hollywood storyteller's library.
