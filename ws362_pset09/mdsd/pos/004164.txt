This book is a lovely mix of Time Travel Sci-fi, Romance, and story-telling, in the same class as Audrey Niffenegger's "Time Traveller's Wife."

Unlike some of Heinlein's other stories, which require knowledge of other Heinlein books to be fully appreciated, this book stands on its own.

Unlike Niffenegger's novel, this one has a Classical ending -- The Good Ones win, Bad Ones Lose. So if you dislike such kitchy endings, this book might not be for you
