Though Jeeves is the most famous of Wodehouse characters, the character I love the most is Lord Emsworth. This poor earl, when all he needs is some peace and some time with his precious pig, &quot;the empress of  blandings&quot;, is always dragged into family affairs, which are of no  interest to him by his ever dominant &quot;sisters&quot;. This book has one  of the best stories about Blandings Castle, &quot;Crime wave at  Blandings&quot;. You will split your sides laughing with this story. All  the other stories are equally good and &quot;The Efficient Baxter&quot;,  secretary to Lord Emsworth makes a comeback here. This book is an absolute  must to any Wodehouse fan and absolutely the most recommended book for  readers new to Wodehouse. This was the first book I read of Wodehouse and I  read it 20 times before putting it aside. A book definitely worth  collecting
