Always getting made fun of at school, never having any friends and noone ever listening to you. Cameron 17 and Leon 18 were both struggling through their high school and family lives. Cameron's parents were both very wealthy and never had really paid attention to him. Leon who's life was the total opposite had a family that was poor and was also never around. Leon and Cameron both reffered themselves to the darkside, because they both wore black clothes and chains. They both never got along with anybody, they just stayed in their own lives. Since they never had any real frends they became dinkers and smokers. They did alot of bad things, but this was the fault of bad judgement from their peers and adult staff at their school. Cameron and Leon were both made fun of each day by people who thought they were bigger then them. Cameron had gone to an adult, but that didn't do anything, that only made things worse.While Cameron was trying to make things better for his friend and himself, Leon had another idea. Actually more of a prank that he was going to do at school. Leon told Cameron that he wanted to go and write in the main hall "Stop the violence", in red, but not with paint but with his own Blood.Cameron showed up the day Leon wanted to do the prank. Leon then pulled out a gun and all shot lose. That day ended with anger and regretment
