This book is a goldmine of information!  Not only does it show how to cut costs when it comes to the big day, it also reveals many scams targeted at brides, and how to avoid a wedding disaster.  I had no idea about the "bridal mark-up" until I read this book, and it really sheds light on how so many brides are taken advantage of.  I recommend this book to anyone looking to save money, as well as to have a better knowledge on what goes on behind the scenes with many "professional" wedding vendors
