Whenever I think of Ms Hurston, I smile while I am sad. Her life story is  a joyous song and while still a judgement on society and an insight on  Black America at that time. she was extremely funny and apparently a very  kind woman. She was also a wonderful writer and talented one. Her prose was  a gift that few can duplicate. If you are into women writers, you must  include all her books. If you want to write, you must study her style. You  will not be able to put it down and will be upset when you finish because  you want there to be more beyond the last page
