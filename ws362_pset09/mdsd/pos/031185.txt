I have never been too crazy about or never been good at economics, but after reading this book, I feel I understand the real-world economics better.  For a novice like me, it is relatively easy to follow the contents because it's full of examples from real business world. I assume this book will be satisfactory to more &quot;academic&quot; readers too because the book still doesn't fail to cover real economic materials like graphs and theories
