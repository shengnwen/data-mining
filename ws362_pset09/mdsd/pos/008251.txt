Edited by the working-class lesbian feminist author and activist, Michelle Tea, "Without a Net" powerfully documents the diverse lives of women living in poverty. While this inclusive multi-narrative text dramatically testifies to the strength of low-income women in the United States, it fails, however, to provide any real collective strategy for female resistance to capitalist exploitation. Nevertheless, I applaud this book for holding the mainstream feminist movement accountable for its classism and insisting, once-and-for-all, that economic justice is integral to women's liberation.
