I think this is an excellent book, and well worth a read for anyone with more than a passing interest in international relations. Cederman presents one of the first studies to explicity apply complexity theory to problems of IR, and it is a remarkable effort - perhaps a good omen of things to come. The computer models he develops aren't games, but analytic tools designed to address two of the thorniest problems in IR: the emergence of states and the role of nationalism. Regarding the former, this is the first study of state emergence that I have read with any empirical thrust or explanatory heft. In particular, I think his incorporation of 'two-level action' (not what it sounds like) into his model is fascinating, and a real asset to 'dissident' scholars looking for ways to challenge the international-domestic dichotomy in the discipline. His models of nationalism are also interesting, but not nearly as central and challenging to the sacred tenets of international relations.

The main drawback of the book is that it is so obviously adapted from a dissertation - and thus bound to all the conventions that fact implies. Someone without a lot of background in IR theory (I'm a grad student) might not appreciate it as much as I do; it's not intended for general audience, I think. Still, if you're a grad student in the discipline, or even an undergrad with a basic IR course completed, this book should be interesting and useful
