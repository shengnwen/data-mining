In this book we are given a hands on approach to a type of Psychology called Operant Conditioning.  Another, simpler way to think of this is Training.  Barbara takes complex concepts of psychology like behavior analysis and puts them into terms that anyone can understand. She gives us an overview of the concepts we are going to need for tools.

We are presented with several of the most common behavioral "scenarios" that parrot owners and their birds are likely to encounter.  Barbara takes each of these scenarios and breaks them down into the steps you'll need to take to teach the behavior you need (or "un-teach" as the case may be - your mileage may vary!).

The best part of Barbara's methods is that they are all based on Positive Reinforcement and at no time will your bird need to feel stressed or afraid.  In fact you can use the tools you take away from this book to help fearful birds become more confident.

If you are thinking of buying this book I also urge you to get Barbara's other book "The Parrot Problem Solver."  With the tools you can get from trying the techniques in these two books you're on your way towards dealing with behavioral problems you thought might make you give up your bird to a rescue.
