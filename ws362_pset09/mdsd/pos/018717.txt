This is an excellent, well-written book that revives the history of Josiah Harlan, the first American to visit Afghanistan. He's been overlooked by most writers covering that area and that period, so this book is long overdue. I have read several books that retells the history of the British invasion of Afghanistan, and its bloody aftermath, but not one of them mentioned Harlan. This is a great hole in that area's history, and I am very happy that Mr. Harlan has now gotten the recognition he so richly deserves, for he accomplished many things which were not done by other Westerners with greater historical reputations. This is a book well worth buying and reading!
