Although Abide With Me isn't as juicy as his rest it still captures that &quot;need to read&quot; in you. You can start to see how Yancey Braxton (soon to be Yancey B.) grew her horns. When I finished reading this book, I kinda wanted Harris to elaborate on the whole Trent situation. But I liked how he incorporated Kyle back into the story
