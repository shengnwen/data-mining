I am a fitness and nutrition fanatic (just ask Amazon who I could singlehandedly support)!  I own 100s of nutrition and diet books, and this ranks near the top.  Why?  Well, first, this is the ONLY diet plan that I have followed that has not left me feeling deprived and hungry most of the day.  Second, I have been able to lose the weight I wanted following this plan.  Third, this plan is healthy, well-researched and does not promote the exclusion of any food type, which makes maintaining weight after weight loss extremely difficult to impossible.  And finally, the author presents her research and information in a clear-cut and easily understandable manner.

As a result, this is a plan that I will be able to follow for life, which means I may be in the minority of people who is able to maintain my weight long-term.  I can't recommend this book enough.  If I was stranded on a desert island and could only bring one of my many nutrition books with me, this would be it.  I look forward to reading Dr. Rolls' update to this book, entitled the Volumetrics Eating Plan, which was released this month
