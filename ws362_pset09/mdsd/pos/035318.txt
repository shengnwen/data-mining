A fine example of the sort of journalistic impressionism that doesn't get written any more. Just make sure you don't actually think you're getting a guide to Marxist thought or the Russian Revolution (& don't trust reviewers like the one below who can't be bothered to get one of the most important dates of the 20th century right - the revolution was one year old by 1918). This is an impressive book for its scope, as an examination of the writing of history, but certainly not as a philosophically astute account of socialism. Wilson famously detested abstract thought, & manages to bungle everything from the Hegelian dialectic to Marx's own historical materialism. (The chapter on "The Myth of the Dialectic" should be read with a salt shaker at hand.
