This book, as stated in the preface, unlike many other books on the history of the English language, tries to include nonstandard English forms as well, and the author also claims that he is not emphasizing England (as opposed to the rest of the English-speaking world) as much as is traditional. As another reviewer has pointed out, he does not succeed very well in the latter goal, but in the rest of his goals he succeeds very well.

The book is quite thick and will not read quickly, but there is a lot of interesting material in it. I'm not very fond of his organization, where he has a chapter on the standard language followed by an "interlude" on nonstandard varieties, but at least he gets to cover both that way.

I would recommend the book, but not so whole-heartedly that I'd give it a top rating
