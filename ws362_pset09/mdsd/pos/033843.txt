One of the darker books in the series but none the less its a Bujold book and that means "the best" the 4 stars is compared to her work, compared to others it would be a five since that's as far as this scale lets us go. Miles and IMPSEC part company, then when something happens to a friend on the inside, Miles goes over IMPEC's head..
