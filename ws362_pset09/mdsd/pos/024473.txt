I was a bookworm since I learned how to read books at 7. I read Vonnegut's "Breakfast of Chamopions" the first time when I was still a teen (in Polish translation) and this book was probably the most astonishing I ever read in my life. Funny (but also bitter), interesting, easy to read, even had some author pictures, sometimes strangely related to the text. But on the other hand, this book really make you think - about the world, about our civilization and where it is heading, about the people and their strange ways, about America.

When I first read the book I was still in communistic Poland, so I saw some of the problems the author was talking about as a part of the western civilization. Now after I read it again, I see so much mild critique of excesses of America's life. I live in America ~ 10 years so it is normal that for me America would be always something different than my home country or Europe. I am amazed that Vonnegut still can look at America from the position of the external observer, who still can see some absurdity in many aspects of life.

In spite of his critique of the world, country and society Vonnegut loves people, he loves them with all their weakness and defects. His books have great educational value.
