Thank goodness, this book is NOT another retelling of the Chanukah story. Instead, the author uses the menorah's lights as a metaphor. The young speaker finds lights in his own world--lamp lights, car lights, star lights--to match the number of candles in the menorah. And the illustrator has painted just the same number of cats, too, so that the pages are utterly engaging. The PW reviewer clearly doesn't realize that preschool- and young readers want something more than a factual narrative. This beautiful book underscores community and family with its rich paintings and words that stretch a young imagination. The candle lights in this story radiate far beyond the page.
