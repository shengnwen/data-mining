I bought "The First 90 days" by Michael Watkins and this book.  I found this book to be a stronger and more practical guide.  Both offered excellent guidance however Neff & Citrin produced a more interesting and readable (less text-book like) book with real life examples and a road map.  Word of warning in that the book is written for senior business management and less applicable for lower levels of management or line positions
