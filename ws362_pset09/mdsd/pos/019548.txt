A High Wind in Jamaica is unlike any book I've read before in that Richard Hughes successfully found a great plot for an adventure novel and wrote it from childrens' perspectives.  It is this unique perspective that makes the book one of kind and one that I would recommend, while at the same time creating a few problems for the reader.

Much of the story takes place in the underdeveloped heads of very young children who don't take notice of what may seem very obvious or interesting details to an adult.  Therefore, the problem lies in trying to figure out what exactly is going on in the book.  Although the children are involved in some very exciting adventures with pirates and natural disasters, they sometimes don't realize it, if at all, until long after it happened, and since you only see what the children see and understand (which may not be what is actually happening) this can prove frustrating.  In A High Wind, you are left to wonder, as a 5 year old child wonders, what in the world is going on around him.

I leave it to you, the prospective reader, to decide if you would like to experience adventure and violence through the  eyes of a child (as confused and out of focus as those eyes often are)
