I read this book cover to cover once a year or so and am always amazed at what I've missed in previous readings.  Ms. Thomas eloquently shows knitting as the skilled craft that it is.  Kudos to Dover for publishing it and its companion, Mary Thomas's Book of Knitting Patterns, at such a reasonable price.  Mary Thomas is THE Knitting Goddess
