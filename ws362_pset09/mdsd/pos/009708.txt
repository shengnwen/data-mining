In Vegas, GetTV host Felicity Charm is thrilled when she wins the "Joanie" for her selling of electronic items.  However, she has no time to bask in her glory as her California based family of nuts and con artists intercede.  Aunt Vi asks Felicity to come home to Half Moon to solve the problem of her cousin vanishing.  Although she prefers to avoid her family of rascals at all cost, Felicity is the troubleshooter so she drives across the desert.

However, Felicity's hits a car sitting on the side of the road in an isolated area.  The other driver Michael Magee insures she is okay by taking her to his nearby abode.  That night they fall into each other's arms, but not long afterward she learns his secret.  He promised his deceased best friend that he would take care of his widow and daughter who happen to be first and second cousins to his "Lissie" as he calls the woman who crashed into his heart.

Though her family comes out of You Can't Take It With You without the charm as they use and abuse the serious minded Felicity, fans will enjoy this lighthearted romp because of the two likable protagonists.  The contrast between Felicity and her family has made her feel as if she was adopted as they could never share the same DNA as she takes life seriously while they go from one caper to another.  Michael becomes the equal sign between everyone, but he has made a death bed pledge that makes it unlikely that he and his beloved will forge a permanent relationship.
