The Last of the Just is one of the most moving,powerfully written and unforgettable books I have ever read. Why more people don't know about this book is a mystery to me. It tells the story of persecution of the Jews from the middle ages to the Holocaust and of the six men who are chosen to bring justice to the world. Read this book and you will never forget it. It is a masterpiece
