Ever wonder how a magazine cover gets picked? Ever think you might like to enter the glamorous but cutthroat, fabulous but secret world of publishing?  Read--I BEG OF YOU---read Little Pink Slips, by Sally Koslow who's been there, done it and lived to tell about it in the most engrossing, funny, and accurate novel of our times. Who gets the perks of the fashion world from Chanel sales to film premieres?  Magazine editors do.  Who gets to have not-so-quiet but exquisitely romantic affairs with the art director or the publisher on the other side of the wall? Magazine editors do.  But who also feels the back-biting wrath of the competing editor who did not have the better idea, did not seduce the prominent movie star for a tell-all, and did not incur the favor of the top gun at the publication? Sometimes it's you--if you're the mag editor who missed out. Sally Koslow tells all. It's a down and dirty yet, in many ways, oddly beautiful behind-the-scenes story. Sally's a writer's writer and she can turn a lyrical phrase or make a reader's heart beat as few ex-editors-in-chief can. 
       I've read romans a clef that are true secret-tellers and some that are simply beautifully written, attention-grabbing stories: Little Pink Slips is both.  I so loved this book and I want to be best friends with its hero, Magnolia Gold, from Fargo,North Dakota who made it big in the big city and lived to tell the tale.
