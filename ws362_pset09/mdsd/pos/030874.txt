If you are looking to jump start a healthy balanced eating pattern, and you'd like the added bonus of dropping a few pounds, this is a MUST read.  I purchased the book as a "test" and wondered if it would be another crash diet scam.  I couldn't have been any more wrong. This IS NOT A TYPICAL DIET!!!  You eat, and eat and eat.  Portions allow you to not get hungry, and cravings are non-existent since you get a balance of carbs, proteins and fats. I lost 8 lbs in 6 days and feel great.  Several of my co-workers have now tried the plan as well, and have also found the same amazingly easy results. Since I am a teacher, I give this book an A+
