Albert Einstein found his place among philosophies and equations in mathematical and scientific areas he had grown up around. He hated his strict school at the gymnasium when he was young and the army when he was older. These two deep dislikes caused him to be freer in his work and mind set, and to never be brought down by structure or criticism. His imagination and pure genius made him one of the world's most impressive thinkers, ever. Einstein was the fore-runner of his new, "illogical" physics and took much of the heat, as did Galileo when he first discovered his laws. He traveled all over the world and experienced much of the times. He finally settled in America and helped the government create a bomb to stop the fighting of World War II, the atomic bomb. As a friend, Phillip Frank knew the man personally and wrote his story because of his mysterious genius and major accomplishments. Einstein's as important as Galileo, Newton, or Kepler, and his story might even be more interesting. This book was a good read and definitely a good reference for anything to do with the genius and his discoveries
