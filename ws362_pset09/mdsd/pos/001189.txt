This is an excellent resource for those who want to learn the language of the Icelanders.  I am very impressed at the tight relationship between the book and the CD's.  Lessons on the CD follow exactly those in the book.

After only using this course for a month, I already have a greater understanding of the cases of words (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) than I ever had in 3 years of studying German.  The course materials naturally flow from basic conversation (What is your name?  My name is....) into more and more complex sentences, and explain in-depth the case changes as they become relevant.

If I had one recommendation for this course, I would suggest more time within the CD lessons to repeat what has been said in Icelandic.  There is very little space given to practice saying the words on your own, and you may find you need to manually pause the CD in order to say the words.  Since the CD lessons are conversational, this can become frustrating over time
