This book contains only 50 positions and that is my only complaint with this book...well that and the price. However this is a good book if you want to test your knowledge and you may even learn a thing or two! (this more than makes up for the cost i believe). The book is full of commonly seen positions which is a great bonus. Another great thing about this book is every 100 point rating jump you gain you should be able to go through the book quicker and get more correct, then when you get a full score...you can get the original &quot;It's your move&quot; which is apparently much harder. In conclusion get this book if you want to test yourself and make sure your knowledge is up to scratch
