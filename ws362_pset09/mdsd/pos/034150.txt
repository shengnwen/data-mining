Primary focus of this book is protocols for 3G/UMTS networks. This book covers 3G concepts in some detail but pays attention mostly on network side and protocols. Which makes this book a must to have together with Kaaranen's and/or Korhonen's book. Contents is light in maths and easy to read. Very good diagrams and plain English. A concise and easy to access content makes this book very useful. Read at once and get the idea how it works. Warmly recommended
