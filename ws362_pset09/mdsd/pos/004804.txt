The rate of learning is slow enought that you won't really need to press the pause button... contrary to what the back cover says, there is a lot of repetition of the same words involved - Pimsleur calls it "saturation". But they substitute words around where possible so you don't repeat the exact same phrase more than a few times in a row. 

The first CD is very simple indeed. The whole 60 minutes is taken up with just a handful of phrases (english equivalent):

Do you speak? / do you understand? / I speak / a little / I speak a little spanish / you speak a little spanish / I don't speak / you don't speak english / no seorita / are you North American? / Yes seor / thankyou / how are you? / very good / good thanks / you speak spanish very well / good day...

That's about all the content there is on the first CD, but there are several variations of the theme -word substitution- so it is a very slow rate of learning. 

In comparison, there is ~10 times as much content on virtually any of the other spanish audio CDs I have reviewed. According to the 3 CD set "Learn in your car spanish", that product conatins 600+ words. Whereas "Pimsleur quick & simple spanish" contains only 75 words.

The good news is- I don't think I'll *ever* forget these phrases now, I believe they've been firmly etched in my brain. I.e. permanently! But I had already been exposed to these words previously, so I found it all rather boring.

At this rate, I don't think I'll learn much more new information from the remaining CDs. Thus, I can only recommend this for people that know practically no spanish to begin with. Start here and follow up with other spanish audio products.

**UPDATE** OK I am half way through now, and I realise I am enjoying this course more than the all the others I have trialled --- for the simple reason that it is INTERACTIVE. It's like having a language teacher right there. The speaker asks you to compose new sentances based on the phrases taught previously. I think it is a very effective method. 

Sure it is slow, but I think you can only learn & retain so many new words per day..... the good news is that Pimsleur makes sure they are CORE words. When I try to learn more words with other programs, I tend to forget them all too quickly. I am tempted to buy the full Pimsleur course, even though I already have 35+ hours of otehr spanish CDs to get through!! 

--- I'D GIVE IT FIVE STARS NOW ---

INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:
I was *extremely impressed* with Amazon's "Priority International Courier" shipping option. I ordered several spanish books + CDs and wanted them here so that I could start learning spanish ASAP, as my trip to Tenerife + South America is in a month's time. I placed the order on thursday night; it was well after midnight here in Australia (local time). I got both parcels on Monday afternoon! Absolutely Incredible!! I order stuff from the USA all the time, and this is definitely the speediest service I have ever encountered. Thanks Amazon!
