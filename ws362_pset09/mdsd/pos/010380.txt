This Book alone is By FAR ONE OF THE FINEST BOOKS OF IT'S KIND. Not only does it have close to about every single gun made It also gives ref. to the Recalls and the Prices of the guns in different conditions of wear. So By Far with the Military Book as well you now have waht i call the Best Refence books made any place any time. 
So YES if you need to Look up about anything and to make sure your getting a fare shake at buying a NEW or used gun this would be a fantastic Resource for you and It also provides the Phone numbers to contact the companies that make these guns so If you have any questions as I do I never hesitate to call direct and ask for a Gun smith or Product Specilist on the Manufacure of the gun, Date It was made or even the Isues you may be having with it it it has any.  and they are 95% of the time willing to tell you not just the simple answer but go into detail about the gun you have and quite often you will find out more than you could have ever dreamed of .. So YES it's the Best on the market Hads Down. And I Up Grade these books at Leat every other year Or if their is a Very large influx of new guns that have hit the market in the past year and then i will but a new one for that upcoming year to cover the guns in Question. So Spend the money and save Even more In the long Run don't cheat your self out of a Inexpensive Knock off Book that is only Fluff and Is not filled with the entire Line up made by that company Be it an Out of buisness Company or a New and up and Coming company  it has it all..
