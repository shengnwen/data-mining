This outrageously funny book gives a brief overview of the slippery slope known as theory-based art.

Wolfe basically tracks his own thoughts and comments on various art movements.  His satire is clever and downright humorous.

Do not take him to seriously, though.  He is merely a satirist, who is not trying to offer an overly grandiose philosophical attack on 20th century art movements
