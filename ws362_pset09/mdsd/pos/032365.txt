Melina and Gillian Lloyd are identical twins whom no one can tell apart.  Both live in Dallas, where Gillian is a real estate agent and Melina is a media escort.  Gillian has always wanted a child, so Melina is supportive of her when she goes to the Waters Clinic to be artificially inseminated.  That same day, Melina also talks Gillian into switching places with her escorting a NASA astronaut around town for the night.  Gillian and the astronaut, "Chief" Christopher Hart, hit it off so well, she spends several hours in his bed before retiring for the night.

Gillian apparently had some kind of stalker who disapproved of her actions, because she is found murdered in her bed, obscenities scrawled on the walls in her blood, the following morning.  The police soon follow the stalker's trail and wrap up the case, but Melina can't shake the nagging feeling that there is more to her sister's murder than meets the eye.  The feeling gets stronger when the FBI calls, and more people start winding up dead.  Chief is also in danger, due to his relationship with Gillian, so he and Melina pair up to investigate Gillian's murder.  What they find is one of the most chilling villains Brown has ever concocted, with visions of a New World Order, which include special plans for Melina.  It's almost impossible to say more without giving away important aspects of the book.  Suffice it to say, there are a lot of twists and turns before it's all said and done.

As usual, Brown has penned a page-turner.  If I have one criticism, it is that I have a little difficulty warming to her main characters.  It's not that I don't like them, I just don't feel like I really get to know them on more than a superficial level.  Other than that, however, this was a very good romantic suspense novel that was fairly light on the romance, but delved deeply into the suspense, leaving a number of surprises for the reader to discover in the last few chapters.
