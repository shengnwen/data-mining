This is the kind of book that might change one's life.  Is that not worth a few dollars?      One could call it the bible of spirituality through movement, music, beauty.  For it is a moving exploration, both personal and academic; through dance, history, archeology, ritual, music, raiment and more.  A rediscovery of ancient ways lost or pushed aside by the growth of organized, hierarchical religion.  A means to rebirth of these ways that are being revived, or were kept alive, by and for women as well as men.      One of the most amazing things to me was to find out that many modern dancers that i admired as free spirits were also deeply philosophical, and deeply committed to keeping personal spiritual expression and sharing alive.      In addition to the exploration, there are: movement experiences to try, an extensive compendium of further sources, and many colorful visuals~~~~
