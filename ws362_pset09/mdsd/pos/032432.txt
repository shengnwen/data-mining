This is a very good book to have for an engineer who deal with two-phase  flows and heat transfer, for those who design and operate nuclear reactors,  thermal power plants and other thermal management systems. It provides a  foundation, with an extensive collection of empirical formulae which could  be useful if properly applied. What feels missing in this book, - and is  general feature of BOOKS on two-phase flows and boiling - is the heavy  empiricism, the lack of a scientific concept, the absence of robust  theoretical treatment that one should possess after reading such a  comprehensive compilation. That is to say, it is good for some one who  knows the subject/field, not for teaching someone about boiling heat  transfer and two-phase flows
