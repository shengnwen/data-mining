This is a good resources for students who want to work on addtional questions. Each chapeter contains about 10 to 15 questions. Mostly, question comes in two pages. The first section of the book, 50 pages, presents only the questions. The last section shows you those  answers. Also, the question seems to be more conceptual than calculation. I think the questions are good to give you the main concept of the chapters but I wish the book should give more than 15 questions each chapter. It still have some errors and typos. For example, question 3 on page 64, I used excel function to calculate, the result differs from that of the book and, question 7 of page 65, formula has a typing error. So, I gave it four stars
