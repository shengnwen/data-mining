My daughter is not quite a year, and she laughed at the colorful pictures.

The pictures are really well done, and the story is wonderful. The chameleon is searching for permanence. He tries to stay on a leaf and remain the same color forever, but he changes with the color of the leaf in the autumn, and he goes through the dark winter.

But then he meets another chameleon!  His need for something unchanging could not be met by denying his nature and remaining the same color all the time.  Instead, his need was met by his new companion.  

This is a really good lesson. We can't be perfect. We can't have "ideal" lives. We can't remain young forever. But it's our close relationships that help us go through life. I hope my daughter finds friends who will be there through life's changing colors
