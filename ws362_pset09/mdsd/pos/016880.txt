I recently took this book along on a two-week trip to Baja.  Joe Cummings clearly has a love for the place, and provides a lot of helpful and informative information.  It's most useful in it's guides to the towns and cities, restaurant &amp; hotel recommendations etc.  We used it to  suplement another excellent Baja guide, Walt Peterson's &quot;Baja  Adventure Book&quot;. A word of caution - on at least two occasions, the  information given in this guide was incorrect - in one town the largest  supermarket wasn't even mentioned, and in Ensenada, a store we tried to  find didn't appear to exist! All in all though, a very useful guidebook,  and to be recommended
