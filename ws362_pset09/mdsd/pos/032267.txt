This book is a life saver!  It has given us practical tools to use in every-day situations with our children.  The book is organized in a clear manner.  A real-life parenting challenge is presented, followed by a suggestion to solve it showing love and giving responsibility to the child... and this is with babies!  "Magic" is not an exagerration.  It is often said that children should come with owner's manuals.  This is it!
