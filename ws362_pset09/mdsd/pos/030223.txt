Lloyd Alexander has to be one of the best fantasy authors, ever.  I have yet to read a book of his that isn't wonderful and doesn't bring up some moral or thought-provoking issue in a fun, interesting way.

"Westmark" is the first in his trilogy of the same name.  Westmark is a fast read and focuses on Theo, a printer's apprentice, who finds himself in the underground rebellion against the chief minister when his master is murdered by the chief minister's men.  With his trademark dry wit, great characterization and plot development, Alexander introduces us to several characters who will play an important rule in the future of the kingdom of Westmark.

The moral questions that Theo will struggle with throughout the series are introduced in Westmark.  Is violence ever okay?  If change is needed, what is the best way to set it in motion?  Is mercy a good thing or is it just being weak?  These are just lightly touched on, but foreshadow the questions and ideals that Theo will be facing throughout the other books.

A good introduction to the trilogy and one that could even be read as a stand-alone.  I'm eager to finish the rest of the trilogy to see how the characters grow and resolve their questions
