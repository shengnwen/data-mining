Thackeray says there is no hero in this book, and he means it. This book seems to me like a nineteenth-century version of The Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives...so if that is what you're looking for, you'll thoroughly enjoy this book; however, if you want a real love story, look into Jane Austen, for instance.

I will admit that I saw the Reese Witherspoon movie version of this book before I ever read it...and as usual, was much more impressed with the book, and more surprised than I thought I would be at how much they truly deviated from the novel with that particular movie version
