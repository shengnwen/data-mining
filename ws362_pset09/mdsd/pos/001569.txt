Double Indemnity (1938) is classic American detective fiction, among the best and most influential noir fiction of the 1930s and 40s.  Along with his The Postman Always Rings Twice, James M. Cain's Double Indemnity belongs on the short list of the best American detective stories.

Cain's prose is direct, austere, harsh, hard hitting, unforgettable realism. The persistent, hard working, independent, successful insurance salesman, Walter Huff, is amoral.  He has seen all the tricks of insurance fraud and knows that escaping justice is highly unlikely. Phyllis Nirdlinger is beautiful, seductive, and absolutely dangerous. Huff immediately recognizes her formidable attraction, clearly sees the outcome, and yet proceeds.

Cain's prose is concise, almost terse. Roughly 130 pages, Double Indemnity is one of those few books that you can, and likely will devour in a single sitting. Amoral and brutal in conception, Walter Huff's clear sighted, detailed, carefully structured murder plan is frighteningly and convincingly plausible. Phyllis - and the double indemnity - are the tantalizing rewards.

Double Indemnity was a highly successful movie in 1943 that is still just as effective and mesmerizing today.  Directed by Billy Wilder and starring Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray, and Edward G. Robinson, the film version of Double Indemnity is quite exceptional and rates five stars like the book itself.  It matters not whether you see the movie or read Cain's short novel first.
