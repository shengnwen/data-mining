What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day.   By Pearl Cleage.

As an avid reader there are times I am desperate for a book to read and yet cannot seem to find one I have not read. It was suggested by a friend that I read this book. Having never heard of the author I hesitated for a moment and then bought it. At first realizing this was a story about a woman who had Aids I wondered if I would be able to read it.

To my surprise  once I opened it and read the first chapter I was unable to put this book down. This is a first novel for this writer and I must say a literary gem. From start to finish the writing is exceptional, the characters vivid and so close you can touch them. Though there is so much sadness, death, drugs, and cruelty the author never allowed you to dwell on these facts alone.  She had you feel only the love, and hope, the goodness of some in spite of the meanness of others. The ending is uplifting, for you also close the book knowing that you have finished a novel well worth reading.

I have bought three more of Pearl Cleage's books and cannot wait to read them.
