I have been reading this book and it has been changing my life. I never really considered going out on this particular 'limb' before and I'm so grateful that this book is the first one I 
happened to come across on the topic.
Like a veil that's being lifted, E. Sue Blume's ideas and concepts are letting me understand myself better than I ever have even come close to understanding myself before.
Her particular "voice" is a gift of equal proportion. I don't 
think I could have even heard any of it without the combination of intelligence, seriousness, dignity, and real care hers carries.
