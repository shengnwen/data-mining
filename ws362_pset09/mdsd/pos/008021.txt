Imagine a world with no pain, eternal youth and endless drugs and sex without consequences. Sounds great, right? 

Now imagine giving up dignity, love, art, adventure, religion and nobility in order to be part of this world. Starting to have second thoughts?

The "Brave New World" dystopia isn't quite as bad as the one in "1984." No one is going to throw you in room 101 and torture you. They'll just keep you so doped up on soma and free love so that you forget everything that isn't superficial. It's a world that promises security, contentment, pleasure, but lacks purpose.

In my opinion, the book falls short of it's classic stature, though just barely. The religion of Henry Ford is never fully elaborated, the word "Ford" is simply substituted for "God" throughout the book. What's more, you have to get halfway through the book before you meet a character that is interesting, though this is in part to show the constrast to the  other "characters" who are a product of a superficial world.

Critics of this book say that it is a hack job on scientific progress. It's not. In fact science is not the great evil in this book, stability is. Nor is the book anti-utilitarian; it simply says that some forms of pleasure ought not to replace others.

Definately worth the read.
