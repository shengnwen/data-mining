Emma Goldman is like the black sheep of the family in a lot of regards.  America wants to turn its back and forget her contributions to our culture and society.  Many worker rights and unions owe something to Goldman.  Anarchism and Other Essays is a collection of some of her best writing.   Her insight on gender equality, workers rights and even the theatre are  appealing.  I do not agree with everything she wrote but I feel like I  gained something from allowing my mind to be challenged by her thoughts.   Read this book. Just dont let Jesse Helms know about it
