I found this book to be an amazing story of the hardships that one women went through in her young life, and then find the strength to overcome them. To be able to go through such an ordeal in ones life and then have the courage to write about shows that she's truly an amazing person. I'd recomend this book to anyone that may be experiencing the same kind of issues and use it as a tool to help themselves
