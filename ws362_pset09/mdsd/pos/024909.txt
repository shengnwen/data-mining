Although this novel lies nearly forgotten today, when it was first released in the late 19th century, its impact on society and the imagination (and expectations) of that society were so immense as to be immeasurable. This book did more than strike  a chord of hope in a population craving better times and trusting in humankind's capacity to make things right, it created a sensation. Clubs were formed in dozens of cities, which hailed Bellamy as a hero and prophet, and Looking Backward was quite simply embraced by millions as prophecy and a blueprint for what was certain to come. It all sounded so good, didn't it? The year 2000 would arrive upon a world at peace, where everyone had sufficient food, had dignity, where crime was heeled, where equality was a reality. It was, in short, both a utopia and a realization of the fantasies of Karl Marx. In fact, today this book seems both impossibly naïve and touchingly---humanistically---idealistic. Communism was tried in the decades after Bellamy's death and the 20th century result was nothing like what the 19th century Bellamy suggested it would be. Instead of equality and liberation, it brought a new species of class stratification and suffocating enslavement to nearly a quarter of the globe. Looking Backward is neither a great novel nor a bad one. In retrospect it lacks the importance which in its early years it seemed destined to have. Today Looking Backward is an interesting read, especially when the context of its creation is considered, and we with perfect hindsight can know how flawed its fantasy of an Eden-like worker's tomorrow was.
