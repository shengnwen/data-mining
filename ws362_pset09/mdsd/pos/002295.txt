We used "Italy for Dummies" for our recent trip to Italy. We had never been to Italy before and we were planning on touring without a group through Venice, Rome, Milan and Florence. "Italy for Dummies" gave us great ideas on what to see in limited periods of time. 
This book gave us hints on the best tours, how to see each city in whatever amount of time we had alloted and what not to miss.
We did their recommended tours in most of the cities.

When we left our hotel room we would tear out the section pertintent to the city we were in and carry it with us all day consulting it as needed.

If you're planning on touring Italy on your own this book is a must! from the important train information to where to pick up a local tour it was invaluable!
