I recommend this book to a person who is looking for a good book. this book is a little confusing in the begining but gets better as it progresses.  The book also has parts where it's a little boring and justs drags on about unimportant stuff. 
      This book is about a neo-nazi girl who is hospitalized after a motorcycle accident with her boyfriend. then she ends up in a jewish hospital.  When she is in the hospital she goes in and out of this seperate life that she is now living. In this "other" life she is a jew living in Germany during WWI and is taken to a series of concentration camps, jail cells, and finishes the book in a work camp. At these camps she meets a varitey of people, some that she gets along with and others not so well. But during the time she is in the ghetto of the first camp shes in she loses all of her family except for her grandmother and her brother. She eventualy loses her brother because she escpes the ghetto. And at the end Hilary finds out who's life she was living in the hospital.
           All an all its a pretty good book, you should read it
