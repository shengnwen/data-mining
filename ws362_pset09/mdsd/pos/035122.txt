We haven't completely dived into any major repairs, but have referenced this book for information about fixing the horn, fixing electrical wiring that's been noodled around with and tune-up specs, etc...  So far it has provided enough detail, that is easily understood.  It does seem to assume some prior vehicle mechanical knowledge or experience.  My only complaint has been the lack of an index....sometimes it's difficult to locate your topic.  The book is divided into 8-9 sections, each section has a table of contents....but when you're looking for something small, you have to guess which category it might fall into -- then read the table of contents to see which subheading it might be under...and if you don't see it in the tables of contents, you have to scan the sections
