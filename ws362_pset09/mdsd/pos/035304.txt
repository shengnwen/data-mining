It's important to note that recent events have added poignancy to Lessac's tribute to her home island. This charming book is a record of an island practically destroyed by a recent volcanic eruption. &quot;My Little  Island&quot; is the island of Montserrat, three-quarters of which lies  buried under layers of volcanic ash. All the colors and the activity of the  people portrayed here are fond memories. What a wonderful opportunity to  talk to children about the things they would cherish about their own homes.   And what a joyous appreciation of a lifestyle also typical of other  Leeward islands
