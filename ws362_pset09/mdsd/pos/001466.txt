Granted, "World" is a great bunch of stories about how our global community has become flattened; but unfortunately for Friedman, the book is already outdated.  That's why the recent 100-page update was necessary, but a book on the history of such a changing landscape is quite like a detailed drawing of the Mona Lisa on an Etch-a-scetch, which someone keeps shaking up.  I'm not saying it's impossible to give a detailed description of what's going on in the world today in a book format, but maybe some of the things that the author described in his book (open source ssoftware and new web applications like blogs and user-drivn web content) are the only way to really get the updated version of our history.  There's nothing like a printed book, but perhaps that media cannot fulfill the needs of a modern history
