Many have said you need to be older (at least 40) to appreciate this book, but I loved it and I'm only 26.  Jewett made me feel like I was really there in Dunnet Landing, and since the narrator is never named, I felt like I was the narrator, living her experiences (it helps that the narrator in this story is a writer and so am I).  I loved Jewett's descriptive language and rich characterization.  I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates beautiful imagery and unforgetful characters.  My favorite character in the novel is Mrs. Todd's mother, Mrs. Blackett -- I wish I was as loving and giving and self-forgetful as she is!  My husband and I are planning a trip to coastal Maine this summer, and I will be thinking about this novel while I'm there
