Jeff Miller has written a great book about the beginnings of the American Football League and the difficulties it faced against the NFL. Numerous players and owners are quoted and the reading is a fascinating look at the challenges the league faced. Bad uniforms, bad teams, bad stadiums were just part of the problem but the AFL had some great players. The book is very well written and it is a must read for football fans.
