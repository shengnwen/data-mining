I purchased this book for my 2 aunts when my Grandmother passed away.  It is a wonderful book about how people really feel.  I found it quite therapeutic after my Grandma died.  The grandma in the book reminded me of  my grandmother - same sweater, liked to have her nails painted and the same  hair style.  I read it to my children.  It is a wonderful and touching  book
