If you like strong, brave women, the old American West, "quilts", and just want to be really proud to be female, this is the book. We have no right to complain about the switch on the microwave, or the too dark toast, etc., makes one feel quilty about the simplicities and pleasure of putting a quilt together today.  This book is a "can't put it down" read.  The pictures are well worth the cost of the book, THANK you Sandra Dallas
