I remember loving the illustrations in the book and liking the story

but shortly after I got very paranoid. I thought that if I accidentally swallowed a piece of hair or something I would have to get surgery and go to a hospital and one time when I came down with the flu bug I started freaking out and didn't want to go at all

I guess much of it is unrealistically written but for its time it was an interesting boo
