I had never heard of Eddie Aiku until 2 months ago when I went to Hawaii and read a sidebar about him in a "blue book."  At first I thought "Eddie Would Go" was just a macho mentality and I thought I was going to read a story about someone daring and tough.  After reading I know the meaning behind "Eddie would go" is so much deeper...

What a gripping tragic story of an incredible man.  The book really captures the higlights and impact of Eddie's actions and does a good job of translating the emotions and feelings around the events that happened through interviews of people that were there and first-hand witnesses.  Coleman often gives multiple viewpoints from multiple interviewees and it is interstesting to see the different interpretations of events.

If we all had the humilty, self-sacrifice and wisdom of Eddie Aikau we'd all be better off
