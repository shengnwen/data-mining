After the Fact is a book that every serious historian should have in their library.  Davidson and Lytle do a great job elucidating the various aspects of exploring the conundrum of history.  From the very basic task of exploring the veracity of the Declaration of Independence to the monumental task of discovering the reasons why history was made in a certain context.  Every chapter is interesting and captivating, and a &quot;must read&quot; to supplement the history seminar.  If you do not have this book already, I strongly suggest purchasing it
