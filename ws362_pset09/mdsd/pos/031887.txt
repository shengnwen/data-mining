Several years after reading this book, I can still recall by heart many of Prelutsky's clever rhymes and catchy rhythms.  The amazing thing is:  so can my kids! The favorite dinosaurs such as T-Rex are given their poetic  due, but so are lesser known dinosaurs such as leptoterigius and  quetzelcoatlus. (sp?)  Although I love all of Prelutsky's whimsical poetry,  I felt this book was better suited for young listeners than such works as  &quot;It's Snowing! It's Snowing&quot;.  (Perhaps because the subject  matter is more familiar to the pre-school set)  Some parents may not like  the occasional graphic imagery, but lets face it: carniverous dinosaurs  were not dainty eaters!  The poetry is too lyrical to be truly gruesome,  and besides, all kids like to be grossed out a little bit.  If your child  is at all into dinosaurs, this may be a good addition to your home library
