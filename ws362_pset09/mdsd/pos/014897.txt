I purchased this book to expand my families appreciation for classical music.  We are beginners, at best, and it's hard to know where to start to broaden your understanding.  This book was VERY insightful.  It is one thing to listen to the music and attempt to appreciate it, but to understand the perspective of the composer and the purpose of major pieces puts everything in a new light.  I am really pleased with this purchase
