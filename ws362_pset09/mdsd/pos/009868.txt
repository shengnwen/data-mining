yes, the writer seems to repeat herself a lot in the story. i almost thought there were only two characters after reading the first 100 pages. but then it grew better, and even more appealing towards the last 100 pages. it is a decent novel, and i'm glad i read it. it is not as thought-provoking as the two novels of anita shreve i read, but i certainly enjoyed the reading
