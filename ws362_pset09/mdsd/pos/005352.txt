An essential tool for anyone interesting in producing Samuel Beckett's  full-length play, Happy Days, this production notebook serves as an  explanation to not only the author's sometimes unrecognized references and  sources as well as difficulties with the technical elements of production  (for example, how the original production coped with the necessity for a  flaming parasol).  Even if one is not looking to produce Happy Days for the  stage, Beckett's production notebook is a great insight into the character  Winnie, whose intelligence is equivocal to Beckett's own and draws (often  without the reader's knowledge, save for this notebook) from Keats,  Browning, and Shakespeare. Reading the author's notes on both the play as a  piece of literature and as a theatrical event also gives one a better  understanding of Beckett as playwright and as an imminent literary figure  of the twentieth century. True scholars of Beckett will also enjoy the  copies of handwritten notes, transcribed into type on adjoining pages. This  notebook is a perfect tool for dramaturgy or for simply gaining a better  understanding of this Beckettian masterpiece
