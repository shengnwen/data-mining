After reading Alexandre Dumas' popular works &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, &quot;Twenty Years After&quot;, &quot;The Vicomte de Bragellone&quot;, and &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, continued reading to delve into his more obscure novels is a rewarding experience.  &quot;Memoirs of a Physician&quot; proves to be an unexpected detour from the standard type of intrigue in Dumas' most noted writings.  After reading &quot;Memoirs&quot; one would almost find it appropriate to label the twists and turns in the aforementioned works as &quot;shallow&quot;.  In this book, the first in the series of the Marie Antoinette Romances, the reader experiences a look into darker and more sinister events which ultimately led to the French Revolution.  &quot;Memoirs of a Physician&quot; exudes suspense, alliances and betrayals, humor, romance, longing to be and the becoming itself - all of the qualities that place Dumas' novels among the greatest works of all time
