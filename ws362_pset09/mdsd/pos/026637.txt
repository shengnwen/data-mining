This book is perhaps my favorite American novel of all time.  Kesey's brand of storytelling is highly engaging and makes this book readable in one sitting.  However, he is most admirable for his characters.  The protaganist of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is Randle Patrick McMurphy, a brash and determined young delinquent with a devil-may-care attitude.  McMurphy feigns a mental disorder in order to be moved from prison to a mental ward.  Upon entering the mental institution, McMurphy stirs up all kinds of trouble by befriending and influencing a bevy of mental patients, all with their own interesting eccentricities.  All of this is done to the dismay of the dictatorial "Big Nurse" who becomes McMurphy's nemesis.  Interestingly, the story is told through the character Chief Broom who for years has pretended that he is a deaf mute, an aspect that affords him greater perceptability.  I highly recommend this book--it will humor, sadden, move, and excite anyone who reads it.  I have also concluded that--in my limited experience with literature--Randle Patrick McMurphy is the greatest character ever conceived by an American novelist
