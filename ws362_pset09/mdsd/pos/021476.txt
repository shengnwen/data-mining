Kazin's book is really a history of populist rhetoric, not populism per se. Thus, the title, the Populist PERSUASION!

Thankfully, Kazin does not ridicule populism as RICHARD HOFSTADTER did in his book, The Age of Reform. But Kazin still relies too heavily on the urbane cosmopolitan view of most liberals that populism is more a style of rhetoric to appeal to the uneducated rubes than a coherent set of political ideas or reforms.

Real populism more then an rhetorical style! It was a political movement of common people to control their own lives within a democratic market system with specific objectives like the crop banks and the sub-treasury plan. The Farmer-Laborer Alliances of the late 19th Century, and the People's Party that resulted, always referred to their reform movement as 'cooperation', not socialism. They were largely inspired by ideas of Thomas Jefferson, and the founding fathers. In this context, populism should be viewed as a struggle between democratic capitalism vs. speculative and monopoly capitalism, not a style of political rhetoric. 

For an understanding of Populist reforms and political agenda, one would be better served by LAWERENCE GOODWYN's book, The Populist Moment: A Short History of the Agrarian Revolt in America. 

That is not to say that Kazin's book is not an important book.  To the best of my knowledge, Kazin is the only book to documented the 20th Century abandonment of populist impulses to the anti-semitism of Father Caughlin, and after the culture wars of the 60's, and the identity politics of the 70's to the likes of George Wallace and Rush Limbaugh.  

As such, it is a valuable political history that does much to explain our modern "Blue/Red State" deadlock then more recent books, like Thomas Franks' What's the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America, or John Sperling's The Great Divide: Retro vs. Metro America.
