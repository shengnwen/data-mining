Many sales experts advocate developing relationships with your clients rather than focusing on single transactions. Charles H. Green encourages you to earn and cherish the trust of your customers; that means putting their needs ahead of yours. He promises that trust-based relationships will generate more income for you in the long run, but only if you are genuinely sincere. You cannot feign trustworthy behavior as a sales tactic; it must come from your heart. Green tells you how to earn real trust, using his four-step sales process and five-step trust-building procedure. He offers a plethora of examples, practical suggestions and useful lists, repeating some strategies for emphasis. We encourage career salespeople to use this book.
