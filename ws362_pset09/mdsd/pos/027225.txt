I haven't really read this book yet, though I plan to, so my 5 stars was just a concession to the need to chose something....I simply had to respond to Brigitte Week's review in which she suggests that Jo March was the character responsible for calling people "kindred spirits". It was Anne Shirley, of course. Did the reviewer make this mistake intentionally to provoke this ridiculous response? Am I too obviously another bibliophile, and pendantic at that?
