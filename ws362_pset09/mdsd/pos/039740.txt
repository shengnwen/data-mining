This book addresses reasons for kids who cant make friends because they are unaware of non verbal 'rules' between kids.  They just dont catch on.  The authors list about 6 clear areas to address that can be gone over with  children to help remedy that.  Each section has about 2 pages of suggested  activities to try . I liked that while many other books offer psychobabble,  this book goes into another dimension -of body language and actual body  presentation.  Real and practical stuff. I didnt like that the book felt as  though the important information wasnt quite long enough for a book so it  was padded to make it thick enough to be commercially viable.  I'd bet this  and their other book could be combined into one really worthwhile book
