I personally found this book both extremely inspiring and enjoyable to read. Swimme's method of unveiling the truth about advertisments and consumerism and how they shape our veiw of reality is ingenious. At the  same time, the book takes you on a scientific journey of the universe that  incorporates feelings of mystical awe and wonder that many books fail to  acomplish. I have read everything from Fred Wolfe to Brian Greene. However,  Swimme envokes a deeper feeling of appreciation for science, the workings  of our universe, and humanity in general. All his books, especially this  one, have something new to say and add a human touch to science that is  long overdue. This is definitely not your run-of-the-mill new age book and  I recommend it to anyone who is passionate about preservation of the  environment or just plain curious about new ideas concerning reality and  the world we live in
