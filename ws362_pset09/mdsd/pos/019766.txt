This amazon short is a quick overview of Letha Hadady's new book Feed Your Tiger. I am a big fan of that book - see my review-- and this short has been my gift to many of my friends. None of us have time to cook. This short is the fast way to lose weight and feel great. Everyone has time for that.

My mother is a Dragon My dad is a Tiger. I am a bit of both - overweight, tired with a heavy workload and a fried food addict. I enjoyed the comprehensive way to looking and feeling better in this short and in the book Feed Your Tiger
