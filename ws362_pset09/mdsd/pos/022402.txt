My daughter got dressed up and did a beautiful creative dance for me last week.  When she was done, she said, &quot;Mom, don't I look like that pretty little girl in the carrot book?&quot; That in itself wouldn't be amazing except for the fact that WE DON'T OWN THIS BOOK! WE HAD CHECKED THIS BOOK OUT FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO!  I'm buying my  copy today!   The illustrations grab you. They're realistic, colorful and  created with a sense of humor.  I could say the same for the text which  builds page to page allowing each member of the family to play a role in  contributing to the success of the giant carrot.  My children love this  book, especially when I read it with a &quot;southern drawl.&quot
