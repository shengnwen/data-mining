Yea this book is very cool, graphics wise: very well done!!!!
however, for those of you looking for a direct sequel to the first book, this isn't it, its a very weird story that is actually very confusing until the end, motoko becomes a hyper advanced ghost on the net and downloads her self into multiple bodies,
the story featured here, follows the journey of one of these motoko copies to its very demise. However, the story at the end dose come back to the original motoko and section 9...sorta, batu and aramaki are in this story but only in the beginning and at the end, and it dose end story wise as if it were going to sequel.

other than that the only bad thing about this is that its printed in a slightly larger "Manga" size. its not like the first book, where it was a 300pg full size graphic novel, no the book is significantly smaller in dimension and has 307 pages, the text is smaller *8pt font MAX*, and this time about 1/2 of is in full *CG* color, 

so yea its a must have for all diehard shell fans..but for new comers and not so diehards alike, this book may be a bit of a let down...
