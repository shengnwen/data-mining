This was an attempt to find meaning in life, which so many authors, and others, have struggled with since we started walking on two feet.  Is there any change from one generation to another, or from one time to another, or from one place to another?  Camus believes not.  He doesn't see a moral advancement of humanity, but a stagnant slog through what chance puts in front of us.

Reading this book, I had the feeling that I was going through the feelings of those poor souls in Oran.  I was sharing with them first denial, then anger, then acceptance, then resignation, and finally, joy.  If not joy, then at least relief.  But the plague can come again, on a whim.

I imagine that the novel is a statement of the uncertainties that we find ourselves in all the time, and how little we can do about it.  There is no divine force guiding us, or anyone else,  We have to find our own way, whether it is through helping people, or not helping people, through what is considered legitimate, or what is illegitimate actions.  There are no moral statements in the book, just acceptance of the various forces acting upon us, through us, and by us.

This book, through the various and opposing characters it paints trying to come to grips with this calamity, accomplishes its aim.  Be prepared to think about its meaning well after reading the last page.  Think about its relevance whenever external forces overpower us, as they do all the time, whether natural, or through the actions of mankind.
