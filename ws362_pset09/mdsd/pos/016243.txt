Even non-vegetarians like myself can find excellent recipes in this book.  My husband and I have made several, and all work as written and are delicious.  Tomato, basil pesto is fabulous and my husband now makes large batches of the sauce and freezes it, which works great.  I have had great success with several of her quick bread recipes and appetizers, and her method for baking a fritatta is the best and super easy.  The dishes are flavorful (we sometimes add a little more garlic) and not  heavy on the brown lentil and tofu dishes that seem to be the mainstays of some vegetarian cookbooks. One does not need a lot of cooking experience to be able to follow these recipes; the directions are quite clear and simple
