This is a concise treatment of the history of evolutionary theory, beginning with the great French morphologists of the late 18th and early 19th centuries and finishing with some recent developments in the application of evolutionary theory to behavioral questions.  Larson is a very good writer and accomplished scholar who lays out the primary narrative very well.  He also deals well with important and related historical phenemona like the emergence of eugenics, the anti-evolution movement in the USA, and the nature of social Darwinism.  There is a nice bibliographic essay recommending further reading, though I was surprised to see Michael Ruse's excellent book The Darwinian Revolution not mentioned.  
Part of the Modern Library Chronicles series, this book is supposed to be concise and within these limits, Larson does an excellent job.  My only substantial criticism concerns the last chapter, entitled Post-Modern Developments.  Modern in this case refers to the so-called modern synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s, the great reconciliation of Darwinian theory, modern genetics, and paleontology.  In his discussion of post-modern developments, Larson doesn't discuss the major impact of DNA sequencing, experiments concerning selection, or discoveries in developmental biology that amount to establishing a molecular version of Haeckel's biogenetic law.  These developments providing continuing major support for one of the most successful theories in the history of science
