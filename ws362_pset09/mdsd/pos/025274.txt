 In contrast to many books on Multipal Personality, this charming book is directed almost exclusively at those who already know they have DID and who are now trying to learn ways to best deal with everyday challenging situations. In a sense, it is like a "Drivers Manual" for Multipal Personality itself.

  It does make some assumptions though.  It assumes that the reader has progressed to the point where they accept their DID, and have the ability to contact their alters. And that their alters generally are in contact with each other, and feel safe hearing from their "host".  In fact, much of the book seems to be adressed as much to a persons' alters as it is addressed to the host.

  One of the more valuable sections revolves around the frequent delemma of.....how to deal with doctors visits that may involve touching and other intrusive proceedures.  The strategies are VERY usefull, and are sure to be a help to those who still find themselves uncomfortable and essentially playing it by ear in such situations.

  All in all, a book with much practical value for those who are becoming more in touch with their condition, and looking for ways to manage difficult situations.
