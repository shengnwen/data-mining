GK Chesterton, who took his Christianity very seriously, published in 1911 this beautiful and moving ballad about Alfred the Great, who also took his Christianity most seriously when he drove the pagan Danes from his land in the 9th century.  It is a measure of how far Western civilization has sunk that, today, both Chesterton and Alfred would be considered fanatics, insensitive and most opposed to diversity.  Particularly alien to the modern mind would be the response of the Danish king, who, after Alfred impossibly beats his forces, becomes convinced that Alfred's Christian faith must be true, and is baptized!

'For not til the night's blue slate is wiped
Of its last star utterly, 
And fierce new signs writ there to read,
Shall eyes with such amazement heed,
As when a great man knows indeed
  A greater thing than he.'

The language is powerful, compelling, demanding that the poem be read aloud.  This edition has very helpful historical notes by Sister Bernadette Sheridan--even the well educated will need them. An inspirational work of faith, from Alfred and GK.  Highly recommended
