Levit's book asks what will be the future of feminism now that so many goals of the 60s and 70s have been accomplished.  She responds that we are going to see a turn toward gender activism, rather than specific women's rights stuff.  This is primarily a legal text, but all non-legal readers will be able to handle it.  The book will in no way intimidate men at the same time that it avoids disrespecting Steinem-types by talking about &quot;post, post, post&quot; anything.  For some feminists, this book will mention too much of the obvious.  For those who are novices, but know that Betty Friedan is dated, they will enjoy Levit's insights
