In Forever Odd, one of Dean Koontz's most endearing characters returns to face new perils, following the trail of a kidnapped friend and dicing with death in a derelict gambling resort. Odd Thomas is his gentle, quirky self once more, communing with the ghost of Elvis and finding himself terrorised by scary cat Terrible Chester. I found this latest outing good but not quite as gripping or significant as the first novel, with a villainess who is more frivolous than menacing. Hopefully, the bad guys will be back on form in Brother Odd, the next book in this intriguing series
