Since I got this online, I didn't realize it was for the smaller slow cookers. There's no nutrition information with the recipes, a pet peeve of mine. The recipes are appealing (no photos). Everything from overnight oatmeal (steel cut and regular) and various broths. I used my slow cooker last night, but I used a recipe found online instead
