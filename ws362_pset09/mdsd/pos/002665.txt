Junji Ito, Uzumaki, vol. I (Viz, 2001)

Uzumaki became something of a sensation in Japan, inspiring, among other things, a live-action movie (which I'm hoping to review in the next week or so, if I can find the time to actually watch the thing). It was a natural, when I stumbled across it, for me to pick it up.

Now, I should start by saying that where horror manga are concerned, I cut my teeth on Hideshi Hino. Once you've been to the extreme, everything else seems a bit... anticlimactic, don't you think? 

That said, Uzumaki (Spiral) goes in a completely different direction when it comes to creating its atmosphere (though don't get me wrong, Ito goes for the gross-out more than often enough to satisfy fans of Hino, Maruo, etc.). Ito's characters are obsessed with spirals. The town in which these loosely-connected stories are set is cursed with spirals. One of his characters expounds, about halfway through the book, on the attraction of the spiral; while the action has let up here a tad, this is exactly the kind of scene Ito needs in order to take his readers from amiable, willing disbelief into "man, this is creepy" territory. 

Ito has been compared to Lovecraft more than once (and while I've never actually seen an illustration of Innsmouth, I have to admit, Kurozu-Cho does seem as if it could fit an Eastern version of the bill), but Ito is to Lovecraft what Ligotti is to Lovecraft; there may be influence there, but he's taken it and (no pun intended) twisted it around so much that this is indisputably the work of an artist with his own voice, not a craven her-worshiper. Lovecraft may have imagined some of the rather ugly, painful fates that meet Ito's characters, but if he did, they ever saw print at the master's hand.

Lovely. I'll definitely be continuing on with this series. ***
