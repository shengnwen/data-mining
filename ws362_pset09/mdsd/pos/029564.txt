I have lived Martha's nightmare with a son. What she has depicted in Augusta, Gone is absolutely realistic and she captures the pain and anguish to a tee.  Only parents who have been through this can understand that it is not embellished for book sales sake.  I am so grateful that Martha put down in words what I could not.
