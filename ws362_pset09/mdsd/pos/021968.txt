If you manage money or trade for a living, this book is AWESOME.  In fact, I'd say it's in the same class as 'The Money Game,' 'Market Wizards,'and 'When Genius Failed.'  Why do I like it so much?  The guys interviewed in it are totally real.  They understand that the money-making business is an iterative process, and they generally have nothing to hide.  You'll see that the Big Dogs play by the same rules we all do.  Have a 'favorite idea,' risk 1 to make 10, if you don't have a great reason to be short gamma then don't be short gamma...  Enough said.
