Bukowski often wrote that he thought most poetry was dandyfied, prissyfied, pretty, not real, fake, false and worst of all, restrictive to the &quot;masses&quot;. To him there were a few exceptions; John Fante, Hamsun and early Hem. in prose, some of Pound, all of Sarayon, all of Jeffers in poetry. Hank wrote clearly and lucidly about many topics, not just getting drunk and sleeping with women as many of his detractors claim. He also wrote clean crisp poetry about LA and the race track, and traffic, other writers and about cats, and food, and taking baths and, well, about life!!!! Life being lived by a human being. War All the Time was written during the early to mid eighties, a time when Hank had had some success with his writing. His movie was out and enjoying some success. He was 60 years old and he had a newer car and a house in San Pedro he owned and a woman he loved (the second Linda) so his words in this collection are not quite as hard as poems from earlier on, like the poems found in the Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame collection. But, War All the Time is still lucid and clear as a drink of vodka on ice, this collection is right up there with the best of Bukowski
