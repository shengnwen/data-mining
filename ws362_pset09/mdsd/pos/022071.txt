Larry Mantle's &quot;Air Talk&quot; on KPCC is the inspiration for a number of the book purchases I've made in recent years.  This same pattern held true for Heimann's &quot;Sins of the City.&quot;  For those of us  somewhat familiar with LA's past, the photographs and sparce commentary  provided a look at Los Angeles of the 1930s and 40s.  They helped to fill  in some of the blanks as well as raise new interests about things  heretofore unknown.  The book provides an entertaining two-hour read at the  beach, but leaves the reader thirsting for more details.  Last week  Heimann's interview was played on &quot;The Best of Airtalk.&quot;  After  having read the book and hearing Heimann's interview twice, I felt very  deprived.  Perhaps it's the ability of Larry Mantle to draw the best out of  his guests, or maybe Heimann wanted his readers begging for more.  Whatever  the case, the narrative of the book pales to what it could have been had  Heimann's interview on KPCC been used as the source of the book's  narrative.  For those of us who like to read Chandler or Elroy, this book  provides us with the authentic photographs of the era to go along with  their classic narratives
