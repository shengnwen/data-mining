I liked the very readable style the book is written in. It doesn't get bogged down on minute details but gives the readers an overall picture of Washington, with a heavy focus on his political life. 

I don't know if this is a result of the records or of the author, since this is my first biography on Washington, but I didn't get a good feel for who Washington was as a person. The book details his actions, but it doesn't let us into his motives and his passions.
