I hadn't read an Alex Cross book in over a year, and wasn't sure what to expect from this novel. 

Some of the books were interesting turn-pagers, others were just mediocre.

This one might be the best of the lot, however. 

The biopic tale of two gruesome serial killers on the lose is presented brilliantly, and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you hooked until the final page. 

Terrific storywriting, interesting chracters, and a terrific plot. Kiss the Girls was my favorite Cross novel, but this replaced it. I can't remember any part of the novel well I felt I was just reading filler or wasn't the least bit interested in what was going on.  

I had grown sour on Cross novels over a year ago, but this one hooked me back in.
