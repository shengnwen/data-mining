The professor used this book in the math stat course I took 2 years ago. I did not like the book at first, it looks too long to be covered. but it turned to be very easy to follow (You still need to think, but the author, being a hero in this field, made a very clear presentation to the audience). As long as you invest some time and brain, you can get a lot from this book. The problems are very good and instructional too
