This, like any good book, will cause you to think, and for me it was to question something at the time I agreed with. Grisham tells the story of a man who was put on Death Row, though he was only the driver of the get away car. It shows very well that death row is a very horrible place and almost barbaric. 

At the time I read this I was a believer in the Death Penalty, but this, if maybe not making me change my mind altogether, made me at least question it. This was the first thing I had ever read or even heard on how they treat people on Death Row and what they go through, even though they are criminals.

Interesting thought provoking read, though somewhat predictable.
