I was really surprised to learn about the sodium/potassium balance that plays such a big role in cellulite. I was very impressed with the author's encouragement to eat raw fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds and sprouts etc. I have been studying (and practicing) raw foodism for a little while on and off and considering this book was written in 1995 (and that was the second edition!) I am truly glad to see that the raw food movement is - once again - not a new concept and truly is the best way to eat. The ideas that she presents are fairly basic, but then again, she has an almost vegetarian way of eating which also is encouraging. Even though some of what she writes would seem obvious, it goes beyond. It's worth purchasing and seeing if it makes a difference in your life.
