Some reviewers have been disappointed with this book, but I must say that all you need is this book, a little time, some open space, and a tomahawk.  While I prefer Coldsteel's Norse hawk, and Bad Axe, I have found that the lessons learned in this book, have given me the ability to throw a tomahawk in remarkably little time.

In the past, many people have advised me on some truly terrible advice.  But, this book has helped me actually throw a tomahawk, and it is filled with interesting adecdotes too.   It is everything that I could want from a book on the subject, but I must admit I would be interested in a DVD on the subject as well.  If digital photography and video were around when this book was first written, that product would be an exceptional find.  But, it is a book that I am reviewing, and I must say that it is well worth the money, and well worth the time it takes to read it
