A great read for anyone interested in history and combat at the grunt level.  A good book for anyone trying to understand the culture of America and Europe from a soldiers point of view.  Did Europe love the United States for being there?  Maybe after a few more books I might have some idea of what world war ii was really about.     Read this book.
