This book was hard to get through, not because of the writing, which was excellent, but because it was so relentlessly honest and upsetting.  I don't think I've ever read a book where the author was quite so hard on himself or made himself out so poorly.  I think he took on more blame than he needed to for his childrens' problems.

The most effective part of this book was showing how terribly poor the US is at handling mental illness in children.  The most telling point of the book for me was when the author asked his insurance plan what child psychiatrists were covered that were in their area (within 50 miles) and there were NONE--and they lived with 25 miles of New York City!  I know how hard it is to find a child psychiatrist, but I didn't realize things were that bad.  It's also astonishing that extremely expensive inpatient mental health hospitals have basically no therapy or help on weekends.

I do think this book is more a memoir of a very trying time in the author's life and his childrens' life than specifically about their depression and bipolar disorder.  There is much about the crumbling of the parents' marriage and the drug and alcohol use of the children.  It helps to set the scene during which the mental health crises occur, but I would have liked more concrete information about depression and bi-polar disorder.

I hope that things continue to look up for this family.
