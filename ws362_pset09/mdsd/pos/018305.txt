I was immediately thrilled with this book!  The wonderful "extras" all through it made it a fun experience and an entertaining read.  The one particular reason that this book is so enjoyable is that it is written as a non-fiction guide book; it takes itself very seriously and, for a while, you do too.  Of course, the end results were detrimental to my wallet; I had to purchase all of the other "Ologies" books and tie-ins!  Definitely worth it, though, as it got my kids (teenagers!)  reading again as they await the newest Harry Potter book!  Highly recommended for readers of all ages...do NOT let the "Age Range" ratings prevent you from perusing all of these books and, they actually manage to instill some REAL information into the readers' brains.
