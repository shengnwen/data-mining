I have always been thin, at times skinny, and without exercising at all. Whenever I put on some weight, just a mere couple of weeks away from carbohydrates always did the trick.
Until 6 months ago I was proud of my abs and I used to wear short T-shirts and low rise pants. 
Then I turned 40. All of a sudden, at least it appeared so, I raised from size 0 to 6, not to mention what happen to my waistline! 
I took every possible blood test in search of some odd disease. Everything was fine.
So I started dieting, but I was gaining weight instead of losing it. It simply didn't work as it used to. That's when I decided to read every published book on weight management after 40.
This book is by far the most interesting I have read so far. It just makes sense. 
Being 40 plus s* really, but Debra Waterhouse was able to make me laugh and gave me the direction to work on. I recommended the book to all my friends
