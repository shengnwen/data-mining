As indicated in my reviews of other recent books in the Plum series, I was losing interest in this series and losing faith in Evanovich.  I had read #10 and was considering whether to even bother buying #11 when a few online friends and fellow Plum fans started to rave about #12, which was newly in hardcover.  That was enough to get me to buy #11 just so I could go into #12 with all the history complete.  I quickly read #11 and then delved into Twelve Sharp with my expectations high.

Twelve Sharp has restored my faith in this series and its author.  It was funny, engaging, scary/creepy/exciting, sexy and even touching to boot.  There were times when it seemed a LITTLE out of character for Ranger, but I'm not complaining--it was a really good story.  The ongoing triangle between Stephanie, Ranger and Morelli took a step forward in this book and it was about time.  Oh, that's not to say the dilemma about her feelings for these two men is OVER, but I think that she at least understands her feelings and the situation more than she did before.

It felt good to laugh out loud at a Plum book again--multiple times, in fact.  From Stephanie talking Melvin Pickle down off a ledge to Lula's outrageous band outfits and Grandma's funeral home antics, #12 was a hoot (Dad finally speaks up--and it was worth waiting for).

Thanks, Janet.  All feels right with the world again. :
