My introduction to Don Miguel Ruiz was through "The Four Agreements". It was a book that I devoured and one that left a deep mark on me, therefore it only made sense for me to pick up his second most popular book, "The Voice of Knowledge", which I just finished reading in its Spanish edition. Besides offering a useful refresher of "The Four Agreements" halfway through the book, Ruiz tackles the very real and tough problem we all face of being overwhelmed with our internal dialogues going on, telling us what to do or not do, why we are better or worse and driving us down a guilt path of learned behaviors and habits.

The material covered by the book makes perfect sense and he is bound to offer advice that will resonate with those practicing Buddhism as well as those into Christian religions. However, after a while, he begins to repeat himself and go back to elements mentioned earlier in the book, which renders the book a bit longer than necessary past the second half. Though I enjoyed it, I struggled to finish it. All in all, it's very good, but the book can easily be a third shorter and it would work just as well
