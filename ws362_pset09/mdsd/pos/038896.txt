I used this book when homeschooling my son many years ago. I just bought it for my sister who will be homeschooling her daughter this coming year. It is a great way to "make your own" curriculum and very inexpensive too! Great ideas using simple material that help kids learn; in 10 minutes and fun for them.  I highly recommend this book as well as all of Peggy Kaye's Learning books
