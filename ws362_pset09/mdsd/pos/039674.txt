I bought this book a while back thinking I'd get to it eventually.  I knew (because I faced this with number six and I'll probably have to deal with it in number 9) that I'd have to dig up the series and at least skim a few of the tomes to figure out what's going on.  I also agree that this series just has to end.  I started reading this series in college when it was already on book three in hardback.  I've been out of school for a while now and while I'm still a big fantasy fan, I have to admit that there are places I won't dig in my bag to pull out my 700 page novel with the picture of the guy holding up a sword on the cover.  I say all this fully aware in the knowledge that at the end of book three, when Faile comes over the hill with her army, I got chills and nerd tears welled up in my eyes.  It was a moment fit for the society of creative anachronism, to be sure.  But this isn't a review of the series or Jordan's life's work.  It's a review of Book 8.  So, where was I... I think I have to go back to the end of book seven and find out..
