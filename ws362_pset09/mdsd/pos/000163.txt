Crowley has written this story on the fall of Constantinople at a level that will satisfy all but the highest academic, but at the same time, it's very readable for the novice.  He does a fine job at giving background to the Byzantium Empire and specifically in presenting the failures and weaknesses of the Emporers who preceded Contantine IX Paleologus.  

By the time we reach 1452, we know how the Theodosian Walls were built, and also how they have prevented anyone from successfully attacking Constaninople.  There is also a fine description of how the Fourth Crusade in 1204 (who attacked through the Golden Horn) destroyed much of the economy of the Empire and left it bereaved of enough hinterland from which to recruit a strong enough army to defend it.

Intertwined with the story of Constantine, is the story of Mehmet the Conqueror.  We learn how the Ottoman Turks had become a major power in Asia Minor, and a danger to not only Constantinople but to Europe as a whole.  Crowley also explains the machinazations that were involved in Mehmet coming to the throne at 19 and successfully eliminating all other rivals and siblings.

In the end, there is a stirring description of the defense of the city by 8,000 soldiers (almost half who are Italian volunteers, it starts to sound like the Alamo after awhile), against a tide of Ottomans (a low estimate is 100,000).  We learn strategy of defense against a new weapon (cannons that throw stone balls weighing up to a couple of tons), that the walls were never designed to stop.  

In the end, the loss of the city is blamed on a soldier leaving a sally-port open, that allows the Ottomans to finally break into the city.  The epilogue is a round-up as to what happened to all the principal fighter.
