Becoming Abigail is devastating in its deep understanding of the complexity human nature (both the beauty and the monstrosity).  I am a woman and I am amazed at Abani's ability to understand and portray a female voice.  This novel is sad, terrifying, moving and every page of it rings true.  
The prose style is sparse, for example (from chapter 31): "The comfort of simple things. Coffee percolating. Cinnamon buns warming oven and home.  An ice cold Coca-Cola on a hot day,  Licking out the mixing bowl. Chocolate. Childhood... And what would be the line for her?... A line is a lie. Who can tell what it will open unto."  And in this unpredictable strong novella, who can tell indeed?  Abani's style here is fearless (you can read how he has distilled his prose from Graceland to Becoming Abigail) and its rhythm ranges from a paused, minimalist riff, to a painful staccato, to the intensity of a fluid jazz solo. 
This is a fast read that will singe your brain.  Abani gives the reader no easy answers, as indeed no good artist should.  He raises questions.  
Through this beautifully told story, in the vein of films like Moodysson's Lilya4ever, calls our attention to one of the world's most overwhelming exploitative practices: the sexual slavery of women and children, not only in Nigeria/Britain but everywhere
