Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary is all encompassing, defining the simplest to the most complex terms. To be honest, however, I rarely even open it because it came with access to their website for a 6 mo trial. Since I do most of my work (I'm still in school) on the computer, it's much easier for me to run a search than go get the book. Potential buyers: this is more of a "dictionary" than encyclopedia. You're not going to get long explanations but short definitions, otherwise it would be volumes and volumes long. One more thing: it's a very pretty book - well bound; having it on your book shelf makes you look like you actually might know what you're doing!
