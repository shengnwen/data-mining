If you're one of King's constant readers you will agree that The Talisman was all King.  Black House seems all Straub.  

The narratvie reads like a screenplay, which at times is drudging.     
You look and look and sometimes you find King, buried in a sentence here and there ... here and now.

But (and here I'll use Black House style of narrative) as we float over Straub's neighborhood, and as we float over the Safeway, which 
seems to have a sale on toilet paper, we reach Mr. Straub's home.  He is scratching his head with one hand while the other tentative hand is resting on the keyboard of his computer.  He's stuck.  He can't seem to come up with the next sentence.  Then he 'flips' and there is King, next to him, and he whispers into Straub's ear, and Straub has the next sentence.

So as we read Black House we know it's Straub, but the haunt of King is evident throughout the novel.  It's Straub's writing style, but it's King's imagination.  Oh, and the DT tie-in's are executed masterfully
