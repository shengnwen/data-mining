Another adventure with Patricia Highsmith's lovely character Thomas Ripley. This book follows the author's &quot;The Talented Mr Ripley&quot; so that the reader is already acquainted with most of the protagonists like Dick and Chris Greenleaf, Bernard Murchisson or Tom's wife Heloise. When Ed Banbury and Jeff Constant, owners of the Buckmaster Gallery in London, decide to open a new show featuring paintings by the famous Derwatt, the situation becomes uncomfortable when the American collector, Murchisson, claims that a painting he bought three years ago is a fake. Knowing that Derwatt died years ago in Greece and that Bernard had been forging paintings by &quot;Derwatt&quot;, allegedly living in a remote village in Mexico, it will take all of Ripley's talent to clean the reputation of the Buckmaster Gallery, as Murchisson's visit to London is imminent. Mrs Highsmith's highly successful ingredients are all present in this novel: crime, horror, humour and suspense.
 Nigel Lambert reading Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Ripley Under Ground&quot; is a masterpiece. All the humour and suspense is rendered splendidly by Mr Lambert's beautiful reading.
