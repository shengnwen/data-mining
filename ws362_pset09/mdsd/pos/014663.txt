Lou's writing is concise and his examples are relevant. Lou has decades of experience but is still young enough to realize current trends. Most photography books explain techniques, which this book explains in detail. What separates this book from others is his ability to explain the intangible "art" of photography. He describes in detail (again with current  examples) food composition, styling, color and most importantly--"The Saliva Factor." 

If  you are a technical photographer and need creative inspiration then this book is a no-brainer. It will help both the novice and inspire experienced photographers, because he is truly at the top of his game
