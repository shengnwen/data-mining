I read or listen to 75-100 books per year.   I originally read this book in hardcover when it was first published and thought it was the best of its genre that I had ever read.   I just re-read the book.  I enjoyed it even more the second time.  I have read all of Hunter's books that feature the hero of this book, Bob Lee Swagger, and those that feature his father Earl.  All of them are entertaining.  This one is the best. It has great characters and clever plot twists.   If you like thrillers, read this one.  You will be hard pressed to find a better read
