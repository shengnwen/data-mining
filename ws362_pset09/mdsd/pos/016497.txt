NAM Rodger is a great British Naval historian and this is his best masterpiece to date. If you are looking for a story about the men, tactics and politics that drove the British navy at this time this is the best place.  His discussion about the rise of the admiralty and the importance it gave to British power is very well done. He looks at how the British established naval hegemony focusing on two years. 1759 and 1805.  These were two major battles in which the British soundly defeated the French leaving them with the command of the ocean. This book is very well written and a must read for those interested in naval history or British history.
