An extremely well researched and well written book, it examines the history of Anorexia Nervosa. During medieval period, a woman's fasting was seen as evidence of her deep faith. This perception, which continued to the Victorian era, placed tremendous pressure on women to be abstemious. Many women died of self starvation throughout centuries. A byproduct of this view was forced fasting by the families of some women who received special attention and financial consideration from society due to the fact that a woman in their family was pious enough not to eat.

It is a must reading for anyone who wishes to know more about a disorder that until recently was mistaken for virtue
