This was my first R.J.Waller novel and I hope the rest are half as good as  this.  With the perfect eye for the romance of life on the road, Waller  tells the tale of Jack Carmine, a ramblin' Texan veteran with a hide as  tough as leather but a soft heart beneath.  Although I found myself  identifying more with Jack's &quot;Walter Mitty&quot; uncle, it's the road  less traveled we come to realize we all eventually want. I recommend it  highly
