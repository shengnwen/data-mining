&quot;Party Going&quot; occasionally rises to the heights of world-class satire.

My only reservation is that sometimes Green's sentences are over-complicated for what should be a smooth-as-ice satire. Green is said to have hugely admired William Faulkner, but perhaps he allowed Faulkner's influence on him to go too far
