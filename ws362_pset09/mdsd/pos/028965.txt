I spent a good part of the day yesterday beggining a reading of GEB and was fascinated at the way Hofstadter looked at language and Bach's canons and fugues.  And there is much to come, I can tell.  Although I consider myself an intellectual, I am not qualified enough in mathematics to really understand what is being said on the subject, but hope that Hofstedter is going to open that up for me, too
