When I picked up this novel-in-rhyme,
I surprisingly had a lot of free time,
But when I started reading this book,
Even at my wrist-watch I forgot to look.
Yes my friend, time passed real fast,
In one go, I read the book to its last.
 
Even if you are one who prefers prose,
This lovely book-in-rhyme on you grows.
The story is all about people four,
Not a single on of them is a bore.
They are - Jon, Janet, Phil and Ed,
About each, pages have been said.

I will tell the novel's story no more,
Read yourself and see whats in store.
All I'll say is that the book is great,
So go on. Pick up the book, don't wait.
Yes, I am talking about `Golden Gate'
The novel-in-rhyme written by Mr. Set
