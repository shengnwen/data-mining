If you want my honest opinion I'm not a big Jayne Ann Krentz fan. I can't stand any of those crystal balls or the future. But since I read the other 2 books in this trilogy I figured I had nothing to lose by reading this one. So I eagerly awaited this books arrival and read it the instant it arrived on my door. Sure enough, I wasn't dissappointed and I didn't regret ordering it. It starts out simple enough with Nick Harte asking out Octavia Brightwell. For the seventh time. She finally says yes and she falls in love. Even with his son too. Of course, every happy ending has its share of problems. Nick's family is known around the whole town for it's legendary feud with the Madisons. Then there's the person, the one that every town has; the crazy one. I would of given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the stupid astrology stuff
