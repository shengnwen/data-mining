This is a book that i have recently finished for the first time reading all the way through. It asks compelling questions through the thoughts and converstations between the main characters and their wives. It also relates to current political parties battling for control of the governtment with a 3rd side party also involved. There are also many ironic and suspenseful moments that kepp you reading evan if you are not reading it for study. Over all, I  find it a great novel, but it is not something that I would read again for a long while; but possibly see the play acted out or watch a telivision form
