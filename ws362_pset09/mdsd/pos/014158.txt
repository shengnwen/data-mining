This book is a handy manual because it is concise, pretty cheap..and tells you almost everything that the other books do - plus, the front photo is a masterpiece - that is the weirdest looking Australian Shepherd ever!  Most are black &amp; tan (the 'Tri' color) or white/grey/black spotted (the 'merle' color) but I haven't seen many that are both!  A book like this is a lifesave if you aren't very familiar with the breed.  Explains their intense energy level and need for 'a job' to do..and why many people are too stupid and lazy to own an Aussie..or any dog really.  But seriously, don't get an Aussie unless you can absolutely promise to go on a minimum of 3 walks a day.  Book also explains their need to herd things..their desire for an orderly existence and why crows and seagulls and livestock and other disorderly animals annoy them.  And why, if you can provide the energy packed environment that they need, the Aussie is a great animal to own
