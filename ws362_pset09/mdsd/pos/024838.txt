I own every Dick Francis book and had mixed emotions when I stumbled across Under Orders in an airport book stall. I was delighted the author was publishing again after six long years recovering from the loss of his wife and main researcher. I was appalled I had to find the book by accident. The publisher doesn't deserve to host this author. Luckily, he can write a best seller with absolutely no fanfare or publicity from the publishing house.

Under Orders is vintage Francis. We remember jockey Sid Halley and care about his relationships and physical limitations. I wish to have learned more about internet betting, or perhaps physical rehabilitation--maybe the success of this book can bankroll a new researcher at the Francis writing stable. It's wonderful to find an old friend after so many years and I can't wait for another book by this author
