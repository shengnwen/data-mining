This book was one of my best knitting purchases.  I've been so pleased with the patterns in it that I've just purchased a second book for a friend in Australia.  Iris's technique is unique and addicting. Once you start a project it's hard to put your knitting down.  My two color scarf looks exactly like the one in the book as does my diamond blossom scarf and pinwheel purse. Iris has her own artyarns website and also a yahoo group where she offers help and suggestions with any of her patterns.  I'm patiently waiting for her second book which is due out next year.
