Four aspects of Antony Beevor's "Fall of Berlin 1945" stand out from my recent reading:

a. Beevor's extensive use of original German and Soviet archives and source material, to the point where the Allied effort to the East is little more than backdrop here (Beevor assumes that that story is told better elsewhere).

b. The sclerotic last days of the Third Reich.  Hilter is a ghostly presence here.  You get a palpable feel for his physical and emotional decline.

c. The fearsome, revenge-laden thrust eastward of the Red Army.  One of the key aspects of Beevor's "original source" scholarship is his laying bare of the rape- and pillage-laden aspects of the Soviet troop advance.  There are alcohol-fuled gang rapes of pretty much every girl and woman in the footprint of the advance.

d. The presence of the NKVD in the Soviet advance, not so much in the sense of them working against the Nazi war machine as they are keeping everyone aligned politically.  Beevor points out that one of the dangers of the advance from Stalin and Beria's perspective is that the average Soviet soldier would be taken by the depravations of 'average' Soviet life vs. the compartive lushness what they'd run across in the East.  Beria's crew tries to keep fear palpable and thoughts pure and dedicated to the 'Motherland.'

I read "Berlin 1945" soon after renting "Downfall" featuring a spectacular Bruno Ganz.  I found that to be a terrific combination.  Another good complementary piece is Traudl Junge's recollections in "Blindspot: Hilter's Secretary" (abysmal production values, but a mesmerizing, stupefying 80 minutes).

The only reason Beevor gets four stars here is that his previous book, "Stalingrad," is his master work.  There needs to be room to single out "Stalingrad" as the superior effort.
