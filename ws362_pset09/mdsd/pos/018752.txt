Another good one from this author though not as good as the Boleyn book, which is probably her best.  Having done extensive research on the period, I don't buy the main point of the plot, though.  Despite that, however, her writing is so powerful she still made me want to cry! Again bursting with details of sight, sound and scent.  Oo la la.

Go ahead and buy it.  You won't be sorry. ---But avoid the Wideacre trilogy 'cuz it was her early stuff and stunk.  I couldn't even finish any of those books and I'm a fan of the author
