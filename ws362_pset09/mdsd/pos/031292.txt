Preaching Without Contempt: Overcoming Unintended Anti-Judaism by Marilyn J. Salmon (Associate Professor of New Testament Theology at United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities) is an in-depth study of the general misrepresentation provided by so many Christian preachers in the past concerning the Judaic religion. Providing contemporary Christian readers with a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the New Testament Gospels in their historical first-century Jewish context, Preaching Without Contempt insightfully and knowledgeably presents Jewish beliefs and offers helpful advice for avoiding the kind of stereotypes that lead to Christian driven discrimination, persecutions, pogroms and holocausts against the Jews of the past. Preaching Without Contempt is very highly recommended reading for all Christians, and most especially seminary students and the Protestant clergy.
