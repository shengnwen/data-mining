Vietnam, Now, by David Lamb, is truly an eye-opener.  This novels consists of David Lamb's accounts of visiting Vietnam both when he was a soldier during the Vietnam war, and later again about 30 years post- war.  He compares and contrasts the two different time periods when he visited, with much detail, using unique writing techniques that transport the reader into Lamb's shoes.  Vietnam, Now eliminates many misconceived notions of Vietnam held by many Americans  today.  Overall, this is a well written book and an excellent read for anyone
