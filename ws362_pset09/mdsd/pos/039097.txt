As an elementary teacher, I have a great love for children's literature.  I choose Harry Horrible books frequently in my classroom.  I read this book to my students at the beginning of the school year.  The adventures of Harry and his friends throughout the Horrible Harry adventures are engaging its readers.  These are some of the first chapter books that they pick up.  It is a great simple chapter book to help hook your students into reading.  They will relate to Harry and his friends, and find that reading is funny.  I recommend this book to everyone.
I found that this book was funny and suspenseful altogether.  My students were begging me to read more.  In this book we find Harry wearing a mini-microscope necklace to school.   Horrible Harry tells his classmates that they can use during recess time to find a secret mushroom kingdom.  However knowing the playground rules, will Horrible Harry and his buddies break the rule and outside the fence to look in the mud? The author engages the readers in suspense, climax, and the issue of right and wrong.
