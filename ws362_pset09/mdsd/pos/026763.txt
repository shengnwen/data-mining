Richard Sennett is an articulate writer whose style reveals a fascinating mind and above all, a keen pair of eyes.  In relating our visual organ to the conscience, he implores us to start seeing our lives as wholly related  to and organically integrated with, the cities that we live in.  In this  thoroughly original and important book, Sennett successfully avoids the  tendency of many writers on urbanism to proffer 'well meaning' solutions,  but instead takes us on a historical and psychological journey.  He  convinces his readers to focus on impulses and 'spriritual' reasons behind  the creation of cities, ranging from the Greek ideals of 'grace' and  'balance' that produced the 'Agora' to the dilemmas of the modern soul that  creates walls made of sheer glass.  In chapter after chapter of engrossing  reading anyone deeply interested in the well-being of urban life will begin  to share his insights on urban forms. He articulates his views using  descriptions of ordianry people's lives through history. His well  researched narrative succeeds in relating their living conditions with  their daily activities as being outward expressions of their inner being.  Psychological and emotional states which then find direct expressions in  the physical forms of the places in which their lives are enacted.  For  anyone working in architecture or urban planning, this book is a must-read.  In the modern age we are conditioned to believing that a city is a product  of functional processes. It is this commonly held apathy which is the very  root cause of our modern urban alienation. To me, the message of Richard  Sennett's book is a revelation. It is a matter of conscience to use our  eyes to see the spirit of our own lives embedded in the walls and the  streets that our fathers and mothers have made
