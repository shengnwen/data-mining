I loved Mary Randolph Carter's book American Family Style so much and this book seemed to me like a part two of that original book.  Although this book wasn't filled with pictures of her family it was filled with the same warmth and comfort as the original.  Even though it may not be filled with exactly the things I might put in my own home it is something I enjoy reading.  You can tell the author truly LOVES these lost, rusty, beautiful things.  I truly can appreciate that.
