I'm no expert.  But, I am Chinese.  My family and I thrive on Asian-made soy products such as tofu.  We are allergic to western-made soy products.  If someone can provide a plausible reason for this, I would be most interested.  (Except where those Asian-made soy products are imported from Communist China.  I would recommend soy products from Taiwan.  I am most concerned about unscrupulous manufacturing processes from Communist China.)

I cannot speak for soy products made here in the U.S.  So, beware of all recommendations for or warnings against soy products.  I believe not all soy is created equally
