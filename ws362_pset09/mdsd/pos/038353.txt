Sleep No More by Greg Isles is a soulful chiller of a thriller. 

When John Waters, a happily married family man, is approached by a beautiful intriguing stranger who whispers one mysterious word--soon--his life takes an unexpected turn. Suddenly everything he knows as truth and reality spirals out of control as someone from his past reappears. But it is the way that she reappears that will shock you. And it is what she does next that will chill you even further.

This novel is rather difficult to review without giving away the plot or the key mystery, but it is sure to give you goosebumps and you won't look at those around you the same way ever again. It is a mix of horror and suspense, a bit of fantastical and a ton of thriller, and overall, it's one novel you won't want to miss. Greg Isles keeps the tension taut until the bitter end. Kudos!
