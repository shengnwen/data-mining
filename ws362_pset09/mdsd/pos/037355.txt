In a time when people are entertaining in their own home more and more this is a great reference to have at hand.  I purchased it when I joined Taste of Home Entertaining as a consultant. And now as I recruit new consultants and hold parties I can use books like this as consultant and hostess gifts. The recipes are mostly simple using ingredients that you can easily find in your grocery store.
