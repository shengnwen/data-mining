Encore to Tanika Lynch for writing a superb story! Poor Kamone has been dealt the poor hand in life but through it all she prevails. She's defintely a S-U-R-V-I-V-O-R in every sense of the word! The spiritual message throughout this book is definitely on point! God never gives us more than we can bare and sometimes He puts us through adversities/tests so we can prepare ourselves for the blessings He has in store for us! This book is FIRE.......read it within 2 days (could've read it faster if not for work)!  ****Highly Recommended***
