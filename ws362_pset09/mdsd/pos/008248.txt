I found this book to be a lifesaver. I was so addicted to sugar, and had become hypoglycemic, to the point where I was having seizures, if I didn't eat candy or sugar, the moment I started shaking and sweating profusely. I was hungry all the time, gaining weight daily it seemed like, tired all the time, and unable to concentrate. After reading this book, and following the steps for getting off the sugar and replacing it with healthy foods, that didn't let my sugar go up and down. I had no more seizures, lost weight like crazy, I have tons of energy now, and I no longer Crave Sugar 24 hrs a day, nor am I hungry all day long. I feel like I have a life again. Not to mention my risk aren't as high for being coming diabetic, which is what my Doctor told me I surely would have before. Not that I don't have a chance of still becoming one, but before it was a SURE THING.
I definetly recommend this book to anyone who struggles with sugar addiction, like I did. You will feel REBORN!
