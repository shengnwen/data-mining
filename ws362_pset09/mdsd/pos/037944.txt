Let me say first: Yes, I live in Lexington. No, I don't know Kim Edwards. 

Okay, now that that's out of the way. . . . 

I just finished this book, and I read most of it in one sitting, which is really rare for me. What kept me reading was that the book shows how secrets and unresolved grief not only eat away at a person, but affect everyone in that person's life. It was like "Ordinary People" with a twist. 

There were some things I wasn't thrilled about--I thought Norah could've been drawn with a little more definition, and certain events and scenes were superfluous--but she is a good storyteller, and there is a lot of good old-fashioned Russian-novel emotion in the story.

I think we all need a book to come along once in a while that reminds us that we can't just forget the past and move on--we have to work through our pain, and, just as important, we have to support each other.
