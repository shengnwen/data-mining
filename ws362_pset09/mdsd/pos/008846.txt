I never thought Gene Simmons was such an ace businessman!  He's really amazing!  His approach to business is totally self-made and every of his many ideas seem to became a source of revenue, sooner or later, one way or the other.  No matters if he got no experience in a domain, despite that, he will go for it and try it, all by himself!  Minimizing every cost possible in order to make the largest part of profit he can.  I love his life philosophy: he's cheap and proud of it, he's a shark and proud of it, he's dedicated 24 hours by day to his work, and most of all, he is totally drug-free.  A live example of the American dream!  And an example to emulate for every businessman in the making!  A must-read book for everyone!

Plus, I share the exact same philosophy about women and life!  They just want your money and life is all about the money!
