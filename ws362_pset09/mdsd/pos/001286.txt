Homerun...Kary does an outstanding job describing this &quot;slippery&quot; thing called relevance.  With an outstanding balance of Scripturally backing and personal real life experiences - I was made to confront my own shortcomings in how to be &quot;in the world but not of it.&quot;  As the Director of the Center for Character and Leadership Development at Grace College - this will be a recommended read for our emerging leaders. We have all heard, &quot;love God and love others&quot; before - but this book fleshes it out in a way that finally makes the light bulb go on!  A must read for anyone wishing to make a difference in their world - transforming your world starts with transforming your life
