Steele threw in a little more action than usual.  There were a lot of parts where I couldn't put the book down.  The beginning was a little drawn out, especially when the guys get out of prison and are re-introduced to the real world, blah, blah, blah.  The end was fairly predictable.

My only Steele peeve is that she descbibes characters personalities over and over and over!  Besides that I really liked Fernanda and all of the characters for that matter.  

If the average Seele read is a 5 this one is a 6
