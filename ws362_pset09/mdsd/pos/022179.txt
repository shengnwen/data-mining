An excellent compilation of diaries of women traveling by covered wagons in the 1800s.  Lillian Schlissel, the author, did extensive research, and, when possible, was able to give the reader information as to what happened to these women after their journies.  The author was able to comment on the lack of personal details in the diaries by giving some history of &quot;the culture of the times&quot;. What the women did share with us in their diaries was heartrending and I found myself brought to tears and full of gratitude for the comforts on my modern-day farm.  A good read, and definitely worthy of keeping in the home library
