Ask any group of American historians who the ten most important figures of the founding era were, and, sadly, the name of John Jay would be absent from a lot of those lists. I had never heard of author Walter Stahr before finding JOHN JAY: FOUNDING FATHER, so I had no idea what to expect, and though he may lack the flowing narrative of an H.W. Brands or Stephen Ambrose, a few more books like this will make Stahr a household name among history buffs.

Comparatively, there have been relatively few books written on John Jay, and what few are available, focus almost exclusively on Jay's career. Stahr duplicates those efforts by giving a wonderful account of Jay the statesman and his near unending accomplishments, but then exceeded my expectations by delving into the personal aspects of John Jay. Drawing on a substantial amount of new material, Stahr also gives us a look into Jay's wife, Sarah. 

This is a compelling and enjoyable read that will, hopefully, raise public awareness and give some long overdue credit to one of America's most important Founding Father's.
