This masterpiece, from the writer of &quot;Games People Play&quot; as well as several other books dealing with the subject of interpersonal relationships, is excellent in its presentation and scope. The late author, Dr. Eric Berne, guides the reader through a clear understanding of how we inter-relate with others, as well as ourselves. His depth of understanding of the &quot;human condition&quot;, presented with eloquent wit and charm, make this a volume that is difficult to put down. Dr. Berne's approach and skills at explanation make this a must read for anyone interested in this area of psychology. While the book could very well be used as a college text, the language is straight-forward and clear for professional or layman, alike
