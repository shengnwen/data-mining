This five volume set contains much of the information found in larger volumes like Angolia's, and much more detailed info than other volumes like the SOLDAT series which concentrate solely on front line troops. 
 
 The detailed info in this volume includes rank insignia of the Eastern Legions, info on Beamten (military officials) and a detailed table on Beamten - this stuff is not currently available in English in any other currenly printed books. 
 
 The meat and potatoes of the book are of course the colour plates , the detailed history of the Eastern Front, and the list of divisions and numbered units (the last being especially only marginally useful).
 
 Doesn't get five stars because of the colour plates. The poses are good, the artwork in the main is useful and shows a wide variety of kit, but the faces tend to look similar and the noses in particular need work. Andrew is obviously influenced by Volstad but needs to learn to put variety into his facial structure in order to present a realistic appearance.
 
 I see my review for Volume 3 is also listed under Volume 4, and 5 so I will add comments on these here - 
 
 Volume 4's special content includes insignia of the ROA (Russian Liberation Army) and special rank badges. Probably didn't need a whole page for the latter, but a bit of new information is posted in the chart also.
 
 Otherwise, all previous comments on the series, including those on volume 3, above, apply.
 
 Volume 5 has no special content in table or illustrations, but the text does discuss in some detail all the campaigns that took place on the &quot;western front&quot; and has note on the organization of infantry divisions as well as good general info on uniforms and insignia
