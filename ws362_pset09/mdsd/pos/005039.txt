This is a very cute book.   I recommend it for anyone who has had that one crush who you think doesn't even know you exist.  That's how it is for A.J. Now don't we wish we all had a little cupid of our own.  The thing I didn't like about this book was how AJ found love then turned on it.  This book takes a lot of time and understanding to read,  I suggest if you don't like to read and just decided to read this book because it was the only one left on the shelf, find something new because this book may not be for you
