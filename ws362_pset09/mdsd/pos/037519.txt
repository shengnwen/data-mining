In an article in Country music magazine, they interviewed Larry the Cable Guy.He said that he had to learn ow to talk in a redneck accent.He even attended a good college.Larry the Cable guy isn't all of the redneck you peopl think he is.Though he is a fake, I've got to admit....the man is funny.Overall I think he is an intelligent man and I strongly suggest that you buy this book if you like sexual humor.I wouldn't suggest this book or any of his books,cds,etc. to kids under 13.He uses language and sexual themes.So your call.Git-R-Done!
