I particilarly like de Lint's Newford stories and novels but this very special collection of stories with varied settings is an excellent choice for adolescents, their teachers, libraries and schools.  This wonderful short story anthology is de Lint's short fiction with teen protagonists.  There's two Maisie Flood stories that take place in Newford; she's just off the street herself, but lives with an adult developmentally disabled man Tommy and a great number of castoff dogs ("Waifs and Strays" and "But for the Grace Go I").  "Stick" takes place in Bordertown.  The eponymous martial arts expert defends a halfling from some Bloods, the band Horn Dance to defend him in turn, with music.  "There's No Such Thing" and "Sisters" are charming, funny and a little sad teenage vampire stories set around Ottawa
