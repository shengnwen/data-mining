I had no idea what this book was about when I bought it.  It was years ago now, and I was given a list of "Good Books" to read as a present: A deck of cards, each card representing a great work in American Literature that everyone should read.  This was one of the books.  I liked it a lot. At the time, I had no idea who Capote was (I still don't) and it wasn't until recently when movie after movie keeps coming out about this "Capote" character that I realized he was the author of this book.  It's a good book, and a well-told story, but I don't see why Capote has recently been thrown up on a pedestal and worshiped by Hollywood. Regardless, this book is worth your time
