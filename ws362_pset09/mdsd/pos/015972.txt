This edition of the book, ISBN 2266087594, is not an adaptation, has no vocabulary, no writing excercises, and no English anywhere.  The review below is of a different edition.

This book does have footnotes that explain historical references, maps showing the travels of D'Artagnan, and sections talking about historical context and structure of the text.  To be honest, I did not find all this extra information useful, but it was there if I wanted to look at it.  This edition is "texte integral", meaning that it includes the entire text, even a preface and appendix written by Dumas that are not part of the main story.

Dumas is an inventive and entertaining story teller, and Les Trois Mousquetaires is on of his better books.  Recommended
