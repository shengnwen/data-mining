This is a GOOD BOOK.  Not a great book, but a Good Book.  It reads very well and is hard to put down.  Written as a narrative, it is not an analytical book that is going to hit you with a lot of numbers, facts, theories, etc..   What it lacks in details, it makes up for in it's ability to bring to life an era of American history that is little understood.   

This book covers the War of 1812 in moderate detail and gives you good insight as to who the key players were during this time and what was taking place in the country.  The book begins around 1805 and progresses into the reasons for the war and then picks apart indivudual "chapters" of the war as if unfolded.  It discusses different conflicts on land and sea;  in Washington and London; Low points and high points; conspiracy and intrigue.  

You should experience quite a few "Wow, I did not know that" moments with this book.  

In 1812 America was at a point in her existence where the "Founding Father" leadership was retiring from the scene and the first new generation of leadership was beginning to take root.  There was a strong push for Imperialism.  It is amazing to see how bold this country was, yet how blind America was to itself as a unified nation, as a member of the world, and how blind she was to her weaknesses.  

Before reading this book, I like many Americans, was very unsure on what the war of 1812 was about and what significance it held for this country.  

The Revolution gave us America, but the War of 1812 completed the creation of this country and forced it to mature early and make changes and decisions that have brought us to where we are today.  

Without the War of 1812, America may not have grown into being a world power so soon or even survived intact to the 20th century.
