I sympathize with readers who found some plot elements confusing--I'm not sure I've worked it all out myself--but, regardless, I found this to be one of the most beautiful novels I've read in a long time, and one of the most moving.

I'd highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys good writing and wants to get pulled into another world
