I bought this book after watching the PBS special and buying her defense day cream (SPF 30) and her amazing exfoliating facial pads.  Both products are wonderful.  As I finish up the current line of cosmetics I am using, I am moving into her skin care line.

The book is quite an eye opener.  First and foremost, she does not pad it with filler.  She gives you the true scoop on Growth Hormones, middle age hormones, menopausal skin, botox, fake botox - you name it, she gives you the hard hitting truth to products and services we all fall prey to.

She provides information for every type of skin - normal, dry, combination, oily, etc.  From the lightest to the darkest complexion, she chronicles every problem and its solution.

Dr. Denese also provides some interesting facts on diets and stress and the impact to our skin.  Some things are basic, but some of the information regarding blood insulin regulation was new to me.

Dr. Denese chronicles her own mistakes in caring for her skin, as well as patients who come to her clinic.

I truly believe this is the best written and most up to date book on skin care right now.  And I believe her line of skin care can work for everyone.

Her complete skin care line is sold on QVC and on various internet sites.

I highly recommend her products and this book
