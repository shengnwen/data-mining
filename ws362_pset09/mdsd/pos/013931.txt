Naval and WWII buffs will find this book quite informative. A missing chapter of WWII has been written by Peszke. He starts with the Polish Navy's development between the world wars and provides the background for  its WWII activities. Serving as a separate national force in the Royal Navy  for most of WWII, the Polish Navy played a substantial role for its size.  Its officers and men crewed destroyers, submarines and mine warfare  vessels. They fought in the Mediterranean, English Channel, Atlantic and  Arctic Oceans, and Norway. Accounts of battles, personal profiles and plans  for a future navy make for interesting reading. Of particular value are the  appendices which include a list of major naval units.    THE FORGOTTEN FEW:  THE POLISH AIR FORCE IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR by Adam Zamoyski is a  complement to Peszke's work.    With Poland now a free nation, it can be  expected that additional unbiased information about its part in WWII will  be forthcoming
