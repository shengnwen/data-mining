This books is one of my favorites and how anyone can criticize it, I'll never know. This is a must read for everyone who can. Those who find period pieces hard to read because of the language (regional, colloquial and/or jargon)shouldn't let that deter them from reading this novel. If you need to look up words, do , but don't pass on this book
