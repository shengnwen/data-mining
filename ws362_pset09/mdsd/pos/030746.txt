This book is an excellent training manual.  It focuses on specific training for specific events (from 5 Km to the marathon) and gives you remarkably predicatable results regardless of your level. I tried a couple  of the programs because I was skeptical.  The results that they promised  were too good to be true given the little amount of training needed.  I  succeeded every time.  I am amazed at how little is required to achieve a  goal if you focus on the correct principles at the correct times. The book  also gives a detailed background on the training methods and scientific  principles involved so you are not just following a training 'recipe'  without understanding it. I have been running for many years and didn't  think I could run faster.  This book has shown me how to do it and also,  how to do it with far less effort!  This is by far the best  running/training manual that I have read
