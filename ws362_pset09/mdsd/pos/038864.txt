In 1950, Joe McCarthy started telling USAmericans that there was a Great Communist Conspiracy that had infiltrated the U.S. govt., the Press, the churches, you name it.  One of his prime exhibits was the AMERASIA case,  where what started as an espionage conspiracy suddenly, mysteriously  collapsed.  &quot;It's true,&quot; said the Right and the Republicans.  &quot;Nonsense you're all paranoids,&quot; said Democrats, liberals, and  the Left.  Now, thanks to Klehr and Radosh, we have the truth, and it is  stranger than anything either side ever suspected.  There were multiple,  independent, overlapping conspiracies, at AMERASIA magazine (to spy for  Stalin),in the State Dept. (to undermine FDR's China Policy), in the  Communist movement (to shape U.S. policy) in the Justice Dept. (to cover up  political embarrassments) and in Congress (to cover up the other  conspiracies).  Had the truth been told then, we might have been spared  some of the worst political messes of modern times.  Highly Recommended
