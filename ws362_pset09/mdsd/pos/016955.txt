I recommend this book for anyone who has kids.  Especially if you are or forsee yourself going through any type of custody decision or change of any kind.  Some of the information is common sense and secondhand.  Some of it we have already tried and failed and/or succeeded.  But the majority of it is stuff we never even thought about....    

Fantastic book...   I bought the first copy for my husband...  He is going through an ongoing custody "MESS" on a regular basis.  Our attorney requested a copy and I bought it for her also.  She also praises the book.
