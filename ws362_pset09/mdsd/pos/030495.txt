If you just want a good, quick yarn, in a historic setting, but not too long ago, Parnassus will do the trick. I bought a beat-up, very old and soiled copy of Parnassus on Wheels from the outside bin of a used book store. I was attracted by the title alone. It's the story of how the retiring owner of a turn-of-the-century horse-drawn bookmobile persuades a dutiful author's sister to step away from her housekeeping life to be a countryside book peddler. Adventure and romance ensues. I read it in one afternoon. It is not Henry Esmond, Middlemarch or any of my other epic favorites, but I can't seem to forget it, and recommend it to friends whenever I get a chance. It was just a pleasure to read. It's a splendid little gift to yourself
