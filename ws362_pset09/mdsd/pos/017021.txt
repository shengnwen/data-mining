After reading the book of Revelation in the Bible, I have always been intrigued about prophecy. But Revelation can be hard to understand because it can be unclear what certain things mean and can be misinterpreted. Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins do a wonderful job putting things in perspective. Everything is laid out and in plain english. I pray for those who will be left behind and I plan to prepare a kit for everyone close to me, just incase they are here when the Lord takes the Christians in the Rapture. That kit will contain, amongst other things, this book, so that they can read and understand what is happening. It is my way to pass on knowlege to those who might be lost.
