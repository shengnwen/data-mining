This book is fast paced and really easy to read. You'll be in the plot almost all the time and also you'll learn something about the Navajo culture. The plot is not quite thrilling and it repeat itself about the slaying of a police officer in 1998 so because of this you'll have many inklings about the book's end. The end is a little lame but you'll have a good reading with this one.
