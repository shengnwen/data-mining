I've lost count how many times I've read this book, I loved it that much. At first reading of the Harry Potter books I was intrugied, but still couldn't quite understand the crazed obession I was witnessing around me. But that all changed the moment I open this book. I was gripped from the first mention of the elusive Sirius Black and rarley put it down from then on. This book was so much darker than the others...Harry's fLair for his childish misadventures were long gone, he was faced now with true danger, and the true darkness of the story began to set in. 

The characters gain much more depth, and new wonderful one are introduced. Sirius Black quickly become my favorite literary character of all time. Each time I read this book I am moved to chills and tears
