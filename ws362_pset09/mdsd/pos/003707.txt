This book was exactly what the author describes in the prologue; a brief overview of a very complex subject.  It touches on all the major names and dates involved, but it is more concerned with giving an overall feel for the trends and changes that took place over long periods that result in the situation the middle east is in today.  In that regard, it succeeds admirably.  You will probably want to pick up several more books on the middle east after reading this one, just to get more info on different events or time periods, but it is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in the subject
