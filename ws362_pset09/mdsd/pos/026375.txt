I have been using this for about 4 months with my 3 and 5 year old boys.  We love the entire experience we get from this book.  Always having loved reading, this book has triggered a deep desire and great enjoyment in finding and reading good books to my boys, and then doing the related activities.  I'm asked several times a day if we can do more activites for whichever book we are currently on
