first things first- asthetically, this book is beautiful. the pictures look like something out of a fairy tale, with cakes decorated with fluffy frosting and fresh flowers. 

if this were just a coffee table book, it would be fine, but the recipes are a little off the mark. the gingerbread cake with chocolate frosting is a fantastic idea and the flavors work well, but my cake was runny and too soft. (given, my oven is like something out of prehistoric times, so it could be that too) the simple 1-2-3-4 vanilla cupcakes are actually quite good, one of the few vanilla cake recipes i've tried that doesn't end up tasting kind of like cornbread. however, all it takes is 2 minutes of refrigeration and they're hard as rocks. in general, this book is fun to own and the pictures are inspiring, but most of the recipes require a little messing with to make a product as beautiful as the images shown in the book
