I used American Son as the end of year text in my 10th grade English class at a low-performing, multicultural high school in San Diego. The students read it in class and then discussed it in small groups, applying theme words like alienation, assimilation, family, loyalty.  I can say little more than this: some of the books were stolen; students who never read begged to take the book home to finish it; many students said they had never read a book that felt more real.  These students were stunned that such honesty existed inside a book. Filipino students came uncorked and reveled in the accuracies. Yes! came from faces and voices as if deep secrets had been told.The figurative language is brilliant.  The characters are amazingly complex, particularly the mother who is as much villian as saint.  Just like life
