Yes, it is a very good book. However, I knocked off a star for the following:

1. It sells its website RiteSite.com SO HARD that the book at times comes off as being somewhat of a written infomercial.

2. The use of so many bold-faced words in varying font types and sizes I found distracting and unprofessional.

Other than these minor issues, the book is a MUST! It does a good job without bias in explaining the contingency and retained recruiting side of the business. The tips I got from this book alone was well worth its cost.

Note - One solid advice that should be mentioned in this book in the next edition is the following - headhunters use tracking software. So if you are registered on sites like HotJobs and Monster and allow cookies to be read, it is possible under certain circumstances that they can see which companies and opportunities you're interested in. My guess is so they can "float" your resume there and put a price tag on your head. And if you think they can't get a hold of your resume, these headhunters do talk to each other. Bottom line - Network! Network! Network!. And if a recruiter cold calls you, tell them to speak to the dial tone! Ha
