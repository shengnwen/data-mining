This book is highly entertaining. I am a HUGE fan of Judy Blume; she has written some of my favorite books. While this was a good book, I would have to say that I prefer Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great and Superfudge. This was still highly enjoyable and had a few laugh-out-loud funny parts. And who cares if it is a little unrealistic? What's wrong with a silly read every once in awhile? So anyway, I give it 4 stars. 

Another great book by Judy Blume is Iggie's House
