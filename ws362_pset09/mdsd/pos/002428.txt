But I still like him and I like this book. Why? Well, it's not because I like Dubya who is arguably the worst president of this century. It's because Zell Miller is a throw back to better days, to days when democrats were normal instead of raving, leftist lunatics worshipping at the altar of Karl Marx. Remember the days when democrats repped the blue collar working man? When they fought for humane working conditions in factories and meat packing plants? Hell if it weren't for democrats we might still be working 18 hour days, 7 days a week. And we wouldn't be enjoying vacation days either. Unfortunately, today's dem agenda truly manifests itself as a sad deficit of decency. Pushing for sick homosexual "marriage" and indoctrinating our young kids with homosexual children's books in school, pushing for massive illegal immigration to establish an indomitable voter base, extolling the NAMBLA-backing ACLU, placing ACLU leftist Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court, covering alcoholics and drugs addicts under the ADA, extending welfare benefits to massive numbers of trashy, lazy reproductive offenders with multiple illegitimate kids, seeking to legalize dangerous drugs, foisting people like Afrocentrist whacko Cynthia McKinney and the coddled, entitled, self-pitying Patrick Kennedy and his disgraceful father on our country, and on and on. Time was Democrats and Republicans shared many opinions, but no more. The Deficit of Decency among leftist democrats has made that impossible. I wonder if anyone else senses this country circling the drain, particularly with both parties pushing for the rights of illegal mexicans over the welfare of the United States. I also wonder if Zell has finally recognized Bush's complete and utter incompetence.
