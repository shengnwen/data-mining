Going Solo is the great story that Roald Dahl adventured throughout his young life. Roald Dahl accomplished many things once he was able to do things on his own. Mainly the book is about himself traveling all over Europe and Africa just trying to experience as much as he could. He travels all over the bottom of Europe and works way down and around Africa staying at many non civilized villages and getting to know many natives. At the time he is working for the Shell Oil Company until he finally quits. In East Africa he also is endangered with a near fatal death with a Green Mamba , one of the most deadly snakes. Roald also has a passion for the air force, and ends up joining the RAF. Going Solo is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read, with the nonstop climax's and so many near death experiences. This is a very descriptive book with so many heroic twist that can keep anyone's attention. Roald Dahl is very famous for most of his work such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but this book is amazing because this all actually happened to writer in real life. The greatest part about the Roald Dahl in Going Solo is that he never gave up, even after a plane crash that he should not have been able to live after.  He was told that he would be blind for the rest of his life, but about a month later he started to gain his sight back. I feel that this book is a miracle
