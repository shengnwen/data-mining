If you are a user or provider of training, High Impact Training is a must read. In my experience as an organizational psychologist, I see few tools more misused than training.  Lapidus has identified the root causes of most  of those failures and has prescribed a systematic solution to many ways  that the training solutiuon can go wrong.  The book is clearly written,  laced with stories that elucidate the importance of the approach Lapidus  takes.  He integrates the whole in a model that makes it easy to program a  training approach and get results.  There is no wasted fluff in this book.  Every page has value.  Its just like all other wisdom, however, we'll have  to apply it to get the results
