This is a great inspirational book that will give you practical ideas for how to spread kindness in the world.  I picked this book up on a whim while browsing in the bookstore a few years ago, and I keep it at work to remind me of the need to do nice things just because you want the world to be better.  

There are lots of books that talk about doing good from a selfish point of view, sometimes politely called "enlightened self-interest", but this is motivational book for people who want to be altruistic and intrinsically good.  If you want to reach Maslow's fifth level, then this is a book for you
