A Great Improvisation is an involving take on Franklin's years in France during America's Revolutionary-era. Schiff meticulously sets the stage of 18th century Paris, a political free-for-all run on gossip and intrigue, and onto it drops ersatz diplomat and international superstar Benjamin Franklin.
From the first pages, the author's research is clearly voluminous if not exhaustive. The reader slaloms through minute detail about the causes and ramifications of decisions made by Franklin, Adams, Vergennes, and a host of others, ranging from the eminent to the absurd. The minutiae frequently spill out of the prose and into footnotes that sometimes remind the reader of a favorite professor's pithy, humorous asides, but are often of a dry complexity more at home in a textbook.
The narrative manages to draw the reader into the humanity and drama of history and politics. The reader becomes acquainted with a flawed and harried Franklin, whose fame and personal relationships can confound him as much as help him. The man is sympathetic as he struggles to be understood in language and culture substantially alien to him, but remains luminous in his ability to engineer an alliance between a superpower and a fractious band of provinces. The interpersonal conflict and diplomatic near-misses create genuine suspense over a series of events already known to the reader.
When marshaled correctly, the historical detail and insight into the lives and character of the players is magical. But at times, the prose trips over the ponderous detail to yield paragraphs that remind the reader of Franklin's gout. Revolutionary-history aficionados will have a strong opinion (one way or the other) about its treatment of Franklin in Paris, but should bear in mind that this solid work is not a casual read
