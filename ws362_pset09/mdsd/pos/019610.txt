Received this book out of the blue from a seller on Amazon who bundled this with an order I placed.  Tossed it aside for half a year before I sat down to read it last night and did NOT put it down until the last page -- then went back to the beginning once more.  Touching, warm, creative, full of personality.  At worst, it's entertaining.  Do read it
