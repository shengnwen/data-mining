Sacvan Bercovitch, Powell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature at Harvard University, presents in this important book an analysis of what he refers to as the "rhetoric of American identity" through the "sources of our obsessive concern with the meaning of America" (p. ix). He uses one central case study to explore this issue, "Nehemias Americanus," Cotton Mather's biography of John Winthrop, first published in 1702. In Winthrop Mather discovered not only "a reliable model of christic identity" (p. 24) but also the "idea of the exemplary American" (p. 35). This is especially because of Winthrop's sense of progress, wherein a "redemptive history" merged personal worth with national mission. Puritans, in Bercovitch's vision, saw themselves as "American Israelites, the sole reliable exegetes of a new, last book of scripture" (p. 113). He argues that Cotton Mather, perhaps the epitome of the Puritan thinker, assigned America the status of a "microcosm of the worldwide work of redemption, and macrocosm of the redemptive work underway in each of its chosen people" (p. 134). This blending of personal story--essentially a spiritual biography--with a national prophecy and mission has been a persistent theme in American history and was first apparent in the writings of the early American Puritans. 

Bercovitch goes a step further with his analysis, however, by noting that this Puritan approach to personal/national identity provided a handy but complex structure for later generations to think of their place in the world. The result was a belief in human perfectibility and a strong utopian impulse in Ameri�can intellectual thought and political tradition. From Tho�mas Jefferson's stirring statement in the Declaration of Independence that people must work to ensure that all receive their unalienable rights of "Life, Lib�erty and the pursuit of Happiness," to the sense of destiny in recent America, the quest for a better world has been a major subtext of every aspect of American life. As Bercovitch shows this strain of thought offers a "celebration of the representative self as America, and of the American self as the embodiment of a prophetic universal design" (p. 136).

"The Puritan Origins of the American Self" is a difficult reading experience. It uses the language of hermeneutics in its analysis and routinely employs such jargon as "auto-American-autobiography." More importantly, some may appropriately conclude that Bercovitch overstates his case, questioning if the Puritan mindset permeated American character to the degree he claims. Even so, this is required reading for students of early American history. It offers an important interpretation of the intellectual legacy of Puritan thought on the United States
