An actual translation of a Chinese detective novel, this is good fun for mystery buffs, and especially for anyone familiar with van Gulik's Judge Dee series.  

The Judge, with his familiar retinue, faces three puzzling mysteries.  Some elements of this are reworked in later Dee novels:  the poisoned-bride story inspired part of THE CHINESE GOLD MURDERS and the killer widow story was lifted and slightly altered for THE CHINESE NAIL MURDERS.  

Nevertheless, this is a breath of fresh air for those who want something different.  Readers curious about Chinese culture will appreciate the text and the notes, and will enjoy a good, readable translation.

To start on the fictional Judge Dee novels, start with THE CHINESE GOLD MURDERS
