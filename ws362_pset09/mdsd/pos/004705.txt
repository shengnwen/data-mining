This book is a down to earth approach to addressing what isn't working right in your life. It is a step by step process for disciplined positive change. The point is not simply to make A change, but to do the due diligence to ensure it is a RIGHT change for you. I especially liked the exercises to explore which of several alternatives is the best choice. The process adds a bit of science to a profoundly personal area
