   Have you read the book Frindle? I have and I can tell you straight from my heart that Frindle is a very interesting book. It's one of the best books I have read in a long time!
 The main characters in this book are: NIck, a trouble maker, Janet, Mrs. Granger, and Nick's parents. Janet, a dependable person, takes the blame when Nick made a high peep sound. Then, Nick is about to enter fifth grade and then he finds a letter in the mailbox from Mrs. Granger. The contents of the letter said that Nick should have a very good dictionary at home so he can do his homework properly. Next, Nick thought he could pull a fast one on Mrs. Granger. Nick asked a time-waster question that declared whether they would have homework or not. One thing that Nick wasn't aware that Mrs. Granger knew exactly what Nick was trying to do. Nick failed and since Mrs. Granger knew what he was doing. Nick ha dto write an oral report about dictionaries that was due that next day. Does the story sound interesting so far? If it does, go to your local library and check out Frindle today!!!
   In closing, I would recommend this book to anyone no matter what age. Please, take my advise and read Frindle!
