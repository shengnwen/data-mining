If you were to check out my reading journal you'd see an AWFUL lot of Ruth Rendell in it, as she's one of the most consistently wonderful writers I've ever encountered. Then again, if you're checking out my reading journal I'd need to have a strong word with you, as I'm not quite sure I've given you permission.

_Master of the Moor_ is absolutely fan-tabulously well-written, and what's best about it is the denouement is revealed very, very slowly. There's no sudden "Whoops!  Surprise, it's a psychopath!" here. It's one long, slow build up to a conclusion you hopefully won't have anticipated, though after you close the book you may find yourself feeling rather silly you missed the clues.  But don't feel too silly, as I missed them, too.

Wonderful stuff
