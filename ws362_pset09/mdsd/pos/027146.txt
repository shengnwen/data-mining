I have duck hunted for 25 years and for 22 of them I had only vague guesses at most species of duck I was shooting at. Not any more! I can identify most species of duck from flight level &amp; style long before  they come into gunning range. In hand identification is even better. Le  Masters uses bill/plumage identification. I have not shot one duck that we  could not identify using this book. I cannot say enough good things about  it. The best $7 you'll ever spend for duck hunting. Ladies give your  husband a gift he will absolutely love
