I'll Be Home for Christmas is an excellent collection of four holiday stories sure to warm the hearts of any romance reader. 

All four stories are wonderful, but my favorites are You Can Count on Me by Roxanne St. Claire and Meltdown by Julie Leto.

You Can Count on Me is a short Bullet Catcher story so I read it first. It's so wonderful. A female body guard sent to protect a little girl who has a gorgeous mysterious father. Sigh. 
Roxanne St. Claire is one of the best writers out there. Don't miss this one.

Meltdown the kind of sexy romance I've come to expect from Julie Leto. 
Passionate and fabulous!
