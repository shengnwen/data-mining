I was looking for something fresh and original when a friend told me about Imperial Mongolian Cooking.  My curiosity got the better of me and I found I loved the book and the recipes.  This is a very unusual cooking in concept, because it explores the cookery of Genghis Khan's empire, which included two dozen countries, but the recipes are carefully selected, easy to follow and just terrific.  Loved it.  Would I recommend it?  Absolutely
