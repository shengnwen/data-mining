I enjoyed this book so when I wrote a review about it I wrote: &quot; Not understanding the times of the First Century, we often misread or misinterpret the actual Scriptures. For example, when Paul is described by  physical appearance, we read this as a non-flattering description. If we  had read Suetonius's description of the Emperor Augustus, we would realize  that small stature, a bent nose, and eyebrows meeting are a positive,  laudatory view of the person! Paul has been described as having all of  these.&quot; For the rest of my thoughts please visit my Amazon Associate  review site, The CRITICAL REVIEW.    www.criticalreviews.co
