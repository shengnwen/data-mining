I've wanted to take up yoga for a couple of years now, and this was the book that finally helped me to get started.  It is very comprehensive in its exposition of the fundamentals of yoga, and the numerous illistrations  really help you feel sure that what you're doing is right, which could be a  concern if you are practicing by yourself.    However, I would have liked  to see a longer section on yoga diet.     Nevertheless, I recommend the  book to anybody that is even remotely interested in yoga.  The pieces of  yoga history, proverbs, and inspirational thought will give you insight  into that teaching, which has survived ancient times and has reached our  modernity as relevant as ever.     And even as you become more  knowledgeable and proficient in yoga, and buy other readings, this one is  bound to remain a good companion of yours for years
