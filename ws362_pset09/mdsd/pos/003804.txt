I purchased this book at a used book sale, and had it on my nightstand for two years before I picked it up.  When I finally read it, I fell in love with it.  I passed it on to my boyfriend -- who's no big fan of fiction -- and he read it, then read it again immediately.  I have since purchased probably ten copies of the book.  I have a first edition, a signed first edition, a reading copy, and the rest have been purchased for gifts.  I am an avid reader, but I'm pretty certain I've bought more copies of this book than any other book.  It's a very different kind of book, but I'd recommend it to just about anyone.  Anyone who's up for an adventure of a book.  "You's all mine, Fishboy.
