Decoding the puzzle of language is inherently part of the fun of reading a Terry Bisson story, which often relies on adept liguistic manipulation to convey ideas as well as to establish mood.  When he sets out to write a story, TB is always clear in his own mind what he is going to get said. Before the end of the story you realize that he's also a good storyteller with a totally original mind.

Greetings: & Other Stories finds this skilled veteran at the peak of his strength working in the medium of the literary short story.  Serious, totally honest, deeply felt.  An excellent read
