I love Clare Beaton's illustrations!  This one follows a little dog asking all sorts of baby animals what a baby kangaroo is called.  My kids are always entertained by this book, and I could look at her amazing fabric art for hours!!  This is actually not my most favorite book to read aloud, a lot of repetition, but it doesn't deter the kids and they start to say it with me.  Try, How Big is a Pig or There's a Billy Goat in the Garden.  Those are my favorites!
