Through well-known lives in politics and art, Graham demontrates  alcoholism is a disease creating disaster for both abusers and victims.  He  fairly convincingly paints alcoholism not as a symptom but a cause of  physical and psychic pain.  Graham intimates but does not state the obvious  collarary that the patient is morally obligated to seek help.  Great work  for a layman but I wish he had consulted/cowritten with a psychiatrist
