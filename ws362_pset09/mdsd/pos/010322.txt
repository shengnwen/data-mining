I ordered this Bible for my daughter.  She and another girl in her youth group here in Sweden (we are Americans serving over seas) shared it with some of the other girls and it has actually become top of the other girls wish lists for their birthdays!  It has practical stories the girls can relate to and thought provoking questions that are appropriately worded.  Other bibles I have looked at sometimes discuss things in ways that I would prefer talking to my daughter about.  This uses the Word only!  Great Word of God!
