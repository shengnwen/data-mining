I just finished this one last night.
This is a light read, but gives interesting insights into the man and how his faith connects to his presidency.
Unlike the writers of most of the negative reviews, I actually read this book.
The bias liberal media tries to brainwash us into believing that George W. Bush is not intelligent. It is not true.
Despite the millions upon millions of dollars spent on smearing the president, he won the election.

That deeply hurts the liberals.
Take a look at the other reviews done by these sore losers.
They don't read these books; they just go from one political book to another, spewing more of their liberal lies.

To them I say, maybe you should actually sit down and read a book before you review it, because you're current poison tactics aren't working.
