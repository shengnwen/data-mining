A very challenging and provoking story of God's current move amoung the Chinese house church.  It deeply touched me and I felt &quot;connected&quot; to the vision of these remarkable people.  I would like to be captivated by the same passion they have.  I would encourage anyone with a true love for Jesus to read this book
