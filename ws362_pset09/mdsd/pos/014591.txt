This is a darling book and it is great that it's finally in board book form. It is a bigger size than lots of other board books, but it is still good for little hands.  The story is the original with all the original pictures and everything, but it's now able to be chewed and the pages can't be torn off! I look forward to my daughter reading it for years to come
