Being a Star Wars geek, when I read about how Visionaries is a bunch of side stories filling in the gaps before and after Episode III, I knew I had to get it. The only picture I saw of it was Darth Maul with his new mechanical lower body and longer horns. It looked a little goofy, and I couldn't take him seriously this way, but I still gave it a shot. Sure enough, the book is pretty cool. The majority of the comics are well done, and the diversity of the artwork is all over the place. Even casual fans are bound to find something in this book that they'll like. Be it seeing Darth Maulester make a come-back, a certain General in non-Droid form, or a showcase of Palpatine's power once he fully embodies the dark side. But there are some pretty poor pieces that I felt should've been left out. If this book was a series of contest winners for adding more to the Star Wars universe, they'd be the runners up for the consolation prize. They were just that bad.

Seeing as how this is a collection of comic shorts, there isn't much I can tell you about without giving away how some of them end. But at the same time, this is another reason I took off a star- some of the stories are too short. A great example is the first one: Old Wounds, where Darth Maul comes back to take care of Obi-Wan. It's all of 12 pages, and the fight doesn't even last that long. While it was nice to bring the guy back, it's almost a tease. Here was pretty much the best fighter in the Star Wars films, and he goes down fairly fast. That isn't really ruining the story for you. We all know Obi-Wan lives to make it to Episode IV. And he seems almost too old in this comic, dispite just being 3 years after Episode III. But enough with the gripes, the other comics are:

-The Artist of Naboo
-Wat Tambor and the Quest for the Sacred Eye of the Albind Cyclops
-Sithisis
-Entrenched
-The Fourth Precept
-Prototypes
-Imperial Recruitment
-Deep Forest
-Celestia Galactica
-The Eyes of Revolution

Actually, Imperial Recruitment is just two one-page drawings of recruitment ads for the Imperial army with two vixens posing- one in a TIE Fighter flight suit. The Artist of Naboo is about an artist who paints things he has visions about. One of these, is Padme. Eventually, he meets her, and makes a life changing decision regarding her. This comic is done in a beautiful painting style. It's detailed, yet very messy. Having no real knowledge of the types of paints out there, this is either in oil or water colors...or both. Wat Tambor is just plain stupid, and I don't want to waste time remembering what it's about. I mean, just the name alone gives you the idea that it'd fit in better in a Science Mysteries comic or something from the 60s. Sithisis, however, is awesome. There is no text or dialogue to be found, and it revolves around Palpatine using his destructive powers all over the galaxy. I especially like how they drew Yoda for this- he reminded me of Oro from Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike. There's a sketchy style about this one. Entrenched throws us on Hoth during Episode V when the Rebels are holding their own against the AT-AT walkers while others evacuate. It's mostly about one soldier who's narrating what's going on to his mom. I have no idea what The Fourth Precept is about, but it's done in a beautiful style, but more modern. Think back to the covers of WitchBlade or something, and that's how the quality is on each page. This one is very short, but it's understandable with how much time must've went into the drawings. If you've seen the Clone Wars animated series, then Prototypes is for you. The unstoppable bounty hunter, Durge, is here...but before he became the mindless killer we see in the cartoon. This has a rough, 70's noir look to it. Deep Forest is an all-out Wookiee fight as they protect their planet from different forces. I don't really like the style of drawing in this one- too many colors don't match, and aren't within the lines of what they represent. Go ahead and tell me, "it's not like there are rules to art", but this one didn't look good to me. Celestia Galactica is a bunch of different one-page art pieces of different things. I particularily liked the Rancors attacking an Imperial base. These would make for great creative writing pieces for geeky teachers out there. Finally, The Eyes of Revolution gives us a General who is the last hope for a planet. But, his ship doesn't make it to its destined location, and he nearly dies. Count Dooku is there to recover him, and the general is in turn, transformed into General Grievous. This one has fantastic art, and will quench the thirst of those who wished for him to seem less clumsy in the movie, and more like the one-man army we saw in the Clone Wars animated series.

Whew. After typing this up, it seems like there's a lot more, but the book's just 132 pages. Some of which aren't even comics. Dispite some mistakes like Wat Tambor, I'd say this is worth a purchase. Or if all else fails, just read the whole thing at the book store. It's worth it. I do wish the price was a bit less though
