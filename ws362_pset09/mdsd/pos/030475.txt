I won't lie, I have never had a child. Nevertheless, the future possibility is there. I read this memoir only because it was assigned for a literature class I am taking. The only reason I didn't make a big stink about having to do so was because I had already read Cusk's "The Country Life," which was brilliant on a number of different levels.
I must confess that I am surprised at some of the earlier reviewers who gave this book a bad or unfavorable rating. I don't like to be presumptuous, but it seems like most of them were just pissed because it did not make them feel all warm and fuzzy inside. This book was not the first case in which I have heard of women finding new motherhood to be something akin to the ninth circle of hell. The problem is, people think it is some kind of taboo to say (or write) aloud that you have fantasies about killing your kid (not literally of course!)
The fact of the matter is this: Rachel Cusk is perhaps one of the best contemporary writers going. She is a smart woman and a smart writer. If you want a peaches and cream how-to manual, run the other way. However, if you want a brutally honest and often times humorous look at the trials and tribulations of new motherhood, pick it up and give it a try. She might rant a bit about the unfairness of new motherhood at times, but her adoring love for her daughter is blatantly clear. Anyone who claims never to have had such chaotic feelings is likely lying to herself.
