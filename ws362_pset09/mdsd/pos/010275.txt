I thought the pigman is a great book to read. I like it because they talk about a lot of topics like on teens for example. I thought when John, Lorraine and the others did the telephone marathon it was cute yet mischeivious in a way. I also thought it was sort of cheesy.

The saddest part of the book was when the pigman died. He didn't deserve to. And Bobo too. I thought that was sad too. Anyway pigman is the best!
