A friend recommended this author's book and after reading the story I was thrilled that she did!  "Echoes from the Infantry," by talented new writer, Frank Nappi, is a story that had me so emotionally involved, I had trouble putting it down once I began I began reading it.  It is a thought-provoking tale of life, love and a war that lasted far longer than the actual war.  I am more than happy to recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this genre.  I know you will enjoy this story as much as I did
