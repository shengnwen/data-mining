I had read about most of these tribes in the past in web searches and other references.
That is why I fault the illustrations ( the stone tools look noting like their actual pictures)  and that there isn't a better coverage of tool, housing and food sources. The language groups are well covered and their relationship are made pretty clear.
I was looking for my local California Indians that are in San Diego County.
They are noticeably absent in this coverage or disguised pretty well.
Since most of this information is in my old 1950's World Book 
encyclopedia under different sections, I was hoping for a little more information here. I have to admit that it is a good reference source
