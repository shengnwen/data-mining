I wish I'd known how to do this in college!  

Mind Mapping is great tool with all sorts of uses and this book is short enough for anyone to learn how to do it.  Like most "life-hack" type tools, you'll get out of it what you put into it.  In other words, you have learn it and use it to get much benefit.  

I do recommend it for kids--it's a great, simple way to organize most writing assignments, speeches, and other projects.  They'll probably still have to do the old boring Roman numeral outlines, I suppose, but the mind-map can make that much easier, too!

So, Buzan's a bit grandiose--mind-mapping probably won't bring world peace, but hey, neither does anything else!
