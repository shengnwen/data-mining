This &quot;continuation&quot; of his How to Draw Comic Book Heroes and Villains really begins where the other lets off.  While his books are not for the true beginners who have never drawn in their lives, those who have  had a little experience would benefit greatly from the lessons contained  herein.  Musculature, character personality/posing, costuming, etc. are all  discussed in a friendly, user compatible way.  An excellent job, Chris, and  I can't wait for the next installment
