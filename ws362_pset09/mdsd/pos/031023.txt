I really like this book!  The pictures are beautiful, as are the descriptions.  Unfortunately, it doesn't neccesarily help me out!  I wanted it for a research book on costume, but there are so many years and styles  covered that it doesn't give me many specifics.  If used in conjunction  with another costume book, or if the buyer is just interested in general  costume, it's fine.  If the buyer is looking for something more detailed  and specific, try another book
