Shirley Hazzard writes beautifully choreographed stories that gently and carefully blossom like a flower. It isn't a book for everyone because it is definitely controlled in how it reveals itself and for some it initially may feel slow. If you do stick with it Hazzard will present some pearls of writing. She writes what might be on the surface very simple stories but her real knack lays in creating some of the most lush and acute metaphors and analogies about the human condition I have ever run across. I found myself writing down sentences and turns of phrases that were tossed off a bit lightly but hit the spot. I came across her work when reading an interview that had been done with her and it gave a keen glimpse into her writing as I was reading the book. This book in particular made me think of Carson McCullers and Truman Capote in the sense that they too wrote calculated stories that only the reader in as much as they thought was reasonable at a given time. Not everything is given away on the page but you can always feel how complex the emotions of the characters are. Fantastic book
