I purchased this book based on past reviewers to help me protect my personal energy and work space in my office rather than my home.  Although some of the ideas may seem far out, with repeated practice they do work.  A book I think perfectly complements this one is Energy Vampires: A Practical Guide for Psychic Self-protection by Dorothy Harbour
