This book deals mostly with primates. Despite the layperson style title, the book itself is quite scientific and detailed. This can be great for those educated in anthropology and sociobiology as it is very thorough,  giving exact names and evolutionary history on the primates discussed, yet  can seem a little dry to the layperson, especially if read for long  stretches. However, layperson, do not despair. Hrdy will often use humour  to lighten or better explain an idea and when she occasionally uses jargon  it is usually tongue-in-cheek and always explained. Many of you will be  attracted by the feminist-sounding title, but do not be fooled. Only rarely  does the author tie in her observations with human behaviour. In fact, any  feminism does not appear until the final 2% of the book and seems to simply  be angry raving against the oppression of women, and is not linked as well  as it could be to the previous 150 or so pages. Generally, however, I  enjoyed the book, even though it contained more detail than I, as a  layperson, actually needed. To anyone unhappy with the stereotype of the  strong male in charge of his passive harem of females or with the  aggressive male just using the females as a vessel for his genes, then this  can shed new light on the way primates behave and are shaped by their  biology. Tying in the information with the woman in the title is left up to  the reader
