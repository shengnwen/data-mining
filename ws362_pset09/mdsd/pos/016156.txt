I won't tell you what this book is about. I'll only say that it was very   well done, I couldn't stop reading it and that it started out being eerie and creepy without knowing why, but then it took a turn about half way through and it became what I can only describe as horrifying. I actually had a terrible nightmare about it, too. Bravo, Scott Smith!
