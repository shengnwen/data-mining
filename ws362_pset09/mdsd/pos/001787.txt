Great book. Very vivid descriptions of language, character and the family structure of non-native society in London. I feel that this book could explain the conflict any transplant could experience in a foriegn land. 
It almost explains, though, that once you have tasted the western world, there is no going back. 
Didn't care for the ending, though-- too much like a Wes Anderson movie where the players all congregate toward one spot rather unnaturally. 
If you desire wit, involved reading and changes in eras, White Teeth is definitely for you.
