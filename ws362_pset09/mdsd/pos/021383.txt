First off: fantastic concept similar in some ways to DC's "Kingdom Come." Secondly, though, the entire series, though brilliantly scripted, has some flaws that make the series less than it could've been. As I read I kept feeling that something was missing. That something was characterization of these futuristic Marvel heroes. 

We saw snatches of potential storylines with Iron Man, and more of Captain America and Reed Richards, but not nearly enough of the other heroes. Surely they had great stories to tell! Instead we had the incessant banter with the Watcher and "Machine Man." If half of that dialogue (the unnecesssary, redundant portions) had been cut, there would've been plenty of space for the stories of the other characters. At the end of each issue, there is more information about the characters--why not incorporate more of this into the story? 

So, overall, a great concept that was only partially realized. Oh, one more comment:the artwork is very dark. I personally like to see more detail and less black shadow. This is partly a matter of taste; however, toward the end, some of the art looks hastily slapped together.

Overall, I'd recommend it, but with reservations
