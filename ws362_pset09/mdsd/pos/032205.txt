This is a very serious and complete biography.  I bought this expecting something more for the masses, lots of rumor and sensationalism.  In fact, it's a very thoughtful book, with lots of detail and very little speculation, presenting many of the lesser known aspects of Houdini's life, including his campaign against spiritualism and fraudulent mediums, and his extraordinary physical prowess.  Not everything was a trick.  Many things he accomplished by sheer force of will.  Houdini was clearly much more multidimensional than portrayed in movies and popular references.  The book also includes many details on the culture and other celebrities of the time; the extensive information on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was especially interesting.  I give it 4 stars only for the fact that there are no footnotes or references.  I understand that the authors chose to put those on their Web site, but they're much less useful separated from the book they document
