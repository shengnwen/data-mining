This book really lit me up! I got a comprehensive and insider's view of this industry and how I can proceed in action! I now feel more confident to take my experiences in this industry from feelings of rejection, to feelings of empowerment. I loved the diversity of VO artists and their varied backgrounds, and of course, the juicy secrets they divulge. I'm so grateful for the clear understanding Secrets provided. Lastly- The Alzheimer's angle blended with the stories which I found compelling and fascinating. Thank you Joan Baker, David Hyde Pierce, and the other contributors of Secrets of Voice-Over Success; I now have great insight as I approach my career in this challenging field!
