This history of Aerosmith shows the incredible fortitude that is required to reclaim your throne.  Great to hear how it was from the beginning... in their own words and in the words of their friends, wives and lovers... all the drugs, sex, pain and loss. 

Steven is the consummate showman... always smarter than the next guy, always a ladies man. He is delicious, confusing and talented. In order to be a great singer, you must have charisma and attitude. It pours from Steven in buckets. 

No matter what you read or think about Aerosmith, good or bad, don't forget the amazing music this band has put out for decades. Keep going, guys. I'll always be a fan!
