While I don't think that the plot of this Marcus Didius Falco potboiler was the best of the series to date, the vast array of information presented the reader about First Century AD Rome and Greece is simply terrific.  For example, here is a rarely presented account of tourism in the classic age as well as much intriguing information about the Olympic Games, albeit in the Roman period.  The author, Lindsey Davis, is well acquainted with the subject of early travel, having sent Falco on the road many times before, but this book's setting in Greece is quite enjoyable on its own.  Also always enjoyable is the interplay between the members of Falco's family.  What's not to like?
