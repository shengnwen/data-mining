How to sum up such an assault on the eyes and mind as this book? Certainly, it's not for the prudish or faint-hearted, as Kramer's mass of gay characters indulge themselves in sex and drugs in 1970s New York. The descriptions leave little to the imagination. If ever you wondered what the seamier side of gay life is like, well here it is. Or, it might better be said "there it was" if things have really altered, given that the intervention of the AIDS epidemic separates Kramer's novel from today. 

That I suppose is the main nature of the legacy of the book: has the nature of gay men (rather than specific protective behaviour to reduce the risk of infection by HIV) really changed? Does what Kramer described typify gay attitudes, either then or now? The book targets the irreconcilable pursuit of sex (really as an addiction) with the wish to find a stable loving relationship. Actions compromise the wishes and hopes. Each of the characters is a hopeless sexual addict, seemingly doomed to an increasingly frustrated existence as they age - and all can see that coming but are powerless to alter their ways.

I can't believe that this picture is typical of all gay men, mainly because it is a stereotypical view of a varied "community", but not least because sex so freely available is utterly meaningless and boring - as the novel really illustrates. Nor, by the way, should anyone think that weird perversity is the sole reserve of gays! Rather, it seemed to me that the book was a critque of part of the gay world, the loudest but also the shallowest. 

As a read, it is an assault, there is an avalanche of characters, and it somewhat loses its steam and impact in the last third (almost inevitable given its high-octane start). Interesting though both as a period piece and perhaps as a not entirely irrelevant picture of today. 

By the way, I plead the 5th completely regarding the intimate details of this review!
