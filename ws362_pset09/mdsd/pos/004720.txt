I Really enjoyed this book, couldn't put it down. Every little chapter was full of funny and very realatable (if that is a word) items. I loved how she incorporated God in each chapter. I would recommend this book to every woman in America. I don't have my own children but to read about hers and how much she truly loves her family touched my heart. This is a must read!!!
