I have a very good background in science, psychology and Eastern thought.  I took Quantum Physics as a course in graduate school and have studied Eastern Religious thought for the last 25 years.  I read this book several years after it game out and picked it up again recently.

I think the two spotlight reviews cover a lot of ground and I don't want to repeat the same ideas.  However, I feel this book needs to be framed in terms of when it first came out.  It is historically significant because it put quantum physics on a lot of people's radar and got them thinking in new ways.

Since this book came out, many other good books have also been written and now maybe this isn't the best book for everyone.  However, it is still a solid, thought provoking introduction.  While it is repetitive in places, much of this repetition is useful and at the time was probably a contributor to helping bust an old paradigm.

I still like this book very much and think it is a good one for someone who is a layperson with an interest in this topic.  The ideas are fascinating and they are presented in an easy to understand manner.  I also think they do a good job of providing a short introduction to Eastern thought
