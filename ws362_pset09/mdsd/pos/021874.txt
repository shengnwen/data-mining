I just picked this book up in a bookstore in London, on the shelf of &quot;staff picks&quot; (which more and more, I am finding, can be a great source of referral).  It is a charming book- I don't think any of the reviews so far have liked it as much as I did.  In particular, the main character Eddie brings much as much insight and depth as humour to his rambling thoughts on how things ended up the way they did.  His great love for his depressed wife and singing daughter is one common theme throughout the book...and one feels like a genuine portrait is drawn, of a chemical engineer who adheres to high moral standards (therefore loses his job) and loves too much but cannot find ways to express it.  Yes there are lots of cliches and devises, people popping up like bad dreams, but its a story, right
