Anyone not already familiar with San Francisco will probably not increase his or her awareness with this book.  This is an anthology that includes excerpts, essays, and poems set in, about, around, or otherwise touching on San Francisco.  As such, the reader may be thrust into settings with no background, and the reader's own knowledge of and experience with The City (capital "t" capital "c", as the locals know it)will have to fill in the blanks.  In some cases the writing is about SF, but in many case the writing is about a subject with SF as the backdrop.  In any case, it works.  As an anthology this provides a great and varied selection, and if you see any of your favorite writers in the table of contents, you may encounter a rare piece of writing that you otherwise might not (like an enjoyable Kerouac piece on a job he held for a while; something from him other than an excerpt of On The Road).  Or, you may learn about an event that you otherwise know little of (the assasinations of Mayor Moscone and Harvey Milk).  If you love The City and/or any of the selected writers, try this book.  There are other books about other cities in this series (at least New Orleans and Los Angeles, I believe)
