Mowat is not only a scientist but also a social reformer. The fact is nature has been thrown out of balance in most areas in the North American continent because preditory animals have been eliminated. This past year, wolves have been reintroduced into Yellowstone. I wonder how much Mowat had to do with this. When this was written people still feared their babies would be stolen and relished by packs of roving wolves. They feared the image of the wolf while our present day society loves images of the wolf on posters, in paintings and even t-shirts. After the movie was made into a film, more people were touched by the message that wolves are not to be feared. Mowat wasn't afraid to go live with them for awhile and document their behavior much like Jane Goodhal did with chimpanzees. He ate field mice to prove that wolves could subsist on them as a diet during lean times. He marked the path to his cabin with trails of his own urine to prove that wolves have their own social standards and respect for other's territory. 
Mowat is consistently a de-mystifyer in his writings. I've been enjoying his other writings on Inuit tribes, their customs and struggles. He's a boat-rocker too not finding much favor with corporate people and government bureaucrats who either ignore or exploit the area and its indigenous peoples to the point of near extinction. So to read all of the books of his I've read so far is to be educated about the arctic region, its wildlife, people and peculiarities. He fell in love with the area as a very young man and gave most of his life to it. I'm crazy about his stuff and am working my way through all of his work.
