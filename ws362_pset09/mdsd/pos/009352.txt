I must say that I didn't have any expectations when I ordered the book and I was shockingly surprised.

Thank you, Mr. Bradley, for writing this book. The book is overall very well written and has the strength of personal experience. I wish that Mr. Bradley has given more "people" examples in most chapters, and that the chapters were a bit more focused, but the book carries much information that is both invaluable and deeply penetrating into Saudi state and national soul.

I would advise that the book be read by everybody, especially by politicians and businessmen having any type of power. Please, send it to most of our US politicians! I believe that reading this book will help them grasp better whom they are dealing with when having any type of business with Saudi Arabia. 

I knew that Saudi Arabia was bad, but never imagined that it is so corrupted, depraved, self-exalting, and degraded one. Above all, it is indeed an evil, evil, evil (X many times) country. 

To all women: Do NOT marry a Saudi! 
To all foreigners: Get OUT of Saudi Arabia!
To everyone else: Do NOT deal with Saudis!
