Kind of a combination Diana/Paul Burrell biography "The way We were" tells about various aspects of Diana's life, mostly in the final years. You will find some material familiar, some of it told from a different viewpoint to what we're used to. 
I take it as a sort of butler's eye view of the Princess's life/ death with inside details and opinions on her love life (he says the Dodi thing wasn't real, just a fling), the dress sale and Diana's friendships among other subjects. Mr. Burrell doesn't do much Royal bashing, doesn't attack the Spencer family, mentions other books but doesn't deride them. It was a nice touch having his sons each write a page or two about their memories of the Princess. There is some "I" and "We" stuff but mostly the book rings true to me. I have a feeling that very little material here can be dismissed as unreliable, a little too self promoting maybe but still reliable. Burrell does have several pictures of Kensington Palace that he took himself and may very well have been busy taking notes as some enemies charge but over all the book is a memorial to/ defense of Princess Diana as he says it is.
The book is definitely worth owning, much better that Burrell's obviously envious critics (Ingrid Seward in this month's Majesty Magazine is one of the worst)are willing to give him credit for. It is an inside source, maybe the only one we're going to ever get, and worth reading. If you have an interest in Diana you won't regret getting the book
