Mitchell Wyatt grew up alone because his father would not acknowledge him as his son. Mitchell's half-brother William finally contacts Mitchell. Then family members start to die or disappear. Mitchell is the prime suspect.

Kate Donovan has lost her father and she is trying to get over his death when she meets Mitchell. Sparks fly between them, even though Kate has a boyfriend, and Mitchell doesn't want anything lasting.

At first I really hated the charater Mithchell Wyatt, he goes to Kate's for dinner and all he wants is to get her into bed. She is so blinded by his good looks that she is willing risk her relationship with her boyfriend for him. Kate's boyfriend flies to the island to be with her, she tells him she wants to be with Mitchell. But Mitchell has left the island without a word.

This was a hard book to read at times, it starts out a mystery, goes to a love story, mystery again, and then a love story.

But all and all it was a good book and liked the characters from Paradise and Perfect brought into this book.
