This simply is a terrific book. The author skillfully weaves an analysis of the diplomatic and military aspects of the 1967 War into a factually thrilling account of the conflict. There is adequate detail--not too much, not too little--about the battles and the maps are good (although sometimes the differing arrows are a bit confusing). Oren makes the personalities involved come to life so that you almost--almost!--can feel the situation he depicts. If you take a little time to study the analysis and compare the time frames of the differing situations, you'll be intimately familiar with this monumental conflict
