Written for HR Professionals, this book will help you to measure the results of HR initiatives and communicate them effectively to executives.  In the world of Human Resources, this book is well organized and useful.  This book is practical and tactical, and contains interesting case studies and useful templates.  Phillips adapts his ROI methodology for corporate training and applies it more generally to all Human Resources initiatives.  Measuring so called "soft" subjects like training and HR has been a difficult and ongoing issue for practitioners who need to convince executives that their work contributes to the bottom line and adds value to the organization.  Phillips provides a framework for measurement which, while not perfect, will give you results that executives can understand and help you build the case for why money spent on developing employees is not money thrown away
