This is easily the best history of Central Europe available for the general reader (or the student).  Johnson always keeps the big picture in mind, while moving the reader though events and people that are unfamiliar to most Americans.

Johnson has organized the material to do what you probably want it to do.  Chapters on the last 150 years or so cover only a couple of decades each, while the earlier chapters cover centuries.  He keeps his eyes on each of the modern countries in the region, while discussing the larger empires that have buffeted them this way and that.

While it would make a good text for an undergraduate course, I think the book's real value is for the traveler.  Read the first half of the book before you go to Central Europe, and then read about more recent events while you are there.  You'll gain an added appreciation for the sights and for the historical context that produced them
