In his frighting followup to his bestselling effort The Hot Zone, Richard Preston writes a chilling and honest examination of the history and the efforts to eradicate the smallpox virus.What makes this book work is the authors unflinching portrayal of the effects of the smallpox virus, it's resiliancy and the possible consequences of what could happen in the future if we are not careful or if the virus could fall into the wrong hands. Although not quite as chilling as The Hot Zone this is still a very effective bio-terror thriller
