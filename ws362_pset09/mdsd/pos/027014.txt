I have to say I read everyone elses reviews and a few of the reviews we totally uncalled for!! The book is great and I read it AFTER I WAS married!! Jessica is giving you her ideas and people who say they wont be married in a year and shes spoiled are just jealous of her life and career... if you hate her so much why buy the book??????  I am a married 32 year old woman who respects Jessica and her marrige to Nick so from someone who has been there and planned a wedding already, her book is great help for those planning a wedding. And for the few who dont like her book that is fine everyone has an opinion, but please GET OVER IT AND RATE THE BOOK NOT HER!!!If you felt that strongly about your feelings toward Jessica you should have saved your money.......
