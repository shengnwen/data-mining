I just finished reading "She Who Dreams" and enjoyed it thoroughly.  In this honest and sensitive book of personal dreams, illness, challenges, and recovery, the author shows us how she honored and utilized her dreams to battle a lethal breast cancer.  Through her openness, I felt like I had known her for ages and am sure I wasn't the only one who felt that way.  With the combination of modern surgery and chemotherapy, topped with her fascinating dreams, the trinity of the healing medicine reversed her path to death.  As the small triumphs and wondrous healings took places, doubts about her unknown future also persisted.  The life affirmation came from an amazing BIG dream, in which she was allowed to re-negotiate her soul contract.  I can't imagine anyone's life be the same again after such an eye-opening dream: it actually gave me chills!   Whether facing a serious life challenge or leading a mundane life, reading this book encourages one to pay more attention to personal dream messages and integrate them into waking life.  I highly recommend this inspirational book to anyone who needs to dream which includes us all
