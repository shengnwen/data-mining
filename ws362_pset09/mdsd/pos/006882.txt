Male Fantasies is a book I wish many, many people would read.  The writing is long-winded, the author's ideas are sometimes (in Volume II) flaky, but the content of the book is too good for this to matter.  Theweleit studies the art and literature of a particular group of men--the Freikorps--who were essentially disaffected former soldiers in Germany after the First World War.  These men developed their own groups and their own culture, and became the firsts-in-line to man Hitler's new army in the '30s (the Brown Shirts and Black Shirts).  What is so fascinating about this book is that it approaches the study of this group by looking at the images of women in their writings.  Initially, the author goes in great detail over letters these men wrote; then he looks at their magazines and novels.  It turns out that through their images of women, a whole vision of human personal and political reality can be decoded.  A particular vision of women (a complex typology of types of women: the mother, the sister, the white nurse, the red nurse, etc.) turns out to be intimately interwoven with a fascist approach to human life--AND this vision turns out to be the core of a great deal of our own imagery and political self-perception.  The first 225 pages of Book I are the crucial part to read, and then you can skip around through the rest of Volumes I and II as you see fit.  The discussion of Freud and Medusa in this section and the discussion of the notions of deterritorialization and reterritorialization in the work of Deleuze and Guattar are specially valuable segments.  This book is also a good introduction to some important Weimar-era history, especially regarding Rosa Luxemburg and the Spartacists.  I recommend this book to anyone in the humanities and to any generally intellectually minded adult.  If you take the time to get into it, it will change your perception of some important things
