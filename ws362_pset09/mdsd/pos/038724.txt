typical John Gray take on male/female differences in dealing with loss, break-ups, or divorce, I found myself learning more & realizing what we tend to do without awareness when we have had our hearts broken & life altered, especially after any long-term marriage/relationship of 20+ years, it is not only a loss/death of a marriage, it is a total change of life-style, mind-set,& new set of rules, but what John Gray helped me to see is without healing properly from this event or any major loss, that if we don't grieve, & feel all the emotions from sadness, sorrow, fear, to anger we can't release the unhealthy part of that relationship & move forward to love & be more balanced in a new relationship, I think it will help me & others who have a desire to grow & be more balanced, without as John says by (giving too much or avoiding intimacy) I would advise this to anyone ready to move forward in their life with a open heart towards others.
