I was thrilled to stumble upon a hardcover copy of "Hattie: The Life of Hattie McDaniel" while browsing in a local used bookstore.  Some minor factual errors aside, this well-deserved biography provides a moving look inside the life of one of America's most beloved character actresses.  Carlton Jackson's flowing narrative is engaging, and it draws you in to Miss McDaniels' persona, private (and sometimes public) struggles, to better understand the scope of what her professional achievements really meant to her, to Hollywood and to society as a whole. This book was a welcomed addition to my book collection and I trust that it will be to any other classic film fan's, too
