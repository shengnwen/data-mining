Not everyone understands the loss of a pet can affect you as deeply as losing one of your own children. This book is for the people who 'get' it.  

I bought it originally for my husband's mother who lost her beloved dog, but he felt it was too juvenile to send to her.  On the contrary, I found it sweet, whimsical and touching.  I eventually gave it to a friend who was looking for a greeting card to send to another couple who had recently lost two dogs - They loved it. 

It is a small, short book, beautifully illustrated in watercolor and easily read by a wide range of ages.  The only dissapointment I felt is that it is basically an expanded story of the Rainbow Bridge, which if you've gone through the pain of losing a pet, and are reading this, you have probably already read it on several websites.  

The book however puts it in a format that makes it convenient for giving to someone else instead of sympathy cards, which while there is more selection for pet-loss nowdays, simply don't cover it, or still come across as being written by someone who just doesn't understand what the fuss is about but feels the need to try and comfort the recipient.
