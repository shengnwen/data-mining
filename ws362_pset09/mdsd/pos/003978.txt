SHE'S GOT THE BEAT is another book from the Simon Pulse teen romantic comedy line, and I found it irresistable. It's a cute, fun, easy read that teenage girls will love, especially considering the strong female characters.

Miranda has just graduated from high school, and for the first time in her life she's leaving her small town for bigger things - she's going to school in Austin, Texas. With support from her family and (most of) her friends, she heads off...and of course, Austin is nothing like she imagined. After a rough start, though, Miranda makes some new friends (Kathleen, the more alternative-type girl and Missy, the flirt) and things start looking up. 

Miranda still feels like something is missing though, and that's when SHE'S GOT THE BEAT really starts picking up. She decides that she's going to do something completely unlike herself: Miranda signs up for drum lessons. 

SHE'S GOT THE BEAT is a good mix of comedy, music, and romance. Miranda's different encounters with a few (very) different boys are funny and relateable at the same time.

Recommended to fans of How Not to Spend Your Senior Year, the Mates, Dates, and...series, and Royally Jacked.

Overall grade -
