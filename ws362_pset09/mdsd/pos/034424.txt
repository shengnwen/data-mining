Although the book may get some what dilirious at some points it certanly shoes a more alternative revue to alot of movies that we all thought where out there. You get a feeling that the author is in one way trying to distroy Hollywood but still shoes appraisiasion to Hollywood movies. I would get it to show you an alternative side to movie revues
