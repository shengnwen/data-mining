   Ch'ulp'o is a little seaside village in Korea during the 12th century where potters compete for their pots to be chosen by a Royal Embisserary  for the Royal Court.
   This book is based on a boy named Tree-ear who lives under a bridge.   Tree-ear begins to dream of becoming a potter. When he sneaks into a Min's workplace to watch Min create a pot, he accidently breaks a pot. Min makes Tree-ear work for him so he could payback the damage.  Tree-ear asks Min to teach him how to make pottery.  The conflict starts because Min isn't allowed to teach anyone but his son, Hyung-gu, who has already past away.
   When the Royal Embisserary see the pots Min had created, Tree-ear was sent on a journey to deliver the pots to Songdo where the Kings Court is located.  His lifestyle begins to change while on the trip.  The resolution begins when Tree-ear's caretaker, Crane-man, past away, Min offers Tree-ear to stay with him and his wife.  Tree-ear agrees to Min's offer and is able to learn how to create pottery.
   I thought this book was one of the best books I have ever read, even though the beginning is very slow, the  journey becomes the  most exiting and suspenseful part of the book.  I recommend this book to people who like books that are a little suspenseful and sad.
