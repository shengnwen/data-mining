I bought this one years ago for my older son when he was 3. Now it is my younger son (4 years now)'s favorite book. He can just sit by the table and draw with this book for hours. The book is a very good teaching guide. It teaches you to draw animals with simple instructions--so simple that a 4 years old can draw a owl just by following this book. I am going to buy another one for my friend since she was amazed how well my sons can draw. Amazon should stock more these kind of books which are great and cheap so customers do not even bother to search for bargins else where
