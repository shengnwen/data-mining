Truly a rare find, this book gives us a deeper insight into the life and times of the author, H.G. Wells.  It does so indirectly, though, for it is not a book about his life as it was or about his world as he saw it but rather a book about how certain characters respond to encountering a civilization other than their own.  The characters were written by Wells in a way that reflects certain attitudes and moral values of his time.  As such their feelings, their actions, their strengths and their foibles are commentary not only on their own society but on modern humanity as a whole.

Another reviewer on this board has given this book a poor rating, seemingly because the utopian ideal depicted in the book is not possible nor scientifically logical.  While that is certainly the case, is "The Time Machine" any less enjoyable becuase temporal physics doesn't work the way Wells writes it as working?  Is "The Lord of the Rings" any less enjoyable because there are no such things as elves?

When reading this book I would not suggest that you look upon it as a plan for building a utopian future.  It is fantasy and not a guide to world-building.  Instead, look at the idea of perfection Wells puts forth... look at the things he sees lacking in his own society and wishes somehow could magically become part of it.  Look on this work not as a treatise on how to make the the world perfect, but rather as an author's delving into the reality of the human condition and his hopes and fears of what that condition could become... not through evolution but through the power of the mind to change who we are.

If you read it in that light, I think you will find it both enlightening and enjoyable to read
