This book has been tremendously helpful to me.  If you ever have reason to pull data from a SQL database into Excel, you really owe it to yourself to read this book.  In addition to being packed with great information, it is a very easy read.  It is one of the few books out there that has something to offer to users of all experience levels.  Highly, highly recommended
