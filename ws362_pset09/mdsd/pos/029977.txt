I read Taming The Star Runner by S.E. Hinton, S.E. Hinton is my favorite author. I have read every single last one of her books and I have enjoyed them all. This book is a realistic fiction book and it's really exciting. Especially when Travis gets a phone call from his best friend Joe, telling him that the twins are dead, Orson had killed them, he helped and that he's out at a gas station near Travis's house and he needs to get picked up.

	Taming The Star Runner is about a boy named Travis who was sent to juvi for beating the snot out of his step dad. Now he has to live out at his uncle's ranch when he gets out. So he gets out there and he's in a new school, where no body likes him and then he finds out the book he wrote is going to be published. What happens when he gets a weird phone call from his best friend, Joe? What's going to happen when a tornado strikes near his uncle's ranch? Read the book and you will see.

	I would recommend this book for some one who likes to wonder what is going to happen next and likes really exciting books.
