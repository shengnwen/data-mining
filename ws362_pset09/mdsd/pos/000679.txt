I certainly cannot place this work at the top of this author's best list, but dispite the warts, the read is good and the story will certainly stick with you.  Much of the work, depending upon your point of view, is pretty much politically incorrect for this day and age.  Heinlein is certainly grinding some axes here, there is no doubt about that.  There are some aspects of the book that you could call offensive, i.e. incest, cannabalism, racism, et al.  This coupled with the fact that not one of the characters in the book is even remotely likable, could turn some readers off.  That being said though, this work is a necessary read for those exploring Heinlein's work.  I feel you have to consider the time frame it was written in and the mind set of the author at the time it was written.  The story will cerainly stick with you and make an impression.  Isn't that what good story telling is all about?  I do recommend you read some of this author's other work first though and not judge his ability completely by this offering.
