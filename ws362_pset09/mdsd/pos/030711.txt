I read this book while at Oregon (1978-1981) and yes, I could relate to the Trials of Miles/Miles of Trials because big milage was the thing in those days. I did skip the portions involving Cassidy getting kicked off the team because it was so unrealistic. The mentor for Cassidy reminded me of Dellinger, so I liked those portions of the book. I can't believe it has become a collector's item and selling for 50 bucks a pop. But, whatever the market will bear right? I would recommend reading it if you want to know what racing was like in those days. For me, reading it again would make me feel old, much like when I see Waffle Racers being marketed as "leisure" shoes when all I can think of was that they were the state of the art cross country shoes that I loved so much. I'm still racing and still looking ahead, not at the runners behind me. That said, it is a good read.
