The premise behind this book (at least for me) is a classic example of "Why didn't I think of that?". Anyone who is a fan of hunting, fishing, the outdoors, food or just laughing out loud will find this story entertaining in the extreme. In fact, "extreme", though sorely overused in today's vernacular, is at the very heart of this story. From the adventures had in gathering the ingredients, to the eclectic nature of the ingredients themselves, Rinella seems intent upon escorting the reader away from our ordinary (often self-imposed) limits. The writing is crisp, clear, wonderfully researched, and above all, entertaining. Taken as a whole, the story is thought-provoking, historically educational, sometimes-challenging, and utterly hilarious -- a rare bird indeed! This dish is fit for a king (or a peasant, or a trapper, or an accountant, or a hairdresser, or...)
