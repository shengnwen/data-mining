Trying to recover from having been "raised" by a mother with BPD often feels to me like being lost in a maze  -  the maze of her illness, *her* reality. I feel like I never know what's real.

When I pick up this book I see my entire childhood laid out, with eerie accuracy and in great detail, on page after page after page... but what I read is the *reality* of it. Not my mother's reality; the real reality. 

I close the book, and suddenly I'm in the world of the real. I see clearly. Things make sense. 

What relief! 

Thank you, thank you, thank you, Christine Lawson.
