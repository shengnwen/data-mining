   My husband and I were days away from divorce.  We were each given a copy of this book the night before our court appearance by a dear friend. He could see how much pain both of us were in and wanted desperately to help us.  He had already attended The Arbinger Institutes training and had read all of their books; most recently, this book.  He knew how powerful its message is to the right heart.  
   There was a lot that transpired during the 18 hours preceding the court hearing.  A lot of this book was read.  Hearts were softened & changed and two prideful, selfish individuals became new people.  I don't use this lightly when I say it helped facilitate a miracle in our lives.  We have a long ways to go, but at least we will be traveling it together and we now have hope for ourselves, and for our marriage and "The Anatomy of Peace" has much to do with it.
