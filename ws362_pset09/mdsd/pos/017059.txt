Someone once said that one has to be a philosopher to understand "Parsifal."  The statement is not far from the truth.  In fact, it can apply to Wagner's mature works from "Ring" onwards.  Magee's book is then heaven sent.

That "Parsifal" is the antithesis of "Tristan" gnaws at me for years.  To understand it is what I wanted out of "Tristan Chord."  According to Magee, the contradiction can apparently be traced back to Schopenhauer's ambiguity towards sexuality.  Schopenhauer, on one hand, celebrates sex as this quasi-mystical realization of life essence - the will to live.  On the other hand, he expounds compassion, or the denial of the will to live, as the road to redemption.  Wagner grappled with this contradiction when he worked on "Tristan," and reconciled it in "Meistersingers", and more interestingly, in an earlier work of his, "Tannhauser."  

Needlessly to say, I am very impressed with Magee's rich insights, solid scholarship and sensitive treatment of German history and philosophy.

Some of my favorite chapters are as follows.

Chapter 4, Feuerbach's influence on early Wagner and "Ring"
Chapter 9, Schopenhauer's philosophy
Chapter 10, Schopenhauer's powerful influence on Wagner
Chapter 12, on "Tristan"
Chapter 14, on "Meistersingers"
Chapter 15, on "Gotterdammerung"
Chapter 16, on "Parsifal
