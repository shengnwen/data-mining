I was so excited when I saw this 5th book added to her Canadian West series!  The children really go through a lot.  It was suspenseful waiting for things to happen sometimes, but isn't that real life?  :-)  Janette Oke has produced yet another wonderful story that I couldn't put down until the end.  Even then, her characters are so well written that it left me wondering if she would write one more for this series
