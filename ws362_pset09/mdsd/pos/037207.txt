When I read this book, I was a crappy teacher in a crappy school in the South Bronx.  Then I read it and read it, five or ten times, felt like someone had given me the key to the universe, almost got fired, and ended up in a better school but still not a much better teacher.  I'm not sure if my goal in life is to become James Herndon or maybe just to meet him, if he is still living in San Francisco (he's listed in the phone book there.)   When I give this book to other teachers, they tend to react with love and astonishment; when I give it to non-teachers, they don't really get it, although they tend to love his other great book, the Way it Spozed to Be.  Presently, my copy is languishing in my principal's bookshelf, unread after four years
