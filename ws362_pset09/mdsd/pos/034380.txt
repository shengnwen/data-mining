If you want to understand what the musical elements are in Lester's hugely influential style, read this book and listen to every recording you can afford to lay hands on. 
Porter does a great job of transcribing and annotating several Young solos from different points in his career and explains with solid scholarship exactly what Young was doing and some of the whys.  Porter is not among those who dismiss Lester's later work with the cliche about all the best stuff being before WWII.  Instead he breaks Young's career into three periods and examines each fairly.  There are some gaps in his discography, i.e.,the session with Oscar Peterson, but that may be due to the original publication date pre-dating the advent of CDs.
 Charlie Parker's idol and cited as a major influence by nearly every jazz saxophonist to follow him, Lester Young was indeed the President of the Saxophone
