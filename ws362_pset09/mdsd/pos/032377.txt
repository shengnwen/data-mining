The great thing about this book is that it compels managers to do the things that they know are right, but aren't willing to take the time. Our companies don't reward us for managing, but this is precisely what helps people to perform. The reason this book is so great is that Blanchard has a wonderful knack for succinctly putting into focus a manager's need to put his or her people first. That makes this book invaluable and a worthy read.
