This review applies to the 6th edition.  This is a very good introduction to all of the various technologies of modern commercial AC power.  It includes good descriptions of various 3-phase systems and their components (alternators, transformers, and motors).  The book starts with the the very basics, but a working knowledge of basic math and electronics helps.  Very readable with good diagrams.  If you want to understand the difference between split-phase and three-phase current, or the difference between an induction motor and a synchronous motor, this is the book for you
