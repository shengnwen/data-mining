I would have to say this is one of my favorites!! I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and while Message in a Bottle will always be my favorite, this runs a close second along with A Walk to Remember :)

I would definitely recommend this book, it is certainly a page turner!! I must demand a sequel!!!
