It has lots of good ideas for teaching the alphabets creatively. My only issue with it is the pictures chart. It's black and white, hand drawn and somewhat "noisy" - E.g. with the picture of the letter "Q q" - the little figure on top of the little q, I presume, must be a "queen" but to me looks like a bug; it took a minute to decipher the picture. haha..try telling your kid it's a queen. Just a little too much details for a learning disabled child. Perhaps just photos of a person making the letter sounds might communicate better.
