Leadership &amp; Spirit by Moxley (brought to you by those folks at the Center for Creative Leadership) manages to be clear, engaging, and concise with an economy of words that borders on simply being beautiful.  No fluff  or padding here.  It's sprinkled with quotes from all aspects of life that  highlight and explain a particular process or idea (i.e. courage, coercive  power, spirit, team partnership, etc...).  Most importantly, this is not more  pop psychology, New Age spirituality, or academic business theory.  It  simply and subtlety touches timeless truths without demeaning them or  reducing them to blandness.  While not written down to anyone, it has  somehow brought to life the simple wisdom we know lies under the surface of  complexity.  If you're "there" or get some of it (ref: the simple sayings  of Chauncy Gardner in the old Seller's movie "Being There"), this can help  you get more of it.  The vision thing ... `maybe not as elusive as we think!   If Covey is too wordy and leaves you frustrated about how to get "there",  if you admire the courage of a nay-saying Morton Thiokol engineer, or if  you appreciate pithy references to people like Coach Phil Jackson,  physicist-theorist David Bohm, philosopher Ken Wilber, or business  leadership prognosticators Warren Bennis and Peter Senge or are just  looking for inspiration and suspect that our species is moving out of  coercive behaviors for dealing with life's challenges, then this book could  be for you
