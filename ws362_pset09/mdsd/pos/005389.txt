I read the first part of "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance" with great enjoyment and excitement. Finally,
someone found a way to write about philosophy in a way that
makes it interesting and accessible to the average
reader... quite an achievement. But it was too good to last.

In the second part Pirsig begins to talk about 'quality'
and the whole book disintegrates -- because while Pirsig
has a genius for explaining the ideas of the great
philosophers, his own contribution to the field is
less than adequate. 'Quality' as an absolute concept,
an objective measurement, a new dimension? C'mon, give
us a break! 'Quality' is as culturally-bound,
subjective, nebulous as you can get. You have to be a
very insular American to think otherwise.

The third part of the book, Pirsig's adventures in
academia, reads like the diary of a crank. Apparently
Pirsig's ideas did not find much favor in the harsh,
skeptical light of the universities, so he took them
directly to the masses in the form of this book. Well,
good luck to him.
