Read George Monbiot's book, "Heat", for a start. He discusses how to work toward the needed ~90% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, from current levels, by no later than 2040 to avoid frying us all and taking the vast majority of present ecosystems with us by the end of the century.

The needed steps are so far beyond "An Inconvenient Truth" as to be shaking, and I write as a thirty-year veteran of disaster preparedness and response planning. (Yes, that's my day-job, and no, I do not work for government or NGO)
