This was one of the best Flynn books and I've read them, in order, needing only to read Memorial Day and Consent to Kill.  Once again, a good share of violence, sneaky politicians, and backstabbing.  This book has a scene in the Phillipines that is really well done.  Irene Kennedy's character is becoming much more well rounded and the "wife" is still a pain.  I keep hoping Mitch Rapp will dump her
