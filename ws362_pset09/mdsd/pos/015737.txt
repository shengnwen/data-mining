When I read this book I was surprised that it was so moral and that it points out some problems we have in real life. After I went to read the authors bio I noticed that most of the things he has in his books are something similar to his life and I was not surprised his favorite books are ones he can relate to. That being said if you want an action book this isn't your best pick but if you want something that will make you think then go for it.
