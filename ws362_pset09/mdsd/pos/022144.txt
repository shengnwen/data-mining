I lived the first 30 years of my life less than 30 miles from New Auburn, Wisconsin.  So when I fortuitously discovered that the author hailed from the same neck of the woods, I promptly purchased the book from Amazon.  

When it comes to reading for pleasure I read at a snail's pace. A John Grisham novel typically takes me several weeks to read.  By comparison, I actually read this book at record breaking speed.  It was impossible for me to set this book down for long.  

There were times when I was nearly rolling on the floor laughing but there were even more times when I literally shed a tear or two.  Most books don't engage me emotionally to this depth but then again most books are not written by such an insightful person, 
Especially when it comes to matters of human nature and mortality.  

And yes, mortality is an issue that this author brings to the fore on many occasions.  In fact, if I had to sum up a central reoccurring theme it would be this.  We humans are on this planet for a very short time and are balancing on a very thin and precarious wire each and every day that we rise from our beds.  

I never felt that the author was an especially cynical person but rather a realistic one who chose to contemplate death as he continued to learn how to help others to live.  His choice of an altruistic occupation simply confirms the lesson that many wise persons have learned, that "there is more happiness in giving than in receiving."  

This book moves quickly with plenty of realistic and graphic imagery of his experiences in the rescue field interacting with scores of colorful characters.  The author is an excellent wordsmith and is incredibly introspective in the matters of the human psyche.  I am hooked and intend on reading his other offerings.
