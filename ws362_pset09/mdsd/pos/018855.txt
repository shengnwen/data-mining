As a mom of two emerging readers (one 3, one 5) I have done alot of research into how children learn to read and this summer I am in hot pursuit of books that will help them practice.  

One of the key skills that appears over and over in the literature is the ability to get 'clues' as to what is going on in the story from the pictures that accompany the text.  This is one of the reasons I like this book.  Without words, it allows my youngsters to practice their pre-reading skills of analyzing and interpreting what pictures mean.

The other reason, of course, is that this book is simply delightful.  The drawings are detailed and funny and they keep my children coming back for more.   A cute addition for a family's bookshelves.

[Don't forget to check out Tomie dePaola's wordless books as well.]

Good Reading reference books: "Reading Magic" by Mem Fox; " Raising Lifelong Learners" by Lucy McCormick; and the comprehensive if more cumbersome, "Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning about Print" by Marilyn Jager Adams
