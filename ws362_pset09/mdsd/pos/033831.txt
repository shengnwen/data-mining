I have always enjoyed all of Oscar Wilde's works, but this is not very good compared with the others, but none the less  still worth reading. The characters were sort of dull, but the plot intresting which made up for it. I'd reccomend this to fans of Oscar Wilde, but if you have just discovered Wilde, skip this and start with either, "The picture of dorian gray" or "the importance of being Earnest"
