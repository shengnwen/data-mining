This book is designed for engineers, but the book can apply to more than an engineer.  I have taken an ethics course from two of the authors of this book.  The cases presented in this book apply to real world situations(some altered slightly), not just some clearly fictional situations.  There are many fundamental tools that help you determine the type of situation you are dealing with -- ex. moral, factual, conceptual.  Afer the problem is determined there are tools to help you make decisions, such as creative middle ways.  The author does not make you adhere to their ethics, but a general ethical standard.  Overall, this book provides very good ways to determine and solve issues; case studies are also provided to give you an opportunity to "test" yourself
