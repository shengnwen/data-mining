When I check out this book at the local library I thought, &quot;Gee, why am I doing this....&quot; because I don't like how-to books. However, this  book turned out to be a great teacher to me and now I'm ordering it to  own.The author shows many options in cleaning depending how far you want to  go, so  I can clean my house anytime... even when I have only 10 minutes  before my guests come. You may not need this book if you consider yourself  a good housekeeper, but this book will help so many people like me, who  don't prefer filthy house but at the same time don't know how to clean and  organize it fast, easily, and effectively. Thank you, Patti! Your writing  is so funny I enjoyed this guidebook as a book to read, too
