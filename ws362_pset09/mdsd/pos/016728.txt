I am gald that someone created a book for black parents with pictures of African-American people nursing and caring for their children.  I feel as if this book was designed for me and I don't have to fit the image of  someone else.  I credit all parenting books, but this shows me that I am  okay and there are other African-American mothers going through the same  thing that all mothers are facing.  Thank You
