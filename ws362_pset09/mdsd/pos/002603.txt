This is the kind of mystery that you look forward to getting back to and that will get read quickly but will not keep you up until 3 in the morning because you can't bear to put it down.  That's not such a bad thing -- sometimes those keep-you-up-all-night books aren't such a good idea.  I've read quite a few in this mystery series and character Sharon McCone feels like an old friend.  In this book, there are a number of references to events and people in previous books that might make parts of this book less accessible to new readers, although they really don't have much to do with the plot.

The plot involves the arrest of Jules, one of Sharon's employees (Sharon runs a very successful detective agency in San Francisco).  Jules is accused of stealing and using a credit card from the client in a case she was assigned to, and for reasons that aren't very convincing, even before Jules is even arraigned, Sharon's agency is being threatened with losing its license to operate because she is responsible for her employees' actions on the job.  Sharon has to prove that Jules didn't do it in order to save the agency.  Although Jules has a colorful background, Sharon believes in her innocence, and it quickly becomes apparent that this is a frame with Sharon's agency as the real target.  The plot then becomes Sharon trying to find out who is framing Jules, which involves finding out who has a grudge against her that is motivating this frame.

I wouldn't describe this as one of those mysteries that you ought to be able to solve if you read the clues correctly -- it's more of a procedural, where you follow along with Sharon as she tries to solve the case.  The real strength of the book is Sharon's likeability -- she's someone you enjoy spending time with in a book -- and Muller's writing skills, which create a whole exciting San Francisco world.
