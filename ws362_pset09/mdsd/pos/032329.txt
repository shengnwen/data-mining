Raymond Chandler certainly has a flair for terse dialogue and hardboiled metaphor, as well as knack for quick-sketching believable characters. But the active Philip Marlowe is the presence in THE LADY IN THE LAKE that kept this reader on the case. Reason: For me, narrators who seize the initiative are better in mysteries than narrators who are saved by dumb luck or the deus ex machina of improbable intervention.

But let's be honest. Hasn't Chandler been surpassed by others writing in this genre? I read very few mysteries--only three in the last three years according to my Amazon.com reviews. But two of these mysteries show Chandler's limits. For example, NIGHT TRAIN (Amis) certainly surpassed this book in sparkling dialogue and metaphor. And, TELL NO ONE (Coben) has characters that are just as well drawn while its plot (admittedly farfetched) is just as surprising but never hard to follow. 

What THE LADY IN THE LAKE says to me is that an above average author can write to make a dollar and still do good work. I suppose the key is to work within a genre. Then, the genre keeps a middling author from overreaching, while making him mind his Ps and Qs. Such discipline enables a modest talent, like Chandler, to produce something beloved and lasting.
