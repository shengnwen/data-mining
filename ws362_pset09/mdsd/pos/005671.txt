Libby Brin is cool. She's a member of the coolest clique on campus, throws amazing parties, and starts the newest, hottest (if short-lived) trends.

And she's bored.

It's not enough anymore for Libby to have money, sex without strings, and the ability to do pretty much whatever she wants. She's growing tired of her shallow friends and their lackluster ambitions. Her need to become something more than she is leads her to do the unexplainable, even the unthinkable, the uncoolest thing she's ever done: She signs up for an internship at the Los Angeles Zoo.

At the zoo, she is assigned to work with Tina, a Little Person with a big personality, and Sheldon, who is overweight, shy, and incredibly smart. As Libby becomes more interested in her work at the zoo, she begins drifting from her friends and is soon the last person to find out about the latest trends. This Queen of Cool, though, is starting to figure out that there's a lot more to being cool than fashion-slave t-shirts and wearing pencils taped to your jeans.

Minimalist writing, where the change in the main character comes slowly over pages of sparse, carefully chosen words, isn't something you see a lot of in teen literature.  Let's hope THE QUEEN OF COOL changes some of that. On the surface, this is an easy read that you might dismiss as being "for younger kids." Once you start reading, though, you'll fill in the spaces between the words and maybe even change a few of your own thoughts on what makes for cool.
