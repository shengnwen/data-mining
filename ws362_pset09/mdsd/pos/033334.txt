I wrote it once and I will write it again: the perfect novel is one that combines literary aspirations with an engaging plot, thus mixing the high-brow (the tone) with the low-brow (the cheap thrills of a great best-seller). Arturo Perez Reverte has by now carved a career out of this thin balance, being the master of the so-called literary best-seller.
"The Queen of the South" is a brilliant tale about a memorable character, a narco's morra (girlfriend) who is forced to escape her native Mexico and then turns into a drug-lord of her own. She's a complex, intriguing character, obviously not free from many ambiguous facets.
The tale is gripping, believable and, as one has come to expect from APR, very well written.
Highly recommende
