Brad Adler has done a great service by taking the time to painstakingly research and describe what separates the all-time great NFL coaches of the modern era from their mediocre colleagues. His chapters on each of the 10 selected coaches are detailed with care and each selection is justified well. The best part of the book, in my opinion, is the manner in which Adler explains how certain personality traits seem to make all the difference in the world (e.g. between mediocre team records and winning Super Bowls): he outlines the need for physical and/or psychological "intimidation" to instill a sense of purpose in the players which is supported by appropriate fear of being humiliated or cut from the team if they do not do their jobs. Simply being a successful coordinator or knowing the strategic x's and o's is not nearly enough! I loved the summary chapter in which he pulls his conclusions together and states his case definitively. I am a psychologist and executive coach by training, and I learned quite a bit from this book. I highly recommend it
