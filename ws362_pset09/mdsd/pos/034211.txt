Nora weaves her magic spell again with this novel. I was hooked with the first paragraph and didn't put it down until I read the last paragraph. I really felt for Caroline, but it took a while to warm up to Tucker. I'm usually very good at guessing &quot;who-dunnit&quot; but this one surprised me! A keeper
