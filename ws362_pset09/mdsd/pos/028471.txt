Sets a foundation for the pianist to begin playing bass lines.
I have been playing for a long time, but have been unable to
get it together with my left hand for a walking bass.
This book gives the fundamentals and just enough
interesting variations to give you a standard repertoire,
and a springboard to exploring more.

It is also helpful for any aspiring jazz musician on any 
instrument. The scales and leading notes used can be applied to
playing smooth flowing improvization.

Most samples are presented in two or three different keys,
but it is still up the the student to everything them in all keys.

Well worth the price - a fraction of the cost of a piano lesson
for a life's changing technique, even if it's not a ton of material
