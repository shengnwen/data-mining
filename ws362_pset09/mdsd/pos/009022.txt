I had recently found out that my future grandchild was diagnosed with Down Syndrome and was anzious to start educating myself. The book helped me understand the syndrome and realize that we need not be afraid of what the future holds. Since then I have found out that this baby will probably not go full term, but what I read made me realize that I should not be afraid of hearing Down Syndrome in the future.
