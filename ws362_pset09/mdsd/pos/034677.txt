Kathy Tyers attempts to tell the story of what happened after the Empire's defeat in "The Truce at Bakura".  Regrettably, I do not feel that Tyers captured the essence of the characters in this book.  For example, Han Solo seems more annoying than witty.  To make matters worse, the book moves slowly and focuses on characters that the reader probably cares little about knowing.

While the defeat of the Empire does not immediately reach the outer rim, the work of the Empire continues.  The people of Bakura, under Empire rule, need help with the threat of an alien invasion.  The "entechment" procedure, which seems to be borrowed from another science fiction series, shows the aliens aiming to convert human life power into machine power.  When the alliance intercepts the message that was intended for the Emperor, the Force tells Luke to aid the people of Bakura.  This puts the alliance in the unlikely situation of working with storm troopers.  When the aliens are defeated, the relics of the Empire have other ideas though.  Much of the story is very predictable.  Luke finds the Force strong in a lot of people as he begins looking for apprentices.  This seems to currupt the exclusivity of the Force demonstrated in the original series.  

There are far better books in the Star Wars series than this one.  While I was disappointed, this book did have some traits which made it worth reading.  The after-effects of Return of the Jedi are explored in this book which draws some interest.  Yet reader may wonder, is this the best follow-up to "Return of the Jedi" that they could make? I don't think it is
