This was a fantastic read, I blew through it in 3 days as I couldn't put it down, even though I was relaxing on a beach in Florida (where my wife told me to get my nose out of the book and enjoy the ocean!).

Very readable, and while some of the books that have come out recently require a fairly indepth knowledge base, this one stands on its own.  

Complements "The Outfit" and numerous good Capone books very well, as Capone was a South Sider, we Nort Seit residents have always been thirsty for more info about the Roaring Twenties north of Madison Ave., and this hit the spot - 
I just started her Bugs Moran biography and am similarly impressed so far
