There is no way, you should limit yourself to just one source, I think this book is a second source book. But, it can be your main source.

That said, It's great for looking up names, about 12,000 names listed. For finding names that may not be household, or the big names as well, such as actors, Directors or producers, and more.

After all, there is no book that has everything, every name, every movie star, if so, it costs 500.00 or the book weighs about 10 pounds.
 So, sometimes you need more than one book.

You don't want to buy a library? ok, then, it's good by itself, its fun by itself, to just do browsing.

But, it works well with other book sources, to check, and maybe another source will prove it wrong, or "Who's Who" proves the other book wrong, when double checking.

I didn't find loads of errors in here, a few, the biggest problem (as others mentioned) is very brief or not complete career lists, movies or TV they did is not complete.

It's a great book, it's a great second source book, 
a double check or name finder book, for movie and TV stars.

At a fair price, it should be in your collection just for the reasons I mentioned.

Buy it? yes, buy it
