This is King in the kind of story he's best at: suspenseful, a little sinister, and really spooky. The story includes all the teenage angst that most of us can identify with and builds from there into a really enjoyable read. I've read about 10 of his novels so far but put off buying this one because the premise sounded pretty dumb- a possessed car. But he pulls it off in typical King-style with lots of character development and suspense, with some restrained use of the supernatural thrown in. The only things keeping me from giving it 5 stars were a few plot holes but overall I'd recommend this to anyone who likes being scared for a few hours
