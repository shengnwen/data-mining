Upon reading this book I feel the author is doing her best through examples of others to demonstrate those that have hit burnout.   Once its established if you have reached it, or if you are on your way, she moves on to how this can happen, and how much you are empowered to change this.  Tips and ideas are given on how to reduce stress and how to help change or tailor your job in a direction that you have the most power.  She does not advocate moving on before you have resolved some of the internal issues that have caused your displeasure at your current job.  I feel ths examples of how real people in the book overcame their burnout and became happy and sucessful once again
