What a wonderful and useful book!  I'm a single woman, between relationships, and I wish I had this book before I started dating.  It helped me understand men and myself.  JAH and a lot of the other reviewers have trashed this book, but it seems to me they are reading some other book.  This book is so positive about both women and men, I recommend it to every woman.  I especially liked how it dealt with bridge brain men and women.  I'm a woman who often "thinks more like a man," and I say, thank you, Michael Gurian, for helping me understand myself
