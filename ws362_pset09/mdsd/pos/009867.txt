One of the more interesting books dealing with Mcveigh. Gives a feel for what type of person Mcveigh really was while taking a look at the inner workings of federal death row. I only wish it had a better publisher because it was filled with spelling errors and bad editing which slightly butchered the work of these two authors. And the price is a little steep. But the information is worth the price... Another piece of the puzzle
