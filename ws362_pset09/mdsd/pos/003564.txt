This book was so compelling - a real page turner.  I believe that his facts were well researched, and some of what he has to say is quite shocking.  It is, however, clear from the first pages of the book that the author is hostile not just towards Mormons, but possibly to all people of faith, and that hostility leaks through when he discusses the elements of both mainstream and fundamentalist Mormon belief.  Like any writing that combines pure fact with editorial, you have to keep in mind where the writer is coming from, and this author makes no secret of his own atheism. I'm not taking away from him for his beliefs (or lack thereof), but his statements about the dangerous delusions of fundamentalist Mormons are sometimes weakened when it becomes apparent that he believes the most benign of mainstream faithful (of any denomination) to be equally delusional.

Still, it is a fascinating read (note I gave it 4 out of 5 stars despite my hang-up with his bias), and I highly recommend it
