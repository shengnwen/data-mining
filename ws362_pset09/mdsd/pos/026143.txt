a Brilliant, will they -or-wont- they murder mystery!
Because you know from the start who the murderer is you want everyone to know! But they don't, and it takes awhile before they do! A FANTASTIC suspenseful, and sometimes gory murder mystery, figured outin time by the great, but weird, Tony Hill!
And the equally as great Carole JordAN, who is not as pretty on camera as the books would lead you to believe! Hermione norris is good, but she should have been prettier according to the books!
