What an inspiring book.  I couldn't put it down.  Libby has had an amazing career and she is very forthright about it in her book.  There is a lot to be learned from her.  Thank you for making me see that I really can make a difference in HR.  I think it is easy to become somewhat cynical in HR and you brought out the passion for me.  THANKS, Libby
