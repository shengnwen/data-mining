This book is great - (...)when I read it aloud, it's kind of fun for adults to read, too.  Out of all the books we have, I'd say this book is one of the top 2 my son wants to have read over and over.  When we're not reading it, he flips through it on his own and looks at the clearly drawn, colorful, interesting pictures, which have just enough detail without being too complicated.  The depictions of different kinds of trains are fairly accurate, too. And the book is a good length - not just a few pages, like some board books, but not so long he loses interest
