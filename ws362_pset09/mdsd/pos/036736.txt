This should not be the reader's first attempt at the subject matter. AJP Taylor has written a well researched analysis of the final century of the Habsburg empire, but it is not accessible to a general audience. My own background prior to reading The Habsburg Monarchy on the affairs of Central Europe was fairly basic, and I do believe much of what's included here was lost.

This is not to say that the book isn't worth reading, only that the  underprepared reader may find it rather dry and hard to follow. What we can get out of it is a sense of the desperate struggle the various players in Austro-Hungarian governments fought to keep their system going. From the start the Habsburg empire was a motley collection of populations and languages only weakly held together at the center. That plus the outside pressures from the other major powers made for a heroic but ultimately futile attempt to preserve what with hindsight must seem to be a doomed enterprise. For a look at the tortured politicking over the years, this is a fine book to look second
