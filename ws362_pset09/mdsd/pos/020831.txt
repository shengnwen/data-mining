I enjoy all of Sandy Mitchel's Ciaphas tales. They add something human to the often inhuman 40k Universe.

This book was not quite five stars, because somehow Cain is a little less self serving than in the previous books, but it is a terrific story with a lot of fun.

I have to say that Jurgen rocks the house. If you like any of the Ciaphas Cain novels, you'll definately like this one. I just hope that the author keeps up the series, because I love reading about Commissar Cain
