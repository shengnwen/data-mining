I know little about Greek myths but I have come across Homer's Odyssey and was disappointed (though hardly surprised) by the two-dimensional portrayal of women. Penelope, though clever, is a simple and sorry 'stand by your man' figure. So it is great to have the excellent Atwood flesh out Penelope into a more three-dimensional character and to give voices to the twelve maids.

Penelope speaks to us from the Underworld and the maids provide a chorus as in Greek drama. It was the murder of the maids that Atwood wanted to address as much as Penelope's position.

This is a very lively and brief retelling of the myth and for me it has succeeded in inspiring a new interest in mythology - particularly the potential for women to be given voices denied to them by the original mythmakers.
