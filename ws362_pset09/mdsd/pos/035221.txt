'How to Be a Working Actor' is divided into three sections: Nuts & Bolts, The Breaks, and Script Analysis.  

Even after being in "the biz' for a few years, I found the first 217 pages (Nuts & Bolts) to be super helpful and informative.  It suggests some of the most effective ways to create an actor resume, flattering colors and clothing types to wear to an agent interview, and the best books and guides to read to find work.  It also explores ways to create a website, average wages for various acting jobs, and the differences between NY, LA and other cities (when I read this book I didn't want to move from NY to LA because of "parking", but when I did make the move I found out it wasn't that bad!)

This book features tips from casting directors and talent agents, and, like Michael Bofshever's 'Your Face Looks Familiar: Journey of a Working Actor', anecdotes from professional actors.

Maybe I shouldn't be writing this stellar review, when I'm an actor myself, looking to hone my skills and career abilility like the next person.  But I believe the universe gives back, and there's a role out there for all of us
