This is a deliciously gossipy book about a small town which just happens to be one of the world's treasures.  For whatever reason, people *talk to this author and provide insights into the heart of a city that few tourists ever really see for what it is.  I read this book just after spending two weeks in Venice and found that it corroborated in great detail so many of my own impressions.  Venetians talk about it, sometimes with mixed feelings, but they do talk about it.
