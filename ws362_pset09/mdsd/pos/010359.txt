This is an excellent book for anyone wanting to understand the cult mentality and the typical behavioral strategies of cults, once a cult member leaves.  In our postmodern and New Age era, where even some college professors are part of the New Age movement or have given their minds over to the idea that "reality does not exist," and who influence and often discourage young people, and with the New Age movement's typical lack of distinction between objective fact and subjective interpretation, this book issues a sobering warning.  It's great for all those who might already be all too suggestible or who feel isolated or lost and might be prone to reaching out to the many all-too-eager cults ready to enlist new victims.  This book shows that often these groups are very subtle, and they prey on people who are lonely and are longing for love and acceptance.  Beware!
