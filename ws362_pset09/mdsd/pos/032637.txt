This is one of the most interesting and well written books I've ever read on this or any similar topic.  To anyone who studies or has studied attachment, Blum offers an amazing look at how this early research changed the face of psychology.  To anyone who has read countless poorly written descriptions of boring research studies, this book is an oasis.  

I don't believe Blum has portrayed Harlow through rose-colored glasses.  On the contrary, anyone reading this book might even wonder whether Harlow's neglect of his own children was a good thing, given his lack of compassion and indifference toward the suffering he caused.  My copy is well-worn and has been loaned out many times.  I highly recommend this book.
