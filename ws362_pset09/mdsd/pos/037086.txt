Inviting in its design and detailed in its coverage of digital painting, Cher Pendarvis tackles both the technical side of Painter and Photoshop and the artistic techniques that turn their expressive brush strokes into art.

Traditional artists struggling to cross over to the world of digital painting will find Cher's well-illustrated, step-by-step chapters a welcome hand guiding them to the best digital tools to achieve the effects they have been painting using traditional tools.

Each chapter focuses on a fundamental artistic technique, like creating volume and atmosphere and working with simulated paper and canvas, or on more advanced techniques like mixing media and sketching or on specific tasks like photograph restoration.

By naming tool names and suggesting software settings, Cher provides an immediate starting point from which readers can begin getting great results. The main tool, however, remains the Wacom tablet whose presence is felt on every page of the book. The tablet is the "brush" that Cher demonstrates can be a paintbrush, a soft pencil, a fine airbrush, a coarse palette knife, or just about any other kind of artistic tool.

Cher's book will find a wide audience among traditional artists as well as graphic artists who will be inspired to move beyond simple graphics to creating expressive art with the look of traditional art tools
