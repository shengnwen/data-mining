Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha is used as part of the GCSE curriculum in my school.  I felt that, although this book is well written, it is over-appreciated, if you will.
The book lacks storyline, and, although it is written exactly for that, it does get tedious towards the hundred and fiftieth page where there is still no plot.
On the other hand, the book is incredibly nostalgic.  It really is fantastic to read and then suddenly remeber similar childhood antics.
Also, the book is driven by the emotions felt by Paddy as his world changes, which is marvellous to find as this is the only factor that kept me reading all the way through
