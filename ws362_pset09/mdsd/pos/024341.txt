The spiritual content of this book I can only describe as awesome. For a  simple human being to leave behind such a legacy is nothing short of a  miracle.  Its content raised my level of faith far beyond what I  anticipated of myself as a result of reading this diary.  If anyone doubts  the mercy and love of God, then this book should settle the issue.  It is a  layman's assertion of the truth of the Scriptures...something needed for  the skeptics of this day and age
