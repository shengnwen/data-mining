This book provides an extensive survey of popular ideas relating to Fermi's paradox. It does not try to validate any one hypothesis, so if you're hoping to find justification for your personal beliefs you may be disappointed.  The author has the difficult task of trying to present contradictory solutions in a reasonable manner. He offers his opinion on the merits of each proposal without being heavy-handed. The addition of a little humor doesn't detract from the seriousness of the topic.

It's a fair treatment. Were the book to dispassionately present each theory without comment, it would make for dry reading. The reader would have to weigh every premise without the benefit of the writer's knowledge and understanding. Instead, it provides a basis for you to make your own judgment. The critique is fair and reasonably unbiased.  The book gives insight into scientific debate and shows how competing ideas about extraterrestrial civilizations have developed. It can be appreciated from that standpoint and not as promoting one particular view
