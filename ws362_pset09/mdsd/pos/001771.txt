This really is a great look at a number of characteristics of Jonathan Edward's life and ministry.  A pretty quick read, but rich in depth, the book unashamedly argues for exactly what it says: a "God-entranced vision of all things".  Piper hits the ball out of the park in the chapters he contributes (did you expect any less?), and the chapters by J.I. Packer and Mark Dever are also particularly good.  Check it out today
