Former fleet captain Chasidah "Chaz" Bergren grew up in a renowned military family.  She still can't believe she was framed for causing the deaths of 15 innocent people and sentenced to a prison planet.  Even more unbelievable is when Gabriel "Sully" Sullivan shows up to rescue her.

Sully is from a very, very rich and influential family and was the heir until his father disowned him.  He became a smuggler and had several run-ins with Chaz until he had to fake his death.

But Chaz never completely believed it.  Sully helps her escape because he needs her help to destroy the gen-labs that are making jukors - mutant monstrous beasts made in government-sanctioned labs.  Jukors were outlawed ten years ago and the horrifying way they're being created now must be stopped.  Sully knows the location of one lab:  Marker, where Chaz's brother is a high-level official.

This story has it all, fast pace, detailed and interesting characters, sexual tension, reasonable science fiction.  The underlying story of intolerance and fear is exceptional.  A good science fiction story with tender romance.
