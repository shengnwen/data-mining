Mr. Quincy did an excellent job on putting this book together.  I have not yet read a book by anyone who would have gone as far back as Mr. Quincy did with this book.  As a little Hmong girl growing up, I have always been curious of where Hmong people really existed from. My father tried his best to educate me on who we- the Hmong people were. Many of what he taught me seemed to be unreal, until I read Hmong: History of A People. It really shocked me that what my father was telling me was actually in print! My suggestion to all the Hmong people out there is that EVERYONE should read this book. There is not a doubt in my mind that you will not gain a better understanding of where you came from. After I had finished reading the book, I was shocked to know that my Great-great-great-great Grandfather was the &quot;Hmong King&quot;- Nhia Vue Lee. My appreciation goes to Mr. Quincy and his desire in wanting to have a better understanding of our culture
