A magically gifted Orb quests for the Llano, an omnipotent musical score, in "Being A Green Mother", the fifth installment of the "Incarnations of Immortality" series.  The bizarre final chapters undervalue the beginning's remarkable character development as the storyline is filled with the standard vocabulary and considerable logical breakdowns throughout the series.  An arousing crusade opposing Satan and the powerful energy of Nature could have built a tremendously amazing novel.

Minor Incarnations appear as Gaea's assistants, however as with the other novels the primary character reveals more unusual associations with the other Incarnations and connections with the earlier storylines.  Satan's ultimate interest in fulfilling the Orb prophecy is a huge revelation.  The last pages present a major cliffhanger, which exceeds any prior ending in the series.

Orb's confusing behavior conflicts between a sweet and innocent young woman to an impulsive and occasionally naughty vixen.  Even though the Incarnation of Nature's appearance is unseen until near the end (offering further depth than the earlier novels), she ambiguously assumes the office unlike the other exacting methods as found with Death or Fate.  Satan's continuous illusions eventually become very confusing and frustrating as a reader.

I recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.  However those of a highly inflexible religious background or intolerant attitude towards religion might want to avoid the selection.

Thank you
