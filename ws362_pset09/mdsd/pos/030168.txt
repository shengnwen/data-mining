The Mexican section of this book is well worn in my house, even though I own over 15 Mexican cookbooks -- Jeff's just hit the spot.  The Armenian recipes are wonderful, and my Armenia FIL loved the meals.  The only  sadness I have with this book is the Three Ancient Cuisines that are  missing!  I love to take a country and make an entire meal and my family  loves it, too.  I HIGHLY recommend this cookbook, which I can read like a  novel
