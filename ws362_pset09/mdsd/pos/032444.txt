Neil J. Sullivan does a good job explaining some of the politics and corrutption surrounding the building and keeping of Yankee Stadium in N.Y. Being a native New Yorker I can relate to some of these events. Being a scholar as well, their are some things that I disagree with and some things tend to be repeat themselves in his book. He does go off subject some and then tries to tie it all together. I thought the book was a very good read!
