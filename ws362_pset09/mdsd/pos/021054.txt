I didn't know who he was before buying the book but you bet I learned who he is and what he's done. Great person to read and learn from. The book was very inspiring but specially was technically estimulating to the level that for the first time in my life I think I can give it a shot and write something. He explained writing the script not as an art but a science. Most of the times when he mentioned that writing is also an art he refered to this a "something that takes years to develop" so instead of making me feel bad about this, he went ahead and taught me the basics, the basic structure, the basic approach and it was killer to have some actual samples of his work the reinforcing his words.  The books is technical so dont expect an "about my life" book which is great... it's clear that Jeffrey has forged his talent and reputation by his work and not by saying how great he is. The book starts technical and ends in a more conversational way when Jeffrey tells you his "points of view" on different media types including internet. One thing I would love to ask him is to release an updated edition or even a new book on writing for a) writing for the internet and b) full length picture writing.  When he wrote this book, internet animation was booming, now it's here so, some advice from him on this regard would be useful
