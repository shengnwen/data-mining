Many of us have searched for years for answers to basic questions about why we are here in this life and how should we conduct ourselves.

His description of how we are "domesticated" into the Dream of the Planet, and the path to take to free ourselves from being controlled in our lives by that old dream, has freed me to live a much more authentic life
