A great book, full of Ruskin's own special insights on art. Esp art in relation to the world, how it impacts our lives, re life, religion, morals, functionality, even. There are sections on aspects of rendering too...  line, color, light. All in all, useful to artists and artwriters alike. It  is no less applicable now than when these lectures were delivered, I think,  only the phrasing, not the content, is nineteenth century. These were very  important thoughts, that set the tenor of art criticism for the entire 20th  century. A few really clear b/w illustrations attend the text beautifully
