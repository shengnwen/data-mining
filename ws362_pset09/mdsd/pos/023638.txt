The only stories in here you should read are, The mist, Cain rose up, Mrs. Todd's shortcut, The Raft, Gramma, *Ballad of the flexible bullet,* 

If you just read these and ignore the other ones you wont be missing much. They are nice in their own ways but nothing that will really stick with you. At the very least you should read Ballad of the Flexible Bullet
