I bought this as a birthday gift but after trying some of the recipes I had to buy myself one too. The appetizing photos were the inspiration to immediately try "Rosemary Scones Topped With Caramelized Vidalias" and "Glazed lemon Coconut Bread". My family's rave reviews prompted me to try many more of these imaginative recipes. The clear, straight-forward instructions and tips (curdling of lemon juice-evaporated milk mixture is normal-don't worry!) resulted in successes every time. Besides the tried-and-true recipes Grandma used to make, I found many new creative ones such as Low-Fat Triple Apple Oat and Banana Flaxseed. What a treasure
