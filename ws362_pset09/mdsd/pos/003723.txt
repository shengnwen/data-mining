If you love to learn flower arrangement but are frustrated by pretty books that don't show you HOW to make an arrangement, this is the book for you! There are detailed step-by-step instructions for each arrangement.  As one  of the reviewer had mentioned, the only shortcoming for this book is that  some plant material may not be available in the US.  Still, I don't see  this as too much of an issue as it is not too difficult to substitute  native plants with similar look and color.  I highly recommend this to  ikebana neophytes
