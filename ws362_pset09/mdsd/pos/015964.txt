Nussbaum's persuasive arguments altered my position on human rights in that I was able to see new possibilities for all men and women. Her many perspectives on human rights were so well-documented that I have used her books, "Sex and Social Justice" and "Women and Human Development," as textbooks and sources to support my thoughts when writing papers and having conversations on subjects that have ranged from early child development to global poverty. Her capabilities approach to issues of gender equality are supremely encouraging. If you are looking for a scholarly text that encompasses multi-faceted, intelligent viewpoints, I recommend Martha C. Nussbaum's books
