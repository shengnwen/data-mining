An interesting tale that uses Tarot images to sanctify everyday aspects of existence.  Powers offers an emotionally rich plotline which he fleshes out into grand themes of loss, redemption, and the meaning of family.  

Although he delves into the darker side of human relationships, Powers manages to deliver an exciting upbeat tale which kept my attention to the end.
