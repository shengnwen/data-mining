I bought this book for my sister's daughter's birthday, but read it to both kids.  Megan's little brother kept taking it into his room, so I had to go back to Borders and buy another one.

I bought the second in the series and they both love it too.

This author is a very talented writer.  I could care less if she publishes her own books or a publishing house publishes them, TALENT WILL OUT!

I'm pleased for her that her marvelous, original characters are becoming so very popular with the younger generation.  Fine, moral books like this are needed in today's world.

Thanks, Ms. Sweet, for bringing these gifts to delight our children for generations to come. - Dora Dalrymple from New Mexico (pet groomer
