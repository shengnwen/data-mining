This is the first "for Dummies" book that I have purchased and I must say it is great for the beginning paralegal student as well as a paralegal graduate students. This book is a great refresher!  When I purchased the book I was able to recap legal research and writing courses that I had completed a couple semesters ago. I was in the process of taking business law and ethics and this book helped me to understand the basics of the two courses I was about to explore as well as refreshed my memory on past courses.  I will refer back to this book as a reference.  This book really does cover EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW about the paralegal profession!!!

The reason I gave this a 4 star is because the legal documents on the CD are pretty basic, although they provide good information for things to include in these documents, the CD does not provide an in-depth look at the complete documents to file or send, just an idea. The CD is useful when it comes to learning more about the system and I must say this CD does have a pretty good idea of what to include in your resume and cover letter. In conclusion, the book is great but the CD should be referred to as a beginning idea of what goes into legal documents and not a template
