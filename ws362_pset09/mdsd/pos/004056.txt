I have been a project manager most of my life but generally under different names than project manager.  The facts that I learned and more are captured in the PMBOK.  In fact, this book dissects the knowledge of project management in several ways so that it can be fitted to all companies and industries.

The guide to the body of knowledge is a wonderful road map to project management.  It doesn't contain all of the details that are needed but it does show the elements that are usually necessary for projects to survive and flourish
