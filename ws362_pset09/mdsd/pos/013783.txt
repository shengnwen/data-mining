A very fine first novel, The Love-Artist attempts to breathe life into the Roman poet and libertine, Ovid -- rather like Pygmalion breathing life into his creation, Galatea, in Ovid's own Metamorphoses. The only problem is that the story isn't quite as fully or as well realized as I hoped it would be. The writing is beautiful, full of remarkable, poetic images, but where these should be the embellishment, with the story providing a solid backbone, in The Love-Artist, it's rather the other way around: the images are the primary substance, and the backbone of the story is rather more weak than I would have liked. It feels like the novel a poet would write -- a mixed compliment and criticism.

Still, well worth reading for the beauty of its language alone
