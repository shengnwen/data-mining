When Valerie's mother announces not only that she wants a divorce, but that she is leaving her husband for another woman, life is turned upside-down. But it isn't long before Valerie discovers dealing with her friends' reactions and working through her own shock are small potatoes compared to the decision she must make: a) live with mom and her new vegetarian girlfriend, or b) move to Schwerinborg with her father, who has just been hired as protocol chief for the royal family. Well, what teenager wouldn't give living in a palace in Europe a try? So Valerie makes the move and is soon unknowingly befriending Schwerinborg's resident Prince Charming, Georg. But can an American teenage girl live up to royal standards?

This book was cute and fun, and I think it would appeal to many fans of the popular books for teenagers by authors such as Meg Cabot and Louise Rennison. The fictional foreign country isn't entirely convincing at times, but it doesn't really make this pretty short book any less enjoyable. I'm looking forward to the sequel
