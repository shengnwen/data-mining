These crossword puzzles are, for the most part, easy to medium difficulty.  The twist is that they're "funny".  By funny, I mean kind of corny, but in a good way.  People who are familiar with NY Times puzzles will recognize this type of puzzle: there's often a gimmick or particular style of pun that shows up in 3 or 4 large clues in the puzzle.  They often show up in Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday puzzles.  

I can easily recommend this book, it's a great one to do on airplanes to stave off the grumpiness that most people feel while traveling.  It also makes for a nice go-to book when you know you want a quicker or less difficult puzzle.  A great gift, for yourself or someone else
