Once I read this book (about 1 year ago) I rushed out and picked up all of her books.  However, this book is in between on the must read list of hers.  When I decided to write a review I was thinking this book was just ok...but then I realized this is THE BOOK that turned me onto Philippa Gregory!  I've since read 10 other of her books and this one falls in between.  Thus if you have read Meridon, this book is much better...but compared to THe Other Boleyn Girl...this book is not nearly half as good
