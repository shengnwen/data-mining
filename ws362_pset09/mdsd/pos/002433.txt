I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which is not at all a how-to manual, but a philosophical yet lively, easy-to-read analysis of women and the internet: how the new medium affects how they relate to men, each other and the  technology itself. Highly recommended for anyone interested in feminism,  whether or not they have on-line experience
