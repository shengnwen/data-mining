Odets subtitled an early draft of the play, An American Allegory. This is the story of Joe Bonaparte who is transformed from an emotional and music-loving young man into a ruthless boxer. In this play music stands for creativity, self-realization and spiritual values. The whole play is, in fact, metaphorically a statement of the conflict between spiritual and material values. The ring is a metaphor for the cutthroat world of American individualism (which proved to be inadequate in the 1930s) where life itself appears as a fight to climb the ladder of success. In fact, the tragic story of Joe is a dramatization of the Horatio Alger formula gone wrong. Joe's dream of money-success is a dream that turns into a nightmare in the aggressive capitalist system
