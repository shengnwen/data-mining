These are great plays, and this is a beautiful translation.

I think, though, that to really appreciate what Aeschylus accomplished (aided and abetted by Fagles), most modern readers should really read the entire trilogy twice.

When these plays were first performed, the entire audience would have known the story of Agamemnon's fate and Orestes' revenge from the Odyssey, and probably from other sources besides.  The interest came from seeing how Aeschylus would reweave the tale - with what turns of phrase, what dramatic revelations, what poetic license, what new ways of glorifying Athens or bemoaning some new turn in Athenian politics.

The best way to replicate that experience is to read the entire trilogy once to see how it unfolds and how it ends, then to read it again for the nuances of language. Aeschylus is subtle, and Fagles brings out this subtlety in this translation: for example, almost every line uttered in the first part of Agamemnon has a double meaning (at least!), even rendered in English.

Not only this, but the dimensions of the tragedy become clearer the second time around.  On the first reading, having forgotten much of the story, I found it gripping.  On the second reading, I found it heartrending.

Like another reviewer on this site, I recommend skipping the introductory essay and diving right into the plays.  Make up your own mind about what all of this means and why it might be important.  Then read the essay if you want to see if you agree with it
