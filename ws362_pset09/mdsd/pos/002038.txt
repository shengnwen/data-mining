Haviong already created quite an interesting set of circumstances with her eleven previous Stephanie Plum novels, Janet Evanovich outdoes herself with this twelfth volume in the series. The entire volume is a very cleverly put together mixture of murder and mayhem, bounty hunting and baddies, desire and romance, all of which is topped by a string of humour that will have everyone laughing out loud, not the least of which is the side-event of Stephanie Plum's grandmother deciding to join a female rock group and grind away link Mick Jagger.  A thoroughly good read, keeps the reader glued page by page, for if it's not murder, bounty hunting, romance and danger with Ranger,love with Morelli, it's one of those amazing dinner parties at the Plum  family residence
