The first half of A Simple Story is so good, you'll want to savor every paragraph.  The plot climaxes when the two strong-willed, intelligent, lovable protagonists acknowledge their love for each other and get married. 

They're financially independent and in love, and there isn't a war on. What could possibly go wrong? Well, the guy is summoned overseas for some unexplained job-related reason. (Not at all believable.) During his three year absence, the woman goes crazy (completely out of character) and has an affair with a local yokel she doesn't even like. The husband returns home, becomes infuriated, and proceeds to kick her out and disown their infant daughter. The wife dies of a broken heart. The daughter grows up without knowing her father.

SPOILER ALERT

The second half of the book is all about Matilda, the boring, goody-goody daughter, who tries to get back into her father's good graces, even though he has forbidden anyone even to mention her or her late mother. He allows Matilda to live in his sprawling mansion, but he banishes her from his sight. Whenever he's in residence, she has to go and hide in the attic. Her wishy-washy cousin comes to visit, and they happen to encounter one another in a corridor of the mansion. They fall in love and eventually get married with the father's approval.

I pretty much lost interest when the wife died.
