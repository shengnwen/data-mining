At last, an accurate account of Benedict Arnold's key role in assuring the Americans would win the American Revolution! Benedict Arnold's Navy is a delightful read,well written, fast paced from begining to end and clearly describes the importance of the Battle of Valcour Island to subsequent events in the Revolution. Jim Nelson is to be commended for providing a readble and scholarly treatment of a neglected piece of history so important to our heritage
