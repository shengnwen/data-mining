This book was by far an incredible ending to a very interesting and different Nora Roberts writing.  I was really looking forward do the big battle between good vs. evil and "Valley of Silence" did not disappoint at all. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not know what would become of Cian and Moira.  I was happy to read their love story and quite surprised at the ending.  The battle was well played out and the evil characters of Lilith, Lora, Davey and Midir were written with as much characterization as the good guys.  Glenna, Hoyt, Blair, Larken, Cian and Moira are amazing characters.  Moira started out as a somewhat meek and mild member of the circle but by story's end, she is the most self-transformed constituent of the group.  Without giving away the conclusion, all I can say is don't miss this story.  It is amazing
