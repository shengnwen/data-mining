I found this book a very thorough guide to chess strategies. In each chapter, Sunil selects a game that pertains to a certain theme and gives a thorough analysis. The best part is that his analysis is not limited to that theme. Sunil takes a step further and manages to incorporate also opening, strategic and tactical themes. Then, at the end of each chapter, there are supplemental games for a reader to go through. Practically every well-known strategy lessons, guidelines, and advice are in this book. Sunil indeed delivers the best chess lessons. His approach to teaching chess is excellent. In my opinion, this is how all chess books should be written. The book is not for a beginner though so please take a note of that. Yet, I do believe that the sooner a beginner will read this book the better off he or she will be.
