If you knew me at all, you'd be shocked to discover that this book is on my shelf.  I am not the type to read Christina Hoff Sommers.  Now, I have been known to buy up copies of "Babywise" and "The Nurture Assumption" (different authors) just to keep other parents from accidentally stumbling across what I deem to be harmful nonsense, but I bought this book because I actually agreed with it.
That's not to say that everything in this book is good or accurate, but a lot of what Sommers said in this book made sense, even while other parts of it made me cringe.  The fact is, women are NOT fragile, gentle creatures and feminism is about equality, not superiority.  While Sommers is not always accurate in her research, the basic sentiment of this book, as I read it, was that one need not crush boys to empower women.  
I happen to agree
