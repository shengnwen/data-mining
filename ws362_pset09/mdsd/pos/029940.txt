This is a textbook of witchcraft and demonology written by the Catholic priest that found the need to translate the "Malleus Maleficarum" (the professional manual for witch hunters for nearly three centuries) into modern English.  This was written prior to the modern Wiccan movement and discusses the horrors of sorcery and pacts with the devil.  If you are looking for the definitive non-fiction work on the evils of witchcraft and demonology then, you have found it.  If you are looking for a book promoting bunny-fluff Wiccan friendship magic, you're in over your head here.
