I've been utilizing ayurvedic principles in cooking for over 20 years and this is by far my favorite ayurvedic cookbook.  Ms. Hospodar has a wide range of cuisines she draws from, not just Indian, and a great wit and charming way of sharing her wealth of ayurvedic wisdom.  My understanding is that she worked on this book for many years perfecting every aspect until it was "cooked to perfection". I have a shelf full of good cookbooks but Heaven's Banquet is the main one that I use day in and day out
