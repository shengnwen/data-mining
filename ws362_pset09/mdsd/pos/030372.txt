This book is great for begginers and i guess also for experienced people. 

They've exaggerated with the title, but even so i think you can get incredible results in your makeup after having this book. It is true that you won't achieve with normal amount of make up  the results that you see in the photos and trying to get the flawless faces that shows the book would look too unreal in person, but probably it would work for a photo session. 

I like the fact that anyone can follow all the advices in the book without spending too much money, also the chapter of the tools (brushes,etc) was great, i learned a lot. I must say that this book gives you the general techniques and tools needed to get the effect you want, the rest is practice.

The book has a good presentation and nice paper, but i expected a bigger size, fortunately the content was worthy. 

I don't regret that i bought this book, it's a good beggining.
