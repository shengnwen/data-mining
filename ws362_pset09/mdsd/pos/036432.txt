This book deals with a lot of issues that hadn't been dealt with, from a Christian's point of view. I recommend this book highly for ALL 12 step programs. The videos are a very effective tool also. They really answer some questions that I needed answering. I would also like to know if this will ever be available on cassette?  I feel that would a very effective tool, not all can take the time to sit and watch a video but most of us drive or have a cassette player of some sort.  That would be such a blessing to people.  Thanks for writing this book, Mr.  Miller and thanks to the people that saw the need,and published it.  EN
