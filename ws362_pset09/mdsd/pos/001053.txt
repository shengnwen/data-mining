A Technique for Producing Ideas  by James Young is a concise quick read. I found it to be memorable.
Some reads can be overwhelming with too much imformation , this was not the case with A Technique for Producing Ideas.
It's one of those books that you want to re-read, and being under 50 pages make it painless to do.
But don't take my word for it read it yourself
