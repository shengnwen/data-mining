I first read this book in 1996 and found it very interesting. It certainly gives a good history lesson. Last year, I decided to reread it. I have found many of their predictions come true, and none have been proven false yet. Unfortunately, I do believe the authors underestimated the power of the OECD to bully so called tax havens into capitulating. It is now almost impossible to open an offshore account as an American citizen. Not because it is illegal, but because offshore banks refuse to deal with the reporting requiremtns for Americans. A must read for any enlightened individual
