Ringer does an excellent job of writing.  His stories are amusing and well written.  While his experiences are based in the real estate arena, I can vouch for their existence in my work as well.  He does a fantastic job of entertaining while educating.  Life is full of choices.  His choice of the turtle for his image is brilliant.  Slow and steady wins the race.  Outwork and outprepare your opponents.  Never forget that in most business deals, win win in the other guys mind means he wins and he wins.  You will run into some honorable men but their goals are to optimize their side, not your side.  Even honest men are not trying to help you they just wont lie to you while they do it.  Great read and well worth it
