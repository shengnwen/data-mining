The Christmas Angel
 by Thomas Kinkade and Katherine Spencer
I know it's not Christmas but a good story but a good story is a good story.
We all know of Thomas Kinkade as a great painter of light, but have you read any of his stories?  This is in the Cape Light series.
This book tells more of Emily, a mayor, she's older and recently married. Emily had a daughter over 20 years ago that her mother talked her into giving up. She now has a good relationship with her daughter, but has missed all of the bringing her up.
 One morning Emily was jogging she spies something moving in the cradle set up outside the church, a little hand. The baby inside starts an adventure you don't want to miss
