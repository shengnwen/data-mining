This book has a narrow focus that addresses one of the most challenging parts of the application process.  

It has the information you need, but it is only 54 pages which makes it expensive when you add shipping as well.  

For me this book was worth the cost as I'm trying to give myself every advantage possible, but if you're on a budget, you might want to consider getting a more general book first and then buying this only if you are still concerned about how your oral interview might go.
