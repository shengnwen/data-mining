     Loaded Dice was very entertaining.  During the five days that Tony Valentine(the protagonist)spends in Las Vegas, he discovers  a scheme that cheats a casino, is accused of murder, has a short romance with an addicted gambler, saves his son, and gets involved with terrorists. Tony did all the work and I relaxed. This is a very easy read and there is lots of interesting information about methods of cheating at games. I recommend this book
