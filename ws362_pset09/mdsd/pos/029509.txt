This book is absolutely stupendous.   Not only does it encourage one to think, it encourages us to really think.  This is so important today, with so many media venues, we hear all this information, but are we really thinking about it?  Unfortunately most people don't think, they just listen and regurgitate what they heard.  It is frightening how many people can get by without thinking, and how the author points out how society would probably be a lot different if everyone would think, not just a select few.  I feel as though I earned a PhD reading this book. It should be required reading at all academia levels.  I feel as though I am a better person because of Dennis Prager.
