What a great book!  This book got better with each chapter.  The reality of being a female in Iran, in the not too distant past, is staggering.  Young Ghazal dodged many bullets and had a hard time keeping her mouth shut which added a little spice to the story.  In particular, personal battles for truth, right vs wrong and sticking up for herself in the family and school.  I used to think all the Muslim women covered their beautiful hair and faces by choice and wore long hot dresses for the same reason.  Unfortunately, these women have brothers, fathers and husbands that make their choices for them.  Without income, birth control and education, they have no choices.  Ghazal understood God at a very young age and with His guidance went forward.  Without much writing experience, she did a great job putting this very deep book together.
