This book is a bit slow to start, but after you get into the characters, you begin to see a wonderful display of what happens in a May-December relationship (one much older than the other).  Throughout the story, you are given equal information about both sides, what they are feeling and how thier totally different lives feed off of each other, that is until they are in the bedroom.  That is where they put aside their differences.  A good read, a great storyline, and another brilliant book from Rita Mae Brown
