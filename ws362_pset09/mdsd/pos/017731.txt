This book is an exquisitely written page-turner with a surprising double ending. I won't give it away but it takes the whole experience - the whole journey  - that the author takes us on, and leaves us with two options of how things really went down. I don't read books twice usually, but this one I could read again. 

Between readings, I started thinking like Pi, if it were me stranded in the boat, having to be resourceful. It took me away, into another world in which I begin thinking of how I would live my last days. Clearly the story has a successful ending because it was written in first person. So I kept hanging on every page to find out where he'd wind up and how he'd manage in the elements with very little supplies.

FABULOUS BOOK
