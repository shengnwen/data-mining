This book is one to have! This book is what I call the greatest beginners book to waterfowl. It takes you step by step, thru different breeds (Canvasback &amp; Green-winged teal), types (Dabblers &amp; divers), and the anatomy of the birds. It is a great book for any waterfowl painter or  Waterfowl carving beginning artist to invest in. It has helped me a lot and it has helped my other fellow artist out also. (Like 2000 Federal Duck Stamp artist Adam Grimm) Take my word: get this book. You'll thank me
