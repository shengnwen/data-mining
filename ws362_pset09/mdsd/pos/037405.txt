It is painfully apparent that the reviewers who dislike Mr. Khalidi's book do so out of their desire to act as one-sided apologists for the Israeli state, instead of seriously engaging in a historical debate of the issues. If you are interested in the Truth about the core of today's problems in Israel / Palestine, buy and read this book.
