A Japanese man travels across the Pacific to reach the shores of the United States in this Caldecott awarded book. The story is told from his grandson's perspective in simple prose befitting an easy book. But the story is deceptively deep. This is no ordinary journey, but a courageous search for a new life in a new world. Character strengths like perseverance and faithful outlook are easily discerned in the grandfather as he builds a family and a worthy life in the U.S. But Japan is never far from his mind, and he daydreams about his former life in his homeland. It is a positive tale good not only for Asian Americans, but for anyone seeking inspiration.
