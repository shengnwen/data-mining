     The Meanest Doll in the World starts off where the Doll People left off. In the Palmers house there are two sets of regular dolls, the porcelain Dolls and the plastic Funcrafts. Tiffany Funcraft and Annabelle Doll are best friends and decide to go on an adventure in the attic with Annabelle's Auntie Sarah. When the Dolls get in the attic they stay out later than they are supposed to and they almost get caught by the human Palmers so they jump in Kate's Backpack and are off to School!
