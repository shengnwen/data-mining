The Color of Water is one of my all time favorite books. I've read it again and again and each time, I marvel at the strength and determination of McBride's mother. This story is a testimony of God's grace and fortitude. As a single mother, I find it amazing and inspiring how one woman (on her own mostly) could essentially raise 12 successful, hardworking, creative citizens. It was through her unselfish rearing and unwavering faith in God that she and her beautiful family survived and ultimately thrived. MUST READ!
