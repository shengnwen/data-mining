Like young Arthur of the thousand-year old legend of Camelot, our hero, Will Stanton, is surprised early in his adolescence to learn that in fact he is not a normal boy. He is someone for whom great things are destined, and who naturally feels totally unprepared for the daunting responsibilities thrust on him. It's a classic trope, one that has been used thousands of times, most familiarly for this generation in the Harry Potter series. Unlike J.K. Rowling however, Susan Cooper puts Will firmly in the middle of a loving family. Both parents are positive characters, and even his many siblings, with their teasing and pranks, ultimately support and care for each other. I recommend that parents read this book with their children, it won't bore them, and it has themes that can be discussed over and over.
