I really like the History Pockets series - they're wonderful. And, this book is quite good and full of a variety of age appropriate activities that my boys really enjoyed.  However, I question how some of the tribes were selected; specifically, the Seminoles of the Southeast Region.  While the HP units can stand alone quite well as a unit study, I like to complement them with additional information and activities for my boys.  I found it particularly difficult to find any complementary information/activities for the Seminoles.  I think the Cherokee tribe would have been a much better choice.  The same holds true for the Maidu tribe of the Californias - very limited information available to supplement. Also, I wish that this book had included tribes for the Great Basin and the Sub-Arctic regions.  To include these two areas would make this unit completely comprehensive and thorough.  Nonetheless, it is a good resource to have and follow as part of an early elementary study on Native Americans
