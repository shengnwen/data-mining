I went to look for a hike in the Sacramento area and there was only one!  In all fairness, my book is an edition or two old, but the most recent version only has two!  So, if you live in the Sacramento area, don't expect to find a lot of local hikes.  Other than that, I think it's a fairly good book if not a bit overwhelming
