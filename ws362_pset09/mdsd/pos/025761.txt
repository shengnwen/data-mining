This is the second James Bond book that I've read (the first being CASINO ROYALE).  I thought that this book really lived up to the first one.  I think that it was great, as good as CASINO ROYALE.  But, like CASINO  ROYALE, LIVE AND LET DIE had its flaws.  In CASINO ROYALE; the villian, Le  Chiffre, was killed about two-thirds into the novel but the real conclusion  is at the end and is slightly dissapointing.  In LIVE AND LET DIE; the  villian, Mr. Big, dies at the end (I'll leave it up to the reader to see  how) but his death is slightly unbelievable.  All in all LIVE AND LET DIE  had better characterizations than CASINO ROYALE, but the atmosphere isn't  as rich.  This book is a good read and I would recomend it to any fan of  the James Bond movies - but read it with an open mind because the Bond in  the books isn't the same as the Bond in the movies
