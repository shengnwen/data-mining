A very entertaining read with plenty of education on pointing dog training.  Most of the lessons are anecdotal, but this book will certainly help anyone who's training a bird dog.  He does admit that the best book he knows for training is Gun Dog by Wolters which I also recommend.  Steven Mulak writes wonderful short stories on bird hunting and for those stricken with the upland hunting "bug", his books are a must for your library.  Mulak is to bird hunting as Gierach is to fly fishing.  There is a sense that these two authors understand why the reader is so obsessed with these outdoor activities and they are adept at passing this on to the reader.  It feels as if you are accompanying the author on his hunting trips, experiencing the point and the flush.  Mulak is able to pass his love for upland hunting to the reader.  Pointing Dogs Made Easy is a must read for anyone who owns or trains bird dogs.
