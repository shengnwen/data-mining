New to the subject, I found the book pitched at the right level, stimulating for the layman and a useful starting point for teaching.
 However, having paid the usual ton of cash for an academic text I was appalled to find ch 4- 'Global Markets'- scattered with solecisms and typos. I counted five, my favourite (I'm English) being the 'Untied States'. Clearly a spellchecker from the last century was used here.
 I have been in touch with the chapter's author, Al Rosenbloom, and he very affably explains that the fault lies with the publishers. This makes sense. My grouse is that text books shouldn't contain any typos, least of all those that address the computer-driven future of commerce. If cutting edge publishing allows errors such as 'wherkever'  and 'Cambodia is country...' to creep into a  reference book then the technology has a long way to go. 
Otherwise recommended
