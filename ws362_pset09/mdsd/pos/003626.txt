This book is a radical wisdom teaching. The premise is simple - that the only reality is to be found in the present moment, but the realization of this changes the way we look at and react with the world. I've read the book twice: once to understand what he's talking about, and again to see how to apply it. I have given it to several friends. The best thing about the book is the question-and-answer format, which deals with most of the problems that come up. I also liked the references to Buddhism and Christianity. The book is especially valuable for people who deal with depression and/or anxiety. A lot of the reviews of this book are negative; as Tolle points out, the ego has a lot invested in its survival
