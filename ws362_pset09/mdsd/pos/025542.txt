This second installment in the Molly Blume series lives up to the promise of the first, Blues in the Night.  Molly is a modern Orthodox Jewish woman and a crime sheet reporter for a local Los Angeles rag.  She reports on vandalisms in some of L.A.'s swanky areas that are governed by HARP, the Historical Architectural Restoration and Preservation boards, then sells the L.A. Times an article about the controversy between HARP supporters and foes.  While visiting a HARP neighborhood, Molly meets retired Professor Oscar Linney when he jumps out in front of her car, apparently lost and confused.  By doing some gentle probing, she figures out where he lives and takes the old guy to his daughter's house, where he bangs on the door and yells until the neighbor comes out and explains that his daughter has been missing for several months.  A short time later the Professor is killed, and Molly can't help but wonder if her article contributed to his death.  Meanwhile, she's been dating her former high school heart throb, Orthodox rabbi Zack Abrams, and the relationship deepens here, despite Molly's short skirts and her obsession with the professor's death.  There are lots of suspects in this whodunit and Krich kept me guessing until the very end.  This book should hold strong appeal for Faye Kellerman fans, especially of her early works.  Note - there is lots of Jewish terminology sprinkled throughout the book, but Krich thoughtfully provides a pronunciation guide up front and a glossary in the back
