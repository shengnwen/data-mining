Buy Low Sell High is very different than the vague theories or get rich quick ploys put out by most books of this genre.  The authors' ideas are explicit and well thought through.  They give real examples and it's obvious the authors have been in the real estate business for some time.  This is the best (and probably cheapest) way to learn a lot from a couple of pros.
Highly recommended
