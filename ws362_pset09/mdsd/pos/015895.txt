I originally received this book by accident as an unwanted &quot;feature selection&quot; of a book club. However, I was so impressed with it that I decided to keep it. It contains mammoth entries on America's major wars,  many small ones covering lesser known interventions by U.S. forces  throughout the world (such as the expedition to Russia in 1918 to fight the  Bolsheviks), and biographical sketches of important American and foreign  military leaders. Most importantly, this book is fairly neutral and  objective when discussing any controversies. Its an excellent overview, and  anyone interested in American military history will enjoy it
