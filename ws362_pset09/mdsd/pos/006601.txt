THE SACRED POWER OF THE HUNA provides a wealth of scientific and anthropological information in a delightfully engaging page-turner of a book. Author Rima Morrell shares her own personal experiences with the ways of Hawaiian kahuna along with her translations of ancient Hawaiian chants, and shares some of the key similarities and differences between beliefs and practices of Hawaiian kahunas and those of other ancient indigenous peoples, such as the Hopi. Morrell explains how so much ancient Hawaiian knowledge was kept secret for so long, as she brings us on her journey of discovery. Morrell's juicy style of writing breathes fresh life into such fascinating topics as fire walking, the death prayer, Hawaiian lunar astrology, and shamanic power of the erotic Hawaiian hula dance. Most importantly, Morrell describes the practical process by which we can each create our reality by being aware of our high, middle and low selves. I highly recommend this wonderful book to anyone interested in Hawaii, shamanism, and spiritual growth
