We seriously doubted we could train our daughter in a day - we hoped a couple of weeks would get us headed in the right direction.  You'll be dubious too when you read the intro (tells about a Mom who trained their kid in 5 hours), but after 3 days of using the methods from this book, our daughter was clean and dry.  She didn't really take to the doll like the book said she would, but the basic ideas in the book are very easy to implement and helped A LOT.  It's a quick read and gives good guidance, but is not so strict you can't adapt it to your own parenting style and the personality of your toddler.  Just be patient - potty training won't be easy.  We were ready to give up after half a day, but we're SO glad we stuck it out - the second day was much easier and day 3 was great
