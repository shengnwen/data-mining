A look at the history of U.S. presidential assassinations.  Part history, part comic commentary, Ms. Vowell extensively documents her visits to sites (official or not) associated with these events.  The history of the assassinations alone is interesting and details are often overlooked (or not looked at at all - e.g., Garfield, McKinley) when these events are presented / captured in popular forums.  It is a quick read that will shed light on and insight into these assassinations that you never considered before
