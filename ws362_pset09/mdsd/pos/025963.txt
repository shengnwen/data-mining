What a wonderful, outstanding book! Susan Meissner writes with incredible insight and understanding for the difficult situations faced by the characters in this story. She has a gift for writing with compassion and warmth, never becoming 'preachy' or sounding superior. This is a novel that has stayed with me - it's that good.
