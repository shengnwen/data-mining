This is a fabulous novelization of the 1933 classic movie that most people know retells the story Beauty and the Beast except in this case as one of prime characters filmmaker Carl Denhan says at the end "Beauty killed the beast".  The exhilarating story line adheres to the plot of the film yet embellishes it with a deeper look at the events that occur in the movie starting with Carl's last second finding of "Beauty" in 1932 Manhattan, the voyage to Skull Island, meeting and capturing Kong, and the climax on the Empire State Building.  A short forward on the filmmaker Merrian C. Cooper adds depth to a delightful rendition that fans of the mighty Kong will want to read as this reviewer did with euphoric enjoyment.
