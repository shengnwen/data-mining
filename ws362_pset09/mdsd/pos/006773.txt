I'm shocked that some people didn't like this book. I have found it to be warm, practical, compassionate and right on the money when it comes to describing the typical developmental stages children go through, as well as any problems or medical ailments they might have. It's definitely the first book I reach for whenever my children get sick, or enter some new developmental stage I'm not familiar with. Forget Penelope Leach, Terry Brazelton and the rest; Dr. Spock is the best
