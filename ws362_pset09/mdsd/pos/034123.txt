In this book; Rules of the Road there is mainly just 3 main characters. The main character is Jenna; she works at Gladstone's Shoes. Then there is Mrs. Gladstone the founder of Gladstone Shoes. Then sort of a main character is Jenna's dad, he I think makes Jenna more brave, and courageous. The whole story takes place from Chicago Illinois, to Texas. They drive around everywhere because of some conference, that has to do with the shoe store. But does Jenna know what her dad is going to do to make her burst? 

"The sky line reminded me of the beautiful Chicago sky line back at home." That quote was reminding me that this author pays close attention to all of the detail. She missed home that wherever Jenna turned she thought of Chicago. The sky line made me think of not Chicago, but New York City. Joan Bauer puts hidden details throughout the whole book.

I don't think that Joan Bauer did that great of a job on this. Compared to her other work. Like Backwater it seemed like she tried harder in that book. Or at least had more in common with Backwater. If I had to chose and she made it into a movie, I wouldn't go see it. I don't think that it would catch my attention at all.

I don't think that I would recommend this book. Unless you like books that have a very odd, story element. Which I don't like. Also I didn't like how there was more than one setting. It changes all the time. So if you can keep switching your brain gears I would not at all recommend this book, Rules of the Road.
