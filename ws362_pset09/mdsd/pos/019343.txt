As I started reading it, many of my impressions and assumptions about daylilies disintegrated and a whole new concept was formed. They originated in Asia and there are more than 32,000 cultivars. Some consider them to be  the perfect perennial because they tolerate a variety of conditions.   Culture, pest, and propagation is covered along with requirements for  registering new cultivars. It gives advice on which cultivars are best  suited for your soil.  Lists of cultivars are useful for selection since  they indicate what size they are and how hardy they are.  Good book
