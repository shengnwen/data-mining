This is an impressive work by the lucid John Searle.  This work is relatively brief but contains Searle's insightful treatment of both social  reality and a cogent defense of realism, the idea that there is a reality  independent of human construction.  This book repays careful reading. Not  because it is difficult to understand, to the contrary, Searle is a very  clear writer with a real talent for presenting useful examples.  Rather,  Searle's arguments are simple but often have substantial implications whose  importance emerges only on reflection.  In this book, Searle describes the  likely underpinnings of social, as opposed to physical reality.  He  develops very interesting analyses of how these two spheres differ and how  we differ in our relation to them.  He shows also the relationship between  them.  Searle's treatment of social constructionism is particularly  powerful and demonstrates the implicit contradictions and sterility of this  faddish ideology.  Searle is particularly concerned with maintaining a high  level of rational discourse in intellectual life. His work is a model in  this respect
