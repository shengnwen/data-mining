For all those who have read and loved a Rushdie novel, Imaginary Homelands provides more of the same biting humor, insightful thoughts, and elegant prose as Rushdie shares with us his thoughts on everything from censorship  to Stephen Hawking.  A fair amount of time is spent on criticisms of  various novels and authors and I, for one, found it fascinating to see what  such an acclaimed author thinks of his peers. Given that this volume  contains numerous essays, you will definitely want to pick and choose what  to read and will probably end up doing so over an extended period of time.  But you must at least take the time to read a little. As always, Rushdie's  language is beautiful and forthrightness admirable
