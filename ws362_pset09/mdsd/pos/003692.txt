This is not a stand-alone novel.  It is more like a long first chapter and leaves one hanging at the end.  The characters are entertaining and the narrative is slightly humorous.  Very intricate prose style, you need to take a little time with it.  Set in England in the 1920's among the fairly well-to-do.  That kind of setting always plays well in Citrus Heights
