This is a very lovely edition of Stevenson's &quot;A Child's Garden of Verses.&quot;  The paintings  illustrating each poem are well chosen and quite beautiful.  The print quality is also excellent.  However, I was a little disappointed to see this selection not include some of my favorite poems from Stevenson's work, most notably &quot;The Pleasant Land of Counterpane.&quot;  What is included is exceptionally well done, but this is not the complete Garden of Verses
