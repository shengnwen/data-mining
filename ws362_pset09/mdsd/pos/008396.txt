EFT, is a simple technique, Yet understanding the correct questions or even any question to ask can be the challenge.  
This wonderful book DIGS INTO the meat of the issues and opens one's mind to just what questions lurk behind those issues.  I'm an Advanced EFT practitioner and believe me there are many times that I have a need to review this book.  Chapter one, by Ron Ball, is excellent for the beginner, who is sure to be confused and have these questions that Ron addresses.  I especially appreciate  that there are a range of co-authors proficient in different subjects, there all at one's fingertips.... a lifetime of therapy experience waiting to be plucked and used for the highest good.   The exciting aspect is this is just the beginning, a jumping off point for your own growth
