If you need help fighting ANY big business, this is the book to buy! It was recommended to me by a friend who used it to successfully keep a grocery chain out of their neighborhood. Now we have followed the advice to keep developers from moving into our small town. The book is easy to read with helpful hints that can be applied to many areas of use. Thank You Thank You for writing this book
