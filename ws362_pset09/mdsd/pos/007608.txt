Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" is a thorough if somewhat slanted analysis of the fast food industry.  The author hooks the reader early with sweeping invectives against the titans of fast food.  Before you can say "Supersize Me," you've learned that Ray Kroc and his cronies are responsible for the homogenization of global culture, the spread of E. coli and other deadly pathogens, the obesity of America's children, and the exploitation of the unskilled masses.  Take a deep breath - that's just the intro.

To be fair, Schlosser dials back the hyperbole in the meat of the book.  Although it's clear that he harbors an acute dislike for the fast food industry and all that it represents, Schlosser is careful to present an objective veneer as he walks his readers through the history and inner workings of this all-American industry.  His descriptions of the meat-packing industry and its cozy ties on Capitol Hill are meticulously researched.  And his comments on fries, McNuggets and other tasty morsels are backed up with helpful portions of first-hand interviews and third-party data.

Reading "Fast Food Nation" is a guilty pleasure.  Chapter after scathing chapter feel oh-so-good to consume.  But after finishing this book, you may want some balance in your life to help keep things in perspective
