Without execution, companies are doomed to failure. Execution bridges the gap between thinking and action in the corporate arena.  This book is great for all levels of management.  With it, I recommend Optimal Thinking by Rosalene Glickman to maximize thinking in the workplace.  And I recommend Winning by Jack Welch, the best corporate leader during the past decades
