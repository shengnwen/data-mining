The value in this book is not just that it paints an interesting picture of the great John Ford, but that it also shows sides of the Ford stock actors we have not seen. Did you know that Ward Bond loved the ladies and had the hots for Vera Ralston when they were filming The Searchers? That Ford and Richard Widmark got along like gangbusters? That Ken Curtis's strange accent in The Searchers came about by accident and got him the part of Festus on Gunsmoke years later? Or that Victor Jory was a tough old bird? 

The book is full of interesting little tidbits of information like this about actors I have known and loved. It even gave me an understanding of why The Long Grey Line - one of my favorite Ford films - was not well received. All the details of the problems, the ends and outs, the stuntmen, the jokes, the hard work of making each film made me want to pull all those films off the shelf and watch them again. 

If you love old these truly classic films you will not want to miss this book
