This is a good book that I found suprisingly detailed with pertinant facts that gave me a better understanding of the culture, religion, family beliefs and social way of life in early Colonial America between 1500 to  1750 (before the Revolutionary War).  The author does an excellent job in  emphasizing the importance of the different Christian religious sects in  the colonies and how importantly they influenced the personal and social  structure in colonial life.  Life on the farm, in the town or villiage is  studied as well as the important tools, crafts, clothing that were used.   Not only is the influence of England stated in this work but that of  Holland and other European powers of the time mentioned as well.  This is a  great book to get to understand what society and indvidual lives were like  prior to the American Revolution.  Overall a very interesting read
