This book is still used and recommended by the Boulder Outdoor Survival School, possibly the most reputable school in the business.  Larry Dean Olsen, the author, is a guru in the field, and quite an amusing writer as well.  This book is a classic, having come out originally in 1967 (my copy is the 30th anniversary edition from 1997).  This is not a book for weekend backpackers, it is a text for those who want to explore and preserve true primitive survival skills - living off the land, friction fires, etc.  If that is what you are looking for, this book is a great choice
