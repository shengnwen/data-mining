My son loves trains and loves the Polar express book. It is the middle of Jan. and we still listen to the CD every time we are riding in our SUV. I had to supervise him with the bell (he is 34 months old) because it was a little small but that was no problem. It is really nice to have the tape and a CD. He listens to the tape in his little Fisher Price tape player!
