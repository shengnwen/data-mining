I found this romance to be fun, fast paced and made me laugh.  The premise is that Laurel has decided after way too many failed romances that she is not going to marry for love and in fact the best idea is for her to "arrange" her own marriage.  This premise is cemented in her brain when her boss gives her a book to review that is about the very same subject. (Point)

Joe is a wealthy self made man of coffee shop fame.  But, he has gone undercover with a coffee cart to research a new shop location.  He is immediately drawn to Laurel.  Joe is definitely a believer of love before marriage. (Counterpoint)

Laurel decided to use her and Joe's opinions for her article (to prove she is right) which throws them together in different situations to see how each opinion will play out.

Fun story that also looks at speed dating in a humorous way.  If you want a light fun romance to read, this is a good one.
