DEA agent Bill Broxton is in the Caribbean investigating the mysterious death of Julie Tanaka's husband, who died on a sailboat full of cocaine. Meanwhile drug smugglers have hidden their white powder on the sailboat Julie lives on with her husband and they try to seize her boat, but she and her daughter sail away in the middle of the night. The smugglers are quickly after her and Broxton is just as quickly after them as they all sail toward a hurricane. This was a quick and exciting read that I enjoyed very much and I think you will too.

Mr. Stewart has nailed what makes a thriller a thriller in my opinion. Women on the run who we care for. Bad guys who we fear and a tough but flawed hero with a likable sidekick. Plus he set his thriller in the Caribbean, a place I've longed to visit. Now I feel as if I've been there, but maybe after reading his book, when I actually do get there, I just might pass on the sailboat stuff. Sounds just a bit to scary for me. Good book, lots of action. You can smell the ocean with this one. Really
