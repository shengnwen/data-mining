Two sisters, Sharla and Ginny, are off to meet a mother they have not seen in thirty-vie years.  The book covers their childhood and a mother, Marion, who left home when the girls were young.

The message in this book is clear - everything in life is not always as it seems.  The girls believe their mother left to be with her friend, Jasmine, and that the two woman were in a gay relationship.  However, as the girls find out after meeting their mother, this is not true and not the reason for Marion's leaving.  Marion did try to continue a relationship with her children after she left home, but the girls refused to see her. Their father remarries and the girls shift their love to a woman who is always there for them as a mother should be.  One can deeply sympathize with the girls and their estranged relationship with their mother, but it is often all too easy to judge someone when you have not walked in their shoes and do not know all the facts.

"What We Keep" is one of Berg's finest books.  It is an easy read but it makes the reader ponder the relationship with their own mother, regardless of whether the relationship is good or bad, and whether she is still with us or has passed on.  Also recommended by Berg is another oldie, "Open House.
