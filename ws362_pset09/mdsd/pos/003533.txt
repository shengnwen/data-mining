I recently bought a Bearded Dragon and bought several books about this lizard. I have to say that this book is one of the best. It is written in a very personal way (unlike many other &quot;take care of your pet books&quot; and I really like that. It is also very informative and has a lot of great images. The book tells you everything you have to know if you are a Bearded Dragon owner or wants to buy one - how to choose a Bearded Dragon, the terrarium, terrarium set up, breeding, the right food etc. I especially found the &quot;food part&quot; informative and with a lot of nice pictures. I highly recommend this book! My BD appreciated it! :-
