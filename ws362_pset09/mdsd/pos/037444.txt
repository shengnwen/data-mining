I like the convenience of slow cooking, but have found most crockpot cookbooks to contain fattening recipes with little information on the nutritional breakdown of the completed dish. This book is full of lower fat recipes that are delicious and provide the information needed for anyone watching their weight or just wanting to eat a healthier diet. I've tried many of the recipes, and my favorite is the Smoked Sausage Chowder: a spicy, hearty soup
