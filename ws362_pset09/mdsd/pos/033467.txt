It's not just for history buffs!!  As a former student and friend  I can honestly recommend this book to anyone.  Terry does an excellent job of conveying lots of feeling and fact about an ever changing time in history.  I'm sure a lot of it comes from previous experience and lots of research of which I can assure you.  This book is enlightening and informative, and filled with Terry's own sense of style
