I am a huge fan of Joanne Harris' work. The first book of hers that I read was "5 quarters of the orange" and I LOVED it. I began reading all of the works that I could, which I enjoyed, but they never stood up to 5 Quarters. In "Sleep, Pale Sister" I have finally been able to find that same immersive book experience. I LOVED IT
