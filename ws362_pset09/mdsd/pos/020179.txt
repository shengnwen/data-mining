No, it really isn't a novel.  I have been somewhat confused about this fact, however.  I listened to the audiotape version of Crichton's The Great Train Robbery and was amazed at what I discovered.  Thank goodness I picked it up (as a last second thought) when preparing for a long 500 mile drive.  Although the tape case said something about this being a novel it simply isn't one -- it is actually a historically accurate recounting of the story based on trial testimony, other case related sources and a wealth of other sources about the time period.  It JUST READS LIKE A NOVEL.  It is exciting from start to finish -- and the finish, no matter how understated, is completely unexpected if you are not familiar with the details of the actual criminal case.  My jaw dropped when I heard the ending!

Even though they are planning a serious crime you can't help but find yourself admiring the talents and tenacity of the criminals.  And to think that the robbery took place on a train moving at 55 miles an hour is mind boggling when you know all that is involved!

If you enjoy books with fascinating historical tidbits about the growth of London, crime, the justice system in the 19th century, the development of railways, or surprising insights into the minds of good and bad men, this book is for you. I heartily suggest you get the audio version.  Prebble (?) did an outstanding job handling the myraid of accents, criminal slang, etc.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book...and I am not too easily pleased
