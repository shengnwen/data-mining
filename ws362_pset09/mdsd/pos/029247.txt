Paul Williams has written another one of those jingoistic books that I've come to know and love. In the 70's and 80's there were similar books about the russian army and how it had bio weapons and sleeper cells and blah blah blah blah blah blah.

Don't get me wrong he builds a great case. The problem with this sort of book is that it builds a hysterical type of case, which is good if you sell survival equipment, but is not all that useful when it comes to predicting the future. 

So read it as a good ghost story, but I think this book is stuck in October 2001.

The fact is, Osama is very patient, and I have no doubt that if and when he gets the chance he will strike. This type of hysterical book ignores so much of the political landscape throughout the world it's just not very useful. 

Osama has lost a lot attention to Iraq. Iran is probably the major leader in the radical Islamic world today. Unlike AL Qaeda, they're not going to be very happy about a nuclear strike in the US, because they may be radical but they're not stupid. If they're seen a collobarating with Al Qaeda after an incident like that, we might spare a few of the 10,000 other nukes we have to warm up their cities.
