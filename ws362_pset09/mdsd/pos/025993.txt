I picked this book for a bookclub with 4th and 5th graders knowing it would be a challenge for them to read and understand.  It turned out to be read the most students and the favorite of the three books choosen for the club that year.  It has a challenging theme and in sections it is hard to understand all that is happening without paying good attention or reading passages twice - but the kids that finished it all agreed it was worth it.
