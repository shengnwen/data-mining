Like others this book caught by attention, and I succumbed and purchased it, intrigued as I was by the description. Needless to say I was not disappointed, as you can see by my rating.  Ms. Bray writes very well, and the prose flows evenly and is excellent at creating the images of what we're reading.  

I feel simply by classifying it as a The Craft meets the Little Princess is over simplifying the story.  It certainly has those elements but they're not uncommon in a Victoria style story.  A time period that England was at the height of their commercial and political power, and where 'new age' sciences of spiritualism and phrenology were embraced by the highest minds.

Each of the characters are distinct and interesting, and our heroine herself is obviously not perfect by her own choices of friends and actions.  

Yes, it does clearly lead to to a second book, as the second clearly leads to a third.  To me this is probably the biggest weakness of the books.  They do stand on their own but they are not at their best that way, and I will agree with another reviewer that the lack of clear villain hurts this book, where it strengthens the second book in the series.

Still I definitely recommend this, and not just for young adult women, but also for anyone that enjoys a good spooky tale, or anything of the Victorian era
