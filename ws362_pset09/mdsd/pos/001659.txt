Once you get over the arrogance of the author's bragging that he "invented" execution (they seem to the think the world's leaders have gone eons without execution) the book is very good.  

Good points and pertinent examples.  You will be very busy reflecting on how you are performing in similar situations.  My industry is nothing like the examples given but the points were just as relevant.
