Jerry Spinelli was one of my favourite authors. I decided to read his biography for school. Now he is still one of my favorite authors only now, when i read one of his books i always think back at what could have made him right that? The book Knots In My Yo-Yo string was written in Jerry Spinneli's style which is why i think i found it so interesting to read. His childhood may bore some people for he found it exciting to get his first t.v but it made me realise how much that we have at this time with all of our technology. Knots In My Yo-Yo string makes you realise a ton of things that we take for granted now a days and it truly is a good book
