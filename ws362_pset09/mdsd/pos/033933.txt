As soon as I bought the book I could not put it down I read it from top to bottom non-stop. This book is an easy read and very applicable. I highly recommend this book to gain greater insights in the Music business or any business. It was a great buy along with a couple of manuals purchased from Musicbrains.net entitled the Indie label Kit on  Amazon, Music business 101, future of music and Guide to releasing an independent record by Tim Sweeney
