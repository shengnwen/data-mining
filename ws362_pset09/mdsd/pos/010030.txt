Having recently been diagnosed with MS, this book was very informative.   Everything from symptoms, family situations, insurance information,to  emotional and physical issues, finances, and life planning information.  I  really recommend this book to anyone diagnosed, or anyone having a family  member of friend diagnosed, with MS
