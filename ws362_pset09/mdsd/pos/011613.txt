A storyteller who can grab your attention and keep it is "doing his job", I guess.  Grishham is one of my favorite pop-lit writers and who only disappoints occasionally, never completely.  This is one of those times and the only time, I think, that I've caught a whiff of his boredom.  In The Broker, he seems to rush, or telescope the plot, leaving out detail in the continuity so that the denouement arrives all the quicker.  I dunno, maybe it's just me.  

Anyway, it's a satisfying read for all Grisham fans.  I'm looking forward to reading his new non-fiction book.  (Maybe it's the reason he rushed to complete this one!)
