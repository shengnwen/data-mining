This book was a delight to read.  The author went to lengths to make the reader feel at home about the subject matter at hand - language.  He uses humor in places that bring his point home and he writes in such as way as to not scare off non-linguists.  I was impressed with the plethora of information contained in so compact a book.  I feel I travelled the word of language as I was reading.  The only negative about the book are the countless actual examples of languages, paired together to show differences.  I for one don't read more than 3 languages and found all the examples distracting; however, after a while, I simply skipped over them.  The examples weren't missed though as the author makes his point without them.  Overall, this book was insightful and interesting and a nice starting place for me
