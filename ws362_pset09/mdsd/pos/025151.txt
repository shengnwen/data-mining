Kissing Kate
	Kissing Kate was a book about a girl who fell in love with her best friend and they kissed one night. Later on in the book they got into a fight and stopped being friends, when they would talk it were more like arguing. This girl could not just get over her friend, she really liked her.
	I believe that society can relate to this. Because I know a lot of girls experiment with girls to experiment and that's what happened with them. It just happened that one of the girls liked the other. 
	I would recommend this book to a lot of people because it shows you a different view on everything. After reading this I didn't care if someone was lesbian or gay it changed my whole perspective and I realized that if they love someone than go for it, you know? I think I grasped a lot of why people experiment through this book also.
