Have you ever wondered if you and your friend could be more than just friends?  Jason Herkimer and Marceline McAllister have only been friends for almost two years and their relationship is just starting.  This relationship is filled with humor and heartbreak up against hormones.  They only good thing that seems to be coming out of this new relationship is that Marceline and Jason know when to tell each other off.  
In this sequel to Space Station Seventh Grade, Jason and Marceline begin to get to know themselves a lot more together.  Jason's sexual feelings have awakened but Marceline is always self-concerned and most concerned with doing what she feels right.  But somehow they begin to feel an attraction towards one another but the pressure Jason puts on Marceline to be more sexual in their relationship brings them apart.  Will this love-hate relationship last?
I found this book very interesting yet very funny and outrageous because of the descriptions Jerry Spinelli uses to tell the little or big arguments that Jason and Marceline have.  This book could probably be read from the ages of 12-15.  I think most junior high students would be able to relate themselves to the same things Jason and Marceline go through such as peer pressure.  Each chapter you read through brings about a new conflict for Jason and Marceline and you can see from Jason's point of view, how they come about.  You get to experience the challenges, humor, and heartbreak of first love.
