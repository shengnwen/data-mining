This is the only kids encyclopedia I own and we love it. I got it as a unit study for the summer for my 6.5 yo dd who is going into 2nd grade. It is perfect for her. She asks so many questions they days and this really gets and keeps her interested for hours!!! It has lots of wonderful pictures and diagrams and even a few ideas to try as well! IMHO it is a great buy!
