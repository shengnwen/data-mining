"The Art of Eating" recountss the tale from post World War I to World War II  France in gastronomic terms.   This is a collection of several books. "Serve It Forth," first published in 1937, is a history of gastronomy.  In "Consider the Oyster" written in 1941, Fisher finds her voice.  "How to Cook a Wolf" published in 1942, when wartime shortages were at their worst includes recipes for stretching the smallest of ingredients to meet nutritional needs and the needs of the spirit.  "The Gastronomical Me" is this reader's favorite, which recounts Fischer's life in France.   If you have any interest in good food, well-written memoirs or French culture, you really must read this book.  It defines the word "classic."
