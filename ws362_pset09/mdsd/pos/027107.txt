My father, a PhD, bought this book for me at the beginning of my freshman year as a Biology major.  I used that book all through college in my science classes, and in my writing classes.  I have been a Biology teacher for 17 years, and my original book has fallen apart from use.  I still keep it, as I treasure this gift from my father.  I have a second copy and use it with my students frequently.  I am considering buying a third copy, as I know that soon it will be difficult to find another.  It is a 'must have' for all science majors as well as science teachers
