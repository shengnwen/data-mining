This manual is good for those unfamiliar with aircooled VWs.  Written and illustrated with humor, this manual makes entertaining reading and can help VW fans decide how commited they are to being responsible for the repair and maintenance of the vehicle.  This book covers many subjects which are not ordinarily discussed in automotive shop manuals.   If you are an experienced mechanic, then buy a Robert Bentley manual and skip this one.
