The novel Gregor the Overlander is about an eleven year old boy who chases his two old sister down a hole in their apartment's laundry room. They end up in a place called the Underland. In the Underland Gregor is treated as a guest , but Gregor thinks Boots and himself are prisoners. After he attempts to escape and fails he learns to trust the Undereland. In the Underland they call people like Gregor and Boots, Overlanders. Gregor meets lots of new friends in the Underland. When he is called an Overlander warrior, Gregor must complete the Prophecy Of Gray
	I think Suzanne Collins, the author, felt that you should never give up hope and confidence. Gregor never gave up hope that his dad would come back home, but sometimes tried to forget his dad. I also think she was trying to say that you can trust someone even if the rest of their kind you can't.
	Personally,I loved this novel. I enjoyed this book because it had SPECTACULAR detail. As I read this book there was a little movie playing in my mind from page to page. The book also had a good suspense. It was a book I could follow. I recommend this novel to everyone
