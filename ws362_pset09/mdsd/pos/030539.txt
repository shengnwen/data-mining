This book is another example of Stephen Arroyo's expertise &amp; is presented in lecture style, paying some very valuable at- tention to transits as life processes. He &amp; I differ completely on the issue of &quot;reincarnation&quot;, believing in heredity &amp; our own past behaviors as &quot;karma&quot; myself, but the insights in this  book are designed to help the Astrologer/student learn to form  their own insights...to actually Think when interpreting a chart! Invaluable aid as it is, I recommend it highly to those wishing  to understand more about synthesis in their interpretations... chart comparisons may be especially useful also. A &quot;relaxed&quot; attitude about difficult transits of the outer planets will put many minds at ease concerning these difficult times we all must face, &amp; this section alone may be worth the price of this book
