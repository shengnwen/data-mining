When first reading this book, I immediately found myself wondering if this simple, straight-forward approach could really work? ...it sure did!! I live with a neuromuscular disease and this is the only addition I made to my wellness routine and worked with it for a year...with phenomenal results! I have sensation back, I'm walking, I just feel better in-touch with my body, better able to work "with" it. I finally decided to learn more about this and "how" it works so I can be the best functional soma (for myself) and help others to achieve this also. Very fulfilling movement - easy to do and very gentle with, I'll repeat myself, phenomenal results! GET THIS BOOK and contact a Hanna Somatic Educator in your area to get the most bang for your buck! Easy to access online to find someone near you.
