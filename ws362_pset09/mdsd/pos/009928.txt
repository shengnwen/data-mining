Superb!

The other reviews handle the content well, but i re-read this book twice after purchasing it when it was new, and what a thriller! For non-fiction, it reads like fiction, the tension is heightened when it dawns on one that this is factual history. The incredible sacrifices, the near-catastrophies, the cat and mouse, the espionage, all were insights into the cold war's tense competitive chess match.

Lying on the sea bed, tapping communication lines, sneaking into harbors, its all there. This book is a vital read for anyone remotely interested in espionage, submarine warfare and the Cold War. Bravo to the authors for thorough research and superb storytelling
