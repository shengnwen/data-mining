This book was a really entertaining read that kept me very interested in both the plot and the characters themselves the whole way through. The character development is the novel is superb, so much so that you actually care what happens to the characters, whether their main protaganist or background antaganist or any combination of the two. 

If Butler description of the what the world will be like in the near future is accurate, then we're all pretty much screwed, but until  the world gets this way, this is a really good on many different levels
