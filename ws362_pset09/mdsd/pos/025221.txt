This book is a remarkable survey of a very broad field.  It is necessarily somewhat superficial in its coverage of some of the more abstruse topics, but provides the necessary essentials an engineer needs to operate in the cable television environment.  Unlike mere compendia of archival publications, this book has a consistent pedagogical viewpoint and notation.  It is oriented towards practicing engineers, providing just enough theory to support successful problem solving.  I recommend it to anyone working in the field
