I imagine writing this book was sort of like being on the NCAA basketball tournament selection committee.  If you are not too familiar with college basketball, sorry about the analogy.  First, you've got the no-brainer choices for the book who are like champions from the big conferences: Black Flag, Sonic Youth, Husker Du.  They got the "automatic bids" if you will.  Then there's the mid-majors who certainly deserve to be here like the Minutemen, Mudhoney, Butthole Surfers, and the Replacements.  Then there's the ones you are not so sure about like Beat Happening.  I don't mean to pick on them really.  I guess I can appreciate Beat Happening, I'm a little baffled by their inclusion into this exclusive indie club.  

Finally, there's the "snubs" or the bands that were left out for whatever reason:

Meat Puppets-I guess having a 3rd SST band would have been too much Greg Ginn worship.
Misfits-Penalized for having 'Walk Among Us' on Ruby Records (distributed by a major) maybe?
Dead Kennedys-The Bay Area punk scene in general was pretty much overlooked by Azerrad.
Pylon-I just figure the legendary Athens GA music scene should have been represented and REM and B52s are way too major for this book.  Anyway, I would have picked Pylon before Beat Happening.

But anyway, it was a great book to read and I always find it amazing when someone takes the time to write a whole book on something like 80s indie music.  I must admit, growing up mostly in Alabama during the 80s, I didn't hear about a lot of these bands until after they were long gone or had gone major.  To hear the stories of their formative years is fun and endearing.  I commend Azerrad for his reverence for the underground movement and for not turning this book into an encyclopedia.
