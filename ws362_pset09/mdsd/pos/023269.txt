My baby, now 8 months old, loves this book as well as "Baby! Talk!" and "Grow! Babies!" (also by same author/photographer). We first found it at our local library when she was about 4 months old, but I finally had to order it when we ran out of renewals. I love that the babies are so engaging, of different ethnicities, and show different moods. I also enjoy the straight-forward text that doesn't rhyme and won't make you feel stupid to read out loud.
