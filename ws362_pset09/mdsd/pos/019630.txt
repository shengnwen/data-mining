How can we say it, other than they did it again.  This is the most  comprehensive book on pasta that I have seen yet to date.  The folks at  Cooking Illustrated are known for their tedious testing of recipes,  ingredients, and everything else imaginable.  This book follows their long  line of other fantastic cookbooks put out by the people at Cooking  Illustrated. The book goes into great dept about making of pasta,  ingredients to use, how to best prepare the pasta, and then has more  recipes than one could ever imagine exsisted on using of the pastas.  This  book is rich in detail and scope of the subject of pasta.  If you are a  pasta lover, you will treasure this book
