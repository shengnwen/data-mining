This book, despite an serious and well-developed plot, had me cracking up. The sarcastic and intelligent humor it is written in, most notably Margaux's voice, is hilarious. Margaux experiences changes and deep hurt, while running a higly entertaining and sophisticated track of commentaries on everything. I really loved this book, and literally read it in one sitting. The entire book is well thought out, and leaves you with the good feeling of having read a witty, self-contained book. I really recommend this to any young adult readers out there
