After you finish reading this book you will come to the same conclusion that I have.  THERE ARE NO COINCEDENCES.  Decade after decade the same people and organizations always seem to "pop" up in major world events.  This is not by chance my friends.  Read your bible.  Don't take Jim Marrs's word as gosple either, research some of this stuff yourself to verify the contents of the book.  Second best book he has written
