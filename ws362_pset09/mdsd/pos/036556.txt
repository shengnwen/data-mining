Written with respect for the dignity and unique culture of the Tarahumara Indians, an indigenous people that live in the Sierra Madre Occidentals (Copper Canyon region). Lots of photographs (both black and white, and  color). Although a paperback, it's quite large (pages are about  9&quot;x11&quot;).  A &quot;must-have&quot; if you are going to visit, or  have visited, Copper Canyon, Mexico
