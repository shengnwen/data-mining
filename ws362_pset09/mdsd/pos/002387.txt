I am an avid bird hunter here in the Northestern US. Through the years I have owned, trained and handled a number of hunting and non-hunting dogs. I also judge hunting dogs, not for show, but for their natural hunting qualities and their ability to take training to become excellent, finished hunting dogs and good citizens around the house. Consequently, I get to see a large number of dogs every year who have been trained using the principles outlined in Joan Bailey's book, and unfortunately, some who have not. There is no question in my mind this is the best book available for anyone who wants to groom a great hunting dog, and a wonderful canine companion. The book is beautifully written, concise, and best of all, it works. I recommend it, and often give it as a gift, to anyone I know who is getting a puppy. Buying this book and following it to the letter is the best thing any dog owner can do for themselves and for their dog
