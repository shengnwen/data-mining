I have read most of Dean Koontz' books, and I think COLD FIRE is one of the better ones.  This is not a instant classic like WATCHERS or ODD THOMAS, but it is certainly very well done.

The first half of the book is mostly action.  Teacher Jim Ironheart is sent by forces unknown to help people who face life-threatening situations.   He does not know why or how he is compelled to do such things, but he believes a "higher power" is guiding him to save these people.  The first half of the book, which is devoted to Ironheart's dramatic rescues, is very exciting and suspenseful to read.

Unfortunately, the second half of COLD FIRE bogs down a bit.  Toward the end of the novel, Koontz provides a rather tortured explanation of how Ironheart acquired these life-saving powers.  This involves a lot of backstory and a rather inventive plot twist that many readers will probably not buy into.

Koontz also devotes a lot of prose to a fast-moving romance between Ironheart and a reporter named Holly Thorne, a remarkably pushy woman who literally camps out on Ironheart's doorstep and jumps into bed with him.  Needless to say, I found this romantic relationship in COLD FIRE to be rather contrived and unrealistic.  I think Koontz also made Holly a little bit too pushy and hard-edged for her own good.  In the end, I  found her character to be more annoying than sympathetic.  

Overall, though, the strengths of COLD FIRE outweigh the weaknesses.  This is one of Koontz' stronger novels, on par with WHISPERS, DRAGON TEARS, and MR. MURDER.
