I couldn't put this book down, it was very interesting and showed some amazing discoveries in the field of obesity research.  We are learning so much about why we overeat but we have yet to conquer 'FAT'.  The author of this book explores the 'lighter' side of being heavy.  It is beautifully written and reads more like a work of science fiction than non-fiction.  Not a boring page in the whole book.  Laymen will especially appreciate some of the intriguing studies on 'fat rats' and 'skinny rats'.  Well worth the investment, especially if interested in losing weight
