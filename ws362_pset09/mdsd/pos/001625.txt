I'll be honest: when I bought this book, I was suspicious already. The promise of the book was too kitschy, too close to those "write a novel in 10 days" things. Well, I bought it nevertheless, and read it all. And although it did not deliver the magic formula that ir promised, it did deliver a structured plan to put the ideas in order and to achieve some balance in any long story. The dullness or keenness of your story will depend on things that are actually not in the Marshall Plan, but if you follow the plan at least you can monitor the balance and be sure you don't get too dispersed. Nowadays, I don't follow the Marshall Plan, but I do follow a plan. For me, the best thing in the book was to teach me that you can have a plan, and how you can create your own plan. And here, it was helpful.
One comment on context: it seems to me (although I think it's never explicitly said) that Mr. Marshall follows Jack Bickham ("Writing and Selling your Novel", "Scene and Structure"), who follows Dwight Swain ("Techniques for the Selling Writer"). To take more profit from the Marshall Plan, I suggest reading Swain first, who's the mastermind of the M-R stimulus and Scene/Sequel structuring, and it's incredibly clear and crisp. Then read Bickham, who adds some more insights and is clear in a very different way ("Writing and Selling..." is enough; "Scene and Structure" is a rehash). Then read Marshall, and you'll see where is he coming from, for he's not as fathomable as Swain.
One more thing: apart from the Plan, Mr. Marshall gives some tips on writing in general. These are very few, but good. I was really surprised.
