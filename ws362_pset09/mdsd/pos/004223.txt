All the threads of the first two novels about Terry Orr come together here in a (more or less) satisfying resolution, which means you definitely do *not* want to read this book first. It's really almost a single long novel, and you'll have to start at the beginning. It all starts with the death (natural) of one of the major supporting characters, with the informal will the deceased leaves behind, and the back story of his exile in New York from south Louisiana. Terry has to see to it that his late friend's wishes (on behalf of another close friend) are fulfilled, which involves a couple of trips to New Orleans. Now, Fusilli's work is noteworthy for the sense of place he gives to New York City -- a place I have never lived -- but I have to say he also does pretty well by New Orleans and Thibodaux -- a part of the world I know very well. The details and place names he drops are accurate and well directed. (Though I also have to say he perhaps makes more of the local humidity than necessary. On the other hand, I'm originally from south Texas, which may be even soggier than the bayous. . . .) But the real plot interest for fans of the series is Terry's discovery that everything he thought he knew about his late wife, about the nature of his marriage, and about the schizophrenic whom he believes killed his wife and son -- all of it is fundamentally incorrect. And other people who sympathize with him knew it all along. Five years of his life wasted. Five years when he should have concentrated much more on his adolescent daughter. The resolution of his conflict with The Madman is cinematic in its "rightness," and it wraps up the trilogy rather nicely. But, perhaps unfortunately, there's now a fourth novel out about Terry Orr; having resolved the tensions in Terry Orr's life, what is the author going to do with him now? I'll keep my fingers crossed
