I have always admired Mother Teresa, but I didn't know much about her other than her being a nun who worked with the poor in India. As I grew in my faith, I wanted to learn more about her, so I found this book.

It is very well written and inspiring. Each chapter has a theme. It starts with two quotes: One from a saint or from Mother Teresa, and the other from the Bible. She then reflects on the topic - e.g. Prayer, On Being Holy, Poverty, Love, Jesus, etc. I felt that her combination of conversational prose, poems and prayers, anecdotes, and scripture was in perfect proportion for understanding her wisdom. For example, I felt she used Scripture perfectly to emphasize a point without it feeling like verses were just being "thrown around" just to use them. Similarly, she gives wonderful anecdotes from her experience with working with the poor which demonstrate her love and provide us with an example of how we can grow closer to God. Each chapter is about 6-7 pages long and the text is not too dense. I found each chapter perfect for reading in 10 minutes then reflecting and praying afterwards.

This book is highly recommended to anyone looking to learn more about Christianity and Mother Teresa specifically. She will inspire you to live a holier and loving life
