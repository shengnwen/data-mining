This book is the absolutely BEST book I've seen on betta fishkeeping. It goes the extra mile that other books don't go. I especially liked the part about breeding bettas - I plan on breeding my quality pair soon, and that was a great help. If I ever have a problem with my betta, I'm sure I will have no problem finding out what the cause and solution is in this book. This book makes the other ones look nothing like books
