In the fine tradition of annotated editions comes this vast collection of all the Sherlock Holmes short stories with detailed notes for every one. Devoted Sherlockians will want to own this handsome two-volume set, with its completist tables of the chronologies of Holmes' cases among other treats. Some footnotes are quite helpful, where the shed light on hansom cabs and other conventions of the late 1800s which modern readers might not be familiar with. Others are rather pointless, as when the editor throws in long asides about matters of pure speculation by Holmes nutcases, views apparently compiled from years of reading insular Holmesian journals. While giving endless print space to absurd theories about subtexts and Holmes' secret love life and whatnot, the editor sometimes ignores more obvious questions, such as whether anyone ever thought it plausible that a snake could be trained with milk to obey commands in "the Speckled Band," and if this was indeed a common belief at one time, why was it? So, not perfect, but a recommended set all the same
