In response to 	Geoff Puterbaugh and anyone else that doesnt know the difference between Persian Mithraism and Zoroastrianism.
It looks like you are wondering if there is any relationship between this Roman cult and Iranian Zoroastrianism.
I'm not a scholar but you may want to know that Mithraism and Zoroastrianism are not the same religion! And if you don't find many things in common between Roman Mithraism and Zoroastrianism that's why.
There are certain similarities but a world of difference.
And Mithraism in Old Persia is way older than Rome.
It's another struggle by church to separate itself from old Persian religions. At least Roman Pagan is better than Persian mysticism
