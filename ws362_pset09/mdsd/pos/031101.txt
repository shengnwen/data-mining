From what I have read so far it is very interesting. The history of how symmetry has become so important in various branches of mathematics has been quite eye opening. There are a number of small errors which did puzzle me at first. For example, the number of axes of rotational symmetry for a cube is 24, but not because there are 6 faces that can be each rotated 4 time as described by the author.
Also, for myself, I would have liked a little more theory and explanation of various Hypotheses: this may come later in the book.
Apart from these small gaps I would recommend this book to anyone interested the place mathematics has in the universe
