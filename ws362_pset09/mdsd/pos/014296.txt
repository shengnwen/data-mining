A thoroughly decent and ethical man is influenced by but not swallowed up by the ubiquitous soft corruption in his hometown. Throughout, a novel about bedrock morals and the test that modern times gives them. A much slighter, smaller story than "East of Eden" or "The Grapes of Wrath," this later novel probes some of the finer intellectual notions the others do not.
