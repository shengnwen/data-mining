	What would you do if you were trapped on an island stuck with prehistoric dinosaurs that are ready to tear you to shreds? A group of scientists are stuck on an island are about to be torn to shreds. Ian Malcom and his three partners have gone to an island called Isla Sorna believing there are dinosaurs that are still on the island since the prehistoric time. When they get to the island they figure out that the dinosaurs are not from the prehistoric time but from a cloning company called Ingen that cloned dinosaurs in Crichton's previous novel.
	Lost World is a grabbing novel and will keep you reading for hours on end. Crichton gives great descriptions of characters, places, and objects that will keep guessing if he was really on the island. It makes you feel like you are a part of the story on the island or off. Crichton has made novels that continue this novel and start this novel. Jurassic park was Crichton's novel before this and Jurassic park III is the novel that continues this novel.
	Lost World is exciting, adventurous, grabbing, and will always be a great novel. I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes adventures and anyone who likes to feel like you're in the story. Lost World is the best novel I have read and will be for quite a while.
