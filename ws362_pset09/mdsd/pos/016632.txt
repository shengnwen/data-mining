            The title of this book is Missing May. This book takes place in West Virginia in the mountains. The characters live in a trailer. The main characters are May, Ob, Cleatus, and Summer. In this story Summer's parents die. 
Summer gets passed from aunt to aunt. Then finally Ob and May took her. Then May died in her garden.
            Ob and Summer had a hard time dealing with May's death. 
summer thought that Ob would die too. Summer's friend Cleatus had came to live with Ob and Summer. I would give this book four out of five stars because it was a little bit confusing but evrything else it was great. I recommend people who like hard but also kinda easy books to read Missing May.
