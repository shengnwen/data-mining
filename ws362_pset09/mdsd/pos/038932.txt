This the one book that taught me more about how to use my SLR than the camera's manual itself. The step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography. I also liked the way Mr. Frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter. One take without the filter and then the same one with a filter.  Also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field.  An encompassing book, the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment.  The peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown. A good buy and money well spent. My only gripe is that I preffered the smaller size of the previous edition as it fit easily in my kit bag
