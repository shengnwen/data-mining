I enjoyed reading about the different families represented. One of the best aspects of the book is the inclusion of each family's recommended reference books, as well as their favorite and least-favorite advice they'd received.  Regarding the reference books:  Whenever I felt a connection with one of the families I'd then look to see if I'd read their book recommendations.  It was a great way to explore where each family was going with their thoughts.  I agree with one of the other reviewers, though, in that there is sort of a detached approach to each family's chapter.  Some families I found interesting and a few I did not.  But rather than the dry, Here They Are presentation, I would have liked to have been taken further into the families' emotional attachments...how they arrived at the decisions emotionally.  One does not buck such a strong system on a whim.  Overall, though, a very good read.  For anyone considering homeschooling, or for newbies looking for other ideas, this is a very good reference book.  I'll be keeping this one
