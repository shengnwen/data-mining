What would it be like to live in a city surrounded by darkness? In The City of Ember by Jeane DuPrau, Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow live in a city of perpetual night. The only light comes from huge floodlights that are mounted above the city. However, the lights are beginning to flicker, leaving the citizens in terrifying blackouts, and supplies are starting to dwindle. Both Lina and Doon are concerned with the state of their dying city. Then Lina discovers an old document titled "Instructions" which she believes will lead to a city of light of which she has dreamed. Together, she and Doon race against time to decipher the ambiguous message to unlock the secrets of Ember. In the end, they defy the beliefs that their city has instilled in them to discover the way out of Ember and save the city.

I thought this was an intriguing science fiction novel that showed how courage can conquer our fear of the unknown. I liked how Lina and Doon never ceased to try despite struggles of corruption and loss. This book had a great ending, leaving the audience with a cliffhanger for the next installment, The People of Sparks, and finally The Prophet of Yonwood. I would recommend this book to children twelve and up because it is filled with excitement and suspense, yet at times it can be difficult to understand. This adventuresome story will keep the reader engaged from start to finish.
