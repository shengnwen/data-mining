Everything you always wanted to know about the films of Alfred Hitchcock, but were afraid to ask; this book is a must.  Hitchcock biographer Donald Spoto (The Dark Side of Genius) reviews everyone of this film giants movies, from his silent films made and produced in his native England, to his final feature released in 1976.  Filled with great insight and behind-the-scenes details, this is a wonderful read.  Classic films get major treatment as you might expect, but so-called minor Hitchcock movies like Stage Fright, I Confess, and Marnie are thoroughly covered as well.  This book just goes to prove that minor Hitchcock is better than most other directors' best work.  Filled with wonderful movie stills,  this book also features some interesting on-set photos, as well as personal family portraits of Hitchcock at various stages of his life.  No other film director is so much a part of American popular culture.  It's hard to imagine what American cinema would be like without him.  A great reference for movie buffs, I've read and reread this book many, many times and gained new insight with each reading
