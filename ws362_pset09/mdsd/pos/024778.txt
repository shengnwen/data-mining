This book has been described as Kissinger-light by some people I know.  What that means is it doesn't get bogged down on every detail.  Instead, it is a very readable book that people with only a modicum of international knowledge can still enjoy.  It basically is a summary of U.S. foreign policy since it was forged as a nation.  

Kissinger outlines each region of the world and then analyzes them with a uniquely discerning mind.  The thrust of this book is how America went from its cold-war strategy in world affairs up until the summer before 9/11.  Kissinger analyzes Clinton's attempts to develop a new policy and then shows how Clinton fumbled and floundered in every attempt outside our shores.

The best thing about this book and the reason it will be a classic for history students is its timing.  The book ends just before 9/11 happened.  I can not think of a better person than the foremost expert in world affairs to write a compendium just prior to such a watershed mark in world history.  

This book will serve as the best tool of knowing just what was going on in the world and where things were heading prior to that fateful day that changed everyone's idea of what was happening in the world.

With the exception of a few fanatics that think they are still living in the sixties, Everyone knows that Kissinger is a brilliant man that is not easily matched on the world level.  Kissinger's ability as Secretary of State was unprecedented in the 20th century and will not easily be surpassed in the 21st.  His ability to analyze the minutia of details and events throughout the globe is awesome.  The fact is when Kissinger speaks everyone with an interest in foreign affairs takes it serious and does not balk at what he has to say.  There is no one else on the scene today that commands that kind of respect.
