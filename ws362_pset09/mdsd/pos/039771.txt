Notes on Graphic Design and Visual Communication is the most essential graphic design book written.  Despite being very thin in quantity of pages, this book holds an enormous amount of graphic knowledge.   I am currently studying Industrial Design and was refered to this book by a professor to help me with my graphic design knowledge.  It opened the world of graphics up to me in an easy to read, fun package. The only complaint I`ve heard of this book is the font used for text.  This book has a hand written font which can sometimes be hard to read.  I have had no problems with the font however
