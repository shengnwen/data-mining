This was a reread for me.  I am usually not a fan of anthologies...  They always seem so rushed to me.
I am not going to summarize each story as I'd give most of the story away.
This book contains 6 stories by 6 different authors.  Each story averages about 50 pages, give or take.  I think it's very good.  Each story is unique and different.  And I didn't feel like any of them were rushed.  I think this book is nicely written and each story is beleivable, despite it's 50 pages.  All of the "couples" were either long time crushes finally coming together, or coming together again.  I liked that part, it helped make the stories seem more real.
My 2 favorite stories were by Lori Foster and Erin McCarthy.
This is a quick, fun read.  Be sure to check your book shelves though before buying it, it was originally released in 2005, same title, purple cover
