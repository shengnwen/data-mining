The length (my version is 1500 pages!) did scare me at first but it far surpassed my hopes in bringing my state to life - I felt as if it were my personal history and made me proud to be a Texan, born and raised.  It was informative and educational without being dull or preachy, and made me genuinely interested in the characters - both the historical and the fictional ones.  Also made me a bit homesick.... all in all incredibly entertaining!!
