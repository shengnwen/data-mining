I've never been much of a reader, this was the second book that I picked up to read.  This was the first book of Sandra Browns that I've had the honor to read.  I usually pick up a book and if it does not grip me from the beginning I will not finish it.  I read this book back a few months ago and it is still fresh in my mind.  So I would have to say that it is a great book
