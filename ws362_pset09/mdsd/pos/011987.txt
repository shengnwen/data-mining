I am approximately 1/3 complete with this book, and it is well written and thorough.  Very conversational in style, not a dry, textbook approach.  The author almosts seems like he is speaking directly with you in the same room, you can feel a sense of compassion and understanding in his presentation.  Very good at covering all aspects of helping to clarify your career focus.  Works well to help the reader identify personal traits first, then gradually get into a realistic goal and method for pursuing a better or the right career
