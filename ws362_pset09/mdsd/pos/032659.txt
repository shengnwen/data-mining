Any book recommended by my oldest daughter is one I will read, so I not only bought Miller's book as soon as I received my daughter's e-mail, I read it completely the first night. Miller is talented and competent. This book is exceptionally important, and reminds me of errors I made with my own children, but it makes the serious mistake of employing an extremist single-think, no-exceptions presentation. Miller's constant use of "all," "no exceptions," "never," "absolutely none," etc., is a major flaw in thinking, and very unscientific. Obviously, since she hasn't seen all cases, she can't classify all cases. Her writing thus takes on a tone of fanaticism and pseudo-religious faith in her "one true principle" -- her "sole explanation" for all instances -- allowing for no exception. 

In addition to the one principle she expounds so well, any psychologist can easily think of other principles, causes and conditions that her single-minded hypothesis ignores. 

In sum, though Miller states her single-think point exceptionally well, she ignores or sweeps too much else under the rug
