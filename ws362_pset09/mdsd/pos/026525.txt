I think Andrew Bostom's review should have convinced you to read this book, and you should also read Dr. Bostom's The Legacy of Jihad, an in-depth, well-researched, scholarly tome, my favorite book on the subject.

Bat Ye'or is a formidable historian, and her book describes in detail what is basically hell on earth---the painful consequences of letting Muslims subjugate one's culture by foolishly ignoring ALL manifestations of jihad, which include not only armed warfare, but also demographic warfare (Muslims multiplying faster than infidels) and Da'wa (deceiving and confusing infidels by claiming that Islam is a religion of peace, etc.).

Don't fall victim to Muslim Da'wa---be an informed infidel.  Read this book, as well as

Eurabia
The Legacy of Jihad
The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam
Why I Am Not Muslim

The alternative to successfully resisting Islam is not pleasant (to put it mildly), as you will learn from reading this excellent book.
