I bought this book on the recommendation of a few who are malcontent with the evangelical life.  I thought it was definitely a good laugh, but if you are evangelical, be prepared to laugh at yourself and not get offended!  Though mostly accurate, there were some definite dated things...such as I doubt many evangelical teen girls have Michael W. Smith posters on their walls anymore...a whole new slew of Christian music talent has overthrown the exclusivity of one act.  Otherwise, it's a quick easy read
