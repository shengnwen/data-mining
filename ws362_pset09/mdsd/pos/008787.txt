I guess it's high praise for Mr. Iles that he managed to get me screaming at our heroine at all her dumb exploits that had the potential to harm or kill her unborn child:  free-diving, drinking, Valium, baths in scalding water.

This was a thoroughly gripping book that at 764 pages long, I was sad to see come to an end.  Greg Iles doesn't shy from the sensitive subject of pedophilia and tackles it with unflinching honesty.  

There is no way to guess the NOMURS "bad guy" in this book til the very end (I don't care what the Australian said who apparently solved the mystery in the first chapter) but I'm disappointed that the author did not interweave the Natchez and New Orleans crimes better. 

It does get repetitive like some said, but I still highly recommend this book if you're looking for a taut, atmospheric suspense mystery.  Very well-written and fresh
