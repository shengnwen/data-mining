It is impossible to hate this one. The main character has the same appeal that say, Rodney Dangerfield, the 3 Stooges or Napolean Dynamite may have. 

Written 1st hand by a 19-year old loser, stranded on an island with his girlfriend who hates him, her hot mother and sisters and their spouses. The men start getting whacked, and then it is up to our dorky hero to protect his babes. 

While propostourous, it is still a fun read and plausable if you let it be. If you're looking for a fun, quick read, nearly impossible to put down, then check this doozy out
