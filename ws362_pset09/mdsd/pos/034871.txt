This text is definitely for advanced math students. On the exciting scale, this text would rank with most others. The text is written fairly competently and is easy to follow given a introductory background in math (Calc I & II). I've found much of the material interesting (for it being math) and have actually enjoyed doing the reading assignment for my class (Introduction to Differential Equations)
