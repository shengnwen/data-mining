Never mind the Kirkus review.  The dog facts weren't boring and I'm a cat lover who merely likes dogs.  I liked the analogies that the author used in order to help those of us who aren't dog fanatics to understand the  feelings of those who are.  I chuckled and cringed over Holly's reunion  with the man who had captured her heart when she was but a girl (and mother  was right).  Actually, I did a lot of chuckling and cringing during this  book.  It's a pity that no one thought to enter an unedited version of the  final judging video to one of those amateur video shows because it probably  would have won a prize. (Heaven knows that the donated lamp probably would  have made a worthy entry in the Ugliest Lamp contest.)  The bride's father  probably would have envied the lucky dad in book/film version(s) of  &quot;Father of the Bride.&quot;  I'm suprised the poor man didn't have a  heart attack before it was all over.  (Got a good chuckle out of Holly's  unspoken appraisal of the groom, not to mention her opinion of a woman who  would marry a man who's allergic to dogs.)  I would have been more upset  about the nasty way two fat characters were depicted if I hadn't already  known from the author's e-mail response to my complaint to her publisher  [over *Bloodlines* and *Black Ribbon*] that she was horrified when a friend  pointed that out to her, apologizes, and hopes that her three latest books  are not offensive. I stayed up until 11:30 to finish this book.  I could  have been in bed an hour earlier if I hadn't kept looking up at the TV to  see if Scully and Mulder were doing anything exciting for the  &quot;X-Files&quot; 2000 season finale.  That was a mistake
