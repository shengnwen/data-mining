This compendium of quotes is divided into 20 chapters (some more vaguely defined than others), each with a short introduction, including:

The Pleasures of Reading
The Pleasures of Buying and Owning Books
Bibliomania
How to Read
Lending and Borrowing Books
What Books Can -- and Cannot -- Teach Us
Collector and Collecting
The Book Trade

Authors and Their Readers

Quotes range in length from one sentence to paragraphs, and are by authors and readers, most pro some con.  Unfortunately, not all are dated or sourced.  An author index can help you locate musings by particular people.

The font is large and clear, and the book format makes this a pleasure to read.
