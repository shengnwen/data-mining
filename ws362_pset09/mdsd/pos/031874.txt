Rosemary Sutcliff and Alan Lee do such a good job in this book. Sutcliff tells the story so that it is real to kids and actually tells the story for what it is. Lee does the most awesome drawings,    I was so happy when they came out with the sequal, The Wanderings of Odysseus. This is truly a masterpiece
