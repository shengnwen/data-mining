I had always thought somthing like this since I was a kid. I also always wondered if there was more of a history book, instead of the fairy tails told in the new testament. If you would like to read more of a historical point on these times, this is the book for you. Especially on the chapter of if jesus was married, the parts about the historical facts should have rocked christian beliefs. For a best seller I am surprised it didn't. Yes there is a lot of supposition, but the parts that talk about historical facts, are astounding.
