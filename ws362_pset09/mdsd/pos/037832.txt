First, skip over the silly introductory analogy of a little kid playing with marbles or whatever.  But then it gets good.  Aside from introducing an equation (p.28) including the variable S without even defining, let alone explaining, it, the 1st and 2nd law are explained very lucidly and with much care (I am a graduate electrical engineer with a full-semester thermodynamics course under my belt who's forgotten most of the subject).  Entropy is very well dealt with.  The last part of the book deals with thermodynamics vs statistical mechanics & there it gets pretty rough.  I didn't try to assimilate too much of that part, not being as intetersted, but it's rigorous and doubtlessly also a fine exposition.

This book is certainly worth the small price and a chunk of your time
