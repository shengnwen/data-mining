I had heard about this book for years before I read it.  What held me back was the title---I pictured this being a book about not just mothers who think, but mothers who think MORE THAN REGULAR MOTHERS---you know the kind of book.  One with essays by mothers who think they are more devoted, more in tune, more able to work and care for their kids at one time..etc.  That wasn't what this was at all.  It is a collection of extremely well done essays about all aspects of parenting.  In my opinion, the best here is On Not Having a Daughter, by Jayne Anne Phillips---about a child not born--I'll remember this writing always.  You'll Get Used to It is another great one, about the tough seperation from your child and how you someday do miss how hard it is for them to leave!  The Line is White and It is Narrow tells of a boy on the autistic spectrum with a love for soccer, and how his mother helps him make his dreams come true.  I could go on and on...lots of terrific writing here.  The weakest pieces in my opinion are the few short humor pieces about everything going wrong during childbirth---they are a little too slapstick for me, but they aren't that bad!  Highly recommended collection about a topic that doesn't really get that much good writing---the thoughts and ideas of mothering
