Patrick O'Brian wrote the most beautiful prose in English literature. On top of that, he was a master story teller.
The story of Pugh and Bronwen is deeply moving. It stays with you. The development of the plot is brillant. O'Brian makes perfect use of the technique of having different people tell the "same" story. He is also a master at omission, not spelling certain things out, but requiring you to intrapolate. He was also a great landscape artist: his mountains are as real as his oceans.
I have not liked many books better.
So why am I still complaining?
The book suffers from the same flaw as Susanna Moore's "In the Cut": who is Bronwen talking to, when she tells her part of the story? Who interviews her? When does this happen? Or has a perfectly realistic story, though not a "naturalistic" one, turned into a ghost story behind my back? Nothing against ghost stories, by the way...
