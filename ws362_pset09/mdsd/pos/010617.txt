"Roadside America: 30 Postcards" is a set of thirty postcards, all featuring different scenes, which come in a sturdy gift box. The cards themselves are on heavy stock, and are printed with exceptionally vivid colors. The scenes vary, but are all of rustic roadside sights and attractions (boxcars and bowling alleys are well represented). The photos are all very well composed and will please anyone interested in aging roadside attractions.

My favorite cards in the collection are "Bowling Pin" (Missouri,1991, which is also featured on the cover of the box), "Terrible" (Banning, California, 1991), "Bowling No. 21" (Wyoming, 1993), and "Trailer No. 13" (Bombay Beach, California, 1993). 

This is an interesting, oddly homogenous, set of postcards and I recommend it for any lover of Americana
