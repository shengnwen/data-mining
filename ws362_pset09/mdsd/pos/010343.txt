This is a reveling look into an almost invisible aspect of black society that has been around for ages, and I for one am impressed.  True, there is some unpleasantness in this book regarding the harsh reality of black on black prejudice.  But this occurs at all levels of black society and society in general.  

What must not be overlooked is the desire and ability achieve and to escape, if at all possible the scars and brutality of being black in a white, racist society.  This is especially true when it comes to ones children, namely the children of successful black Americans who desperately want and need to shield them, not only from the ravages of racism, to which young children are especially sensitive and can be seriously marked and marred, but also from the numerous pathologies that are rampant in the black community and are destroying black children by the millions.  The children of the black upper classes are not only taught that they can be somebody, but that they must be somebody and that failure is not an option.  Thankfully, they can afford not to allow their children's lives to be sabotaged before they reach puberty and have, or did, construct a community in which they could develop into individuals not as adversely affected by entrenched racism and prejudice
