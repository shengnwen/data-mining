The Storm introduces us to a new book series by Cynthis Rylant, one of my favorite children's authors.  We are introduced to Seabold, a seafaring loner (and a dog), the cat Pandora, a lonely keeper of the lighthouse, and three mouse orphans.  The text is melodic and never overwrought.  The story is sweet, and though filled with virtue it is not moralistic.  By the end of the book my son and I wanted to live with the lighthouse family, and share in their new life together.  A sweet book, that I read to him, but equally appropriate for a mid-level independent reader.  I would think the age group anywhere from 5-10 depending on who is doing the reading, an adult or the child herself
