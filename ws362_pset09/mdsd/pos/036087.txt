This is a good Garfield read, and the cartooning is great. But, the only problemm is, the jokes ain't that funny, and I do have to agree with... emergency chick 67(???) that the jokes are running a bit dry. The only &quot;laughs&quot; I got were a few chuckles, and the series is running a bit low on funniness. All in all, I'll give this book four stars, but I'm a bit anxious about the strips in the next book, Older and Wider..
