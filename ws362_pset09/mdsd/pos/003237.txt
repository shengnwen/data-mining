Judith Sills' astonishing EXCESS BAGGAGE will make you think the author has been spying on you.  In describing the five major personality types, she provides such a wealth of detail that you'll find yourself gasping or whooping as you recognize yourself, your family members, friends and colleagues.  

Best of all, she provides real, concrete ways to "get out of your own way" and modify your behavior in a variety of situations.  The lessons can be difficult (isn't change always hard?), but are well worth applying if you're interested in making fundamental changes.  

HIGHLY recommended for anyone interested in learning more about themselves and others.  The advice Sills offers comes from years of counseling experience, and is provided in a nonsensical, easily understood way that maximizes your chances of putting these lessons to work in your own life
