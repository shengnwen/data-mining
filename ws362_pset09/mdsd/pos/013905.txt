This book is beautifully written and tells a fascinating story, not only about the evidence of life in the Precambian period on to the Cambrian Explosion but also about the history of such studies and the pros and cons of different theories. It is not a page-turner; the reader must be ready to think. But a thinking reader, even one with no science background, will learn a lot.
