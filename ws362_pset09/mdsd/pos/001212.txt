Clearly the previous reviewer didn't read the book they were "reviewing." It is exactly that kind of ad hominem, cult-claim claptrap that is causing the massive exodus into the theonomic camp. The previous reviewer apparently didn't know that Calvinism (you know, the devil-worshiping idiots) started the protestant movement with the Reformation, founded the american colonies, and then fought for the freedom of the american nation. If it weren't for the Calvinists, we would still be confessing to priests and buying Indulgences for our sins.

The book is, as is usual with Dr. North and DeMar, superb and well supported Biblically and otherwise. It is a great introduction to Christian Reconstruction. If you want to understand the essence of that fastly-growing movement, this is the book to read
