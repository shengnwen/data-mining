I recently received this book as a graduation gift.  After allowing it to sit on my bedstand for a few weeks, I finally cracked the cover.  The first chapter on &quot;Passionate Purpose&quot; really hit home.  I had been debating between pursuing a career in PR or one in teaching.  After reading the chapter, I have  now decided on the latter.  I have not yet finished reading rest of the book ... but I am hoping it'll be as inspirational as the first chapter
