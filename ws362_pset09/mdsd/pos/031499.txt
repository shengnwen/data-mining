Cortazar was one of the more unearthly literary geniuses of the 20th century; like Borges and Nabokov I return to his short stories often (more than a decade after first discovering them), and can still get new things out of them.

I agree with previous reviewers - Cortazar's precision with language rivals Nabokov, Kafka, Proust or Borges.  I would add another comparison as well - though the intent is quite different, the very musical and rhythmic sensuality of the writing also recalls the best of Ferlinghetti - Cortazar is confident enough in his expertise to be willing to play with language in a similar fashion, and creates extraordinary and unforgettable worlds throught this (and other) collections.

This is a great introduction to Cortazar, with many personal favorites: "Night Face Up," "Idol Of The Cyclades," "House Taken Over" and "Axolotl" are all unforgettable short fictions.  I wouldn't stop there - Cortazar's other writing is well worth investigating (especially the second story collection, ALL FIRES THE FIRE).  Cortazar seems to be sliding into unfortunate obscurity as of late, with a number of key works currently out of print.  Thankfully, and for the time being, this is not one of them.
