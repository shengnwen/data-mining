The bit of a twist that made an accident appear to be murder worked for me.  It made me think, 'Okay, this main character is on the edge of bragging about helping to solve murders in England, feels a bit put-out  because the Scottish police don't seem to want her help, and then realizes  that she might have made a mistake - and she wants to correct it.&quot;   It's nice to see a main character who is not only NOT perfect, but is made  to face how she might have hurt someone by her mistake.  She doesn't have  to see and solve everything on her own
