How can a book contain so many disturbing, even highly distasteful elements, yet remain so intoxicating and intriguing? Such things from a lesser writer and I would have thrown the book across the room. But with this one I could not. I was compelled. Marquez is part poet, part magician. It is the only explanation I can find.  And in spite of itself, this story leaves you with a feeling almost akin to reverence. Reverence for romantic love even in very old age.
