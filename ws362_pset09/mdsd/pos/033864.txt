I am a family therapist specializing in women's addictions therapy.  I am the clinical director of a treatment program that admits over 100 women per year. I have also been the coordinator of substance abuse training for the  past four years. Three years ago I invited all the addictions counsellors  in our system of care to read &quot;seven weeks&quot;.  For most of us, the  information changed our approach to early sobriety counselling.  Clients  who were previously diagnosed as chronically relapse prone were  experiencing great success following Dr. Mathews Larson's advice.   Accessing the vitamin formulas is difficult in Canada, but higher quality  pharmacies are helpful in producing what clients require on an individual  basis.   Clients are deeply appreciative that so much of their problem is  in their diets. They can change their diets without years of painful  emotional therapy. It is incredibly empowering.  Seven Weeks is a gift to  society.  Of the women who follow the &quot;Seven Weeks&quot; plan, more  than 90% report dramatically lower incidence of depression.  The  combination of psychotherapy and sound bio-chemical management is a  guarantee for success
