I believe if Forrest Gump were reviewing the "for Dummies" series of books, he would say they are like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. I have found a few of these "for Dummies" books to be exceptional, others to be marginal at best, and yet some like this one, MARKETING KIT FOR DUMMIES by Alexander Hiam, that fall somewhere in the "helpful" area. 

This book is not exceptionally well written, but does have some pearls scattered throughout. The book is broken into six parts and twenty one chapters. The problems I had with this book start here. Hiam tried to make the chapters and sub-chapters fit into the six parts and some of them just don't seem to belong there. That in and of itself is okay. It's nice to find unexpected resources. But it makes navigation of the content rather difficult. 

Another pearl here is the CD. I haven't used it yet, but have downloaded it and it looks quite useful for an array of marketing purposes. Perhaps it will prove itself to be worth the book price. 

I guess I would have to say, if you are a business looking for an improved marketing strategy, there are worse places to start, but there are better ones as well. You'll find some useful information here, and strategies that will have a quick impact on your bottom line.
