This delightful book is as much a `and then I ...' as it is a `and this is how you...' type of book. Martin Perlich (originally from Cleveland) was a young man in the right place at the right time, and happily grasped every opportunity made available to him. He describes his triumphs as well as his goofs in this book which is, really, a combination text-book and memoir. 

Every page contains a famous name-or two, or three. Mr. Perlich has interviewed rightfully famous folk as well as celebrity-type folks, and cheerfully tells us how he got that story. 

For the classical music buff, the episodes about famous musicians will be all-too-short, but yet entertaining, even if too short. There are also tales about rock/pop musicians, athletic stars, politicians, and would-be's in each of those categories. 

For the person who wishes to conduct interviews-whether written or recorded (audio or visually) his tips cannot fail to be helpful to the novice as well as the more experienced reporter. Mr. Perlich is very willing to give credit where credit is due, a most enjoyable trait. He happily acknowledges those who helped him along the way. 

I could wish the book was twice the size it is-probably you will, too. Hint, hint.
