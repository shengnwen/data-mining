A generally easy to follow and excellent review of the material.  However, a shortcoming is the lack of clearly definitive language for determining how to name mutual fund money markey accounts and life insurance policies in order to include in the Trust.  For example, do you name yourself as initial trustee or the successor trustee as trustee of children's trusts as beneficiary on life policies?  Do you make Trust owner and/or beneficiary of money market mutual funds.  One additional crticism is that forms are not set up as &quot;forms&quot; per se.  You must eliminate the &quot;fill-in&quot; language such as Name? for each blank
