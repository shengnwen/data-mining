I picked this book up by accident at and utterly fell in love with it. Mcinerney's writing is fluid and really transports you to Japan. Having been there myself, I found the cross-cultural descriptions to be very true. 
However, I would have liked the "flashbacks" to be developed a little further as I found them to be hurried and I believe they would have helped the plot be even more interesting.
Regarding the ending, I must say I read it a few times as I, (like the previous commentator) need to allow it to sink in.  Overall it was a truly great story and I highly recommend it to anyone who has even the slightest interest in Martial Arts, Japan or simply a god read
