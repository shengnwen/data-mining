I wish I had time to write more at this time...this is an excellent small intro.  It does what it claims to do.  It is not comprehensive, but it neither claims to be nor attemtps to be so.  Even so, I have read lots and lots of philosophy books and Nagel says more and does so more effectively than many many (too many) philosophy books that are four, five, six times the size of this little intro of his.  I have probably bought a half a dozen or more copies of it when I see it at used bookstores and have handed them out to friends and even acquaintances who could benefit from knowing something about philosophy but aren't going to dedicate their lives to it.  If you only have time for a hundred pages of philosophy but want to get a taste for the discipline, this is the one you want.  I've said more than my time allows...but would write much more praise if I could
