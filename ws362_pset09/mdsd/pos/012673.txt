I don't give out five stars lightly.  This was one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time.  It's a fascinating glimpse into reality as perceived by someone with multiple personalities.  The story is told from the varying perspectives of the different identities; each is unique but yet also part of a cognitive whole.  I couldn't put it down.  Truly amazing
