Hi my name is Maegan.I read a wonderful book called Half Magic.It is by Ed Eager and illistrated by N.M Bodecker.It is a fictoin fantisy.The charicters are Carrie, Jane, Mark, Martha, Merlin, Ma, Ms.Bick, and Mr.smith.The problem is their wishes get out of order.A interesting part is when the cat half talks!I think you should read this book!
