The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to his White Mother by James McBride is a powerful, stunning book.  It is both a biography and an autobiography, for it tells the life story of the author's mother intertwined skillfully in the author's own.
Ruth McBride Jordan was originally named Rachel Shilsky, the daughter of an Orthodox Jew rabbi.  She was one of three children in her family, but was disowned by her parents when she left her Virginia home to live in Harlem and marry a black man.  It was considered taboo to do so, but she never looked back and lived on to bear twelve children who all made it through college and some through graduate school.
Within this story, we can all feel the pain and disappointment of Ruth, who wants so desperately to fulfill her heart's wishes that she's willing to give up everything for it.  We also hear stories of each of her twelve children, told from the viewpoint of the author, who was the seventh oldest child in this family.  Over all, this was a story meticulously written.  James McBride has woven an urban tale that's deeply modest and yet has an everlasting meaning.
Although at some times the content became so painful that I had to pause and let the emotion portrayed sink in and become digested in my mind, I enjoyed reading this novel.  I gave this book four stars, because it isn't too suitable for younger audiences, but I heartily applaud it for its subtle beauty.
