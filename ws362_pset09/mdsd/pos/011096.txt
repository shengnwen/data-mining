This short novel asks the same question as the film The Matrix poses: is it better to be happy or to know the truth?  The question is even more complex in this novel since happiness is not aligned with beauty or wealth as it is in The Matrix.  

The novel reminds me very much of the 1913 novel by E. Phillips Oppenheim, The Double Life of Mr. Alfred Burton--I wonder if West read that book.  Both books contrast middle-class and upper-class life, and although both clearly see the superior beauty and elegance wealth brings, both novels also depict the snobbery, isolation, and selfishness that can come with social status.  Oppenheim's book is more concerned with social class than with differences in wealth--new money and old money are contrasted.  West's book is more subtle and complex--the complex situation of the returned soldier with amnesia forces the characters to define, rank, and value the relative merits of love, happiness, life, truth, and social position.

(It is fascinating to juxtapose this novel as representing English country life in WWI with the Barchester novels of Angela Thirkell, and with the WWII novel of Mollie Panter-Downes, One Fine Day.  The social burden of class in England comes across strongly.  Another interesting juxtaposition is with Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway--which also deals with a mentally ill soldier returning from WWI.) 

This book poses a true moral dilemma--there is no possible solution that can be happy ever after.  This book should make you rethink the choices in your life and inspire you to greater self-knowledge.
