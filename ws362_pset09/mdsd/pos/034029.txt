This is an amazing book.  It really has alot of techniques you can
use for "take downs" or some sort disarming or disabling techniques.  I Love it, especially since I got the Dr Yangs DVD set on Shaolin Chin Na and useing these together really gives you a better understanding of the art.  Just a side note, the DVD quality, production level, direction, its the best martial arts instructional video I have ever seen
