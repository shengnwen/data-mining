 When Buddy decides to enter Ankh-Morpork and become a musicion he meets Clif and Glodd. Other musicions. Buddy finds a guitar with strange music and an even stranger power. Soon the trio are playing Music with Rocks In. Later all of Ankh-Morpork is in a music franchise.
 In another place, Susan a girl of reason finds out that she is the grandoughter of Death. She realizes that she must take over the family business because Death wants to forget the future by, drinking, going into a pitt, and joining a bunch of beggars.
 A story full of music with rocks in, Bone Motorcycles, musical guitars, a lot of money and neverending spirits.
 I loved this book so much. It was hillariouse and was just plane great. The big thing about this book was that when ever Terry Pratchett would dscribe the music with rocks in, I would go into a trance. So if you want to relax with a book that is also funny Soul Music is your book.
 I took one star away because the book sometimes dragged on
