Let us give him his due. He has great style and tenacity and the nerve. This book was written in better days before his fall. I have visited a number of his buildings - which I understand that he was closely and personally involved in the design and construction - and they are beautiful.

The book gives a nice picture of his move from Queens as told by him, and his developments in Manhattan. But let us not forget it is not as hard as one might think to become a billionaire if you start off with 250 million. He had a great start with his father including his father's business acumen and a development base and finances. His father gave him a lot of responsibility and the young Trump responded and went from Queens to Manhattan to make his mark. He was creative and did well. No question. Only a few are in his class.

But then he got carried away. He thought he had the Midas touch - maybe believed his own book. In any case he thought the "Trump" name itself had tremendous value. He put it in on airplanes. He got over extended and dropped the ball, all on his own and driven by his own nerve and ego. The guy knows how to hire and manage, something he learned from his father and he has taken all that to the next level.

I have read and enjoyed all of Trump's books but he leaves out the practical aspects of dealing with unions and the mob and shady lawyers. They are books with a certain faï¿½ade just like his buildings, so enjoy the book but it is just part of the story.

The books are short and bolster his PR - but are a good read.
