This book was very interesting. I loved the way it recounted every detail in history about the stadium. It took you &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of New York's politicians and the stadium.  It kept me interested. The whole time i felt like i was in New York in the 1920s, it gave me a whole new respect for baseball
