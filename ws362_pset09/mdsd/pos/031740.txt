This book is a must have whether or not you have an overweight child!  This book provides so much quality information that can be applicable to the whole family...  Dr. Melinda Sothern and her team have been publishing in major scientific journals for over 15 years and actually have the experience and basis for their recommendations.  Trim Kids has over 100 pages of tips and ideas to increase physical activity in children.  There are also strength, flexibility, and aerobic exercise recommendations for all children based on family medical history and environment, the child's age, weight condition, personal interests, and body type. All recommendations follow the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine and are based on sound scientific principles and research.  This book is a must read for all parents even those with normal weight children because the exercise guidelines may help prevent overweight conditions.  This book addresses all aspects of weight loss and weight management including nutrition and psychological issues.  I have recommended this book to quite a few families and have seen first-hand the positive influence it has made on both the children and parents
