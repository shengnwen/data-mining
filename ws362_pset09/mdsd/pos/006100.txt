Melissa Bank's The Wonder Spot is an engaging novel/collection of short stories about one character.  When I first started reading, I was a little annoyed that the chapters are more like stand alone short stories than parts of a novel with a unified narrative.  I mean, come on, this is glorified chick lit, how hard can it be?  But, I admit, Bank won me over with her excellent, evocative writing.  She does an excellent job of capturing dating/single life in New York, plus the work is written cleverly with deadpan wit.  The Wonder Spot is a good, quick read, intelligently written, definitely a worthwhile read
