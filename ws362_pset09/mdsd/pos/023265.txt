This book is very well written and an excellent guide if the reader is looking to build a successful, profitable home cleaning business.  Susan Bewsey does a good job of outlining the steps you need to take to get this business off the ground, and to maintain the business.  She also gives a good general idea of what all the business involves.  As far as holding your hand to go get the license, bonding and insurance...no, she doesn't do that.  But she does tell you what you need, and where and who to check with to obtain them, and to get more information on them.  After all, different country's, states, and even city's requirements differ.  If you're going to make it in a business of your own, you need to be able to do some things for yourself
