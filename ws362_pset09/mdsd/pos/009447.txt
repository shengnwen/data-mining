I had been investing in real estate by traditional means (i.e. bank loans) for over a year and having marginal success.  I thought I had read every "how to" book on the market until I found Bill Barnett's.  You always hear of his methods from other investors and in other books but never get a good layout of what YOU need to do to make it work.  Using a few of the methods described in Bill's book, I bought a property 3 days after I put the book down and turned it for 22% in 5 weeks.  I have been doing this for the past 4 months and re-read the book often as it serves as a good reference as well.  The presentation of facts versus good fortune and other people's stories is what serparates this book from the thousands of others.  There will always be risks involved with investing and there is no such thing as an "overnight" millionaire--but this book will certainly get you on your way.  Highly recommended
