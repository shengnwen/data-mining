I have been looking for this type of help for quite sometime now. I have meditated for many years but felt a more focused direction was needed. Procrastination and mental toughness hypnosis did the trick for me. Neil Fiore's soothing and professional manner easily flows into deep relaxation. I will recommend this to many people.
