I enjoyed this book, mostly because I had many, many questions about the politics and the economics of the WTC.  If that's your purpose in picking this book, you'll do fine.

However, "The Rise and Fall" certainly implies a lot of coverage of the collapse of the towers.  This, while covered, is not dealt with in as thorough a manner as in many other documentaries.  So, as with many things, your pleasure with the book is a function of your expectations.  I liked it a lot, but, from what other reviewers say below, I can understand why others feel much less enthusiastic
