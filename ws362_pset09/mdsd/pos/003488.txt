Everyone ought to have at least one cookbook that covers basic recipes for just about anything you may have to cook.  And this is the one I recommend.  You can be staring at a cut of meat, or a fish fillet.  Or wondering what cheese and wine to serve with fresh fruit.  Or trying to guess how to make a cheese fondue.  Or a pie for dessert.  This is the book that will help you do it all.  The recipes are not particularly fancy, nor are they exotic, but they're safe
