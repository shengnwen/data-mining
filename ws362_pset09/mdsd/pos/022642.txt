All of the intricacies of the election of 1800 and its characters could be a 600-page book.  Ferling has written 200, so he sacrifices depth for a quick read, but does a pretty good job of giving a good outline of what happened and an introduction to the characters involved.  This is one of those interesting but overlooked events in American history that people would do well to know more about.  It is a quick and easy read and for history buffs, it's a good pick for a lazy day, especially around election season
