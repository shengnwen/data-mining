I read entrepreneurial business books all the time.  It's part of my job because I speak and consult with small business owners who want to turn their businesses into Consumer Destinations.  Sometimes the books I read are theory.  Sometimes they're written by marketing professors who talk a good game, but have never run a business in their lives.  Donna Fenn's book is different.  She found real-life small business successes that any business owner can identify with.  This book is so chocked full of real-life, 'these-really-work' tactics that an entrepreneur can read this book, and immediately apply them.  I also appreciate that Fenn takes you through the life of the businesses she highlights.  She doesn't just hit the high points; she describes the trauma and agony of becoming an Alpha Dog business.  I've already recommended Alpha Dogs to my coaching clients because I know that they'll read the book, and be able to mirror the successes of the businesses in the book.  I don't know if Fenn intended this book to be used this way, but I'd require it in my course, if I was a professor wanting to prepare my students for the real world
