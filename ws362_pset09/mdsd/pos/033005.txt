Being an 'project Apollo junkie', my great blind spot was the famous LEM.
This book gave me an unseen look behind the scenes of this unique flying apparatus, the only true spaceship man has ever made.
When one looks at these pictures now, one can only be amazed by the engineering beauty of it, and even more by the claustrophobic confinement of its cramped space inside.  I just couldn't believe how two grown up persons in full space suit had to exit and enter this tiny cabin by an even more tiny hatch (that even swung inward !).
The only part I missed was some more text, maybe even some anecdotes.
All in all, I love this book, it sits there on my bookshelf and from time to time I like to browse it again and again, a bit in disbelief about the technological marvel of a spaceship with less computer memory than the most tiny pocket calculator you can find today.
A deep bow for the people that designed and built this machine
