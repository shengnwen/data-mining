As soon as my son is old enough to read and understand this novel, I am going to challenge him to read it one summer. I feel that every young person, especially young black males should read this novel. It accurately reflects how we are all products of our environment, and even sometimes caught up in situations beyond our control, but it is our response to these circumstances that is key. But the largest lesson to be learned and to understand is that there are always consequences to our actions, whether our actions are intentional or not. 

The novel brings up the interesting dichotomy that exists between nature and nurture. I eventually came to the conclusion that faced with some of the same challenges that Bigger Thomas had to deal with (racism, stereotypes, and himself...perhaps his own worse enemy), I could have made some of the same decisions. Even more troubling at the end of the novel is my conclusion that any of us could have been 'Bigger' because at the end of the novel, Bigger wasn't even the issue, it was Society and their response to Bigger.
