So the Clintons were crooks -- what a shock!  Are not the Bushes?  Are not the Kennedys?  When are we as a nation going to wake up and realize that politicians of national prominence are almost always vampires with personal ethics that belong in the sewer?  Why do we want to keep making government bigger and give these types of vultures more power over our own lives?  Have we all turned into sheep?  VOTE LIBERTARIAN!!
