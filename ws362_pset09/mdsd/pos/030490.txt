The Lundberg's book &quot;I Don't Have to Make Everything All Better&quot; has been a great resource to me as a church leader and counselor.  When their new book &quot;Married for Better, Not Worse&quot; was released I bought it without hesitation.  It is well researched and they have carefully integrated their own ideas with concepts and articles from many others.   The real test of any book is if it can help stimulate a positive lasting and permanent change in behavior and understanding.   In order for that to happen it must be easy to read, offer hope that conflict relief is achievable, and contain common sense solutions to everyday problems. Although there are many books available on this popular subject, it has become my book of choice when counseling couples in trouble.  I have already witnessed some very positive results with its use
