Walter Mosley has turned his incredible talents to the writing of science fiction and has done a very good job.  This is a book of nine shortstories that are linked to a future society as a common thread.  Some of the various characters show up in more than one story, but not as the main character in more than one.  Mosley paints a bleak picture of the future as a revolving cycle of employment/ unemployment.  Nobody ownes anything anymore, it is all leased from a corporation.  Shirking your work is now a punishable crime and the constitution no longer applies to individuals.

Futureland can be classified in two ways, 1: it reminds the reader of cyberpunk novels, but without all of the cool gadgets and anti heros beating the system. 2: it is written in the same vein that "Brave New World" explores.  Mosley focuses in one the lives of various people in the short story and explains the world through their eyes.  It is not very pretty and the book does not end in a pretty way.  This is very well written and is enjoyable.  Recommended
