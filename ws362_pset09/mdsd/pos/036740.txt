Professor Snow once again demonstrates his superb skills at analyzing closely and presenting to readers clearly the central issues confonting American national security in the coming decade.  More than any other  writer on the scene today, Snow possesses the professional stature and the  broad admiration of his peers to present such an authoritative volume.   Readers will be lead through a singularly lucid survey of the altered  nature of national security thinking-- and thus formal policymaking-- made  necessary by the &quot;twilight struggle&quot; of the Cold War.  This book  is highly recommended to general readers, policymakers, scholars, and all  teachers of international affairs
