I have the first edition of this book, purchased many years ago. It is an excellent introduction to the basic quantum chemical methods. The problems are well matched to the level of the text. The best way to use this  book is as an introduction to the source papers. 

For the most part, the primary papers in this field are well written. So read the chapter on Hartree-Fock theory, and then go ahead and read the references at the end of the chapter for the original sources. If you understood the chapter, the papers won't go over your head and will actually be quite fascinating. The only exception to this rule is that GUGA based configuration interaction approaches do require some group theory beyond what is covered in this text. Well worth the price
