This is a really great true story about a band of buddies who hiked to the top of Half Dome in Yosemite during a fierce lightening storm and got zapped. Their goal was to ignore the warning signs and dance in the storm. Finally they took refuge in a rock cave that overhangs the valley below to marvel at the display. What they didn't know (or chose to ignore) was: 1) Half Dome is one of nature's greatest natural lightening rods; 2) What they took refuge in was essentially a smaller natural lightening rod on top of the big one; and 3) The remnant of a man-made lightening rod was right in their midst. They were perhaps the only humans to observe first-hand that lightening does indeed strike twice in exactly the same place with devastating consequences (yes, death and injury resulted - along with great heroism on the part of rescuers - but you need to read the book to get the details). Highly recommended although the author takes frequent and too-long side trips to discuss technical climbing, types of clouds, etc. when he could have focused more on this truly gripping tragedy. A must read if you ever plan on visiting Yosemite National Park in the Summer. Advice - in July/August, be very careful hiking in the high country after 2 pm - I and some other hikers got caught in a sudden/unexpected lightening storm in Aug. 2006 and it's unbelievably scary - and I observed all the warnings!
