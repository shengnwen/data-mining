Unlike another reviewer, who gave this book one star, I found Dale Willerton's book to be very helpful. As someone who knows nothing about leasing, the book revealed to me many of the issues I can expect to encounter, and helped me begin to understand some of the complex problems I will have to deal with. Yes, there may be other resources out there that are as good or better than Dale's book, but at least give it a read and form your own opinion
