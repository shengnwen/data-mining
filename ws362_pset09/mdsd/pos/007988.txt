This is THE Italian cookbook to have, period.  I have been cooking out of the Marcella's original Classic Italian Cookbook for 15 years now.  It was a quality paperback, but I used it so much that it broke into a bunch of pamphlets that I had to keep together on the shelf.  So when I saw this book on the market in hardcover at a truly reasonable price, I had to get it -- and I am glad I did.  The organization and presentation are superb and I get the added wisdom of her second tome blended in with the first.  Even simple and elegant dishes like the beef braised in red wine (the best roast you will ever eat in your life) have been slightly repackaged to the reader's benefit.

If you like Italian food and want to prepare it the right way with simple and easy to follow instructions, this is the only book you need.  When you serve Marcella's meals, the dinner table gets very quiet except for the groans of pleasure at every bite
