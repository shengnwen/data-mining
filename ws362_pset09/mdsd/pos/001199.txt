This one is more of a 3 1/2 for me, but I rounded it up to 4 because I'm just too picky when it comes to the excitement of a story.

This book is basically a collection of stories about warriors in some way, shape, or form. Some stories stand out as thoroughly captivating in some way or another--i.e., the dark 'Heartless', the action-packed intrigue story 'Devil Wind', and the funny 'The Boy Who Cried "Dragon!"' Others were boring or with a not-so-great plot--i.e., 'Serpent's Rock' and 'Lioness'(&lt;--this would have been good if it had been written by a different, or better, author). Fans of Tamora Pierce who leap at this book, prepare to be at least a bit disappointed; only one story is written by Her Fantasy Highness herself, and even that one 'Student of Ostriches' was surely not her best. 

I enjoyed this book for the first couple stories, and then after a while I started realizing that this book was getting mediocre fast. I barely read the last two stories--whether that was a mistake, I don't know, but sincerely doubt. 'Young Warriors' is for fantasy lovers who have long zipped through Tamora's new book, 'The Will of the Empress', as well as all the other new fantasy reads, and are in desperate need of a good book of magic and strength. However, I would recommend getting this one at the library, depending on how high your endurance level is and how much you love fantasy.
