Reading this book is not a pleasant experience -- it has more to offer than mere pleasure.  It grips you like a vise while you read it and haunts you for a long time afterwards.  The book is short and claustrophobic, taking place almost entirely in one home.  It is an intensive exploration of the way a regime like Qaddafi's corrupts everything in its grasp, from overall social structure to the workings of the individual mind.   

The plot proceeds mostly by hints and implications, producing a gradually increasing sense of dread that is appropriate to this subject matter.  The author's portrayal of the protagonist, a nine-year-old boy, is courageous and completely unsentimental, exposing the cruelty and selfishness of this child; his passionate, jealous attachment to his mother; and his ruined spirit as an adult.
