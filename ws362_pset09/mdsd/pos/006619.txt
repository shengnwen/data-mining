Charlie Bone isn't your typical nine-year-old boy.  Although he didn't know that himself.  But when photographs get mixed up and he ends up with a picture of a man and a little girl that talks to him, he knows everything that was normal about his life is gone forever.  Tracking down the picture, Charlie finds out it belongs to Miss Ingledew, a woman who owns a bookshop and has been looking for her missing niece for years.  She gives Charlie a mysterious package (that he can't open) and sets him on his journey that will change everything in his world.  As it turns out, Charlie is one of the descendants of the Red King, a mysterious person who had wondrous magical powers who went into hiding.  The Red King's children have been equally divided between good and evil ever since.  At Bloor's Academy, Charlie finds friends and enemies, and the challenge of his lifetime as he tracks down secrets others don't want revealed.

Jenny Nimmo is the author of five books in the Charlie Bone series and has written several other children's books and fantasies.

Many people compare Charlie Bone to Harry Potter, and that's a good comparison.  But the two series are different.  Harry's family is really non-supportive, but Charlie has a loving mother, a doting grandmother, and Uncle Paton, who turns out to be something of a hero.  The book is a fun, fast-paced whirlwind of mysteries, magic, and friendship.  Even at 400 pages, it feels like it's over much too soon.

There are a few jarring instances where the point-of-view was disconnected, moving from one character and one scene into another without warning.  They were easily overlooked due to the pacing of the story, but noticeable all the same.

Fans who are waiting for the next Harry Potter book who haven't tried the Charlie Bone series are encouraged to do so.  Charlie's story, although similar, has much to offer in reading excitement
