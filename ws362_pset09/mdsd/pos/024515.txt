This is a great book.  I bought this book because I attend many work functions during the year and I find it hard to keep conversations going after the initial introduction.  This book made it easier for me.  I love that the book is thin and the advice is succinct.  I was able to use his techniques at a black tie gala right after reading only half of the book.   Even though it's a thin book, the author asks you to read one section and then go out and apply it before reading the next section.  It really works.  It's easier for me to start conversations now and to steer conversations to new topics when I feel like a topic is drying out.  Very useful
