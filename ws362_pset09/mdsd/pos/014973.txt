Like many other reviewers, I also don't read many anthologies, but I have to say I enjoyed this. Was I crazy about every single story in it? No, but there were enough good ones to merit a good review.

Basically, the stories fell into a few categories. The selections by  Hendricks, Weisberger and Sparling were about women abroad contemplating their relationships back home, (or lack thereof). All three were very good.

Weiner's, Trigiani's and Manby's all took place in England. They were all just OK, in my opinion. Weiner's writing style was perhaps too serious for its silly plot, Trigiani's was just too fluffy, and Manby's was kind of sleazy (but was probably the best of the three.)

Chupack's, Henderson's, Wolfe's and Curnyn's were the most literary, and were very stream-of consciousness. I didn't like these that much.

Three of the stories were not really chick-lit but of that "Southern small-town woman" genre. The stories were all right (Baggott's, Dalton's and Laskas's)but didn't belong with the others in the anthology.

I didn't get through Mlynowski's, which seemed very shallow, so the three remaining were probably the best.

Gold--Voodoo Dolls, etc.--Melissa Senate.  Funny and moving
Silver--Leaving a light on. Cute, with a surprise ending
Bronze--Forty Days, by Jill Smolinski. Close tie with the "vacation" stories, but this one was more origninal.
