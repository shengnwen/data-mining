As a child of grandparants and a father that lived in Basilicata in that time period I was struck about the potrayal of the poverty of the region. My father leaving that area a the age of 14 had only fond memories of that region . I am a little suprised about the potrayal of people as superstitious simpletons and such characterization I know from personal experience in not accurate. My father never mentioned malaria even thought that disease is promonently mentioned in Levi's account of the rgion.
Where levi should be credited is that he wrote a wonderful memoir in terms of the power of the words and this book is somewhat of a model for memoir writing. He shown a relatively unknown area of Italy and gives the reader an insight on the almost feudal conditions that existed in southern Italy.Where I disagree with Levi is that he looks at incredible people surviving poverty and disease and he charaterises them as simple tons believing in werewolves and portraying people as believers in magic over Christianity. I know from my grandmother that even with some of the superstitions she can be characterized as a firm believer in Christianity. Levi a probable Socialist is disappointed that the peasants did not overthrown the bourgousie as his Marxist leaning would require. Read this book to learn about Basilicata but be aware of Author bias
