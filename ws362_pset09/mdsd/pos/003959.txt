Wake Up... You're Liberal: How We Can Take America Back From The Right is a sharp-voiced wake-up call, grounded heavily in both research and personal passion. Cartoonist, columnist, and war correspondent Ted Rall argues that most "Republican" voters agree with liberals on most issues, but have been duped into voting against their own interests and for the interests of the wealthiest, most sharply conservative, and often most fanatically religious minority of the nation. Discussing everything from high school bullying to dirty political practices to Central Asian oil politics, Wake Up... You're Liberal combines its whetted observations into an overriding manifesto to wake up, get involved, and contribute to the democratic system that makes America great.
