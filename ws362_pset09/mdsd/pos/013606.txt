Leo the Late Bloomer is another in the vast series of books that made my childhood the happy time it was. I know it has a message about bolstering self esteem and being special in who you are, and in feeling confident that if you wait and do your best, your unique talents will blossom before the world, but you know, twenty years later none of that matters a hill of beans to me. What I seriously recall most is that is the colors in Leo are simply wonderful. I'd sit in my cozy miniature chair with the fluffy orange "fur" on it and I'd stare rapt at the vivid, semi-fluorescent day-glo colors of the flowers, of the tiger's fur, of the birds, of what seemed like every part of this genuinely captivating picture book. In terms of visuals alone, this book will draw any child straight into it. Staring at this used to do something positive to my three-year-old brain and make me happy. I'm being serious. Get this for a 3-4-5 year old and watch what they do. I bet dollars to donuts they stare at the colors and sit with their face about an inch off the page. 

I don't know what it is about Leo The Late Bloomer, but it connects somehow with the visual/emotional/cognitive centers of the young mind in a way I personally can't remember any other book quite achieving
