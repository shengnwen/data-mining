In brief, Nobody's Fool is yet another brilliant, hilarious and affectionate snapshot of small-town life in a fictional upstate New York town from Richard Russo. Though he mines the same territory in most of his works (absent, good-for-nothing fathers), in Nobody's Fool we get inside the head of one of these said fathers in Donald "Sully" Sullivan. And as is also the case with Russo's novels, his plots take their time to develop. In the hands of a less skilled writer, that could be infuriating, but Russo's prose and characterization is so entertaining, by the time he gets to the point you're having so much fun, it makes the wait more than worth it. 

If you're looking for an introduction to Russo's work or just want a great novel to live with for a few weeks, Nobody's Fool is the perfect balance between "serious" literature and homespun storytelling. Do yourself a favor and start reading
