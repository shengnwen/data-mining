This book contains something for everyone.  Action, adventure, power  struggles, romance, money, geology, the wild west, the roaring twenties,  family feuds and best of all...it's all true!   Frank Phillips grew up a  farm boy in Iowa, started a career as a barber and ended up an oil tycoon.   This is an easy read and it is obvious that Wallis' research was very  thorough.  He almost leads you through a day to day account of Frank  Phillips' life.  And what a life it must have been.  A true gambler, Frank  Phillips' started with almost nothing, made a fortune then risked  everything he had just to stay in the game.   I can highly recommend this  book to anyone who enjoys reading.  Wallis has brought together a complex  man's world and gives the reader an insight rarely seen in biographical  writing.  He makes the stories come to life and links them all together  superbly
