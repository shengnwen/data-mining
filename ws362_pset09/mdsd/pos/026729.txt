Obi or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack is a new edition of a novel originally published in the 1800's. Based on the escaped slave and Jamaican folk hero jack Mansong, who was believed to have found strength in the Afro- Caribbean religion of obeah, or "obi", Obi or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack is a dramatic saga of his struggle to survive, resist slavery, and defend his family's honor. A mix of religion, politics, romance, and social critique, Obi or, The History of Three-Fingered Jack is as compelling a read today as it was over a century ago. The Broadview edition features a critical introduction and a selection of modern documents including historical and literary writings concerning obeah and accounts of an eighteenth-century slave rebellion. A classic that passes the test of time with flying colors.
