I don't know how Vlasic was able to get the information in this book. The conversations ring true to me and this story feels as if it really could have occurred the way Vlasic describes it.  This is one of the best books I have read in the past year.  He is able to take a somewhat chaotic true story and assemble a story that flows smoothly yet also seems accurate.  His ability to draw a picture of the characters is outstanding and they have proven quite prescient as time has passed
