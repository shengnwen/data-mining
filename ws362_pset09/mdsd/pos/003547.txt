A. Manette Ansay has written another beautiful book ~~ this time about an angel that has been sighted over a river in Wisconsin. It is also a story about a small town where everyone knows one another and where everyone knows of its neighbor's struggles. The story is centered around a little boy named Gabriel. Gabriel was dumped in this town, Ambient, by his father who deserted him. Fat and unlovable, Gabriel is a devout Christian and is always found to be praying. Picked on and abused, Gabriel continues to slug along ~~ till one day, he is discovered in a neighbor's barn, dead.

The story focuses on Gabriel, his aunt who was raising him, several members of a prayer circle, and one of the daughters of the town who was part of the fateful events of the evening that Gabriel is later found dead. The stories entwined with one another in small ways ~~ it's written more like short stories combined to make one novel about a town. Ansay writes with her usual lyrical style about different lives of people and their secret joys and disappointments and how it all meshed together with the legend of the River Angel that people have taken to be their local lore.

It is a very interesting book ~~ dark and depressing in places though but beautifully written and with a grace that is evident in each of the characters written. Ansay is not an easy author to read sometimes but her stories are always compelling and brings the reader further into the book. This is an excellent read ~~ perfect for a bookclub discussion.
