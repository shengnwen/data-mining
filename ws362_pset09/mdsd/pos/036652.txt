This is mystery romance novel about stolen art and the mix of romance between the burglary and art proprietor. The secondary story of alcoholic brother and his first love had some wonderful moments. The mystery was great and I didn't have a clue who the killer was until it was unveiled. I would recommend this novel and 'The Villa' by Nora Roberts's
