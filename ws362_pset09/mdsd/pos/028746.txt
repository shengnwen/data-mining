American history never made sense to me and now I know why.  As voltaire said, &quot;History is the lie commonly agreed upon&quot; and that's what was taught to me in school and is now taught to my son.  Francis Jennings tries to change all that with a &quot;revisionist history&quot; asking the questions that when posed by students in school are ignored by teachers. How did material progress evolve in a country that was already populated by over 25 million inhabitants?  Who owned america?  How did we shift from a policy of cooperation with the indians (a la Thanksgiving) to one of aggression. How much of our revolution was political and how much economic?  How did relations between colonialists and Great Britain deteriorate so quickly after so many years of harmony?  This book is an overview of much that Jennings has written in earlier books with some further thoughts and ideas.  What is most enjoyable is that he is willing to speculate, to question accepted fact and wisdom, to go out on a limb, to offer an opinion on various events, characters and situations.  For the first time american history became real to me: the people human, the events complex and contradictory, the struggle for independence understandable.  In the end a history not much different from what has been happening recently in Washington. The prose can be turgid; parts of it are somewhat academic but Jennings moves the story along and makes for me (a non-historian) very telling points. He left this reader with much to think about. I have since gone out and bought his other books and will be reading those in 2001.  A good balancing piece after this book is A Struggle For Power by Theodore Draper
