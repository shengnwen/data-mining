While this book is indeed cute and comical, I was a little suprised at how small it is.  I thought it would be much larger and with many more pages.The book itself is only 7 1/4"x7 1/4"x 1/4".  Inside the book has only 26 different things to write about or record, one of which is an envelope to hold something inapproriate.  The book covers moms body when pregnant, labor, nicknames, 1st poop, belly button stump, 1st rectal thermometer, mucus, spit up, 1st person peed on, breastfeeding, breast leakage, 1st diaper changing, 1st solid food, 1st solid food poop, inappropriate things in mouth, 1st indigestible things in diaper, embarrasing outfits, 1st pooping/peeing in bathtub, farting in public, smearing, naked in public places, items in nose, habits, and 1st inappropriate word.  While I feel the book could include more, I still think it's a great and original shower gift
