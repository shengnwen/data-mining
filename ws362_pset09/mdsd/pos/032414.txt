This outstanding autobiographical recount of Ardery's WW2 experiences ranks amongst the top in this genre. Follow his career through flight training and initial assignments, trials, tribulations and finally, a combat assignment. Ardery, his crew, and their B24 participated in several critical and unprecedented bombing missions during the war, including the infamous Ploesti raid. His recount of flying into a virtual &quot;wall of fire&quot;, which was the defensive flak being levelled at their bomber, is one of the most horrowing experiences written to date.  In addition to this book, those interested in the B24 should definately read Thomas Childer's &quot;Wings of Morning : The Story of the Last American Bomber Shot Down over Germany in World War II&quot; which stands alone as the absolute finest piece of literature written to date on this subject
