For many people who enjoy classical literature, whether Greek tragedy or Shakespearean comedy, it comes down to which version of the work is the best.  I have read the Merchant of Venice many times, and was looking to read it again.  However, there are well over 50 versions to purchase on Amazon alone.

My review, then, focuses not so much on the play itself, but on this Signet edition.  Whichever side of the "Shylock shows Shakespeare as a racist" issue you are on, the reality to me is that this is wonderful literature.  That being said, I highly recommend this particular version for several reasons.  The introduction to Shakespeare, his time, his language, the theater, and other areas is well written.  While perhaps not new information to Shakespeare buffs, I think people reading Shakespeare for the first or second time would find it extremely enlightening. There is also an 18 page introduction to MoV that is like a Cliff's Notes version with some insight as readers prepare to absorb the beautiful language ahead.

With respect to the play, this edition does not bog the reader down in defining every other word, but rather only those words that are completely foreign to the modern speaker, or that had a completely different meaning 400 years ago.  After the play are some excellent essays that may help enighten those readers who are wondering about Shylock and his portrayal.  I also enjoyed the history of dramatic performances and who played whom in past productions
