De Bono has broken down the steps an individual takes to make a decision and presented it in a way that can be utilized by groups.  The importance of the book is to eliminate argument from any decision making process.  In argument each side tries to prove their point, allows emotion to get the better of them and in many cases the better arguer (not the better solution) wins in the end.  

He uses a very basic image of 6 colored hats and assigned the type of thinking you should accomplish while wearing each hat.  For example black hat is cautious and careful, looking for weakness in an idea while yellow hat is positive and uncovers the positives in an idea.  The importance is to make sure everyone in a discussion is wearing the same hat at the same time, so as to give focus to a discussion.  Depending on what the issue is the hats can be worn in a variety of different orders and it is up to the blue hat to decide what order.

The main problem I have with the book is its conclusion.  Throughout the book he refers to an information map and at the end he says that by using the information map the answer suddenly appears to everyone in the room?  I think it would have been a great idea to add an additional chapter discussing the information map and how the blue hat thinker could capture the information from the discussion.  Obviously there are many techniques available but his book is incomplete without one designed around the 6 Hats.  In fact he goes as far as to say if a decision does not jump out at everyone in the room then another method may be required.

I think this book is incredibly usefull for solving discussions that are plaqued by argument.  It basically is a method to stop argument and start collaboration.

Overall I would recomend this book as it is a very easy read.  It will help you realize when a discussion is turning into an argument and when the Six Hats should be utilized
