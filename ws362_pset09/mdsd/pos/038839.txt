This book is a beautiful way to associate art throghout the ages with our needlepoint of today.   It is so interesting to find paintings that you have seen and then look at them again by being shown a person sitting and stitching.   You can actually see and feel her joy in her work and the feeling of accomplishment it is bringing to her.   Wonderfully done and researched. And since Gail Sirna is a designer and teacher of needlework, she brings authority and true feeling into this interesting book which is a "feast for the eyes".
