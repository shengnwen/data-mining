I like her first book, "Handknits for Kids", better - but it's still very cute.  I can't imagine spending the time to knit a kid a robe that is never worn outside.  So... I plan to modify one of the robe patterns & make it a regular sweater.  If you love to knit blankets, (not me) this book has some gorgeous patterns.  Some really cute toys, too - I love the owl!  Definately worth a look if you are a Lucinda Guy fan.
