I first read this book several years ago, but the concepts and ideas have so pervaided my life that they continue to guide me.  In fact, I have re-read this book several times over the past few years.

While other reviewers have remarked that the author seems prideful or her ideas too simplistic, I found her to be direct - cutting the concepts to their basic "black and white" cores.

LeAnne Payne reminds the readers that we too often focus of what we shouldn't do as Christians leaving too little time to focus on what we should do.  For me, that was a stepping stone into evaluating the actions and activies of my life and my mindset.

Her suggestions on how to release negative thoughts to Christ was incredibly helpful... and her discussion of negative thoughts and how the enemy actually uses them against us... well, I'd never read anything like it.

If you're looking for a book which will lead you into deeper introspection - and you're willing to take your time to apply the concepts - I would highly recommend this book
