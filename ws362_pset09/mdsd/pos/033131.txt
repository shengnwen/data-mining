I always loved Edgar Allan Poe's literary work. I also enjoyed Matthew Pearl's "Dante Club" book. So I was happy to see the combination of Pearl writing and the story of mysterious death of Poe. The book is very engaging following the footsteps of Baltimorean attorney, Mr. Clark, who abandons his practice and loved ones, and follows the quest to uncover the truth surrounding Poe's sudden and mysterious death. M.Pearl paints very vivid picture of 19th century Baltimore and Paris where the main protagonist finds his way to discover additional troubles haunting him till the end of the book. The story is fast paced, intriguing, and well written. However, I am not awarding my review 5 stars because, unlike in "Dante Club", Mr. Pearl is utilizing much less of Poe's literary work and more speculative investigative information, which I believe he spent lots of time researching. I still highly recommend this book
