When I was a grad student in anthropology, I needed to get up to speed in this field in a hurry.  I bought the 1st edition of this book and read it quickly.  I was very glad for the background in some basic field of cultural theory and popular culture.  

While no means definitive, and probably debatable on a few points, this is a very effective way to quickly become familiar with the field.  I recommend it to undergrads, grad students, and even to neophyte faculty in the field.
