John Ross has written a novel laced with real events from the 20th Century that illustrates how our Bill Of Rights has been diluted by well meaning and not-so-well meaning politicians.  It is an entertaining history lesson and a serious wake up call for all Americans who care about personal liberty.  I highly recommend it
