I teach literature to undergraduate students majoring in interdisciplinary arts and sciences, business, computer science, and nursing.  Since I can't count on them having had training in writing about literature, I often assign specific sections of this text, or make it recommended reading for students with less confidence in writing about literature.

My students almost universally praise this text, and I think *their* opinions, rather than those of us teachers, are the ones that really count.  They find the specific, nuts-and-bolts suggestions useful, and the explanations clear and helpful.

I recommend this text to any student (high school or college) who wants a concise guide to writing about literature, and any teacher or professor whose students usually lack a solid background in literary study
