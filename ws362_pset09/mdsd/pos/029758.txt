I really enjoyed this book. I like it so much because it reminds me of my interracial marraige to my high school sweetheart and best friend. He was like Ned, kind of nerdy. I was like Fiona,a cheerleader and dancer. Ned and Fiona are great best friends. Fiona is living with Ned until she finds a job. She has attended law school to prove to everyone that she isn't an airhead. Ned is really smart and has a job working with computers. He wants to run his own department but doesn't know how to prove to his boss that he's capable and ready. So, Fiona comes up with a plan that is supposed to get Ned a promotion and her a job in the best court in Virginia. There's only one catch,the plan calls for them to cross the best friend line and become lovers. Will they decide to go for it? You'll have to read the book to see what happens. Believe me, it's worth it. There are lots of heart felt, humorous and sexy moments. This is the second book that I have read by Bridget Midway. I have thoroughly enjoyed them both.
