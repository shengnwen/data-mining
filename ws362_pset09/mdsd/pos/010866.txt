Albert Mroz does an excellent job in describing in both words and in black &amp; white pictures the more than 1200 different American trucks and Commercial vehicles.  This is a very useful research tool for the  automotive historian.  Details behind the manufacturer's products as well  as the history behind the companies is very thorough.  I would welcome a  revised edition with added marques and additional historical information as  well as a listing of production figures.  This book should be in every auto  historian and truck researcher's library
