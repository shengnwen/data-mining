Inseperable from the book Fr. O'Malley is a teacher to those who seek the most basic questions of ethics.  As Kant realizes that morality comes from a sense of duty--so Fr. O'Malley teaches his students and readers what it means to be human.  This book connects, compares, and touches upon the essential subjects of morality and God.  A great read for anyone who questions.  As a friend and former student I can say that here is a man analogous to his words.  Meet him and his thoughts, in &quot;Meeting the Living God.&quot
