It nevers ceases to amaze me that people could be so gullible as to send a check for a large sum of money because some guy with a great line of BS says he can make you rich and he represents an official sounding brokerage house.  Wow.

The story is very captivating.  Reading about Louis spiral out of control, hooking up with organized crime "Guys", the drugs, the lies, the scamming.  Pretty entertaining.

This book really makes me wonder what all those regulatory agencies actually do.  Its obvious they are not running around trying to protect the average consumer. Too bad, cause with people like Louis manning the phones, many people out there need protection.

I found myself looking for excuses during the day to get back to reading this book.  I really enjoyed it
