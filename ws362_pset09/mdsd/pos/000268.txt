This book is as exciting and full of mystery, suspense, and fantasy just like Faerie Wars. I liked all the new, interesting characters in the Purple Emperor, but i think i liked the first book better, i'm not sure why, it just kinda left you wondering and i liked that. I did like how the Purple Emperor was based more in the faerie realm instead of the analogue world it drew you in more than the parts based in normal life.
