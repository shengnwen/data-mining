I am fairly new to all of this herb gardening stuff but this is one of the nicest books I have come across so far. It has alot of nice pictures and diagrams. My favorite parts of the book are the garden ideas/diagrams it shows. It shows a wagon wheel garden, knot gardens, etc. As well as gives potting ideas and helps. In the back is an index of herbs with descriptions and colorful pictures. The pictures do a good job of showing you what the herb looks like. It also have basic garden information on composting etc. I also like that it helps you plan a year round garden. Nothing worse than a garden that only blooms one season! I think anyone who needs help with herb gardening, or anyone in a rut, should check this book out. I really enjoyed it
