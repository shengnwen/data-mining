Two things you should know when considering whether to buy this book:

1. When they say worst-case scenario, they really mean worst-case scenario.  It advertises advice on surviving volcanic eruption, not on losing your travelers' checks.

2. It is humor.  On page 48, they advise "earplugs are useful when you want to sleep in a battle zone" which leads into the next section "How To Survive A Hostage Situation."  This section, by the way is a kind of awkward read post-9/11 (as near as I can tell, the book has not been revised since before that event or at all).  They also recommend that you wave for help when stuck inside the trunk of a car, so there you go.

If you are looking for humor, I recommend it.  If you are looking for something more serious in the light of New York, Madrid, London, Thailand/India/Sri Lanka, New Orleans, etc. in the past five years, you will need to look elsewhere or you will be disappointed
