I was given this book to read, and I enjoyed it so much, I bought a copy for myself and another copy for my mom.  What would happen if white supremacists from the future travel back in time to the Civil War to help the south win the war?  I was amazed when I was only half way through the book, when the war ended.  The war is over, what else could happen?  We get to see what happens after the war, and how the opinions of people can be changed, for the better.

If you are not familiar with the works of Harry Turtledove, he writes stories centered around a "what if" theme.  I am currently reading his series of books dealing with aliens invading during World War II.  Harry Turtledove is the master of this style of fiction
