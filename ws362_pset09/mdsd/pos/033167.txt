1919 is John Dos Passos' second novel in the U.S.A. trilogy which takes place during World War I.  Dos Passos masterfully intersperses biographies of personages of the time with fictitious characters-idealists, profiteers, and those simply caught in the middle of it all-who sometimes cross each others' paths in the confusion.   
The Camera Eye and Newsreel present snippets of headlines and popular songs, as do Dos Passos' own illustrations.  Some of this has not aged well since 1932, the date of publication. All but the most illustrious people have been forgotten, as well as many of the events surrounding the war. 
The strength of 1919 is that it seems to capture the mood of the period through use of "real" speech, the reporting of quotidian conversations and banal concerns, a device far more effective than a historicized  than the characters discussing Marxist dialectics in the middle of the trenches.  The characters of 1919 are concerned with making it home alive while perhaps learning something about themselves and their country's position in the new century.
