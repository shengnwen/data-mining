SCARY!

These are the quotes you see on EVERY single book you read these days whether it is King, Koontz, or Pee Wee Herman's autobiography.  Very few books actually live up to those words and phrases though.  Misery is one those novels.  For me to read a book in two days is a phenomonon.  Not because I'm an "ijit", but simply because I don't have the time to kick back and read like I used to.  Misery made me find the time though.

Writer Paul Sheldon gets caught in a blizzard and winds up in a brutal car accident.  He shatters both of his legs, and probably would have died except for the fact that he was rescued by a woman named Annie Wilkes.  A woman who loved his writing and in her words was his "number 1 fan".  Sounds like Paul got lucky, but Annie just happens to be a homicidal maniac.

This is a book of pure action from the first page to the last.  It was written in a period when King was at his best.  This book stands out though.  At a time when it seemed all of his novels were gigantic, rambling, character driven, and epic(IT, Tommyknockers etc.), Misery was the opposite.  This book is short and sweet and the perfect book for non-King fans to get into.  This also is the perfect book for a King first timer to pop his or her cherry.

Highly recommended for all readers.  If you're a King fan, what are you waiting for?  If you're a non-King fan, swallow your pride and give this book a shot.  You will not be dissapointed.  If you are neutral on King and were interested in maybe giving one of his books a read, start with MISERY.
