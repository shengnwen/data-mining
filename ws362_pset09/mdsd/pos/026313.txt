After I went to Florence and saw both the Pitti Palace and the Uffizi, I searched in vain for a coffee-table quality book on both- and was thrilled with these!
I have to admit I was a little put off by not having a picture or example of the book on amazon, but I took a risk. 
It is an excellent quality/heavy stock boxed set, with fabulous photos of not only the buildings, but the majority of the artworks and Boboli gardens.  there is even bonus sections of collectors glass, rock crystal pieces and commissioned jewelry by a variety of Medicis. the frontpiece/backpiece outline the Medici genealogy, and there are historical narrations throughout the book of the history of the pieces, art, and politics of the times.  Worth every penny, and an heirloom for any lovers of Florence.
