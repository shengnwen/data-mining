This is a very interesting book with practical advice for not just IT professionals and IT managers but also for 
other corporate/business professionals.  I was particulary intrigued with the chapter on IT Politics and the chapter on helping
IT people excel.  The concepts about politics, power, social capital, networking, negotiation, setting up of fully 
integrated performance management systems ... these are covered extremely well along with practical & useful advice
on applying them.  A book like this was long overdue for the rapidly changing IT industry.  In addition to being laced
with easily implementable practical advice, it is an easy & useful read. A must have on the book-shelf of any IT 
professional who wants to learn and who wants to make a positive difference to his/her organization. The best way to
climb that corporate ladder and have a fulfilling career is to read this book and apply what it teaches you
