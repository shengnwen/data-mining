I agree with a previous critic who complained about some of the omissions in this book.  Not only are the women from Fleetwooc Mac missing but so is Chaka Khan, the most influential female R&amp;B singer since Aretha Franklin!  But except for those omissions - and the author's apparent bias in favor of those women who let her interview them - &quot;She's a Rebel&quot; is the basic and essential text on women in rock.  At a time when the rock establishment continues to ignore women - the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has not inducted a single woman in several years - we need an author like Gaar to remind us of the contributions that women made and continue to make to our pop music.  A special salute to Gaar for including in her book the often-ignored, and mostly-unknown, &quot;womyn's music&quot;
