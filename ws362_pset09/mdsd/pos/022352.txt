This is one of her best books I have read.  I absolutley loved all her characters in the book.  The storyline between Dora and Jed was fantastic.  You could just sense Jed's pain when remembering his family and the discomfort of now knowing how to deal with Dora's family when first introduced to them (which by the way added a cute storyline on the side).  I recommend this book to other readers.
