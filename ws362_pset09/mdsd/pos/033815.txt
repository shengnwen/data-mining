The pictures in the books help memorize the kana pretty well. Although you have to use your imagination on some (like "E" is for "edible", didn't quite  get the pic at first) of them it really works. Although I wish this book were bigger in terms of size...since I'm always losing/misplacing mine...I guess it's perfect for when you're on the go. I found the charts of each Kana at the beginning and end of the book really helpful too. I'd definitely recommend this book if you want to visually memorize the kana, if you want to know how to write it (aka "stroke order") or the context in which some are used then you might consider getting other accompanying materials
