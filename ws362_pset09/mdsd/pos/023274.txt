I was impressed with the quality of the writing and organization of the story. I understand that this is Keith Donohue's first novel. It is certainly one that is unforgettable.

The story itself is haunting and very sad. The idea that a small boy can be kidnapped from his own family and instantly replaced by a fairy or "changeling" is frightening. The effect on the family who suddenly finds itself with a child identical in appearance but obviously different was, to me, terribly sad and tragic. 

The story is told through the eyes of Henry Day,a child taken from his family and replaced by a changeling. The years pass as Henry learns to live as a changeling with a group of other children who, like he, have been stolen from their families. 

I found myself hoping for a happy ending for this child (Henry) who remembered his old family with great longing and a desire to return to normal life. The ending left me surprised and emotionally drained. It was not what I expected.

The characters are well drawn and sympathetic. For those looking for a frightening and thought provoking fairy tale, this is it. But, definitely not for small children
