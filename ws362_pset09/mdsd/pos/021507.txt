I started reading this book yesterday, I didn't stop till I got to the end.  Being single for all 31 years of my life Ms. Smith has been able to express many of my feelings and frustrations in the pages of her book.  I appreciate how she continually drew from her own personal experiences, the experiences of close friends, the wisdom of other authors and from people who had e-mailed her over the years to clarify and make her points.  If your living the single life and your not happy, The Single Truth will help to give you the truth about being Single and the way to be content with your life, single or not
