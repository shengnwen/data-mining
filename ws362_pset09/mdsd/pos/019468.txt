This was a very romantic read - not quite as spicey as the bedroom scenes were rather weak and kind of awkward.  However the two characters were very endearing and you really can see a wonderful relationship developing between them.  Judith's children were adorable and Leander was quite taken by them.  One of the very best parts of this series is that Beverely always keeps you updated on the characters that were introduced before. This is one of the reasons I love this series so much - a little like the Cynster novels of Stephanie Laurens.  In Christmas Angel both Nicholas and Lucien are brought into the story in significant ways and it really solidifies the friendship of this company of rouges.  I love this series!
