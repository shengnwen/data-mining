John Gottman is a researcher and scholar.  His work is based on analysis of thousands of videotapes of volunteer couples in his Seattle laboratory.  The messages of the book are somewhat surprising.  They contradict much popular thought about "expressing your anger" in a relationship, and more mythical and New-Age widely held opinion.  Rather, he presents clear direction as to what works in a close relationship and what kills it.  He then gives steps to take to ensure that your marriage stays on track.  A good read.  The only negatives are that he writes in a wordy style, and thinks very highly of himself.  Maybe I would, too, if I knew as much as he does
