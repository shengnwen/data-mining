This is a great book for a very young child, I started reading it to my daughter at 1. It doesn't go into detail about a birthmother or the actual adoption process. In fact Choco looks for a mom like him and finds love in a family that is very different, but is very happy and loving. My little girl loves this book and enjoys the bright pictures of the various animals. I love that it opens the door to explain that loving families can look different from each other... and that is OK!!! I would highly reccommend this book to anyone that has a family blessed by adoption from any country.
