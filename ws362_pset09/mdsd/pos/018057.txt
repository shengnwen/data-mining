As a college logic teacher, I recommend this book. I divide my course into two major areas: formal and informal. Damer's book is perfect for the informal section. I find students are weary after learning about syllogisms (and "Barbara Celarent"). Informal arguments are much more common, and this book addresses 60 of the most common errors. The book is suitably brief for class use, with plenty of exercises to reinforce the detection and correction of the errors. After reading this book, watching political debates will never be the same
