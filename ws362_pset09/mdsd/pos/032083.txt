Hey, so just looking at the pictures just makes me want to get trashed. And it is very easy to, as author Ben Reed gives you the necessary steps to making these delectable drinks. The pictures alone make the book worthwhile. And even though mine don't look like that, none of my guests ever care, because its whats IN the drink, not what's on the OUTside of it. So, thanks Will for the pictures. And thanks to you Benny, for being a great bartender. A great book, highly recommended
