This book was so incredible words can't even describe it.  I finished it a couple of weeks ago and it still occupies a large amount of my thoughts. My sister is now reading this and I will get a copy for my mom and mother-in-law for Mother's day to educate them about where their grandchildren are coming from.

This is such a moving book, very emotional, but very informative as well.  I consider myself a fairly well-educated woman, but this stunned me.  It made me want to jump up and scream "What is going on and why aren't we doing anything to help?"

If you are thinking about getting this book, do it.  It will be a life-changing experience.
