Okay, this book is riotously funny in parts, with lots of human turmoil, but for pete's sake the author should get a grip. Hank, our narrator can be out of sorts in his negative spiral through chaos, but the author should do more than dump his tool box onto the floor. I lived that academic life, and that mockery is deserved. A cheer for that. But Russo again doesn't know when to stop. He's a great storyteller, but he goes long and takes in too much...introduces a key character in the last 20 pages of the book. Things like that bother me...a little like Tristan Shandy, does. Russo is a fine writer and brilliant at times, but not always wise. Perhaps Hank is a shadow self he can't deny.
