I bought the book because I know Jose Stevens' work and didn't think much about the title.  As I started to read the book, I was pleasantly surprised in the way Jose weaves together bits from his life story, lessons from his teachers and different techniques to pray (or connect with the Great Spirit).  There are prayers for almost every situation you can imagine - happiness, health, wealth, well-being, sleep, sorrow, pain, men, women, and many more. 
  The most powerful aspect of the book has been the sense of peace it has brought me personally.  I noticed almost right away that when I went to sleep, I was sleeping more deeply and peacefully if I had been reading the book just before going to bed.  A few times since then, I've had trouble going to sleep initially and tried the prayer techniques in the book and magically, sleep came within minutes. 
  This is a book that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of faith or religion and I highly recommend it.
