It seems to me that there is a very basic argument missing from the discussion about Under the Banner of Heaven: How is it that Joseph Smith (founder of the Mormon religion) can be considered legitimate to his believers and yet the main tenets he set forth for the religion are condemned by the LDS church and mainstream Mormons? It just doesn't make much sense--either the man was a prophet in communication with the Lord and what he said is held to be true, plural marriages, extreme racism, hatred of homosexuals and all, or the man was a serving-his-ego-to-the-point-of-starting-a-new-religion crackpot. So far in my reading, the evidence certainly points towards the latter. Is this how a religion gets started? A man with a bunch of charisma and and some visions in his head sees an opportunity to start a new religion, in this case where he can have sex with hoardes of women under twenty until he dies, the religion takes off, and a century and half later believers mulitiply exponentially (due in no small part to the mandatory reproduction and mandatory missions) all the while professing AND denouncing AND believing their founder? Wake up and smell the spell...Newsweek was right, this is the creepiest book to be written in a long time.
