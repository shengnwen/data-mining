I remember this poem from 4th grade (I am now 40).  Even to this day, I could recite the 1st four lines and I haven't read the poem since 4th grade....until now.  I now have a 3 yr old daughter and am searching for books to read to her above her age level.  Seeking to introduce her to various subjects, authors, etc.  Remembering this poem, I went specifically in search of it and found this book.  I LOVE it! And so does my daughter.  I love the gentleness of the illustrations, the little splash of color and the quietness it offers.  My daughter loves the color, the horse and various animals, and, as any child does, searching for the hidden animals in some of the pages.  When we sit and read this book, it's not just a one time reading.  It's at least 4 times.  I highly recommend this book not just for the literary benefit, but also for the little bit of quiet snuggling time you get........What can be better than that
