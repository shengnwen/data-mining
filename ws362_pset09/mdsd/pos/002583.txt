I just finished re-reading "The Little Sister" for the fourth time.  I highly recommend this book, and even more, I recommend reading the Marlowe novels in chronological order.  This will be my fourth time through the cycle.

I say "Marlowe is back," because Marlowe is absent in "The Lady in the Lake," the immediately previous book.  He is replaced by an unfunny sourpuss who calls himself Marlowe.  The wisecracks are few, and what few there are aren't funny.  Marlowe's wisecaracks ordinarily make me laugh out loud several times during a book.  I don't think I even chuckled at anything fake-Marlowe says in "The Lady in the Lake."

"The Little Sister" brings that wisenheimer back, just the way I remember him.  It's vintage Chandler and vintage Marlowe.  Marlowe novels have plots a dime-novelist could improve.  But these dime-novelists wouldn't have Marlowe's humor.  When Marlowe is in top form, I don't need much of a plot.  That's why I can read "The Big Sleep" repeatedly and still enjoy it.  I read it for the wisecracks.  I read it for Marlowe himself.

Which brings me back to "The Lady in the Lake."  Marlowe's humor is AWOL in that book, and therefore the plot takes center stage.  That's not a good place for a Chandler/Marlowe plot to be standing, what with Chandler's unnecessary reliance on preposterous coincidences to move most of those plots along.

Something must have happened to Chandler between the writing of "The High Window" and the writing of "The Lady in the Lake."  A nasty divorce, the death of a wife or child, alcoholism--something.  The Hollywood experience doesn't explain it.  I don't read author biographies, because I'm afraid I'll find something out that'll make me despise the author and I won't want to read his stuff anymore.  But I'd bet Marlowe lost his sense of humor in this period because Chandler did.

Thank goodness Chandler found Marlowe's sense of humor again.  "The Little Sister" is his most entertaining novel since "Farewell, My Lovely.
