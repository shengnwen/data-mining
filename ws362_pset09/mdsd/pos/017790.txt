  In a recent newspaper, in one day ...  Enron chief pleads not guilty, Adelphia execs found guilty, no retrial in stock scandal ... and this was just the front page of the business section. On that same page, I noted the use of the phrase, "ethically amoral." Have we finally reached a point where we can construct such phrases? Corruption, moral relativism, the meaning of "is," have you had enough?

   If you are looking for some insights into the problem and perhaps an alternative approach, here's your book, There's No Such Thing as "Business" Ethics. Maxwell writes, "...There's only ethics." Maxwell is right, and through interesting stories and common sense he argues for the adoption of the Golden Rule: Treat others the way you would like to be treated.

   I read this book in hopes to validate my own research for my book, Swapping Lies! I felt that perhaps my call for a return of honor to the workplace was a bit too much, too naive. I was surprised to read that I am not the only one who feels this way. Maxwell is calling for the Golden Rule! Many will consider the Golden Rule a bit nave in today's world, yet it is principle that successfully guides us in our business endeavors. A principled and focused leader is not nave. In fact they are a constant source of strength and confidence to all. Spend just an hour to read this book. It may change you and your company.
