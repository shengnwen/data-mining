Simple outstanding E. B. Sledge tells it like it was. A true testimony to the bravery and courage of the Marines in WW2. I grew up reading the dry WW2 books from Balentime Books. Numbers and stats. I loved it and grew up wanting to be like my dad. E.B. Sledge story is not numbers and stats. It is  the real life horror and courage of war. Reading his words will bring you to the brink and have you hooked. 
My father was a Marine who caught the tail end of WW2 and  fought in Korea. Just this last year has he been able to talk about it. I think I now understand why, thanks to men like E.B. Sledge. Semper Fi DAD and E.B. Sledge
