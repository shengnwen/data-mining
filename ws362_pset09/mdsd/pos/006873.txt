Ok so i am not one of those people that has a great attention span, mine lasts about 45 min tops and thats on a good day (15 on a bad day). But, this book (as well as all the other Southern Vampire Novel series)not only got my attention but held onto it like the "Jaws of life". Ill admit that the first book in the series that i read was DEAD AS A DOORNAIL and I got that at CVS while i was waiting, but i ended up finishing it in about a day and a half and as soon as i finished went out intending to get the DEFINITLY DEAD book and could not stomach paying $23 for a book, but was glad to see that there were other books that i should have read before that one, and ened up geting all the ones that they had out in paperback. i am not ashamed to say that it took me maybe a whole week to finish them all, and am reading them again (for the second time). my only complaint is ....WHY CANT PUBLISHERS PRINT PAPPERBACK COPIES WHEN THEY PRINT HARDBACKS!?!?!? But i geuss in my beating around the bush way i am saying that this are all GREAT book
