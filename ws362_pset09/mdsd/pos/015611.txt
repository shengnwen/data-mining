I will admit I have not completed the tome yet, but I am quite far into it, and I have read enough to know I can highly recommed this book. Its excellent.

For those who want a single volume dealing with the long war in Europe--which started with the French Revolution, and ended with the final defeat of Napoleon, this is it. 

Harvey has put together a wonderful book, which includes biographies of the important figures, anectotal information, and a well-written narrative.

His account of the French Revolution, and the rise of Napoleon is very well done. It goes from one step to the next, and explains how the Corsican rose to power. Many pages have been written about the rise of the dictator, but not many are any better than this. 

It was a fascinating--and complicated--time. Sorting it out is not always easily done. Mr. Harvey has managed it with great skill, and good writing. If the topic interests you, get the book.
