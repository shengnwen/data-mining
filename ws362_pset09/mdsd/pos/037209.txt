Richard Middleton convincingly argues in this well written book that the influence of Pitt during the war has been hyped.  Pitt showed no system for winning the war and his descents on the French coast were political expedients to avoid sending troops to Germany.  Pitt was not Prime Minister as the office did not exist.  Instead he worked as one of two secretaries of state, who, along with the Treasury, made up the ministry.  The book focuses on the politics and administration of the war, and not on the battles and campaigns themselves.  Interestingly, the author shows how historians before the early 1900s were sloppy, and how modern historians often rely on their work without doing their own proper investigation.
