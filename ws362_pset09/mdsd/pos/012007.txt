As an aspiring travel writer who has yet to publish anything, I turned green with envy on reading Bruce Chatwin's novel.  In terse, spare prose, he summons up images that seem drawn from photography or haiku rather than  from ordinary literature.  He presents distant times (late 18th and early  19th century) and places (Brazil and Dahomey) linking them seamlessly with  the steamy, sordid present---the paranoid military dictatorship of Benin in  the crumbling West African post-colonial 1970s.  Every page is redolent of  color, smell, sound, and imminent disaster: every scene appears like a bead  in a necklace of decay, corruption, cruelty and disaster.  There are no  wasted moments, no lagging sections.  A poor boy from the Brazilian  backlands becomes a rich, powerful slave trader in West Africa, but his  background betrays him at home, his connections in Africa ultimately do the  same.  His largely illegitimate family continues into the seedy Benin of  the present.      My only criticism of this work is that Chatwin chose to  concentrate solely on the Brazilian side of things, leaving the Africans as  part of the backdrop--more acted upon than actors.  Dahomey was a  fascinating society and besides the anthropological researches of M.  Herskovits, one can read Frank Yerby's &quot;The Dahomeyan&quot;, though  Yerby's prose pales in comparison to Chatwin's.  A far better book, one  which focuses on the Dahomeyan connection to Brazil as well, is Judith  Gleason's &quot;Agõtime&quot;, a possible antidote to the slant taken by  Chatwin.      Otherwise, this book contains superlative writing on every  page, writing redolent with human nature, the mysteries of the soul, and  the mundane horrors of much of human history.  &quot;The Viceroy of  Ouidah&quot; has the power to open periods and locations for readers that  have seldom featured in Anglo-American writing.  It is a stunning book
