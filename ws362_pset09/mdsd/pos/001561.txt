How have Arab political ideas and institutions evolved since the 1967 war? how have the Arabs contended with the external influences to which their wealth have exposed them? what does the rise of Islamic fundamentalism mean and what will it lead to? Ajami, director of Middle East Studies department at Johns Hopkins University, School of Advanced International Studies, seeks to answer these and related questions in his illuminated study of the constraints and possibilities facing the Arab world today. he documents the political and intellectual response to the 1967 defeat; surveys the choices facing the arab world exemplified by the case of Egypt; and seeks to explain Islamic fundamentalism, ultimately locating its roots in the failures of the dominant political atmosphere and ideology and the integration of secularism. emphasis is been given to specific events such as the assassination of Anwar Sadat, the Iranian revolution, the iran-iraq war and the persian gulf war
