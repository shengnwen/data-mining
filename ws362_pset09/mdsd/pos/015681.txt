I first discovered Nick Tosches when Creem magazine published his essay on Wynonie Harris way back when I was a kid.  I have been a fan ever since.  His writing is highly stylized.  Imagine a hard boiled crime writer waxing eloquently on rhythm and blues, the mob, and boxing and you have a taste of Tosches.  This book contains the sentence "It was like slipping wilbur into a thermos full of hot oysters."  That alone makes it worth the purchase price.  

I turn to Tosches' work again and again, for insights into music, and just for fun.  Buy this book and you will too
