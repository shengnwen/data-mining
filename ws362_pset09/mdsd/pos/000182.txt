In this book, Dennis Overbye contributes important history to the already crowded canon on Einstein.  That is no easy feat, but as he deftly demonstrated in his brilliant book, "Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos," Overbye has an uncanny ability to research and illuminate the human side of scientists and, in doing so, show us not only the human contribution to cold science but also scientific achievement in spite of the human condition. Overbye also has a nifty ability to explain complicated science to the layman--in this case Newtonian, relativistic and quantum physics--and he succeeds here reasonably well.  

What emerges is the portrait of a very handsome, sexy, playful, erudite, restless and headstrong physicist immersed in a world on the verge of two world wars and a revolution in our understanding of the physical universe. His passions in love were as strong and complicated as those he brought to both making sense of a world of physics beset by new empirical evidence at odds with traditional theory and a world of geopolitics being torn asunder. 

Overbye is at his best when illuminating the science and the politics of science, so the life-long sturm and drang of Einstein's love and domestic life become almost-tedious distractions by the latter third of the book, but overall this very interesting book should keep you enthralled from cover to cover.
