I was disheartened about this book before even picking it up. My first port of call was Amazon to read the reviews on the book. Numerous reviews made mention of the lack of Space Battles in the forth of the Honor Harrington saga. I'm reading these books for a Sci Fi, lasers flash'n, ships exploding, the good guys always win, fix.

I knew I wasn't going to get it with this installment.

This was the first book in 15 years that I read in a day. I couldn't put it down (having to surrender myself to the wrath of my disgruntled ignored wife afterwards).

This book starts to really show how much the characters are developing in the series, and how much the reader starts to care for the main players.

Might have to read the thing again whilst I wait for the 5th book to arrive from the States  :)
