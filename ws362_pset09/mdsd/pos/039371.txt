If you've gotten Ozawa's other books, then you already know how detailed his books get! This volume is no different and goes a step further by showing you actions in progress such as showing you each movement of a person walking. Then he shows you how to do the same action but at different angles and foreshortening. There's so much info in here that it'll take you awhile to digest all the information in it. It's stacked full of drawings and side notes!

There are quite a lot of action moves in this book, specifically hand-to-hand combat. No instructions on drawing weapons even though the cover shows them.

Quite unlike Martials Arts & Combat Sports and Illustrating Battles editions, this book prep you to think in 3 dimensions and animation-type movement. If you're set on making animations and video games in the future, this book is the best way to learn spatial relations and seeing your characters more than just one or two-dimensionally.

If you're into making manga, getting this book won't hurt at all but you're probably better off getting the Illustrating Battles or Martials Arts & Combat Sports book initially.

Like his other editions, this book is young-reader friendly and covers nudity well using block, wire, and wooden model figures.
