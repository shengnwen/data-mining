This book provides a more profound insight into Tibet for those interested in  Tibetan culture, trekking and adventure travel, than the others that are on the market. It is the most comprehensive guide- uniquely including the vast eastern regions of Kham, Amdo and Gyarong, as well as Ngari and Utsang. The book avoids the traditional steriotypes of Tibet and includes much information directly translated from original Tibetan sources as well as data derived from more than 50 fieldwork expeditions and trips in Tibet. The author, Dr Gyurme Dorje,  is a Tibetologist, who has been involved in Tibetan studies for over 30 years, and has authored several books on diverse aspects of Tibetan culture. His handbook has the advantage of being continuously updated
