Cohen has done an admirable job of putting together a history of the diplomacy regarding Israel's decsion to pursue a nuclear weapons capability. And herein lies the problem. This book should really be titled Israel, America, and the Bomb. Most of the book is dedicated to telling the story of Isreaeli/US diplomacy regarding Isreal's facilities at Dimona. Readers expecting to find any information on how Israel went about actually building the bomb, will be disappointed. Nonetheless in an age were most non-fiction reads like warmed over attempts at mimicing Tom Clancy, it was refreshing to read a well researched, well written, and most importantly well footnoted, work on a topic that is seldom written about. All in all, worth reading, but dont expect to find anything out about Israel's weapons capability or strategies for employment
