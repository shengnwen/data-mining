Joan Bailey does a great job of helping inexperienced people understand how to effectively train their own gun dog.  Her philospohy is both simple and fun -- basically the owner takes responsibility for exposing a pup to the situations that will allow him to develop his hunting instincts.  The rest is up to pup, and Joan assures readers that any well bred hunting pup will quickly begin to develop the traits he was bred to inherit.  There is little need for formal training early on, and it seems that if one follow's Joan's outline there will be a very strong bond between owner and pup by the end of the first year.  No negative responses or punishments in the critical early months.  

A less intense approach, to be sure, but one that will prevent inexperienced trainers from making serious errors that can cause problems down the road.  Joan tells readers what to expose pup to, when to do it, and how to go about it.  It is a training approach that focuses on encouragement and exposure, leaving readers with the option of additional, more formal training after the first year if desired.

All you need to do is explore some of the internet forums on training hunting dogs (particularly versatile hunting dog forums) and you'll see this book recommended far more frequently than any other.
