I've used it for a couple of years in a three-day introductory courses about OOA/D and the 'students' found it easy to learn. It's good because it softly introduces to the concepts of object orientation keeping in mind the fact that many people worked for years in a 'functional' way. Also good because you can use it every day while making analysis. In fact it's a manual. The two examples (one about an airline system and another about vehicle categorization) are developed together with the various aspects of the methodology and this helps to understand how to apply it. It's good also because it clearly separates analysis from design concerns. Of course now shows its age, but can be a good introductory book
