I remember reading this book several years ago and reading it on the bus and at school and before I went to bed. It brought me back to my childhood and the creativity and imagination I had as a child, and I'm sure several readers felt the same way. The story is fun and engaging, and so it makes a great bedtime story that you can read to yourself or to a child who still loves a good tale read out loud.
