This book should be required reading for anyone who takes up space on this planet we call earth. Being able to provide an Optimum Learning Relationship should be the goal of all adults that are in communion with the children of the world by their very presence or intent. We have for too long denegrated children and those that work with them. Children are the future and they deserve the best.  This book shows how the children can best be served and provides some hope for a better future for all living on the earth
