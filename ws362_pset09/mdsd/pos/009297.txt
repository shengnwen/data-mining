I read the book with each child we had [ 4 times].  I found it practical and common sense.  There are a lot of folks who buy into worldly philosophy and ignore the Creators values and means.  In no way does the book advocate violence.  Our children are now adults and are requesting copies now that the grandkids have come along.
