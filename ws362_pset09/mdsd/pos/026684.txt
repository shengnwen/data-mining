When I picked up my copy of Jonathan Spence's book &quot;Emperor Of China&quot; I imagined it would be a book I SHOULD read and might struggle to keep going about a third in. I was pleasantly surprised! The way Spence  has put together the material (16th and 17th century traditional Chinese  scholarship) in a colloquial and easy to read manner is almost astonishing.  It is more than readable, you can't put it down. The style, Spence says it  is &quot;an autobiographical memoir&quot;, draws you into the book and also  into the mind of the Emperor. I think I've learnt more about the Emperor  Kangxi in these 175 pages than I would if I had read a more detailed  historical account. The Emperor's wisdom is deep; buy, read, enjoy and  re-read
