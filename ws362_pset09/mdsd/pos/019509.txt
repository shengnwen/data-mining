Stephen Johnson is by far the most creative artist/illustrator of educational children's books alive.  He not only makes learning fun in Alphabet City and City by Numbers, but shows his remarkable talent as an artist.  His illustrations, for lack of a better word, are flawless as can  be seen clearly in the originals.  He does not bring the book down to a  child's level, but teaches them to appreciate art and learning at his  level.  He is completely remarkable and shows that it is rewarding to major  in fine arts in college even if you wish to be an illustrator.  No  illustrator could produce the quality work that he has produced.   Definitely buy this book.  You will not be disappointed
