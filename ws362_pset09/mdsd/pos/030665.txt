My mother got me my copy of Desperation Dinners a couple years ago because while I love to cook, as a busy college student I didn't usually have the time to prepare an elaborate meal.

Nearly every recipe in this book *will* be ready in 20 minutes. The exceptions are the recipes where you have to boil water; those can take up to 10 minutes more to prepare. The important thing to remember is that you have to keep moving. Of course, if you have someone helping you then things move along much faster.

I have enjoyed every recipe I've made using this book. The ingredients are easy to find and prepare, and you get a variety of flavors and meal types. Plus, the recipes are easy to modify if you need to.

I highly recommend this book as a starter cookbook for college students and new couples who want to do more in the kitchen but may not have the time for elaborate meals
