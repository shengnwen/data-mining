The information in this book is accurate and reliable.  I own many different ghost hunting books and I always find myself going back to reference this book.  I have even used it to help build my own ghost hunting website.  I recently purchased this authors new book, Book of Ghosts, and I was not disappointed.  It was a great advanced level ghost hunting book.  This writer knows ghost hunting.  His books are clear and precise and always have much more relevant ghost hunting information.  I have never written a review for any other product, but it is my pleasure to right these reviews for Mr. Brandon's books.  Keep up the good work
