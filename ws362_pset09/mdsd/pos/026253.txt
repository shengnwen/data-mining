Firstly, yes, if you're bound and determined to ride the Republican train into the ground, or if you're afraid of potty words, don't read this book.  It could say stuff you don't like.  Most the folks I know are real tired of that sort of holier-than-thou posturing.

On the other hand, I felt like I was reading a book one of my friends had written.  The narcissism gets a little grating, but that's what we're like.  That's the nature of the 30s 40s crowd.  The swearing... well, again, I don't know too many people who don't talk that way.  But the general sense of loss of purpose, of grandiose plans gone to hell, of plain old existential angst is far too familiar.  One day we all realize that if you look like a marketing guy, work as a marketing guy, and aren't actively writing, painting, acting, inventing, crafting, whatever-- guess what?  You're a marketing guy.

On a more practical level, it's one of those books that, as Julie herself describes, demonstrates all the possibilities out there to see a world larger than the one you'd settled into.  It's the kind of book that makes you think 'huh, wonder what I could dive into?'

It's funny.  I've laughed aloud while reading it.  It's maybe a bit longer than needed, but it's easy reading.  I'd definitely recommend it to chefs and foodies, but it's not really a food book as much as a "coming of age" back for those of us who have found ourselves making multiple return visits to ages that end in 0
