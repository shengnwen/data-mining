Although sometimes long-winded and with way too many wild examples for me to handle when it came to brutality (which was precisely his point), I liked this book a lot. I read it for a class, but I would've read it for fun. It goes into the depths of how racism has affected our country as a whole, be it through riots, murder, job prejudice, lack of progress, lack of companionship, lack of trust, poverty, and through celebrities.  This author goes into all realms of racism and in the end, proposes the same argument I supported for years.  I thoroughly agree with every point he has made, and I like his unique way of spreading about Reparations.
I heard him speak at my college and he was phenomenal. My teacher said he was humble. I don't know where she got that idea from because he was very in-your-face and I love that about him.  Any time someone speaks on a controversial topic, they have to be willing to stand by what they say and have relevant examples to back themselves up.  One of the ladies in my class said before he spoke that she felt this book "disrespected white people."  I totally disagree.  I think this book is just the truth that some are not ready to read
