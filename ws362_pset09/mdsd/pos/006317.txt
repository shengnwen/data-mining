But I would like to clarify to the readers a couple of things. One Eli wonders why army seargents are always so angry. Well, their stern attitudes are to keep their soldiers in check afterall their soldiers must not have cocky or lax attitudes when it comes to handling guns or tanks or someother powerful and being stern and angry is a way of getting the men to listen up and not disobey.

As for method acting (Eli's brand). Well, it was begun by Stanislavski in Russia in the early 1900's and despite undeniably helping some turn in good performances it has far too many downsides. Method actress Jo Van Fleet (whose in Eli's book) asked Kirk Douglas to really hit her for a scene in a movie so her reactions would be honest. No good! Method actors need to psych themselves up a lot before playing a role and find the character's motivation and if the method actor has little time between being told they got the role and doing the role they may not have enough time to either psych or motivate up for the role. Clearly not every actor can be a Stanislavski method one
