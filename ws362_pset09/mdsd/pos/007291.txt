Of all of Nora Roberts' books--and yes, I've read them all--this is my favorite.  It is undoubtedly her funniest.  I first read it six years ago.  I loaned it to a friend who forgot to return it, so I had to buy it again.  I'm on my fourth copy now, I've read it probably ten times, but I keep on loaning it out and reordering and re-reading.  

The characters are lovingly developed, and the dialogue quick and genuine.  

Dora, our heroine, is a gutsy gal who takes no gruff off anyone, especially her new tenant, ex-cop Jeb Skimmerhorn.  They're a recipe for great romantic sparks and hot sexual tension.  

This is truly Nora at her very finest.  I wish she'd write another just like it.  Or almost like it
