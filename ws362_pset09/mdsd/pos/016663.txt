I have read a few of Pete Dexter's books and after having watched HBO's version of "Deadwood," wanted to give this book a try.  Let me make this perfectly clear: I do not like westerns as a genre, in film or in prose.  

This book strays from HBO's interpretation (or vice versa) so please go into reading this with an open mind.  There will be differences if you are familiar with the HBO series.  The book is a standout for several reasons, but for brevity's sake I'll keep it...brief.  The story telling and language are vivid.  The humor is somewhat different and did have me laughing inappropriately-loud in public places.  Most importantly, the book and its characters convey complex emotions and ideas with relatively simple language -- a characteristic unique amongst any previous books that I have read.  A solid buy
