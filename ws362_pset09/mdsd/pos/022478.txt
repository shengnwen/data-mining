This book gives a solid foundation to learning the most important aspect  of the golf game -- the Swing.  Without it, I would probably still be  spending more time fixing divots on the fairway than enjoying the game of  golf.  Jones has some simple and effective techniques to develop the feel  of the swing. It's seems awkward at first (especially for those who have  learned to 'whip' their clubs) but once you get the feel of the club,  you'll be amazed at how fast your clubs gets the ball to your target.   Overall, it's not a band-aid solution, but rather a solid foundation to  build upon your game
