I'm sorry that the previous reviewers seem to have missed the point(s).  I felt like this story was trying to explain a lot of things.  Okay, so Rayven's character was not explained in the first two pages, but we discover as we go along why his personality is hidden.

Ash, as we know is a complex peronality.  Each character sees a different side of him; they may all agree on some points, but each has their own experience of how Acheron will or has responded to a given situation.  More of his true nature is revealed in each book.  I mean, why would he put up with the "heifer goddess" if he didn't absolutely have to?  And his dealings with Nick... Remember it has been said that the fates of those most closely tied to him are hidden from his vision.  Nick was his best friend, so his fate would especially be hidden from Ash.  I felt that it was Nick's inability to be blinded to some of Acheron's powers that gave their relationship a special meaning.  Would you really want to be able to control the fate/feelings of someone?  How would you know if what they are feeling about you is not just because you manipulated it, but what they really feel?

And as for Susan... I liked her character.  Who cares if her marial arts training came into play later in the book?  After all, she was trained by the Dragon, a Dark Hunter as well.  People react in different ways.  Some have to be guided to a feeling or reaction, but some just attack the situation verbally if not physically (Susan did both after she got used to her new perception of reality).

Give the story a chance.  Ms. Kenyon writes about men who had to lose something in the past, in order to gain something even more valuable in the present.  Her female characters have to be strong to defeat the Dark Hunters' pasts
