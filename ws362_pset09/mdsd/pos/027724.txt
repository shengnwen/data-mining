IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN is a collection of sayings not only by Jim Henson, but also includes some reflections about Jim Henson as well as sayings that Muppets Henson performed became known for saying.  The book was edited together by Jim Henson's daughter, Cheryl, and is divided into five different sections.

I am a huge Jim Henson fan.  In many ways, I was partly raised by Henson television:  SESAME STREET, THE MUPPET SHOW, FRAGGLE ROCK, THE STORYTELLER. Many of the ideals and principles that were taught and illustrated on these shows were things that my parents tried to teach me. They helped reinforce the way I was raised. Not only that, but these shows also had a profound effect upon my creative and imaginative skills.  Therefore, though I was very pleased with IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN, I was also slightly disappointed.

The book does contain many passages that Henson wrote that have never been available to the public before. However, IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN has just as many if not more sayings from people talking about Jim Henson and from things different Muppets have said.  The "Rainbow Connection" is one of my all-time favorite songs and THE MUPPET SHOW is one of my favorite movies. However, I was expecting more insight and actual writings from Jim Henson himself than this book contains. In that sense, it's just as much a book describing who Jim Henson was as a person as much as it tells what he was about.

Despite not having as much of Henson's original comments as one would like, the book is a wonderful collection of inspiration.  It is not a biography, but it is a terrific gathering of great quotes. Overall, IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN makes a wonderful gift for any Henson fan and for most Muppet fans
