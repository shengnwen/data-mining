kozol manages to do in this book, what he wasn't able to do in other books- simply love the children he was surrounded by.  in this work, you can truly feel him love the children of mott haven, and in turn, feel them love him.  you are given the awesome opportunity to appreciate unconditional love through his relationships with a host of characters from the community.  he is so no longer the outsider he seemed to be in AMAZING GRACE.  he has truly become a part of the community he once only studied
