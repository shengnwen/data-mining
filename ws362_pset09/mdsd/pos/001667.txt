    The Firm is a very interesting book that will grab you from the very beginning and keeps you going until the very end. Mitch McDeere is fresh out of college with his law degree from Harvard accompanied by his loving wife, Abby. Mitch is recieving tons of job offers because he was ranked third in his class at Harvard. After careful consideration mitch decides to take a job in Memphis that pays a lot of money. What both Mitch and Abby thought was a god law firm turned out to be the place that could ruin their lives. They haved to perservere and try to secretly get out of this law firm without being killed. They are very upset with their decision to work at this law firm but will do anything to get out of this very mysterious firm.

    I thought that this was perhaps one of the best books that I've ever read. This book had me reading from cover to cover as soon as I started reading. I just wanted to keep on reading more because it was so suppenseful and I wanted to find out what happened next. I thought that this was a good writing technique because he keeps you reading from front to back. All in all I thought this was a great book and would suggest it to anyone who likes reading suspenseful, on the edge of your seat books.
