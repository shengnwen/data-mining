I read the first paragraph of this book in the bookstore and I knew I had to buy it.  It hits you right off the bat and doesn't let up until the end.  I love all the contradictions this book has in store.  Everything in this book is so far-fetched. but so funny.  Go out and buy it. Its a must read for anyone who wants a good laugh
