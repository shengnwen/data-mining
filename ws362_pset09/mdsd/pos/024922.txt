Although I am a first time marathoner, I am an intermediate level runner, and especially enjoy the half marathon distance.  I bought this book to train for the marathon, and found it helpful.  One thing I did not like was the recommendation to run for minutes rather than miles.  I guess I'm enough of a mileage junkie and not good enough at judging pace that I found it disconcerting to have to guess how far I went.  Also, that way you have no idea what kind of pace you are on for the marathon itself.  The author has made the book easy to read and well organized (except for the training schedules)  If you are beyond the beginner level, save your money
