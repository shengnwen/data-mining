OK. I did the opposite, I saw the movie "Shooter" based on the book first and then read the book yesterday. I was really engrossed in the book, to the point that I was reading it as I walked from the university parking lot to my office. 

I don't usually read books in this genre. I don't see it as similar to Lee Child's work. Now admitting that, this book only had a few places where some of the prose was over the top. Besides that, I found engaging and made me want to finish the book as quickly as possible. 

If anything the Dobbler, the psychochiatrist, really annoyed me. And, I wonder if he was meant to or if the writing of that character just didn't work properly for me. 

I've since read two chapters in _Master Sniper_ and won't finish it. I just didn't "get" into it. I think the anti-semitic part of it was really bothering me. Maybe I'll re-start it next month?  

Back to _Point of Impact_ the book is worth a read. I think if you like Tom Clancy like books, you'll like this. I think the writing is better than James Patterson's work, too. 

I think I threw off some of my WS students when they came to my office hours and saw me reading this book. Hey, a woman has to read! And, I read most genres.
