After a mixed experience with LP's new edition for Morocco earlier this year, I hesitantly agreed to purchase another LP for my trip this summer to Brazil's northeast, specifically Salvador, Recife, and Sao Luiz. I was not disappointed.

LP continues to give budget travelers a good feel for the communities they enter, and in this case, has relatively accurate lodging and restaurant descriptions. While at times I wished for a fuller description of places other than their simply being another "quaint" and "small" fishing village, I never found myself cursing the book for leading me to a place I did not want to be in.

I would definitely recommend this guide, although its prices are already out of date due to currency fluctuations. A better option for future editions, I believe, would be for prices to be listed in the local currency, reals, rather than in dollars.
