I have recently been reading a lot of investment strategies and have been investing myself quite a bit.  Keeping that in mind I think the Gardners did a decent enough job of explaining the market and what to look for in a company for your portfolio.  Their techniques, the Foolish Eight, are useful and seem promosing.

I must say, though, that a lot of what they developed, or created, was simply a mish and mash of O'Neil and Lynch with a heavy backdrop of Fisher and Buffett.  This isn't to say it is bad, o contrar, it is quite useful.  But I would recommend reading Lynch, Buffett and Fisher before hand, with maybe some Graham, before you venture into this book.  This is the case because you want to have a good understanding of the market and the value investing of Buffett and Graham, as well as the growth investing of Fisher and Lynch.

With that in mind, their book does a very good job in bringing everything together and showing the reader the potential outcomes of various investment strategies.  One must always, and they even say this themselves, protect what is yours, and in this case it means don't dump all your money on a potential growth stock.  Take a small amount, say 10 to 15 percent, and the rest in value, large blue-chip companies.

When all is said and done, I would recommend this book.  It is fun and interesting and puts a lot into perspective.  The Gardners say so themselves, take their approach as well as others and find one that works well for you, perhaps mixing and matching.  But, to finish, no matter how you invest, always, and I mean always, carefully look at the financials before you dive in.  

I would recommend
