I totally agree with Theodore Dalrymple's central thesis.  Let's stop describing abusers of mind altering drugs as addicts.  This implies that they are helpless victims.  No, these individuals are childish manipulators, if not outright criminals,  who minimally require tough love or even a jail cell.  Many employed in the so-called helping professions lie to themselves.  They also, at a gut level, want to do little that might threaten their way of putting bread on the table.  Treating "addicts" can be turned into a financially rewarding career.  Some may even think that drug abusers are actually victims of capitalist exploitation.  Whatever, the latter are not expected to possess self discipline over their appetites.   Occasionally romanticizing them as avant-garde iconoclasts adds to the problem. Are they truly the deviants---or are we who substantially adhere to the cultural norms of a civilized society?  Pathetically, there are highly credentialled people who are unclear on this most important point.  

The sad thing is the author is the exception in his field.  I'm convinced that we will not get a handle on this problem until his views become the ho-hum norm.  Will the post modernist intellectual establishment help Romancing Opiates: Pharmacological Lies and the Addiction Bureaucracy rise to the top of the best seller lists?  Don't hold your breadth.  Regrettably, Theodore Dalrymple's book is perhaps doomed to be a "seminal work" that won't be fully appreciated for many years into the distant future.
