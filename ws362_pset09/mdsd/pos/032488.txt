I have read all of Kathy's book they all tell you something.This was by no means my favorite.But there was good stuff in it.There are lot of material on this subject in print.I've read some of it.On a personal note I like a straight-forward murder any day.I hope she moves Tempe & Ryan's together for good they make an excellent couple.And tell us what Tempe status is with her marriage.I went to Montreal last summer and went to all places in the books. Great fun, very cool city
