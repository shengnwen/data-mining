I am a college student studing Education and I read this book for my class.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who maybe interested in becoming an educator.  I truly enjoyed reading the personal stories of each  teacher interviewed. However, the the most impressing part of the book for  me was the whole new prespective on intergated schools that I gained.   Being fairly young, I have only attended integrated schools before and I  have also only been told positive things about this change.  Realizing what  actully happend to black students and teachers from personal stories has  really given me a new outlook on this topic.  If I could find anything that  I didn't like about this book, it was the introduction.  It was very long  and almost all of it was repeated agin in the text of the book
