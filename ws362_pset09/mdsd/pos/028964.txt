A personal book like this really depends on the appeal of the author herself - and here one hits the jackpot. Charmian Carr is so charming, sensitive, and modest that you can't help loving her through the book. 

I had no idea the book would be this enjoyable.

This is a wonderful tale with five interwoven threads: 

i) what it was like for a 21 year old working for a doctor in the San Fernando Valley - and who'd never done any professional acting, dancing or singing -  to work on a movie that would gain the highest box office of all time and become a phenomenon around the world - wonderful details and anecdotes of the making of the movie, the comparison of the story with the history, 

ii) the experiences of others working on the movie, as Ms. Carr truly put a lot of work into this book, reaching out to everyone to ask about their experiences, their anecdotes;

iii) AMAZING stories told by people around the world who've been affected by the movie over the years;

iv) the experiences of the cast since the making of the movie - those playing the von Trapp children stayed very much in each other's lives over the years; and

what I found most affecting:

v) the highly dramatic and in many ways quite tragic story of Charmian Carr's own growing up - particularly the story of her show business mother and father, as well as that of her sisters (you probably know beautiful younger sister Darleen from so many television series and mini-series) and their children. 

What a great book - it's impossible to put down - and so acutely sensitive, so warm, so candid, so funny.
