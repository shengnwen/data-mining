I won't argue with detractors. Literarily, Ishmael is laughable. The narrator is an undoubtable caricature, and Quinn is some impressed with his anthro-philosophical platform that he's failed to present a well-formed narrative. In a way, the book reads like  a draft. It is too impressed with its premise, and is too eagerly shouting its message to really be taken seriously as a work of fiction.

This is evident by how Quinn decided to end the novel. I can literally see the wheels spinning and his desperation mounting as he mentally screams, "Oh, god. How in the sweet hell am I to end this thing?"

And thus, the last six pages were born.


That said, this novel works great as any piece of writing should. That is, it acts as as a wonderful bit of food for thought. Yes, it often deals in terrible absolutely. Yes, it's preachy. Yes, there is no valid counter-arguement presented. Yes, there is no character development and there is no climax to the plot. But, the premises are thought provoking. But, and as always, do not expect a visionary. Read and enjoy, or do not
