This book lays heavy as most coffee table books do.  But it does not weigh  heavy with mass, but with the knowledge and mastery of an American artist  who set the standard for those who strived for excellence.   With an  introduction written by Norman Rockwell, an account of his life and his  works are the focus of this book. The splendid imagery and skillfull and  constructive drawings of the human figure are a favorite to teachers and  students alike.  For the non artist, it is a book filled with wonderful  illustrations that captivate the eye.    A must buy, for any collector or  artist
