I have been reading romance stories for the last three years, and just as I was getting tired of them, Nora comes with something different!  It was an entertaining book to read.  I particularly liked the timeline that she did following the main characters through years to develop the story line.  It was also exciting to watch the two romantic heroes to "narrowly" miss each other over the years and to see them finally met.

In this book, there is more dynamic plot than in some other Nora's books.  If you read "Black Rose" you would know what I mean.  It seems that sometimes Nora has pages and pages of the pretty much the same "stuff" and it feels like she is just trying to fill the pages to get the book to the publisher.  Not in this one.  Sure, there are some repetitions, such as you get to read about the family being established in the community, being close, loud and helpful to each other.  But it does not get to the point that you see the same sentences over and over again.  And in my experience, some of her books do get that.

I'm glad this book was published in summer, because it made for a perfect book to read on vacation.  And once again, she did not dissapoint with a slightly different style than her other books.  Well done
