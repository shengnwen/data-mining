As a career counselor, my clients often ask me a lot of questions about interview techniques.  This book answers all of them, from how to dress, how to act, how to respond to difficult questions, how to address gaps or  other problems in your work history, and so much more.  This is the best  guide I have come across for such information, and I consistently recommend  it to my clients who want to cover all of their bases
