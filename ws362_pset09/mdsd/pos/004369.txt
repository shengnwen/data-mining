People, do not bother with ANY other books on breastfeeding!  I swear this is all you'll need!  I tell everyone that I wasted a bunch of time with La Leche League's guide, and all those others out there, even Dr. Sears (just get his Baby Book instead)... And I feel like short of mastitis, I went through it ALL!  And no one, NO ONE, will tell it like it is with regards to THRUSH, which I really battled with -- in fact no other books, pamphlets, you-name-it, even TOUCH the subject, which really afflicts SO MANY women!  and it is curable and DOES NOT have to mean the end of your breast-feeding days! Nothing really does!  read DR. JACK and you'll see!  Then you'll be buying this book for everyone else like I've been doing ever since
