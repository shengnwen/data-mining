This book is a superior example of American wit and wisdom.  HOW TO MARRY MONEY has improved my poise and confidence as well as the quality of my companionship.  I recommend it highly to all women from 18 to 80.  It's also the perfect graduation present for women on their way to do great things.  Read it!  Learn it!  Live it
