This story is about the Pyes (Rachael, her brother Jerry, Mama, Papa, Gracie, Uncle Benny, and Ginger) who go on vacation so Papa ,a famous ornithologist, can figure out what a puffin is doing there. His bad memory gets him in a lot of trouble very early on in the book. Little did he know he wouldn't get much work done due to an abandoned kitten left on their cabin's door step. Pinkey Pye they called her, who would do anything just so someone will say she's cute. Mama brought plenty of coats (even though it was 90 degrees outside) just in case they were walking along the beach and a snow storm arived and matches in case they got lost. Her motto is "Be Prepared." Uncle Benny is Mama's brother even though he is 5 years younger than Rachael and Jerry(Mama's children). He wonders how his crickets are vanishing one by one. He is on a never ending quest to stop sucking his thumb. Gracie is a grumpy old cat who feins boredom through out although she is very interested in a creature lurking in the shadows of the attic... Ginger is the clever dog, but feels a little left out when Pinky steps into the picture. Will her jelousy overcome her common sense? Filled with laughs. Some of the suspence in this book will keep you laughing and crying over their detailed antics. I recommend reading Ginger Pye before this one though. All in All a good book
