While the illustrations are simply luscious, with extraordinary detail and humor, the text is simple enough that my 5-year-old "reader" can read it to her younger brother.  They also love us to read it to them, and we pore over the illustrations to see what hidden treasures they can find.  My children especially like the ending (they cheer!), when the young page thinks of the simple, common-sense solution that all of the grown-ups, with their ruses as elaborate as their clothes, could not.
