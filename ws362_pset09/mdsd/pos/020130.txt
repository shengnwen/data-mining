After reading many, many homeschooling books, I can honestly say this is the one that is well marked, underlined and has it's own place on the shelf.  David Guterson is a masterful writer who describes both sides of the education coin - public verse home education.  His chapter on socialization is thoughtful and interesting.  I appreciate his non-emotional writing style that is educated and well balanced.  If I had read this book before my eldest entered kindergarten, we would have started homeschooling years ago.  The Family DOES Matter - and that is why education at home makes sense.  I wish more politicians would read this book and stop giving lip service to the family - and help Americans educate their children with more ease - be it in public schools, homeschools or a mixture of both.  Well written!
