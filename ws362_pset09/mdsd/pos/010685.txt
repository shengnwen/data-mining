I have owned this book for over one year, but have put off reading it in favor of others because I can not claim to be a boxing fan.  I finally reluctantly started to read it, and found it to be so interesting I finished it in three days.  The book's main focus, of course, is on the two fights between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling.  Although Louis won the heavyweight title in defeating Jack Sharkey he knew he wouldn't be recognized as the true title holdler until he avenged a previous loss to Schmeling.  Author David Margolick provides ample and interesting prefight hype and postfight reaction for both contests in addition to sports and movie celebrities' interest.  Margolick skillfully weaves the attitudes of African Americans and Jews along with the racist attitudes of the American South in regard to the matches.  Comments from several newspapers citing the stereotypes popular at the time are also provided.  Finally Louis's and Schmeling's role during World War II and post war life is also provided.  I felt this book provided me with a taste of what life was like between America and Germany during this time period.  Boxing fan or not, I feel you are sure to enjoy the book.
