Juniper, Arizona is an almost idyllic western small town.  One day when Bill Davis is out jogging he notices that one of the most scenic meadows is being demolished to make way for 'The Store.'

The Store is a Wal-Mart-type of establishment that promises low prices in just about everything.  It co-opts local officials, uses tactics to drive local competition out of business, and ultimately comes to control the town of Juniper.

The upshot is The Store is more than a corporation, it is in itself a living being, with the ability to literally suck the life out of the world (dead animals abound at the construction) and even can convert humans into undead 'night managers'

The other aspect of this story is that it is also somewhat tongue in cheek.  It parallels the South Park episode that deals with 'Wall-Mart.'

In addition to the undead night managers the store also can corrupt people directly.  Teenaged kids can somehow find illegal firewaorks, for example.  The scene where the elderly woman somehow managed to wander into shelves of 'personal marital aids' along with a typical helpful clerk explaining the advantages of each was quite funny.

As 'tongue-in-cheek horror' (an odd combination I know) The Store works quite well.  The latter third of the part does begin to drag, it doesn't all tie together well at the end, and the ending is weak (though moderated somewhat by a cute epilogue) and can't get a 5-star rating for these obvious flaws.

Still, it is quite amusing, and if you or someone you know has a dislike for Wal-Mart, you will enjoy this book.
