This book is an interesting read and the results of Dr. Stanley's studies are thought provoking and lead readers to believe anyone can be financially successful.  The book, however, is about twice as long as it needs to be.  The author is incredibly repetitive.  The reason I gave the book four stars is because the information Dr. Stanley repeats so much is interesting
