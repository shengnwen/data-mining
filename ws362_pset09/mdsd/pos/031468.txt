As a serious photographer just now getting into digital, this book has been a godsend, clearly explaining and providing useful context to the often daunting new world of digital workflow issues. The all-color approach with plenty of photographic examples is an added, eminently useful benefit. I'm a Mac-based guy, but this book is platform-agnostic. Bottom line: When it comes to real world digital photo issues, Timacheff and Karlins cover it all beautifully.
