Going back that far into history requires some imagination.  Thomas Cahill had some very interesting views on what could have happened back then.  He rightly points out that Abraham lived a couple of thousand years before the bible as we know it, was actually written down.  He made some points in it that forces me to go back into the old testament and reread some printed oral traditions that were put on paper at the time of Moses.  Historically, there are still many questions as to what happened 3000 years ago.  Heck, we are still speculating about King Arthur and the round table!  I thought it was an interesting read, provoked some thought, and he had some points that do make sense.  After all, historians keep telling us that history repeats themselves.  Maybe he's just trying to prove that point with today's international sagas
