This book follows the life of Galahad, Lancelot's son, from early childhood until he is an adult. Galahad is on a quest to secure three relics for Britain, a grail, a spear, and a sword. If he does, Britain will be forever invincible. In the beginning of the book, Galahad is intolerant, self-righteous, misogynistic and lacking in compassion. Through flashbacks to his childhood, the author allows us to understand why he became this way. Although there are battles, this book is less an adventure story than it is the story of one man's transformation. By slow degrees, Galahad comes to a better understanding of the world and especially of his father, Lancelot. He is finally able to be the great knight he had already believed he was. Nancy McKenzie does an excellent job portraying this transformation and making it real and believable for the reader. If you are looking for bloody battles, you may be disappointed, but if you like Arthurian legend and enjoy a well-written story with complex characters, give this a try
