First, I should point out that I am not Jewish; nor am I an expert on Judaism.  I read this book because I wanted to learn more about Judaism.  So, I am not qualified to comment on the accuracy of the information in this book; nor am I in a position to tell if the writing is objective or biased towards a particular viewpoint.  All I can comment on is how informative and how "readable" the book is.

The aim of the book is to give an overview of Jewish religious doctrines, in all of their complexity and variations.  And they ARE quite complex and varied.  The author devotes a lot of space to discussing the various ways that Jews have understood their religion throughout history.  He addresses the many doctrinal debates and competing perspectives within Judaism; and appears to do so fairly evenhandedly (though, again, I am not really in a position to judge his objectivity).  The book is packed full of information.  In fact, it almost has too much information (if that is possible).  It's very informative; but it can be rather dense at times.  I often found myself having to re-read certain paragraphs in order to fully digest the information.   This is not light, casual reading for someone who is only mildly curious about Judaism.  I would recommend it only for those who have a strong interest in the subject.

But it IS very informative.  I feel that I have learned a lot about Judaism from reading it; so I'm glad I got the book.  On the other hand, it's so densely packed with information that my brain just can't seem to process it all into an orderly framework.  I'm still not quite sure I fully understand what Jews believe.  But I know more than I did
