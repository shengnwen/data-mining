Forget Wild at Heart! Buy this book instead. It calls for radical discipline as the means of pursuing godliness in every area of life. With a good blend of biblical teaching, true-life stories, and practical advice, Hughes leads men to embrace the spiritual sweat necessary in following Christ. I like this book so much that I'm currently leading the men in our church through this study. It's one of (if not the) best books for men on the Christian market today
