I was required to read this book this past year as a school assignment. First off it's rare for such a new book (it was only published 14 years ago) to be a school assignment (well at my school it is). I suppose that says something for this book. It's the easiest read but not bad. Rather boring in places. It leaves a lot of the story up in the air a little which I didn't like so much, and I definably found the end rather rushed. All in all, not my favorite book, but a good book in general.
