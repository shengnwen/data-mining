I have mixed feelings about this book.  On the one hand, the author makes excellent points about the origins and function of depression:  how it can  be a wake-up call, a learning experience, or the body's way of ensuring  that someone gets the rest and the caretaking he/she needs.  I also felt  that his &quot;holistic&quot; approach to depression is right on:  One of  my best friends leads a life that would depress the cheeriest soul alive,  and takes massive doses of Prozac to cope with it.  While she had problems  with depression long before she painted herself into this corner, I think  the drug is just suppressing the anger and frustration that might stimulate  her to get out of it.  On the other hand, several chapters struck me as a  sales pitch for St. John's Wort, and I have some real problems with that:   the potential for abuse, the dangers of self-medication and unpredictable  dosages, etc.  In general, I think the book has some excellent advice for  depression sufferers, but I'd advise readers to view the St. John's Wort  sections with extreme caution
