First, let me state that I totally disagree with the previous bad review of this book.  The book is not hard to read by any means, but to fully understand and comprehend this book you need a solid background in Marxist theory.  I found the book to be very enjoyable and enlightening.  The first half the the book, based on Taussig's on research on devil pacts and baptised banknotes in Columbia's Cauca Valley, is very good.  The second half of the book, based mainly on the research of June Nash on the "devil-worship" of Bolivian miners, does not flow as well.  It seems to be a bit jumbled, but nonetheless has some interesting ideas and is worth reading.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in Marxism and religion or the anthropology of religion
