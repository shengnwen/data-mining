Inspiring. Entertaining. A veritable cornucopia of romance-generating ideas. These words accurately describe Joy and Kevin Decker's delightful book, "Romantic Antics." What's more, this amazing book actually does deliver exactly what the authors say it will. . . "Creative ideas for successful first dates, adventurous Saturday nights, and Playful Long Weekends."

Joy and Kevin Decker's book is superbly written, and the stories of their romantic antics, starting from their courtship to marriage and beyond, beautifully illustrate how to incorporate a sense of romance into any stage of a relationship. I wholeheartedly recommend "Romantic Antics" to anyone who is looking for ways to whip up romantic magic in their quest for lasting wedded bliss.
