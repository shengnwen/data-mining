I bought the book and the DVD and I am thoroughly impressed with the level of detail Alan goes to in both. Anyone who has seen a demo of Alan hitting the speed bag knows he is exceptional at this skill, but what became clear to me after reading the book and watching the DVD is that he is equally skilled at teaching novices how to master the techniques and nuances of the speed bag.

I would recommend that you buy both book and DVD, as they support one another quite effectively. Watching the DVD took the mystery out of several techniques that I had been struggling with for a long time. I can honestly say that after watching the DVD once, my skill level at a couple of the more difficult techniques improved greatly. 

One of the best benefits of buying this training course is that you can ask Alan questions on a forum he set up specifically for speed bag enthusiasts;

speedbagforum.com

Alan and others will answer all of your questions and I learned a lot simply by reading the older threads that contained many of the same questions or discussed some of the same problems I was having.

I think the combination of the book, DVD and the coaching you can get on the forum is superb and I commend all three to anyone who desires to become a highly skilled user of the speed bag.

Semper Fi,
