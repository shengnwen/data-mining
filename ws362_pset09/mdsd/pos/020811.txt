The Looming Tower is a very good book about the modern beginnings of Islamic radicalism.  The book's timeline starts in 1948 with the banishment of an Egyptian to America and progresses to the childhood of Ayman Al-Zawahiri and Osama Bin Laden and their transformation to Islamic fanatics.  Wright presents some of the individuals pursuing Al Qaeda, including one who wanted to kill Bin Laden but was denied, and another who wanted to arrest him.  I watched the interview with Lawrence Wright on Amazon.com and after reading his book was left with the opposite impression about the war with Islamic radicalism.  His take was that we are creating more terrorists by fighting them while my belief that radical Muslims are motivated more by idealogy rather than as a result of our actions or any other country's was reaffirmed.  It seems that they are driven by a desire to bring about worldwide Islamic domination.  This book  is well researched and easy to read.  I enjoyed this book for the history of Al Qaeda and would recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about Islamic radicalism
