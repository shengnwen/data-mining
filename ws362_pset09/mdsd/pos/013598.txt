format, and as you read through them you glean all manner of answers from the afterlife. If you're reading them in conjunction with current research on past life therapy, life between lives regression, and even ancient writings, the cases that John presents support the theory of the immortal soul, Karma and pre-destiny for soul growth. Otherwise, if you're reading John Edwards for comfort and reassurance that the soul personality exists indefinitely and stays in contact with this human existence, his case studies more than satisfy. Read Gordon Jones and Michael Newton as well and they'll change the way you view death and the afterlife
