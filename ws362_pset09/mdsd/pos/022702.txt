This is a good book with engaging and thorough review of each of his operas.  The reviews are so detailed that it would be outstanding study for any team planning to perform these operas.  A moderate list of references is provided with references noted in the text.  There is a good index.  There is a recording with excerpts from recent performances.  The thing I like best about this book is that all the CD, DVD and book references include very recently released works so this book is very up-to-date.
