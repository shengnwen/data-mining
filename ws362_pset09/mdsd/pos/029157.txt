Psalms Of David is one of the most beautifully illustrated versions of the Book Of Psalms. 
It was done by James S Freemantle as a gift for his wife Clara,whom he married in 1906. His years of work produced wonderfull drawings of things he saw in his travels through India. 
Drawings of storks, flowers, temples, holy sites and the writing itself make this book not only interesting but also great eye candy. 
I have so far purchased 4 copies of this book and given them as gifts, everyone loved it. 
I plan on giving more copies as Christmas presents.
You can't go wrong with this one!
