Buzz Aldrin and John Barnes wrote the long, but quite thought-provoking science fiction story &quot;Encounter with Tiber&quot;.  At almost 600 pages, it takes a reader at least a couple of days to trudge through the story, especially the early highly technical parts of the story.  Aldrin essentially predicted commerical space travel, and from the news, we may not be far off from the scenerio that Aldrin and Barnes present here.  The story is told through five different narrators with three humans at various points in the 2lst Century, and two &quot;Tiberians&quot; who came to Earth(or as they called it Setepos) in ancient times.  Basically, the message is that science and space exploration takes time and commitment, but it's worth pursuing.  The novel leaves the reader wanting more, as Clio(an astronaut traveling in the late 21st Century) discovers that her journey is just beginning.  It leaves room for a sequel, which depending on your attitude towards the story is good or bad.  I enjoyed this rich novel, and recommend this for anyone who really wants to know why we should try to go to Mars
