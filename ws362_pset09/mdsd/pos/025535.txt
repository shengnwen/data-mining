The funny thing about that book is - Rupert (the guy telling the story) is so horny that it's hard for him to think about another thing than to stare at (or if possible under) the bikinis of the girls which are with him on the trip to a lonely island.
He's still horny, even when man after man gets killed in a very brutlal way and it becomes clear that he is the next on the killer's list . . .

After a few pages of the book you won't stop reading because it's really thrilling an (as I wrote above) very funny sometimes.
It also has some sudden and unexpected turns during the story.
The whole story is great, from the beginning up almost to the end.
But it seems to me that Laymond was in a hurry when he finished the book - I was not really happy with the end.

Nevertheless - I can recommend it; everyone who likes thrillers will love this one!
