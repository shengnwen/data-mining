This is a good book designed for the friends and family of eating disorder sufferers.  Before I gave this book to my familiy, I read it myself.  I liked that the authors suggested therapy/counseling for friends and family, who can sometimes feel helpless watching their loved one suffer with an eating disorder.  There was also a lot of focus on parents.  That's good for many, but my family is not a problem in my case.  When I gave this book to my family, I told them to ignore that chapter since it did not pertain to us.  The information provided within the book helped my family understand what I'm going through, and for that I am thankful.  I didn't know how to get the words out to explain the eating disorder.  This book helped me tell my family of my disorder
