The Metamorphoses is an excellent work and Mandelbaum does a great job of translating.  The book is full of the ancient greek myths of hero's, gods, and regular individuals.  While not as readable as Homer or Virgil, Ovid gives a great account of many of the ancient myths.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Greek Mythology
