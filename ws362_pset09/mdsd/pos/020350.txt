If you have read the White Book or anything by Ramtha, you can see that some concepts are brought up again and again (in different helpful ways, but still...) This little book has new concepts and, by the way, a direct intersection with Seth's teachings: While we are manifesting our future, our past is actually re-written. This helps explain why "living in the NOW" should be your only focus - but you won't have to bear hearing it in that recently over-done cliche. Ramtha actually explains the concept, instead of using it as a mantra. I would have to say that this book makes many concepts make sense. I now think of time as being in a bow-tie shape. The knot represents the NOW and the past and present both fan out into the many possibilities. This book is well worth the time and money to get this knowledge into your head, with Ramtha explaining it MUCH better than many others
