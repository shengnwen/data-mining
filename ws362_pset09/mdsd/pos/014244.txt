This is an excellent book if you are looking for well written, sound advice on Project Management and what being a Project Manager is all about. The author used humor and very mild sarcasm in alot of the sections, which makes the book alot more entertaining and easier to read than most dry books of this nature, and serve as 'memory-hooks' to help you remember the message intended by that text. I would highly recommend this book
