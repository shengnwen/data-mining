Wonderful details on all pages, however, my eager-to-learn daugters found the amount of cutting required to be a bit tedious. Nevertheless, if you are looking for an historical accurate rendering with a built-in activity to fill some time, you can't go wrong with this book. I suggest that teachers do the actual cutting before hand, laminate the figures, and store all the pieces the way you would a file folder game. This would certainly make play time much more enjoyable for the children.

Enjoy!
