Mary Lawson's "Crow Lake" takes place in a gritty little farming community in northern Ontario.  The Morrison and Pye families live parallel tragedies, each aware of the other's dark lives, but too consumed with their own problems to effectively intervene.  The narrator is Kate Morrison, a frustrated and frustrating character if ever there was one.  Orphaned at a young age, Kate achieves success in academics and escapes south to Toronto.  But she never overcomes the guilt of leaving behind her older brother, whose sacrifices and unfulfilled potential are the ultimate burdens in Kate's life.

Across the road are the Pyes, who find no escape from the paternal abuse passed down from generation to generation.  The Morrisons and Pyes interact only minimally through most of the story, but their lives predictably intersect near the end.

Lawson makes it difficult to like "Crow Lake".  There's little to be optimistic about, the circumstances skate at the fringes of plausibility, the narrator is trapped in emotional la-la land, the surroundings are an acquired taste, and the resolution at the end is wispy at best.  But with the right frame of mind, the book can probably be enjoyed.  "Crow Lake" is a tough and reasonably well paced story which doesn't pretend to offer any neat or happy endings.  Dive in on a dark and rainy day, with a somber state of mind, and you'll come through without being disappointed
