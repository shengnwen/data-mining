This classic western takes a raw and realistic look at frontier justice and mob mentality.  Author Walter Van Tilburg Clark (1909-1971) shows how easy it is to be caught up in the mentality of a howling mob with its inherent peer pressure, not to mention the difficulty and often danger of trying to reason with or stand up to such a mob.  The OX-BOW INCIDENT involves of group of westerners in 1885 that turn to vigilantism after hearing that their friend has been killed by cattle rustlers.  The men form a posse and ride out of town determined to avenge this despicable crime.  The posse soon comes across three men that may be the perpetrators, but the evidence is far from certain.  At this point the vengeful posse becomes a kangaroo court - despite some dissent - disdaining judges and the court system, not to mention the idea of taking their captives back to town to stand trial.  Instead the mob simply hangs their captives from the nearest trees.  Sometime after this rash act this vigilante group discovers that they've indeed done wrong.   

I gave this solid 1940 novel just four stars because it drags a bit in places, but it carries a very valuable message.  The OX-BOW INCIDENT was soon adapted into a very good 1943 movie with Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews and Anthony Quinn.
