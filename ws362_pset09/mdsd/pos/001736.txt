I'm SO glad I heard about this book when I did.  I have a 15 month old son and getting all of this insight so early will help me along the way.  I will refer to this book often.  
It is very insightful and down right brilliant!  I wish all parents of boys could read this book.  The world of boys would be a much happier place
