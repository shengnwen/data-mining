The novel begins with unexpected violence in Edinburgh, spooling out a dissociated cast of characters who are tied together by the vaguest of circumstances, the result an ingenious, collision-packed adventure. A car accident; an assault on one driver by another wielding a baseball bat; a threatened witness; a young woman who may or may not have drowned; one man bludgeoned to death in lieu of another. All these things happen so fast that no one links them together until one police inspector literally trips over the coincidences.

The cast is varied: the crooked real estate developer now lying comatose in the hospital, victim of a heart attack in a motel room with a paid companion; his over-the-hill wife, quite aware of her husband's financial chicanery and random adulteries, planning her own escape for years by stashing cash in the basement; Louise, the police inspector, whose teen-aged son has turned into a primeval monster with the advent of adolescence; Martin Canning, a reclusive writer with no personal life; "Honda Man", a huge, baseball bat-toting brute; his first victim, Paul Bradley, whose valise contains an artfully hidden pistol; and Jackson Brodie, the unsuspecting hero, ex-cop, ex-PI, recent millionaire, who has come to Scotland with his girlfriend du jour, an actress.

As the bodies multiply, the plot thickens, the reader treated to inside information that eludes the protagonists, who continue to crash into each other like pin balls. There is a certain logic compelling the story line, people's paths intersecting more and more frequently, the threat increasing exponentially until it all comes to a head in one massive conflagration, the major players all on the same stage, the monster in their midst expelled by the least aggressive of them, the shy writer, who, until recently, has spun out more exciting events in his head than the numbing banality of his lackluster days. Although a bit anticlimactic, the ending befits this amusement park ride of geeks, freaks and virtual strangers, all come together in a grand finale. Luan Gaines/2006.
