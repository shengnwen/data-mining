Do you remember the part in the movie "Amadeus" when the great Mozart played one of his operas for the King of Germany (I think)? The king said it was brilliant, but, well, there were too many notes. This is how I feel about this book. I enjoyed this book very much and highly recommend it. It would be better for me if there were fewer laws. For practical application, 21 are quite a bit to remember and apply. Five to Seven laws would be better for me. In fact, I read this book for continuing education and in my report I highlighted seven of my favorite laws. Mozart replied to the King, "Which notes would you like me to remove?" (Or something similar). Later Mozart said the piece was perfect, there are no more or no less notes to add or subtract. Well, this may be the case here too.
