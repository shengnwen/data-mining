This book is the most comprehensive guide through the intricacies of the job search process that I have ever found. It methodically walks the reader through the complete executive job search process. Actually, to say it is comprehensive is an understatement. Orrin Wood starts at the very beginning prior to departing from one's current position, he proceeds to literally dissect the whole search process itself, finishing with the eventual adjustment period in the new job and beyond. It is rich with examples and step-by-step instructions on how to develop the necessary material for a successful job search. Then, to ensure successful use of the material just generated, Orrin Wood carefully alerts the reader to the many subtle pitfalls at various points in the search process, and the do's &amp; don'ts to avoid them. In addition, applicable  outside resources have been inserted throughout the book, making it an ideal primary guide during the job search. This book is a &quot;must-read&quot; for any executive who is realistic about the uncertainties in today's marketplace
