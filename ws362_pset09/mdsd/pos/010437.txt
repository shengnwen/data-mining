I found the book to be a great resource...very informative and a fun read. I work in a county clerk office that processes birth certificates, and we encounter names you wouldn't believe. This book is right on the mark, from names you know to those you'd never think of. People are quite imaginative these days when it comes to baby names, and this book captures them quite well. So, if you're looking for a name, this book should be the first place you look
