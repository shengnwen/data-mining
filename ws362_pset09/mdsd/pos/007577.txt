I absolutely loved this book and only gave it four stars instead of five because even with all of the research that the author did to bring Lt. Holman to life, there was still so much more I wanted to know about his thoughts, ideas, his travels that I felt were left out. Tragically, Holman's own final testiment would never make it to print so we miss out on his "final" observations about life, his travels, etc...Jason writes a great deal about Holman's adventure in Alexander Po but then glosses over the last 15 or so years of Holman's travels not really providing any detail from the rest of Holman's journeys. It's like Jason found no more about Holman's life to research. And you're left wanting to know so much more!!. I highly recommend this book. It's a joy to read from start to end. Jason writes in a "neo-victorian" manner which fits the time period and makes for an entertaining read. I'm sure any one of us would have loved to invite Holman over to dinner and hear him regale us about his adventures and travels. Absolutely fascinating story!  A MUST READ for all those who love read about history and, in particular, biographies. Holman must rank as one of the great individuals of humanity, right next to Helen Keller
