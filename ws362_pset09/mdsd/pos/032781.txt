This is my first EB book and I know I will read more of her books simply because I liked this one. The story line held my interest well. Her language dripped with memorable imagery that brought me back to times when I was young. I felt like a spectator in the girls' private world while reading this book. I thought the story ended too quickly without benefit of the fine, descriptive story telling Ginny provided throughout the rest of the book. I was hoping for a more emotional ending.
