I like Anita Shreve for her well-constructed, romantic plots and good writing--her books are great summer or airplane reading, engrossing without taxing the brain too much. "The Weight of Water" is set in a place well known to Shreve's readers--the coast of New Hampshire, and focuses on at least one character, Thomas Janes, from another novel.  The narrator is Jean, Tom's wife, a photographer who is researching a century-old "Crime of passion" for a magazine article, while at the same time approaching a crisis in her own marriage. The stories of Jean and the main character in the murder story subtly paralell each other, at first without the reader realizing it. The murder is solved by the rather clumsy device of Jean's finding an old "confession." As Jean reads the shocking confession, the sense of an impending tragedy in her own life grows. This isn't great literature, but it's a great read nevertheless--you'll enjoy it
