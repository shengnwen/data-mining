First of all, I must say that this guide is absolutely gorgeous. If nothing else, it is worthwhile for the collectability and the beautiful artwork.

Second, BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY THIS GUIDE be advised that there is a special edition version of this guide. The special edition is more expensive but it includes an artbook (VERY beautiful and detailed), the guide, and a folder to keep them in. The special edition guide has one of six covers featuring a character from the game, but the artbook contains all of the images - so no worries if you don't get the one you want. However, the inside contents of the two guides are EXACTLY THE SAME. Just be aware of that before you decide to buy.

The guide contents themselves pretty standard - the guide first includes a story, character profiles, and even a "relationship flowchart." There is a full explanation of the License Board system including a chart that shows how each character can access the complete board. Other sections include Gambits, Espers & Quickenings, a complete Walkthrough, Hunts, Side Quests, & Secrets, Weapons, Armor, & Accessories, Magicks & Techniques, Items & Sundries, The Bazaar, Marchant Shops, and last but not least, a Bestiary. This guide is great for getting everything in the game, and as I said before, if you're a collector, this is a must have
