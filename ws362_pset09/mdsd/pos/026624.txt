I can't offer the most descriptive review for this textbook because the course I am taking uses it sparingly. When I have sat down to read the chapters, I find that the emphasis is sometimes misplaced and too many details are provided for certain aspects. However, this may be what someone needs for a higher level course (I am currently taking this as a graduate course, but it's more like an intro to neuroscience lecture) when more descriptive info is needed.
