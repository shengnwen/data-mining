Mary Quant's book is a very good basic guide to make-up.  It tells you what type of make-up to use for each skin type, hair color, and facial structure.  It will let you know how to reproduce many different examples from start to finish.  However, it does not go into the new creative techniques for when you really want to make an impact.  Also, it does not use any type of make-up but hers.  This book will give you a good base to work upon.  If you are looking for more modern or exciting looks, Kevyn Aucoin is a much more interesting author
