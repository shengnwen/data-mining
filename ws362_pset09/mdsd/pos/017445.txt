I like this book, and loved it when I was younger, but as I have matured, so have my tastes.  So... It's interesting, but not the best book.  If you want to read a really good book of the same type of story (girl raised by dragons), check out "Daughter of Dragons" by Kathleen H. Nelson.  I think it covers the human/dragon culture clash better.  Would a girl raised by dragons really fit in that well into human culture
