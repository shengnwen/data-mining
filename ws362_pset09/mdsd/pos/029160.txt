I am a 25 year old-dominican. And just like soledad my parents migrated here and moved into Washington Heights. This book is so wonderfully put together that I felt like I was Soledad! Not only was I familiar with the places but I lived on 164th Street like she did and was able to walk the streets along with her as I read the book. It is the first time that I read  a book by a Dominican writer that does not take away the essence of our people, our language, our culture. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read
