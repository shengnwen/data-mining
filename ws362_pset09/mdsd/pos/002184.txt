Gus was a stray in New York City who was hit by a truck and left for dead: he seemed slated to become one of the millions euthanized yearly, but was saved by good Samaritans and entered the life of New York writer Stephanie Williams. JUST GUS: A RESCUED DOG AND THE WOMAN HE LOVED tells the story, with Stephanie's sister writing of their devotion in a blend of photolog and memoir (photos by Roslyn banish). When Stephanie fell ill with cancer, it was Gus who stayed beside her to provide comfort in this touching visual and written journal of faith and devotion.
