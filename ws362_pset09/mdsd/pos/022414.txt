Even though Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's lesser known novels it is very well written and also a very good story. The story is centered around the romance of Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. They had fallen in love eight years before the novel takes place, but Anne broken off their engagment after Lady Russell persuaded her that he was not a suitable match. They end up seeing each other again after Anne's family runs into money problems and Anne and Wentworth realize that their feeling for each other are renewed. Problems from their past and also their families hurt their chance of a fresh start.
I thought this novel was very interesting and another one of Jane Austen's great novels
