This is very prcatical and helpful book to learn about not only divorce, but also marriage, including reasonable reason to marry, types of things to consider before marriage, marriage plan, relationships...on and on.
It is not like listing of theories and statistics, but very practical to learn something out of it. In addition, contents are very organized well, and easy to read. This is one of the book i would keep, and recommend to friends who are in relationship.
