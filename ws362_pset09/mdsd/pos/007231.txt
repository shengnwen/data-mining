Charles Portis, a veteran of the Marine Corps in the Korean War from Little Rock, Arkansas, worked as a newspaperman in Little Rock, Memphis, New York, and London, ending his newspaper career as London bureau chief for the New York Herald-Tribune. He also wrote for such magazines as the Saturday Evening Post before launching his career as a novelist with the incomparable Norwood.  True Grit, his second book, is one of the true joys of American literature. I give it four stars rather than five because it may not be as significant, ultimately, as Huckleberry Finn or, say, Faulkner's The Hamlet. This is beside the point. True Grit will likely last as long as does this Republic. It is funny, scary, thrilling. How can a burr-head Marine like Portis channel Mattie Ross of Yell County, Arkansas, a fourteen-year-old girl bent on avenging her father's cowardly murder at the hands of the white-trash Tom Chaney? It's a mystery. The novel was made into a film, the only one for which John Wayne was awarded an Oscar, but don't let that fool you. This is a great book, one that will bear many rereadings
