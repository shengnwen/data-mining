David Cordingly has presented a popular subject with appropriate sobriety. The book reads like fiction, perhaps mostly due to the colorful nature of pirates themselves, and is fast paced and filled with detail. I learned more than I ever thought existed about piracy and was pleased to have many misconceptions cleared. While it is well researched, it is not perfect - several vaguely referenced assumptions are made that will be clear enough to an attentive reader. This annoyed me enough to knock a star off an otherwise stellar book.

I have read several of the source materials that Mr. Cordingly cites and find that he has a skill for taking research and making it cohesive and digestible. One reviewer has commented on repetitive content, but I found that the repetiton was useful for making a point and did not distract me from the text.

Overall, a wonderful survey of the pirates, well written and probably the best history of these scalawags to date
