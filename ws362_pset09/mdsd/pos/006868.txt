Being from San Antonio - I was a little sceptical when I checked this out from the library.  I don't know about 'Nuevo' as a trend, but the book is a delight and I hadn't had it home for more than an hour or so before I was  on Amazon ordering a copy.  It is fun to read and fun to cook from and the  whole layout of the book is a delight with fine color photographs
