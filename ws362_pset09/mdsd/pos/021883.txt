This is a great book to refer to when trying to tie your own flies. It avoids getting too deep in the "bugology" and yet provides useful information. For someone like me who did not know many bugs started off in the water, this was both eye opening and entertaining. If I had to suggest an improvement I would suggest that the fly recipes be closer to the mentioning of the fly. In a few instances I would read about how a specific fly was very good to use in certain conditions but would then have to dig around to find a picture and recipe of what the author was talking about. It is a nit and not worthy of dropping this great work to four stats
