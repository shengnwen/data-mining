Cool Pose is an excellent book. It addresses the word &quot;cool&quot; and how it plays a major part in the mind of afro-american men. I commend the authors for dealing with the issue of coolness because it is a term that has great relevance in the minds of young afro-american men( unfortunately older men too), yet no one has discussed it in great depth.  Read this book...and it discusses other topics as well
