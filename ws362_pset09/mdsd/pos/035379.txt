Although I still have to read the last book in the series, I will say that this is surely the best book of the four. A reformed rake, Sebastain, meets his match in the most shy of the Wallflowers, Eve and their story has truly surpassed the other books in terms of the romance, passion, tenderness and the gut wrenching emotions!  Please read the entire series and make sure you buy them all at once because once you finish a book, you won't want to wait to start the next one!
