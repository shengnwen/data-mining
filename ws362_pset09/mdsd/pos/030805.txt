The Witch of Fourth Street is a collection of enjoyable, magical stories.  Tales of immigrant children and families and how their ordinary days and events become extraordinary when viewed with humor and imagination.  A good  read aloud book for a wide age range.I liked the glimpses into a different  time period from different immigrant perspectives.  I also enjoyed the fact  that the stories were magical, but believable.  Modern day fables
