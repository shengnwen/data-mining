The author explains how information technology affected organization of production, profit structure, and regional economic structure.  I myself would not come up with a comparative analysis of these two cases, Swift (a meatpacking firm with railroad) and Dell (as you know), but he provides excellent data and develops arguments to grand theories.

His research style, writing, and theoretical argument should be a model for all economic historians
