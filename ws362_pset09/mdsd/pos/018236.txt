Mark Larson's book is a down-to-earth treatment of how to be successful in the stock market.   His straightforward approach deals with the important issues of timing in the market, knowing when to sell, knowing how to read indicators successfully, but most importantly, how to develop an attitude of treating this as a business and learning how to make wise business decisions when it comes to your day to day decisions regarding your portfolio.     I highly recommend this book for anyone serious about gaining the type of knowledge you really need to be successful in the market.    Thanks, Mark
