It is obvious that Ms. Billings' passion is for the family union and loyal friendship.   Applause to her poignant story of the Brickman family, their struggles that filter from one generation to another, and their determination to overcome misgivings and misunderstandings from previous and present mistakes -- true-to-life issues so often many of us take for granted, but need to examine within ourselves and those we love.  The reader is drawn right into the family, laughing at their shannigans, annoyed with some of their decisions or rooting them on.   The Brickmans are certainly people we can relate within our own household or people we know.  Most importantly spiritual enlightenment played an important role in their lives no matter how hard they tried to handle matters on their own.  Definitely an inspirational read
