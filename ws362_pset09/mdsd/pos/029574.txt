Too bad Cathleen Rountree cannot clone herself to be by the side of every aspiring and experienced writer when we need reassurance and inspiration. But at least we have her book! I find The Writer's Mentor to be an inspiring companion filled not only with the author's extensive experience in the literary field, but with the shared experiences of other successful writers. The inspiration offered through movie references show Rountree's well honed multi-lens approach to the creative act of writing, guiding us all to pursue inspiration from the screen, in addition to other venues. The question answer format of this guide, as well as the suggestions at the end of each chapter, are appealing and indeed create an atmosphere of mentorship. I strongly recommend this book for all who seek an engaging 'read' about the craft, as well as a professional guide to writing
