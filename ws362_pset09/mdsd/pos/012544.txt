After I had read Julia's incredible story of survival, bravery, humility and humor, I had the pleasure of meeting her at a reading. And I can say from personal experience, her spirit, her incredible courage and her dedication to her mission shines through her writing. The voice you hear when she speaks is the voice you hear in her book. If you have the chance to meet her at a reading, GO! 

A compelling read, an amazing true story of how, who, and what makes the difference when life throws you a curveball the approximate size of Boston
