this book was hilarious and very eye-opening. and full of the sorts of factoids you'd never be able to find anywhere else. i wouldn't be surprised if the government is keeping a very close eye on the author.

note- if you're at all conservative, this book might give you a heart attack...

but there's no denying that this is a great read. very engaging- not dry at ALL. i highly recommend it
