If you are interested in Middle East Cold War diplomacy, from Truman to Kennedy, this book is for you.  Bass explains why Truman supported the Israeli state from its inception, then why Eisenhower backed off from any kind of a special relationship, to Kennedy's "fishing" for friends in the Middle East.   You will ultimately understand how our relationship with Israel evolved from an arms embargo to "not only are we going to sell them arms, but how many and what kind."  Bass also lays out the bigger theme of Cold War containment for the region, specifically focused on Kennedy.  He also explains the origins of the Israeli Nuclear program.

With Bass's work we can discern the major players in the Middle East today:  Israel, The Arab Monarchs, which hold vast oceans of oil; the Pan-Arabist's, which include Egypt's Nasser and also the Baath party of Saddam Hussein lineage.  These groups are portrayed as nationalist with a socialist leaning.  Also, although not talked about but implied, the Muslim Fundamentalists.
