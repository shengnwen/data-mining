Anyone who was there knows that all of their conventions and beliefs were challenged or totally discarded. The 1960's was a cultural roller coaster ride that bounced and threw us back and forth like being caught in the  teeth of an angry dog. It was an explosion of artistic beauty and also an  explosion of unparalleled madness. Richard  Avedon's portrait photos convey  a brutal honesty that captures the mind set of the decade perfectly. He has  an undescribable ability to capture the natural human nature of a subject.  When you see a black and white portrait by Avedon, you feel just like  you've known the subject for years. He's the &quot;Matthew Brady&quot; of  the 60's battleground. One note of caution: several photos contain nudity  perhaps not appropriate for younger viewers
