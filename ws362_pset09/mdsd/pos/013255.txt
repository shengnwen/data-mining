After an EXTREMELY long hiatus, over 10 years, I think, Robert R. McCammon has finally released a new book and I have to say that I just polished it off last night & it's excellent.  I've always enjoyed him far more than Stephen King and I only wish he was as prolific.   This is the tale of a young man who is a clerk to a magistrate (judge) that journeys to a small town in the Colonies (South Carolina, by today's map) to judge a woman that has been deemed a witch.   This little town (Fount Royale) has many dark secrets and nothing is ever what it seems.  This is an excellent and compelling read and I only wish I knew why McCammon chose to stay away from writing for so long.   He's a grossly underrated writer and while I know his books are still on the shelves of your local bookstore, he's much better than Stephen King, in my humble opinion.   Run, do not walk, to your nearest bookstore or wherever and snatch this up, it's well worth your time
