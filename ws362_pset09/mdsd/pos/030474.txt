 Two shorts concerning Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld and they are both hilarious. Mr. McCall Smith possesses a subtle dry sense of humor that practically forms his writing into a rather droll literature laced with great command of the English language. "On Being Light Blue" is entertaining in the sense that it dwells on academic politics where each distinguished adult character is made to behave quite impossibly na?ve but commanding. "At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances" is full of actions where the heroic professor doesn't really have any control over anything - not even his own safety - but he comes out shining as fate (promised on him by his creator, Mr. McCall Smith) would have it. Three hours spent reading this book is time well spent
