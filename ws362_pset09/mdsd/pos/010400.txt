I'm fifteen (B. Rothermel's daughter), and recently checked out from the library a bunch of old, lighthearted books just for the heck of it.  I had never read Mr. Popper's Penguins, but I found it to be really cute and funny, but definitely a bit outlandish and slightly dated.  It is very short, but just the right length for kids ages 8-10, and I also think it would be a good read-aloud for younger children.
