From the day after Lee's surrender at Appomattox, most historians, Civil War buffs, history teachers, and everyone else always said and wrote that the South lost the Civil War due, mainly, to a shortage of manpower and the fact that the North had more industry.  Recently, though, several historians have started to say while those reasons are true, there are other factors to look at.  Freehling, along with David J. Eicher, is one of the leading proponents of the thought that the anti-Confederate Southerners, as well as politics, played a large role in the South's losing the war.  Freehling focuses on the idea of a non-unified South to explain the Confederate loss.  While Freehling does point out some eye-opening statistics, most of what he writes will be old news to most well-read Civil War followers.  The book is useful for the theory Freehling espouses as well as the chapters on the role of African Americans both North and South.  Freehling also does an excellent job of agreeing with some of Gary Gallagher's points (who, he asserts in the prologue, gave him in the inspiration to write the book after Gallagher published a book about how the South lost due to inferior manpower, etc.) despite the fact he does not agree with Gallagher's overall hypothesis.  This is good because it shows that Freehling is open to ideas besides his own and isn't doggedly pursuing his goal without doing any real research.  The negative, though, is that Freehling's book could have been half the size as he seemed to restate many of his facts.  Whether you agree with Freehling's idea or not, the book is still a useful, and well written, work
