Informative and realistic - great book!  The thing I liked most about this book was the fact that it kept a consistent theme throughout (i.e., consistent references that did not require me to search previous pages for definitions). It is true that there are a lot of choices to be made each day and knowing what type of decision maker you are can help make those selections easier and more fulfilling.  I particularly liked the way he explained the correlation of the level of regret associated with a maximizer vs. a satisficer and his references related to risk aversion.
