I'm never quite sure what to think of Shirley MacLaine -- I've enjoyed many of her movies, yet she can prattle on and on regarding various subjects. So I found her biography surprisingly enjoyable. The worst parts: analysis of what it means to be an actor, a star, a resident of Hollywood.  These passages tend to ramble. The best parts: Lengthy chapters on  professional relationships with such people as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin  and Jerry Lewis. And for those wary of her work with metaphysics, she keeps  this book firmly focused on Hollywood. Overall, MacLaine shares many  stories that provide insights into what it means to be a movie star.  Judging by this fact only, the book is successful
