Bevin Alexander delivers a summary of America's short yet rich history that would make any patriot proud.  He details our history, but also describes the motivation for the things that occured in that history thereby explaining how the American character developed over the years.  He isn't afraid to point out mistakes along the way, but the overall theme is that America is good and so are our intentions.

The 'blame America first' crowd will have a field day with this, but they will find it difficult to argue with history.  Alexander points out that those who feel we are imperialists simply don't have the historical record to support that contention.  Yes, there are some who may feel wronged by our actions but no one can argue that America has consistently been on the side of good whenever good came under attack.  Even today, it seems as though the world is incapable of confronting bad people and bad governments without America taking the lead.  This is just one of many truths that Alexander points out with flavor.

All in all, this book is well worth the reader's time.  It's inspiring and educational and it's a welcome rendition of American history free from one-sided criticism and hatred of our past actions
