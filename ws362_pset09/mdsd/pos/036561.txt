I listen to a lot of audiobooks, usually stephen king although i have listened to others and having read this book several times i thought i would listen to the audio version. I was pleasantly suprised by how much it changed the experience, it was like re-discovering the book all over again and Rob Inglis's voice really matches the narrative, although his singing isn't brilliant, but then again i always skipped the songs while reading anyhow. I would recommend this audiobook to fans of the book looking for a different way of experiencing it and for people who have never read it. Bring on the lord of the rings!!
