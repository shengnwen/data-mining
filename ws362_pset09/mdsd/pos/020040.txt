Two reasons make this book worth the purchase:

1.  It gives emphasis to the idea of the orgasm as part art and part technique.  I practiced piano technique for years before I ever became proficient enough to "play" the piano and forget the technique (consciously).  The book enphasizes the idea that technique isn't the answer; the answer is in the art.  That idea, the art of orgasm, if caught makes the book valuable.

2.  The pages on cunniligulus display clear, beautiful, and tasteful descriptions and sketches about how to practice the art in a way better than other books devoted completely to the tongue.  

I wasn't that interested in the details of Ms Cattrall's life (I don't own a television, never once watched her show, and never found the personal testimony of movie stars convincing) except that she gives convincing testimony that a lover/artist who takes time to learn the instruments (his and his lover's body) can create a new level of pleasure and a new level of understanding. Also, it's probably encouraging for some to know that rich and beautiful doesn't equate with spectacular sex life. 

The amount of information at first seemed less than the size of the book promised.  But, if you enjoy a beautiful book (the feel of it and the sight of it), and if you carefully study the techniques offered in the section on cunnilingulus, THEN if you forget the book and the mechanics of the techniques in the spirit that a pianist forgets the scales--leting his fingers "play" the instrument, I think you may improve your art and find the book worthwhile.
