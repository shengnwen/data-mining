First, I'll agree that the use of the terms "mysteries" and "cults" is a bit misleading sounding, as it does, like an attempt to pull in the 'DaVinci Code' audience.  Cahill explains his use of the first term and the second is not that far off the mark, anyway.  The author is careful to tell us at several points that his choices for emphasis are his own as are many of the opinions expressed.  This is not an encyclopedia but the work of an enthusiast, fascinated by his subject and looking to share that fascination with his readers.  The book contains veiled criticism of George W. Bush and unveiled criticism of the modern Roman Catholic hierarchy and I would imagine that many of the negative reviews are prompted thereby.
