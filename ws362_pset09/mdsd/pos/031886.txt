This is a work of serious reporting. This book is not about the Disney of Walt's time. It's about the behind the scenes of the Disney from 1990 to 2005. The author had exclusive access to first hand conversations and range of documents (such as internal company memo and mails) which were accessible on account court cases that happened against Disney. Patrick was invited by Eisner, to have conversations with him. But little did Eisner know that through course of Patrick's investigation, this book would be highly negative about him. The book is divided into 3 parts. The wonderful world of Disney, the disenchanted kingdom and Disney war

Main highlights:

* Michael Eisner exit from ABC and entry into Disney

* Eisner's 1990 era of success as CEO proving to be the most creative and productive years for Disney. This success is also attributed to the "rudder" or "balance and checks" association with Frank Wells, the then chairman. Their combination seems to have worked, Michael having creative input , his harsh way of getting work done by people, combined with the more sober and mature Frank Wells

* Emergence of Jeffrey katzenberg , a creative executive who revived the flagging animation department by producing hits like beauty and the beast, and lion king and his championing of the deal with Pixar.

*The building antagonism on the part of Eisner towards Jeffery and the final split. Jefferey was ambitious and fiery and innovative like Eisner. Eisner preferred a more serene and non-ambitious type of colleague who would be ready to play second fiddle to Eisner. These were essentially two incompatible people who were both ambitious and were at  loggerheads with each other in terms of style of working and vision.

*The hiring and firing of Michael Ovitz (from CAA) as president and the paying of the 200 mill or so in terms of penalty to Michael Ovitz

*Eisner passing up on projects like "sixth sense" and the "lord of the rings" trilogy. Disney even sold of the national distribution rights to sixth sense and saying no the lord of the rings franchise were 
considered big mistakes and marked the downward spiraling tendency of Eisner as the right Disney CEO. Eisner passed up projects like "survivor", "CSI" which later on became hits for rival networks.

*Eisner' character as the person playing dirty politics, backstabbing people, incorrectly reporting what one said to the other to spread mistrust and misunderstandings and deliberately asking staff to spy on 
their managers (who reported to Eisner) and report everything to him

*Eisner's Euro Disney and how it lead to financial disaster.

*The financially unsound acquisition of Fox family channel, and of getting into internet businesses.

*Esiner's split with Steve Jobs and Pixar cancelling a fruitful bussiness association uptil now. 

*Disney's loss to Jeffery in court and having to pay the decided upon 200 odd million as per Jeffery's contract (which had a clause smartly included on Jeffery's insistence). This clause attributed a certain percentage bonus  to Jeffery of the sum of all profits Disney would make from all animation projects on which Jefferey led the projects as head of Disney animation department. Jeffery then went on to form Dreamworks SKG with Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen (of Geffen Records). Thus the intials SKG in Dreamworks SKG(S= Spielberg, K=Katzenberg, G=Geffen)

* The save Disney campaign by Roy Disney and Stanley Gold. Most enjoyable parts of the book .For a movie fan like me I loved  discussion of the behind the scenes  business related decisions on movies like the sixth sense, pirates of the caribbean, pearl harbor. The passing up of lord of the rings trilogy . 
Eisner said that the lotr would not be done well on the big   screen ,survivor, CSI which later on became hits for rival networks. 
The save Disney campaign or the so called "fight back" to unseat Eisner 
as CEO and chairman and to force  him off the board. This is like 
reading the final retribution section of a fiction. The villain, in this 
case Eisner  unseated forcibly from the throne. 

To his credit, Eisner's  concept of "singles and doubles" as he called it is very level headed. Eisner preferred Disney to make movies which were small budget with relatively high profits. So instead of big stars and script writers, investment could be saved. This way each film even if not a whopping big hit would still be a confirmed profit. As Eisner 
says "we are not responsible to create art, we are here to make a profit"
 
Be prepared for a heavy read, because as a corporate biographies go, Patrick B Stewart leaves no stone unturned in providing as much specifics of events as possible. The narrative is interesting and intercut with "supposed' dialogue between characters and via excerpts from internal memos and internal Disney e-mail. It's a very good book. The book is great and Basically it can be summed up as  painting a highly negative portrait of erstwhile CEO and chief Michael Eisner. And this seems to be true, since the reporting is accurate as most of the stuff is from testimonies, memos and mails.
