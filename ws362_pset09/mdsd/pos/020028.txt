This is a pleasant and easy to read guide to "Wicca"/Witchcraft from a "warrior" perspective.  He wrttes well and makes nice use of quotes and references. Perhaps it was a little TOO easy to read, however, as I polished this off very quickly and was left wondering where the rest of it was! 

Mr Cuhulain had a focus on creativity within Witchcraft that I found very comfortable. Similarly, I found myself nodding in agreement with many of his statements, such as the practices behind raising energy, of taking responsibility for one's actions, of direct connection with deity, and of self-examination and awareness of one's faults. None of this was completely new... but it was a timely and enjoyable affirmation, and it brought a new peperspective through the attempt to codify and understand these principles through the concept of "the warrior". 

Cuhulain draws a lot from Eastern techniques of martial arts, and I found this somewhat less workable as anything but inspiration. How does one take the mindview from an unknown discipline that takes years to learn, and simply insert it into one's life? What these, and the stories from his own three decades as a US policeman, do is give context to Cuhulain's life-philosophy, a hint that such ideas are compatible and workable to those who take the time to learn them. It opens up/affirms possibilities. Although I was hardly moved to call myself a "warrior" by the end of the book, or make use of the (lovely sounding) warrior initiation given in the back pages, the book did introduce me to a new role-model and concievable way of being. It showed that 5'1" bookworms such as myself could at least gain inspiration, and the reminder to be responsible for one's actions, strong and vital, from the existence of this ideal-type.
