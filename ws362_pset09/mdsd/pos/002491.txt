I have now been involved with RCA for several years and it's the way to go in the future.  This book is a good example of what Root Cause Analysis is all about.  The book focuses on the use of the PROACT system and I imagine  would they would work very well together.  I am looking at trying PROACT as  well, not just yet!  Good book easy to read and gives good definitions to  those foggy terms.  I enjoyed the book and I use it for my job which speaks  for it's self, it doesn't hide in a cupboard or on a shelf.      I get the  feeling this book is one of the better ones in the bunch, not just someone  who has jumped on the RCA bandwagon because it's a flavour of the month
