This is one of those books filled with those ideas that you've thought all your life but few have the courage to admit, even to themselves.

Nietzsche takes a brutally honest look at human nature including the uglier things.  He rightly shows no mercy towards clergy and religous believers calling them cowards, weak minded, haters of life and other assorted insults.  All is done in a beautiful, poetic style.

The moral of the story is to be above the masses, to go above your limits and to enjoy yourself while doing it.  Its a positive philosophy that if implemented can make someone that rare person who rises above the herd and makes their short time on this earth worth it.
