Five stars for Ross Anderson's Security Engineering are just not enough - you have to read the book to understand what I mean. I won't repeat what other reviewers here on amazon.com have said; instead I'd say that the author is THE security expert. His amazingly broad and in-depth security expertise and good writing style resulted in a book which is not only comprehensive and detailed, but also interesting to read. You can be an expert in one, two, well, three (out of 10) domains of information security, but it seems the author is equally at home when writing about all 10 domains. I wish I was his student
