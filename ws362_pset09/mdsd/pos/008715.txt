Russo slips into the minds of his characters with artful grace while successfully maintaining an omniscient narrative voice. This is one of the best novels that I have read in years. The main character of Miles Roby manages a humble grill in small-town Maine. Miles is simply living his life from day to day and trying not to bring harm to those around him. Throughout the book, he grapples with the memory of his mother and tries to make sense of her decision to deny herself the pleasures of love and romance, opting instead for a Catholic routine of self-deprivation and guilt. 
A New England native, I found the descriptive powers of a once prosperous factory town were right on point: the now abandonned main street; empty mills and store fronts; bored teenagers with nothing to do on the weekend after the highschool football game; and residents who are endlessly hoping that maybe, just maybe, a wealthy investor from Boston might purchase the old factories and mills and bring life back to the town.  
The sub-plot involves Mile's teenage daughter, Tic. As a mother of two teenagers, I was amazed at Russo's understanding of the stress faced by modern day kids in public schools which are more like emotional war zones. As a woman, I was equally amazed at Russo's understanding of female sexuality and the desire that so many women have for power- not just over men, but over their worlds, as illustrated in Miles' bitter and punishing ex-wife Janine, and the town's controlling matriarch, Francine Whiting. 
My husband and I rented the HBO movie on Netflix starring Ed Harris and Helen Hunt and also loved it. Paul Newman plays Miles' quirky and shiftless father, and Joanne Woodward plays Francine Whiting. You get the sense that Paul and Joanne really enjoyed playing these contrasting roles. Russo also wrote the screenplay, which explains why the movie so closely resembles the book and captures the story so well. This is a must read and a must watch in every way. Kudos to Russo
