"Low tide. Piping plovers. Sanderlings with their toothpick legs, skittering over the shoreline like wind-up toys on speed." Putting it simply, Benedict is a master of the language. The way she can nail a character, or describe a room, or evoke an emotion with a few very choice words tells you everything you would ever need to know about writing first-rate fiction. This one takes place all over a single very long weekend, beginning with 48-year-old Sophy Chase with her lover in New York when she receives the phone call from the police that her husband, from whom she has been separated for three months, has been found dead back on the island where they had become full-timers. Maybe he committed suicide. If so, maybe it's her fault. It's an apocalyptic catalyst for change in Sophy's relationships with her grown stepdaughters and her lover's Vietnamese adoptees, in the way she sees her own life, where she's been and where she's going. The plot-threads of her intermittant alcoholism, her longing for children of her own, her dependence on a gay male friend, her discovery that she's being upstaged by another friend on the island whose perfect life is facing a marital disaster of his own -- her neediness in general -- all these create a rich narrative fabric. It's often a funny story, but in the sense that the human condition is often funny, if you pay attention. And her characters absolutely ring true. I confess, it's hard for me to read a book like this one without trying to cast it as a film. But with the right screenplay, it would be a terrific flick
