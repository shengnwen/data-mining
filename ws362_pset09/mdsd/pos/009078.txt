I really enjoyed all the readings this book included.  It has religious and non religious readings.  It includes sonnets, love poems and passages from the Bible.  If you want some alternative selections for your ceremony,  I definately recommend this book.  Whether you are Jewish, Christian or  Atheist this book really has something for everyone.  Some of the readings  they include in this book would be great to be recited at the reception, or  be placed in your wedding program or invitation.  I would recommend reading  this book from cover to cover so that yu don't miss any of the special  passages that you may want to incorporate
