This is one of the few books that my son (7) reads over and over again.  It is filled with trivia that he loves to memorize. How much does the earth weigh? How to fight back in an alligator attack. How to juggle. World populations. Wild life spans. Most intelligent animals. Most disgusting smells. Just a few of the many.
