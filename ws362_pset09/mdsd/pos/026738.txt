This is a fascinating book! Kurin gives a color and life to the history of the Hope Diamond, showing the interesting characters and lives touched by the "curse" and also those lives that have been positively affected by the diamond. 

There are photos, paintings, illustrations, and cartoons interspersed in the text to help bring alive the history of the gem. The writing was smooth and accessible and I truly enjoyed the look into history and past cultures as the author brought us on a world and historical tour of the Hope Diamond
