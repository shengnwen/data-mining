The story of Ben Carson by Ben Carson is an account of the lifeof a young American who went through many obstacles to becomesuccessful.  When Ben was a little boy, his parents split up and Ben is told that he will never see his father again.  This is a hard time for Ben but not as hard as times to come.  When Ben started school, he was teased because he wasn't as smart as everyone else was.  But here's how " the class dummy" turned into an extremely talented brain surgeon.  Ben is so talented that he has cured cases that other doctors said were impossible.  Ben is what you call a neurosurgeon.  A neurosurgeon is another name for a special brain surgeon.  Ben has separated two Siamese twins that were connected at the head and shared a large artery that was essential to their health.  He also helped a man with Von Hippel Lindau disease, a disease which causes many tumors to develop.  He is also well known for his Hemispherectomies.  A Hemispherectomy is the process of removing half of the brain.  This process is only performed by the most talented neurosurgeons.  Not only is Mr.  Carson a very talented surgeon, he is a great Christian. First he didn't think anything was in store for him. But he was wrong. When he was eight years old he decided that he wanted to be a doctor, but he never really thought that it would happen.  I had a great time reading this book and I hope that you take the time to read it.  EN
