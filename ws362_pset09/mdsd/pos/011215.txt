There are very few books which bring me to tears of laughter and this is one of them.  Incredibly, this book was written by Carl Hiaasen in 1986 and here I am listening to the audio version 20 years later and it's still incredibly funny - although younger readers might be lost on references to Jane Pauley and Michael Landon.  The audio version is expertly read by George Wilson.  He does an amazing job of bringing these quirky characters to life
