Hollander brings an art historian's eye to this survey of the history of Western European costume.  Her interest lies less in historical detail than in the ways in which the governing esthetic of what makes a man handsome,  or a woman beautiful, has changed over time and in how those changes have  been reflected in costume and art. Occasionally, Hollander badgers the  reader with a personal theory that is not adequately supported by the  information she provides in the text, but most of the book is informative  and thought-provoking.  If you already have a general knowledge of historic  costume, you will find much to interest you in Hollander's book
