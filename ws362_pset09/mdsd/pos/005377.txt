   Carole Cadwalladr's first novel is a must-read for anyone who grew up in the seventies - her musings on American and English popular culture are worth reading the book for alone.  That's just the icing on the cake, however.  This book is a fascinating study of a middle-class family - trying to stay normal with a decidedly not normal mom who we later learn is mentally ill.  She is written so sympathetically that even when she does inexcusable things you can't help but feel her desperation and pain.  
    All in all, a wonderful first novel, and an excellent read
