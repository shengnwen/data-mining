Sticking to incrementalism will lead to a long and painful death for businesses. The only hope is innovation, especially in an age where you are not only competing with local players, but are engaged in open competition from those all around the world - some of which inherently possess lower cost structures. Innovation is the next frontier. Through innovation you'll be able to set your sights higher and create surprising experiences for your customers.

Making Innovation Work is a great book on applying structure to the innovation process. While pure innovation cannot always be systematized, applied structure is necessary to move ideas from the wonderful world of thought to the real world of application. In essence it's all about applied innovation. The authors explain seven innovation rules which talk about innovations power to redefine industry. The rules explain the need for strong leadership, reasons for weaving innovation into corporate thought, managing creativity, as well as creating the right metrics and rewards to spur innovation.

All in all, Making Innovation Work is an excellent book which will show you how to stimulate and most importantly, apply innovation to create real world, bottom-line results. Entrepreneurs and managers alike  need to understand that innovation is not about repackaging the old, it's about creating the new. My personal recommendation is to read Making Innovation Work as well as Clayton Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma. Go ahead - shoot for the moon!
