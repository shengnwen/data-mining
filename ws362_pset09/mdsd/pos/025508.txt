So funny how all the naysayers on this book either complain about the art, the ripper theory or the violence in the book.  Hello!  It's a book about Jack the Ripper expect some violence.
Eddie Campbells gritty art is perfect for the story.  This isn't a good book to read if you brand new to comics, but if you're an experienced comics reader who can handle mature topics and (gasp) violence, pick up a fantastic book
