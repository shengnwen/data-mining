This book caught my notice while I was working in the library. After I've checked them out it didn't disappoint me. Gonzalez starts from the starting of Christianity with Jesus Christ, all the way up to Reformation in the first volume. He explains how Christianity has endured Roman persecutions, and the character of persecutions that Christians faced, namely the principle of "not seeking them out, yet when found be persecuted." 

In the first volume he also tells the story of early church fathers, those who tried to protect the doctrine of Trinity while the Arians (who claimed that Jesus Christ was in fact a first creations, rather than the Creator) were dominant under Constantine. Stories of Athanasius of Alexandria and Ambrose of Milan, and John Chrysostom of the East are particularly inspiring. (I was in Milan last summer, and there was a basilica dedicated to Ambrose. I didn't know who he was back then, but was glad to figure it out. I'm not sure if it's authentic, but I think they actually had his body underneath in the basilica. It is sad how Catholics tend to idolize "the saints". Nonetheless, I have this book to thank for telling me who Ambrose was.
