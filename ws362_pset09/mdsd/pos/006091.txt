At the opening of Tender Is the Night, the reader encounters Dr. Dick Diver on the French Riviera, surrounded by fashionable and wealthy admirers.  Diver is terribly attractive and charismatic, but there are signs of trouble.  Some type of scene at the Diver's home - we don't know what - leads to a duel, and the Divers decamp for Paris.  There, Diver enters into a serious flirtation with a young actress, and the instability of his wife, Nicole, is revealed.  Diver's father dies, and this loss seems to loosen some restraint in him.  He begins a long debauch and ultimately he is diminished while Nicole is strengthened.

This book explores some themes found in other Fitzgerald novels.  Most prominently, it examines the need for people who are superficially attractive and intelligent - people who "have it all" - to base their lives on something more substantial than the approval of others.  It examines the role that alcohol can play in a personal collapse.  And it examines the nature of emotional damage:

"One writes of scars healed, a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin, but there is no such thing in the life of an individual.  There are open wounds, shrunk sometimes to the size of a pin-prick but wounds still.  The marks of suffering are more comparable to the loss of a finger, or of the sight of an eye.  We may not miss them, either, for one minute in a year, but if we should there is nothing to be done about it."

This is a sad book, but it is beautifully written and the settings - in Switzerland and France between the two world wars - add interest.
