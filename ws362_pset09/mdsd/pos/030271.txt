Elliott Jaques devised a system for analyzing executive ability based upon an individual's time horizon--the maximum period of time in the future toward which his/her work activities were aimed in their performance.  He reached this conclusion during extensive, longitudinal, empirical studies in England.  His series of books reflect his elaboration and extension of this finding.  He worked, for a time, with Dr. Owen Jacobs of the U.S. Army (and then the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, ICAF).  Jaques prior, groundbreaking book, "Requisite Organization" is more pictorial than this volume.  The present work is oriented more towards practicing executives.  After reading it, I bought a copy and loaned it to my boss!  I wish more bosses would read it--and carefully at that.  The charts provided are engaging and thought-provoking.  A less extensive volume, "Human Capability" follows in sequence.  Jaques wrote it with is wife and publisher: Kathryn Cason.  It is a fine sequel, adding some additional perspectives and completing the charts that Jaques developed over time.  These books are most strongly recommended for serious students and practitioners of management.  They go far in attempting to move management into management science
