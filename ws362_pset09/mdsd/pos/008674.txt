"Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations" is a timely restatement of how an economic era developes through it life span. Agriculture started about 8000 years ago in the Baaka Valley and concluded with the Cotton Plantation of the early 19th. Century American South. Like wise the Industrial Revolution begain with the forge and cottage weaving in England and ended in the late 20th. Century with the Robatic Assembly lines in China.

The current Information Age is still in its infancy it will most likely will be dated from the mid 18th. Century when movable type and cheap paper made the printed available to the masses which sparked a revolution in literacy. The point of all this is that the great Information Age industries are still not here yet. Some may be developing in garages and on kitchen tables and some day will become the Ford, IBM or Proctor & Gamble on the new economic era. 

This is a business book and is divided into short quick readable chapters. I would assume that the author had in mid it being read on an airplane.
