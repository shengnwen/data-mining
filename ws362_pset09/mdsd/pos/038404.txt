Weber's Economy and Society was the number one pick by sociologists at the World Congress of Sociology. Twenty percent chose the book as one of the top ten. No other book had as high a percentage of admirers. Many key  concepts come from this encyclopedic work: Modern Capitalism, modern  bureaucracy, charismatic authority, and goal-rational social action. The  overall thesis of this complex magnum opus concerns the de-mystification  and rationalization of our world, the famous iron cage thesis. One  neglected aspect is Weber's ideal type model of patrimonial prebendal  traditional authority and its oscillation with feudal authority. Feudalism  promoted capitalism and capitalism has a tendency to become an iron cage of  instrumental rationality. The main difficulty with the book is the  casuistic writing style; it is not a book to sit down and read, but more  like a reference work. Before accepting trendy PoMo discourses take a good  look at this in depth examination of one key aspect of globalization. (This  two volume set supplants previous partial translations of portions of the  book, e.g. Parsons' translation of one part, and the editing work is in the  highest scholarly tradition.) Everyone interested in social science should  study this book! It is an exemplar for comparative historical analysis in  sociology (CHS)  that is neither naively Positivistic nor dogmatically  Marxist
