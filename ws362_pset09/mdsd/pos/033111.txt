I am 60 years old, have no children or grandchildren in my life to share this with: I bought it originally for the song I heard her sing, but I am young at heart and love dogs, so I was very charmed by the story and pictures Too!   I loved the Gentle lesson in the story showing how we all have some beauty and talents within us, even if we or others can't see them  right away.   Be patient, be helpful, and friendly, others and you will discover them in time.  The lesson is the same for people as well as for animals as I well know.  (Animals have Feelings too)   Gloria, I hope this isn't the one and only children's book-you have the talent!!!!     Please MORE!!!!    and I think your NOELLE is Darling!!!     the real one, as well as in the book
