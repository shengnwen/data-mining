I don't get these whiny liberal reviewers who say that they don't condone the people of the town for killing, no EXTERMINATING this fat sack of s**t after what he'd done to them for all those years! The law had utterly and completely FAILED them, as it has most of us for years, and they reacted out of frustration and fear after they'd finally had enough! I hope all you lawyers will take note: Sometimes this is how you must spell justice: V-I-G-I-L-A-N-T-E !!!!!Read the book. It's Great
