I have owned 3 books by Silver RavenWolf and also read Teen Witch.  No matter how many other books on the Craft and magick I buy, I still end up going back to this one every time I plan a spell or ritual.  The chapter on casting circles is invaluable, with plenty of examples of different visualizations and good instructions on how to write a circle casting.  I use the chapter Conjuring Minor and Major Magicks a lot, especially the planetary hours. I have found using the right planetary hour definitely adds "punch" to a working, especially when you need to work quickly and can't wait for the right day of the week or the right moon phase.  I like Silver's anecdotes, they show that she is a practicing witch and I don't feel like she's just pulling things out of thin air.  One thing I especially liked was her discussing "correct" behavior at an open circle.  I know as a solitary I was intimidated the first time I went to such an event.  I did not feel like I was being talked down to, I felt like earned wisdom was being imparted.  
  I also owned American Folk Magick and To Ride a Silver Broomstick.  I gave To Ride to a friend's daughter at her first blood ritual, because it is a good book for beginners, and American Folk Magick to a Christian friend, because the system didn't suit me.  
  There are things I disagree with the author on, however trying to get Pagans to agree on everything is like trying to herd cats.  If you are interested in making Wicca an everyday part of your life, rather than just something to make a big deal out of on Samhain and Beltane, this is a good book.  It shouldn't be the first book you buy about Wicca, but it's good to read a year or so into your studies.  But especially as a solitary, no one author should direct your studies entirely.  Especially not Silver, because if you read all her books you will get confused.  This is definitely the high point for her, but I haven't read To Light a Sacred Flame yet
