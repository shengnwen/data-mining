Once I had learned the basics of knitting from one of those "Leisure Arts" pamphlets, I went to the book store and gathered up all the knitting books they had and looked through them. This is the one I chose to bring home and I've been very happy with it. Don't get this book for a fun read or attitude, get it to help your knitting skills. The instructional pictures are the best I've seen in any knitting book. The photographs in the stitch library are also good quality and inspiring. The back flap has a list of all the abbreviations in the book (the same ones you will see in patterns) and is one of the most useful parts of the book to me. When following a pattern I will look in the index for the part of the book that has illustrated instructions and refer to these to begin with. Then I only need the back flap instructions and then finally I can just remember what the abbreviation means. The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because I didn't personally care for most of the projects. I did make the lace bags to practice lace knitting, but for the most part I wouldn't mind if the project section were left out all together. I don't see this as a big flaw, since tastes vary widely and it would be impossible for any designer to please everyone. Overall, if a beginning-intermediate level knitter was only going to have one instructional/reference book, this would be a great one to have
