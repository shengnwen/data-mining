I love this book. The reason I gave this book 4 stars is because it hopelessly fails trying to get into PowerPoint programming territory. The author should have stayed away from this area and concentrated more on beginner issues. After all, this certainly is a beginner's book. In fact, it's as good as the missing PowerPoint manual. If you want to go beyond the manual, check out the well explained Cutting Edge PowerPoint by Geetesh Bajaj. It makes a great complement to this book. And if you want to do more programming, check out Powerful PowerPoint for Educators by David Marcovitz. And for troubleshooting PowerPoint, look at Fixing PowerPoint Annoyances by Echo Swinford
