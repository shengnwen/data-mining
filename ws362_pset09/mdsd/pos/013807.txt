Take the ultra-researched science of a Michael Crichton novel (with only a slightly milder level of paranoia), the challenging futuristic conceptual philosophy of a Philip K. Dick novel, mix in the self-evolving computer premise of David Gerrold's superb novel, "When Harley Was One," and what do you have?  You have "Julia and the Dream Maker," the brilliant science fiction debut of P.J. Fischer.  Fischer combines computer technology, cellular biology and the angst of three post-doc college students in a very near future to bring us the story of a prank experiment gone rogue, and the aftermath that leads to a unique possible future for humankind.  With believable characters, a compelling premise and a natural story-telling style, Fischer's debut is a must-read not just for science fiction aficionados, but for anyone who likes excellent, page-turning fiction
