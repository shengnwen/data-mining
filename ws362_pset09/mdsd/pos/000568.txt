The Ruby In the Smoke is a good mystery, and exactly what I would expect from Pullman. The characters are intriguing, and the sudden deaths make it very suspenseful. I felt very connected with Jim and Adelaide, as they showed quite a bit of personality. A good book is one in that you can't tell whether or not a person is actually good or will betray sometime. 

But I gave it four stars, and not five, for a reason.

Mrs. Holland stands nowhere near as complex as Mrs. Courtier from His Dark Materials. Once beautiful, sucked into the darkness of an evervaluable object, betrayed by young love and turned evil... you get the point. Her subjects start as 1D evil creatures, toward the middle of their time in the book they seem like they may defect to the good side, then do something horrible and then die. This was a good formula to use for Hopkins, but carrying it out again with Berry was not as intriguing as it could have been.

I agree with that one person who said that the characters were standard deal. But they did have personality. It would have been intriguing to carry out the Van Eeden problem for another hundred pages.

Overall, the book was very skillful, and I would reccomend it to anyone mature enough. A little kid is definitely not a good person to read this book, due to the constant sudden death and significant drug use. The book also shows good word choice, but that also results in no little kid being able to understand it. It's a verry good book, as long as you don't focus on the little tiny out-of-context problems like some people did
