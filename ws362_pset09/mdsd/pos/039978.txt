"When Eight Bells Toll" is a first-rate crime drama by famed author Alistair Maclean.  The dramatic theme is British Treasury Agent Philip Calvert's pursuit of a murderous gang of maritime bullion hijackers working out of the rugged coastline of Western Scotland.

Calvert is a highly experienced agent who may be in over his head in this tense tale, in which very few people are who they seem.  Calvert's frantic search for the hijackers and for the hostages they hold takes him over the remote isles and sea lochs and forces him to make allies of some unlikely locals.  The double-crosses continue to the very last page.

Maclean's gift for understated and ironic dialogue, both internal and external, is on full display from the very first scene, in which we find Calvert facing an opponent armed with a Colt .45 revolver in the cabin of a ship he has just boarded.  The scene sets a sardonic tone for the remainder of the story.  Calvert is a typical Maclean hero, world-weary and sometimes cynical, yet ultimately honorable, who must battle bureaucracy as well as the bad guys to solve the crime.

Maclean was born and raised in Scotland, and spent part of his childhood in the Highlands.  Maclean brings that experience richly to bear in capturing the setting and characters of "When Eight Bells Toll".  The rugged weather and terrain of Western Scotland are authentically portrayed, as are the ways of the West Highlanders themselves.

This book is highly recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean's work and to others looking for a enjoyable reading experience.
