Oh, my, this book was wonderful.  I devoured all 600 pages in a week.  Read it during the winter, curled up in a warm sweater, and drink a cup of hot chocolate while you turn pages.  The writing is just beautiful-- the characters fully drawn and interesting.  I fully identified with Maggie (the protagonist) as she moved through her very moral, principled life.  She has many complicated relationships with people that are just a joy to read about.  If you like Victorian novels, do not miss this one.  I've heard Middlemarch is even better and I can't wait
