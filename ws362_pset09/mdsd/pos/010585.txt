Once again, Hiassen proves he is an amazing writer.  Most thrillers need an intricate story to propel them forward to keep a reader turning pages.

Hiaasen's story is rather straightforward, local Floridians dealing with the aftermath of a hurricane and the assorted riff-raff that arrives to separate them from their money.

In the hands of another writer, it could have been very so-so.  But Hiaasen's little nuances, excellent characterizations and dead-on dialog are almost guaranteed to keep readers laughing, guessing, and turning pages.

Highly recommended
