This is a very good overview of nationalism.  Following other scholars, notably the pioneering work of Carlton Hayes and Hans Kohn in the 1930s, Hobsbawm point of departure is the fact that nationalism in the modern sense is a recent phenomenon, arising prinicipally in the 19th century and often as the produce of state formation in that era.  Hobsbawm covers the history of nationalist ideas from the early 19th century onward, describing the evolution of nationalist ideas from their association with liberal political movements to their later association with the right, indeed, the fascist right.  Hobsbawm covers also the basic historiography as well.  The primary theme is the social construction of nationalism, often as a state mediated process with developing states using nationalist ideas to increase social cohesion.  Hobsbawm also points out how nationalist ideas often arise from confrontation with others, an increasingly common experience as 19th and 20th century Europe saw increasing contact with others from differing ethnicities and religions as the world economy promoted large population movements and novel information about others.  Written with Hobsbawm's typical combination of broad erudition and solid prose, this is an engaging and instuctive book
