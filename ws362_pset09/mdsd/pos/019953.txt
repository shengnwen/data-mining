I bought this book to use in my American history classes. I read this book many years ago and liked it very much. Students today, need to know that some people have the integrity to do what is right no matter what the consequence to them may be.  An example is the story of John Adams. He jeopardized his future to defend what he knew was right. It turned out well for him, but he did not know that at the time he defended the British soldiers. Students need more good role models in their lives
