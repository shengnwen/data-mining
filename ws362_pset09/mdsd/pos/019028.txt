So that's what Joie-de-Vivre means. It's really not the point whether the anecdotes are based on real facts. It's D.V.'s attitude, her curiosity, her passion for certain things, and her irreverence for the rest is what's most inspiring. The writing, edited by George Plimpton and Christopher Hemphill, is wonderfully imaginative and poetic, be it about Mona Lisa or Buffalo Bill. I recommend it to anyone with an eye for details and a passion for life
