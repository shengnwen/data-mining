This book is my favourite book of all time. I know that my personal opinion probably doesn't count when compared to someone who has perhaps studied a Masters in English, but I really think anyone should read this book. My favourite of the three stories in this collection, is &quot;Lorraine goes to Livingstone&quot;. This story, has the usual shock value characteristic of Welsh, but to the literary buffs out there, it can be analysed on many levels. I found it to be an hilarious satire of the media, as well as being accurate at pinpointing the true motives to the characters behaviour. I think that this collection of short stories will be loved by the most discerning readers, not only because it's funny, deep etc, but also because it forces the reader to see the part of the human psyche that we  don't want to admit is present. In short buy this book
