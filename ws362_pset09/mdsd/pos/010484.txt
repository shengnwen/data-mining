This story arc focuses mainly upon Peter Parker and his developing relationship with Kitty Pride (aka Shadowcat). This is one of the things that myself and many others find to be so great about the Ultimate Spiderman series- it doesn't focus almost exclusively on Spiderman, but gives equal or greater time to Peter Parker's life and problems, which makes both him and his alter ego seem much more REAL.

We see Ultimate Silver Sable and her Wolfpack and Ultimate Vulture as Spiderman's enemies (though it is unsure whether Sable IS Spidey's enemy) in this arc. As usual and expected of Ult Spidey, the artwork is stunning and the dialogue is clever, and again very REAL.

Highly recommended to any reader, specially those who have collected the other 14 volumes. For those considering starting the series I recommend you go with the hardcovers which can contine 2 or 3 paperback volumes, usually with bonuses at the end, and can save you some money as well
