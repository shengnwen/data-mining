I've read The Talisman by Stephen King & Peter Straub no less than ten times, and I'm sure I'll read it at least that many more times, if not more.  One of my favorite novels of all time, The Talisman is the modern version of Tom Sawyer and the newer version of The Lord Of The Rings.  Bold statements, I know, but I can't say enough about this book.  King & Straub just clicked on this project and the results are brilliant.

12 year-old Jack Sawyer is on a quest to save his dying mother.  He has to cross the country to find The Talisman and in order to do so he has to cross over into the territories (a parrallel world) to find his way through terrors unimagined.  

I've loved this book since the first time I read it way back when it came out.  The first book, unfortunately,  makes its sequel, Black House, look like a booger in comparrison.  Bummer.  Enjoy the first.  Truly amazing.
