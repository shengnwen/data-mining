What we don't know certainly can hurt us...what we do know can change our  lives. ANGEL POWER is the most important book a thinking, educated person  can read today. The dual reality of our lives as we see them and the cosmic  life beyond the third dimension are explored brilliantly in ANGEL POWER.  The book is grounded in penetrating academic research, utilizing mainstream  sources highly regarded in the intellectual and religious disciplines. This  theologically technical world of the angels is woven with true, personal  stories of people, our contemporaries, whose daily lives have intersected  with the spiritual and produced astounding results. Some of these people  did not even believe angels existed! ANGEL POWER is graciously written to  be read and not stuffed in a library as a complex research document, even  though it is theologically sound
