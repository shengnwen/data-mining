Maine Squeeze, written by Catherine Clark, is an enjoyable and exciting book, which is most likely to appeal to teenage girls.  It is the story of a summer in the life of Colleen, a college bound 18-year old, who is living on her own for the first time.  She faces many obstacles over the summer, from reuinting with her ex-boyfriend, Evan, losing her current boyfriend, Ben, having a truly awful roommate, and much more.  Colleen, however, is able to make it through the months with her three closest friends by her side and an unexpected new friend, an elderly artist.  Colleen ultimately struggles with herself, making mistakes along the way, yet finally arriving at a place she can be at peace.  Furthermore, Catherine Clark is able to make her novel come to live by the use of many literary devices.  Through the constant use of rhetorical questions, Clark allows Colleen to state the obvious in her own thoughts and while conversing with others.  Also, personification is used often when Colleen describes her cats, Starsky and Hutch, making them at times seem human.  In addition, while Colleen is working at a crabshack, her boss tells her to chose a crustacean which represents her personality.  Colleen, therefore, speaks metaphorically when she refers to herself as a soft shell crab.  Clark's style is plain and simple, making her novel easy to comprehend.  Its tone is constantly changing from shocked to humorous and candid.  Overall, along with Clark's other novels, I enjoyed reading Maine Squeeze and recommend it to teenage girls looking for a quick and fun read.
