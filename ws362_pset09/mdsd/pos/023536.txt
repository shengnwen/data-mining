After 40 years of relatively unrewarding jobs, and 40 years of wanting to "find my true self", I started on the path towards becoming a writer...a lifelong dream.  Along the way, I read "Do What You Are".  In addition to enjoying and agreeing with the authors, I found out that, based on their means of discovering the possible perfect careers, they agreed with me.  Nothing solves all the problems, but this would be a great help to most people who read it.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it can be a bit daunting to go through if you are not already motivated, but it is worth the effort
