This is my favorite story to read aloud to my second grade students.  The characters are so endearing!  Ms. Rylant paints a beautiful picture of true friendship without being preachy.  She also includes enough suspense to hold the reader's attention and enough humor to keep them smiling.  I love to read it to my students in late fall/early winter because of the vivid descriptions of the ice storm and changing weather. We feel like we're right there with Kona, Stumpy, and Murray! A truly remarkable story.
