David Bach offers a very straightforward and basically foolproof method for managing your finances in "The Automatic Millionaire." This isn't a get-rich-quick book: "The Automatic Millionaire" is based on the principle that anyone can become wealthy by following a few basic steps and learning how to manage their money well. Bach insists that the only way people can truly get rich is if they "pay themselves first" with every check before shelling out money for bills, basic expenses, and trivial purchases. The idea of making everything "automatic" stems from Bach's belief that by using automated payroll deductions for things like retirement accounts and monthly bills, people won't be tempted to stray away from their budgets.

"The Automatic Millionaire" doesn't really offer much new information on personal finance, but Bach makes everything very easy to understand and provides numerous examples and scenarios that really drive his points home. I grew a bit annoyed at all the self-promotion for other "Automatic Millionaire" products that Bach has scattered throughout this revised edition, and the final chapter on tithing also seemed a bit preachy to me. Overall, though, this is a great financial guide for people who are ordinarily intimidated by money or are just getting started with serious financial planning. I think everyone will be able to find some useful information in this book. It changed the way I think about money and I've already taken a few steps to move toward a more "automated" financial lifestyle. I'm also going to suggest that my husband read this book so we can apply Bach's techniques to our collective financial assets
