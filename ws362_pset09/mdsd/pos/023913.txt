This book contains the first book of poetry by Propertius with commentary in the back to help the reader with difficult grammar, ambiguous meaning, or other problems common within latin poetry.  
Poetry:  Propertius was an Augustan age poet, an elegist following somewhat in the footsteps of Catullus.  He was a romantic, and most of his poetry either praises or complains about his girlfriend, Cynthia.  Since he is a little less dirty than Catullus, he is slightly more suitable for serious study in the classroom, and I enjoyed his poetry very much.  Latin students who enjoy Catullus or Horace would enjoy Propertius.
Commentary:  Excellent.  Propertius uses references to mythology that can be very obscure, but the notes delight in giving the background to the reader.  I found the notes extremely helpful in my translation work and appreciated the depth of explanation for the ambiguous passages.
If you want to read Roman poetry, Propertius in particular, I highly reccommend this book
