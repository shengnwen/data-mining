While having dinner with his parents, Teller learned that his father had drawn a series of cartoons which he had been unable publish in the Philadelphia Inquirer, and he realized that he did not know much about his parents' lives before his own. He spent time talking to them about their childhoods and how they met, the result of which is this book of reminiscences, quotes from correspondence, and cartoons, drawings, and paintings. While Teller's parents may feel that their son's celebrity has overshadowed their lives, this book shows that their lives are quite interesting in their own right. Teller's father traveled to all of the 48 (at the time) U.S. states, and to Alaska, mostly by rail as a hobo. This is a small, high-quality book printed on heavy paper with illustrations on nearly every page. It's a pleasant tribute from Teller to his father (and mother)
