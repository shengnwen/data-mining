Beating the odds in Vegas is much harder than I thought. Leave it to a group of MIT braniacs to figure it out. This story is incredible; so much deeper than the "card counting" I expected. Their system was incdedibly elaborate. This is not a book you can read on your flight to LV and hope to gain an advantage. This is about a system that was years in the making. I"m facinated by how successfully this system worked - to the tune of millions in winnings.
