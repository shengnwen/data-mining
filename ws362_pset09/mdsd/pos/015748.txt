This is my first Deaver/Lincoln Rhyme book and it is making me go back and read the others.  It works as a stand alone, although I am looking forward to seeing the genesis of the characters in the predecessor works.  The inner circle around Deaver, especially his former model/lover/eyes and ears are well-developed with personalities that interact well.

Rhyme is wheel chair bound and, like Nero Wolf, solves crimes from his NYC apartment.  He is a former crime scene investigator, so that is the thrust of the sleuthing.

In this novel, a thirteen year old black girl from Harlem who is bright and on her way out of the ghetto, gets wrapped up in a series of crimes through no fault of her own.  There is plenty of plot twists and turns and misdirections to make any mystery fan wrapt.  There is also the solving a post-Civil War crime that needs to be addressed.  Mr. Deaver's young ghetto character is convincing in voice and demeanor, even to the point of chiding authors who don't really know Afro-American speak.

Based upon the mystery alone, this is a good book.  What separates it from much of this genre of CSI is the almost non-stop action.  It seemed as if every ten pages there was another action scene or tense moment.  This constant intensity made a cerebral crime scene analysis into a thriller-like page-turner.

As noted, this will happily lead me to Mr. Deaver's earlier Lincoln Rhyme books.  Highly recommended
