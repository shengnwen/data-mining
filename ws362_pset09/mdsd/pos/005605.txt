This beautifully illustrated large book shows what's happening in club/discotheque design. Like a lot of the daab books, it basically has no text. Instead it is a collection of high quality photographs showing the latest trends in club design from around the world. And around the world really means all over the world vrom Brazil to Peru, Japan to New York, all over Europe, behind the old Iron Curtain, Israel and more. 

Clubs seem to go through styles. From the original dingy cellers to high style, then back to the celler with the warehouse look of exposed beams and utilities, and more recently to a wide variety of styles that combine nearly any look from living room, to theater, to cave. 

Consider this as an idea book for club design. It's what the top designers around the world are doing these days
