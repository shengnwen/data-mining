The difficulty of a book such as "The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason," by Sam Harris, is that the reader's reaction to it is probably shaped by views already held. Harris contends that the existence of organized religion is a deadly epoch in humanity's history, one that we must outgrow in order to survive and flourish. Faith in a sentient deity itself, he argues, is incompatible with rationality. 

The book is strongest in its cataloguing of the well known horrors, historical and current, committed in the name of someone's God. He also argues persuasively that even religious moderates can remain religious only be ignoring the calls to violence and divisiveness appearing in sacred texts of all creeds, and by interpreting or rationalizing those words away with experience gained from our collective secular experiences. He legitimately questions why a person's religious beliefs, as opposed for example, one's political beliefs, are beyond challenge and criticism in our society. His critique of Islam, devoid of any hint of political correctness, is potent.

Harris is at his weakest when he implies that with the end of religious faith, the worst of man's depredations will end. He strains unpersuasively to to argue that even secular tyrants such as Hitler and Stalin, gained their traction via religious beliefs. The book is further weakened by a meandering section on the nature of consciousness, as if he needed to fill 30 more pages. Harris' arguments are the logical extension of secular humanism, a belief that justice and compassion are within the human province and not dependent on religious faith. Anyone open to the notion that religious faith is a passing phase of a young species, needs to read this book - preceded or followed of course, by the Old Testament, New Testament, and Koran
