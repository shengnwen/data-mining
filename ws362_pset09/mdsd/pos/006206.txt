Five years ago when I had my son everyone and their sister told me to get "What to Expect" ....and I got it and I read it and I felt less than nothing.  Just a big, fat, clunk.  nada. 
I am much more crunchy than a lot of moms but I'm not that far out there. (No homebirth for me) but gosh, what I would have done for something like this book back then.  When my son was having a fever everything in me said, "skip the tylenol" it just felt wrong to me... and in fact in Feder's book (page 362) she describes it best.."The fever and its accompanying symptoms, whle anoying are vital in helping to strengthen the immune system and ward off future infection."  I now let my son burn off his fevers and I am willing to push it to 104.....this just felt right in my gut and that's what makes Feder's book so great.. it answers to some of us who have different guts than the ones that ring over the 'what to expect' books...
