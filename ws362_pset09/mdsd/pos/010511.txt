Lt. Joe Leaphorn was author Tony Hillerman's first detective, created for the 1970 novel THE BLESSING WAY.  He was a truly original figure: a Navajo employed as a law enforcement officer on Native American lands in the Southwest and a man with both a deep respect and understanding of the ways of his people.  The character Jim Chee does not differ greatly from this mold--but he does have one significant advantage.  By the time Jim Chee appeared in this 1982 work, Tony Hillerman had learned how to create a tightly woven novel, something that was not always the case in the early Joe Leaphorn books.

THE PEOPLE OF DARKNESS introduces Jim Chee, a young reservation law enforcement officer who struggles to find balance between the traditional ways of the Navajo and the cultural incursions of the white man.  In this particular novel, Chee is summoned by a wealthy woman to investigate a theft; the circumstances are, however, extremely unusual--and as he slowly peels through the various layers of deception Chee finds himself tracking members of a cult-like religion with ties to a tragic accident more than three decades in the past.

This is one of the better Hillerman novels.  As always, the author is extremely respectful of native American tradition, and he paints a fascinating portrait of traditional beliefs and patterns of behavior.  Unlike such novels as THE BLESSING WAY and LISTENING WOMAN, the plot is tightly constructed and winds back upon itself in such a way that one can honestly consider it a mystery novel--something that cannot always be said for a Hillerman work.  Well written, PEOPLE OF DARKNESS is a fast and entertaining read.  Recommended.
