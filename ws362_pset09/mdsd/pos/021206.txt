I bought this book to see the history of the canyon 5 miles east of my current residence (I've not quite moved to Seattle yet, despite my profile), and because I'm a Joni Mitchell fan.

It was an pleasurable as hoped, probably of greatest interest to Los Angelenos, but also to those impressed with the 70's folk/pop scene.  There are ample amusing anecdotes, a light dose of sociological philosophy, some lurid crimes.  The story is built from a relatively small number of interviewees, as far as I can tell, and not all were so remarkable, but the narrative hangs together.

A third of the way in, I was afraid it would devolve into Rolling Stone-style musical over-analysis, but that misstep was temporary, and then I particularly enjoyed the demise of folk-pop by glam, punk, disco, greed, drugs, etc..

While not encyclopedic, a diverting excursion through the a critical stage in American music and America
