TIME BOMB by Jonathan Kellerman
November 20, 2004

Here's an older Alex Delaware novel originally published in 1990, in which a sniper attacks a schoolyard and Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis are on the case trying to solve the crime.  Alex's job is to help out the kids that were exposed to the violence that left the suspected sniper dead, by counseling both the children and their parents.  

Meanwhile, the police are stumped as to why a young woman had tried to gun down children at a school, although it was also a coincidence that a local politician, State Assemblyman Samuel Massengil, was scheduled to speak at the school that same day.  His political rival, Gordon Latch, also happened to be at the school before the shooting started, and it appears suspicious as to why they were both at the school when only Samuel had been expected to be there.  

The mystery soon leads to the young woman's father, who turns out to be an egomaniac.  Interviewing the neighbors brings up a young Black American that some say she had been dating, but in any case, had befriended her when she had no other friends. And subsequently, themes such as racism, the KKK and Nazism play central to the mystery of who the sniper was and why she did it.  

I've only read a handful of Alex Delaware novels, but I feel this was the most complex of them all.  What I like about these books is that although they do have continuity going for them (Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis, as well as some other minor characters, are the constants in these novels), one does not have to read them in order to enjoy them.  For those who enjoy a good psychological thriller, TIME BOMB is recommended
