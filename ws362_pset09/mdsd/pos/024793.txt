My first of Gregg Olsen's work, but it wont be the last.  I got this book yesterday afternoon and couldnt put it down.  You get completely involved with the characters and there is absolutely no predictability.  Very suspenseful and intriguing.  This is a must read for anyone who loves suspense thrillers
