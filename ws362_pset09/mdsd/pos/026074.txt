If you are looking for a plot driven story, then this may not satisfy. However, if you do not approach the story with the same kind of expectations you might bring to a work of popular fiction, Farrell maintains a high level of interest. I believe Studs Lonigan is one of the most developed characters in twentieth century American fiction. I am especially impressed that this depiction comes across so strongly without the aid of contrived catastrophes that land on the character from out of the blue. Although Studs is affected by his environment, it is still possible to trace the turns his life takes to sources within his own personality. These sources determine him as often as they are determined by him. I found him to be neither beneath nor above me. I can't say the book is exciting so much as extremely moving. Either way, I was turning the pages late into the night.Definately a book I will remember all my life
