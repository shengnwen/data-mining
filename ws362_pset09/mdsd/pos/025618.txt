Great book. Definitely doesn't cover every area of Torts that you're going to need to know for your course (IIED, false imprisonment, etc.). Get Gilberts or Emanuels or just use your class notes on this stuff though. Also: if your professor has a slightly different view on the rules (even if it's just a difference in semantics) use your prof's rules when working the Examples. Writing out your answers to the Examples throughout the semester will solidify your knowledge and you won't have to struggle to memorize the elements of each rule at the end of the semester
