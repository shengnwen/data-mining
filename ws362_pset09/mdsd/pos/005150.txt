This book well deserves the Bestseller slot it holds in the UK but despite it's claims to be suitable for vegetarians I'd advise looking over Mr Marber's shoulder.

They say behind every great man there's a great woman.....check out Yvonne Bishop-Weston BSc Dip ION MBANT at The Food Doctor. 

If you have leanings towards vegetarianism then try her recipe book by Hamlyn (Vegan) ISBN 0600609154 - fantastic healthy recipes. It's based on the same kind of higher protein,lower or rather better carb, lower GI / GL (glycaemic load) type principles that have made Ian Marber so famous recently whilst battling out on British TV with other nutri-celebs.

It's also on special offer at Amazon! Enjo
