Finally, a self-help leadership-oriented book that doesn't talk down, that isn't written at the 5th grade level, that isn't a study of what others do, and actually offers more than one point of view. This book is configured the right way, with one central question driving a well-thought out and obviously thoroughly researched debate. You'll need to take your time with Absolute Impact, because the territory is deep and personal. The messages are universal and timely.The tools in the back are terrific, and worthy of a year's study
