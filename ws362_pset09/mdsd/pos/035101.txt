If you like shipwreck stories from the sailing era, consider this a 'must.'  Not because it is so well written.  It's a workman like job but Philbrick's "In the Heart of the Sea" wins that prize.  Not because it is so well researched.  It is well researched, to the point where it could do with a bit less speculation, especially at the end.  Rather, this is not your usual 'cast out to sea in a little boat for weeks on end' story.

How can that be?  Read the book
