I truly admire Hulda Clark for her great contribution to the human race, with her such books which I've read and applied some of her ideas.  It may seem radical yet what's the defintion of "normal" anyway?  While some things may not work for an individual, it may work for others.  As our bodies as well as our belief systems (which seems to be more important thing than anything) respond to different things, at different stages of Life.  There's no ONE way for everyone.  It may take some experiment and time to get the kind of results some may seek for, in however way we may find out there, either modern or traditional or such.  What Hulda has done is that she offers an alternative way, to give some folks, desperate or not, chance to give it a try after their certain treatments fail or some treatment causing severe side effects turning their lives as unbearable to live.  Some may disagree with the books yet there are couple of pratical logical things to do, to safeguard their health, like taking well known toxic stuff out of kitchen or better the entire house, what not to consume or inhale to avoid self-poisoning, healthier products to use for babies, so forth.  Rather than condemning the whole book.  To those who seem wanting to burn this book of Hulda's...  I'm quite glad that we're in democratic society, with such kind of freedom we enjoy i.e. freedom of press.  We do have rights to make intimate personal choices for ourselves and our health needs... WITHOUT much interference from those who disagree.  Think and feel for yourself, without fear.  They do have right to those opinions, that is, without taking or harming this such freedom we have.  "Those who say it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it" - Chinese proverb  (US and China, different political systems....hmmm)  Read on and see what may help!
