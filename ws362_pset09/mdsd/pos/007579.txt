As I have said before when doing a review of a Lee Child book, I started with his most recent effort and have been working my way back since. Die Trying is the second book in the Jack Reacher series and not withstanding what some others have said about it, I found it to be very readable, highly entertaining and very good writing.

Other novels have been done about militia units and their paranoia. 

In this case, Reacher is, as he describes himself, "an innocent bystander" who happened to be passing a Chicago dry cleaner when Holly Johnson is exiting it with a full load of freshly pressed clothes. She is struggling with the nine hangers and trying to manage a cane as she has hurt her knee playing soccer. Reacher takes the cleaning to assist her and the next thing he knows they are surrounded by three men with guns, hustled into a car at the curb and taken away.

Holly is an FBI agent. She is also the daughter of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President's god-daughter. 

You might imagine that her kidnapping rates attention.

The rest of the book plays out as Holly and Reacher match wits with the militia mastermind and the government tries to deal with the kidnapping in a low profile manner.

I found it to be a page turner. I think you will too
