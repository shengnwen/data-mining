This book rocks.  Crain covers controlling light better than all of the other books I have read.  His obvious knowledge of equipmnet for controlling light is superb.  I especially liked the end-of-chapter assignments to help me really integrate this information.  Let me know when his next book is due.  The helpful demonstration of the equipment necessary to do this level of work is a real plus
