I really enjoy The Stock Trader's Almanac not just because it has some great market statistics but because it gives me ideas for new trading strategies and helps me refine some existing ones.  My favorites strategies from the Almanac include the best 6 months strategy for the S&P 500 and the Best 8 days for each month.  It is always handy to know when the next FOMC meeting is scheduled and the daily quotations are fun to read.  If you are a savvy investor, it is another great tool for your arsenal
