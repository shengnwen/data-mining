Amazon lives up to it's name.. it's huge and practically unknowable. 

Amazon Hacks is the best of the wonderful "Hacks" series. You won't be suprised to see that you know about most of the 100 hacks and/or find them unusable.

However, there are at least 0 that changed how I look at and use Amazon everyday. 

I've been on Amazon as a buyer, seller, publisher, author and heavy user since the begining. I professionally promote books on Amazon... still, I found new information in this book. 

I recommend anything in the HACK series, and this one for anyone that intend to use web services, Amazon, or a computer in the next decade
