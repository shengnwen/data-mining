I have read each of Tananarive Due's books and have enjoyed them immensely. This account of Madame CJ Walker's life was such an enjoyable read. I am thankful that Ms. Due reminded readers in the end that this was a book of fiction because I had become so engrossed in the storyline, I must admit that I forgot it was fiction. I did not know much about the life of Madame Walker but this story shed a lot of light and most of all it stressed for me that you must not allow fear to stand in your path. I will continue to support anything written by Tananarive Due and thanks for a wonderful story
