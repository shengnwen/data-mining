Strengths - This book makes a very articulate argument against privatization from a philosophical viewpoint, spanning several areas of "industry" (health care, schools, prisons, etc.) and why a vibrant public sector benefits not only the poor and middle class, but corporations themselves.  The sections on privatizing prisons is particularly illuminating, given the authors' experience with advocacy in this particular realm.  Unlike other books, this one actually does come up with an alternate plan to the current privatization schemes, unlike other books which just "rage against the machine".

Weaknesses - Other than the sections on prisons, facts and figures seem to be lacking.  There are plenty of solid statistics backing up the hard economic reality that the book argues out there, they just don't include them.  I also could do without the poetry, it really doesn't add anything to the argument and seems more of a distraction.

One neutral comment - The book indicates that some corporations are trying to put their employees on Medicaid, transferring economic responsibility to the government.  In reality, they don't want Medicaid to exist at all, so they don't have to pay "high" business taxes...and we are essentially left with a cash-pay health care industry where only those with the means to pay get even adequate care.
