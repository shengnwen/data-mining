This book was required reading for a Lit class at UNC Chapel Hill, and for good reason. It brought together many of the themes we discussed over the course of the semester in a morbidly comic way that focused my attention like none of the other SF classics we read (Childhood's End, Starship Troopers, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Akira, etc.). I found the arguments around suicide near the end less than compelling, but the third act taken as a whole is powerful. Completing a second (final?) circle, the story will (should) leave you asking questions about history and humanity. 

Readers will find SF and religious themes and tropes warped in ways that are pleasantly challenging. From the disfigured Mrs. Grales who challenges conventional notions of the virgin birth to the low-tech treadmill generator of the 32nd century, Miller brings to life a future that is chillingly familiar and... hilarious. Miller even manages to make the Wandering Jew a powerful character.

Worth the read. Keep google handy if you're not familiar with Catholicism or Christianity. If you like a harder edge, go instead for a book that tackles fewer themes: Neuromancer by William Gibson. It's another SF classic that will leave you wanting more
