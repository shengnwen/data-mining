This book contains the Parisian memoirs of journalist Adam Gopnik.  From childhood, Gopnik had always been enamored with Paris.  In his mid-thirties (from 1995 to 2000), he had the opportunity to live his dream, together with his wife and young son.  In this book, he describes his period of adjustment to French culture and to fatherhood.  

Towards the beginning of the book, Gopnik tells us of his struggles to furnish their Parisian apartment, of his dismay when he found that many of the electrical items that they had brought from the States were not compatible with the European electrical system.  At this point, I nearly put the book down, thinking that someone who was overwhelmed with such superficial and entirely predictable problems such as these could not possibly have anything of interest to say about cultural differences or French society.  Fortunately, I kept reading, and found that Gopnik does indeed make some worthy observations.  He does a decent job of explaining French attitudes to labor, and how this can result in conflicts with American attitudes towards vacations.  His struggles with gym workouts highlight the French health conundrum: the French seem to eat fatty, buttery foods with abandon, they smoke like chimneys, and according to Gopnik, have an aversion to rigorous exercise-so why are their life expectancies still higher than ours?  In addition to discussing life in France, Gopnik also describes episodes in his son's development. Parents may find these descriptions charming, but some readers may find them tedious.

The book is quite entertaining, sometimes thought-provoking, and would make good reading matter for anyone thinking of traveling to or living in France
