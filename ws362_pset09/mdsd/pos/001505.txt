This workbook is a wonderful aid to the student of church history. Putting the major movements of the development of the Christian church into chart form, this book will give you a ready reference to put people and important  church situations in  chronological context. Most charts include brief  statements of appropriate theology or doctrine, allowing the student to  quickly glance at the movement of the church. I'd highly recommend this as  a resource to anyone interested in church history
