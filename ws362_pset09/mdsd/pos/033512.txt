This book is a classic from the 1960's, and a winner of the Caldecott Medal.  I've always loved it, and now I can pass it on to my young nephew.  It follows the activities of a young boy during perhaps his first snowfall.  The illustrations are unique, and it's a great read-to or read-with book for young children and those just learning how to read. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good book with lots of pictures for kids from 2 to 5/6 years old.  It's also a great way to introduce snow to kids who live in parts of the country/world where snow doesn't often or never falls.  Enjoy
