Of the 30 or so books I've read in the last two years on brain-based behavior, this ranks at the top of the list. Not only is it engagingly and compassionately written, but Baron-Cohen seems to empathize well with the careful reader, anticipating questions and objections as they arise and addressing them clearly. 

I find his scientific research solid and painstakingly presented, far beyond what psychologists typically provide. Those who criticize the author for compartmentalizing men and women didn't even read the book, I suspect. That is so far off the beam. 

Some adults with Asperger's (and parents of Aspie kids) do have an ax to grind -- and they grind it loudly. They feel they or their children are the ones with the "normal" -- even "gifted" -- brains and it is everyone else who acts abnormally.  This defensiveness seems an obvious reaction to being so misunderstood. One can see their point more clearly after reading books like this.  

To those living with partners, parents, or children who are higher on the autistic spectrum, this book bridges a gap to understanding and, in many cases, healing hurts. If we expect "normal" levels of empathy from these loved ones, we set ourselves up for hurt because the lower-than-average level of empathy feels intentional, personal. Or, as a non-neuroscience-savvy therapist might say, "withholding."

 If we understand the differences, however, we can appreciate the good points and set aside expectations that only hurt and alienate everyone. 

The Guardian newspaper posted on its website an article on Baron-Cohen's theory as well as an interactiive quiz to test your empathy and systems quotients.
