I liked the book very much. It tells a lot about what slaves went through during those times. It gives a lot of details, and it is kind of like a story. It has a beginning, middle, and end, but it is a non fiction book. The perspective of each person in the story gives you their own point of view.
But, having a lot of different people in the story can be distracting. It is also hard to read because none of the words have been reworded to be able to read better. It also has a lot of bad interjections that would be inappropriate for a 4th or 5th grader. All in all, this is a great book, and I suggest that everyone read it
