I came across this novel quite by chance.  I was browsing in the bookstore, and the summary on the back of the book sounded like material I would be interested in.  I am glad I found it.  I like this book for several reasons.  Egan has the ability to take a real-life issue, such as the change in society from manufacturing to technology, and write about it in the medium of fiction so that she is not merely informing us but moving us.  Her characters are the major strength of the book.  Her main character is troubled and mysterious, but ultimately, likable.  Other side characters are heartbreaking for their suffering.  One main character, Moose, is fascinating, and, at times, depressingly disturbing.  However, Egan is not writing to lull us into peace.  She writes to open our eyes to the inhuman havoc our landscape and culture wreak upon the human psyche.  If you are looking for a gripping plot, interesting characters, and most importanlty, an intellectually engaging novel, this is for you.  I recommend it enthusiastically.
