Don't be fooled into thinking this is yet another in the recent deluge of TDVC clones trying to cash in on the prevailing fad about "code and quest" novels, because it isn't. This is a soundly-composed, affectionately written literary mystery that dangles the possibility before us that prior to his untimely death in the war for Greek independence, George Gordon, Lord Byron had set his hand to a novel. The tormented, dynamic spirit of the Romantic Age's rock star poet is masterfully revived here in what I found a completely convincing and elemental story worthy of Byron himself. The plot unfolds in a way that straddles the stormy past of the early 19th century, and also the email-heavy 21st. The protagonist, a woman, a rarity among these sorts of tales, tackles the intellectual challenge before her in an admirably proficient scholarly and yet also intuitive way that adds dimension to her that I found lacking in the main characters of other recent books to which this will no doubt endure comparison. I enjoyed this novel quite a lot and was pleasantly surprised that with its "off the beaten path" plot about a poet and his age, it ever saw the underbelly of a printing press. Two years ago this novel might have languished in manuscript form and this time next year the climate might shift again, but for now this represents a pleasant addition to the best seller lists of this decade and I'm glad I found it
