City Lights Books in San Francisco continues its avant-garde mission with the launching of its own &quot;Noir&quot; crime series, and Carlo Lucarelli's &quot;Almost Blue&quot; is a superlative debut thriller. A serial killer dubbed the Iguana slashes university students in Bologna and assumes their identities. Detective Grazia Negro, recently transplanted from Rome and unfamiliar with this other city, ends up relying upon Simone, a blind broad-band radio voyeur, to help locate the Iguana through his &quot;green&quot; voice. Lucarelli has crafted a word collage to tell the tale -- multiple first person voices, thoughts interwoven with descriptions, music and lyrics by Chet Baker, Elvis Costello, and Nine Inch Nails. Oonagh Stransky's translation is amazing; I wonder if she wrote this, it's that good. If you like the &quot;Mask Noir&quot; series from Serpent's Tail and Soho Crime series authors, you'll love this
