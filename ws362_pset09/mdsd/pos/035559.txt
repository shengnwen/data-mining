Any open minded person that reads this book will quickly discover the obvious;  The Black community in Shaker Heights, Ohio is in deep need of Dr. Phil McGraw's "Self Matters."  Ogbu produces page upon page of community respondents culturally brainwashed to focus their intellect on a history they have not lived, and an available future that they cannot fathom.  Ogbu's tone is harsh.  His main argument:  The Black community's cultural beliefs and practices are not conducive to success in academics.  This is where the controversy lies.  Because the book doesn't blame the testing gap on White racism, his analysis must be wrong.  Simply read what students themselves are saying and draw your own conclusions
