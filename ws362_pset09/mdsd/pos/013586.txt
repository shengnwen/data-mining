Browning asserts an interesting thesis regarding the Einsatzgruppen; these were the death squads who adminstered conquered lands and carried out the final solution in places where they could or did not ship the jews to camps.  He establishes the backround of a particular Police Battalion. 

These individuals were not hardened Nazi's nor fanatical SS; nor were they even that keen on gunning down Jews.  The argument that Browning makes is that anti-semitism was created in these individuals by killing jews.  In order to cope with murdering, they became anti-semetic.  When their commander announced their first action, he was in tears and offered an exception to whomever did not want to do this.  Soldiers cried, looked the other way when some jews tried to escape, establishing a character that challenges our assumptions.  

As time went on, the soldiers became used to this, and would have to joke around with each other while shooting jews.  There were some instances of drunken debauchery that will break your heart as well: instances of cruelty that boggles the mind.
