I thought this book was a fun read.  I loved the secondary characters and how the whole story unfolded and the many twists and turns it took along the way.  Phillipa was a brave girl who had a giving heart and a fire in her spirit.  This book was fun to read and kept me on my toes wondering what might come next.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of all the fighting between the two characters.  I don't mind some fighting, but I don't like it when they are constantly going at it all the time. I just wished everyone didn't make fun of Phillipa's height.  It got kind of mean and old after awhile.  I believe there is a fine balance and this one just tipped a little too far over to the hostility side.  But, don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this book.  There were some real funny and cute parts in it (i.e.my favorite was the mud scene).
