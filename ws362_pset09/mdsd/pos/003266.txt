I have not read either of the previous books in this trilogy.  I chose to read this on its own, not having read much science fiction before, and hearing this was the best of the three.

The most exciting part of reading this book was the philosophy that was tied into the science fiction. I found the questions profound and thought-provoking, and it really is irrelevant, to me, whether Stephen Baxter did a sufficient job in posing answers to them. I think that is beside the point. 

This was one of only a handful of science-fiction books I've read, and it moved along quickly most of the way through, although it lagged for about fifty pages in the middle of the book.  The physics and scientific parts of the book were descriptive and interesting, satisfying enough. The characters were a bit less so, although I still cared mostly about the two main characters, just not the supporting cast as much.

Baxter has current research of methane gases being released from the permafrost thawing, which has been discussed recently in the news. His exploration into a society during and after global warming occurs I found highly interesting.

I recommend this book particularly to those who haven't read much science fiction but want to branch out and try it. The opportunity for the reader to spend some time thinking about what our lives might be like due to global warming concerns is worth the price of the book. I think the questions the author introduces, while they aren't unique, are relevant and somewhat haunting.
