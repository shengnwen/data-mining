Frank Vincent is an interesting dude and I bought this as a lark and was hoping for a few laughs. What I got was a ton of laughs and surprisingly, some really good suggestions and tips on how to have some fun and be a man. Frank's a throwback. He is old school. He likes women and he respects them. He has lived a heckuva life, too.

Over the top? A little. Is Frank a little deluded? Perhaps. But Frank Vincent is a man's man. He is polished and a gentlemen. He is refined and well mannered. He is confident and treats ladies right. And boy is he funny. But the jokes shouldn't overshadow some of the content and in my opinion, it didn't. Look past the Vegas stuff, I am sure he got something out of those plugs, and if he didn't -- he better go get his shinebox! Seriously, he gives great tips on hosting parties (i.e., music, food, drink, decorations), grooming, talking to ladies, selecting wines and scotches and smokes. He dresses sharp and talks about grooming in a macho way that is sort of "queer eye-ish" yet subtle enough to call a guy out on his appearance (i.e., nails, hair etc.) as well as clothing and accessories. His interview with Steven Van Zandt was super.

It's a fast read and wildly entertaining. And the bonus is he actually has some excellent points. Don't mock it 'till you try it!

Peace
