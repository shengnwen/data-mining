Nancy Pearl, Booklust (Sasquatch Books, 2003)

Let the reader beware: picking this book up and reading through it cover to cover will put you on a path that may take you years, of not decades, to finish traversing.

Booklust is, quite simply, a book of book recommendations. Unlike most books of this type, Pearl doesn't focus on one genre; her recommendations span the gamut. A reader with far-flung tastes will pick up hundreds of recommendations here, few of which he's likely to have read (my TBR list grew by over three hundred titles in the course of reading this).

Another warning: it will take you about ten times as long to read as the normal two-hundred-fifty page book. You'll be stopping every ten seconds to write down another title. ***
