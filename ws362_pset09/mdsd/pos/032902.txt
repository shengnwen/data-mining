If you're looking for your muse, this book is it. Beautiful photography, galvanizing descriptions of not only the food but how it's grown, cared for and prepared. There's no need to limit yourself to the art of food, but if you're a food artist, you came to the right place. But any artist will feel at home with this book. Putting FLC & Bouchon together is an inspired idea, synergy writ large
