This is a great book to pick up and read when you are going through nail biting withdraws of just wanting to call the guy that just broke your heart. It puts the reality back into perspective and helps you redeem yourself. It puts reality on how you will feel after you have called and he has dumped on you again and what a set back that is. So instead of calling and making a fool out of yourself, pick up this book and read it until the longing goes away.
