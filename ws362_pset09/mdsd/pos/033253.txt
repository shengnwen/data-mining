In the 7th book in the Scumble River mystery series, the small town is preparing for the largest yard sale to ever hit their stretch of Route 66 in Illinois.  Skye Denison, on summer break from her job as a school psychologist, has taken on the job of event coordinator for the huge sale.  Making additional money over the summer has become a priority to her, as the cottage she has been renting is now for sale.  Wanting to purchase her rental home, Skye tries her hand at her third job this summer...as the previous two ended badly.  Her normal summer job is to be a lifeguard, but when goose droppings close down the swimming area, she seeks a different job working in an antique's store.  Skye is quickly fired after telling a potential seller that the owner of the business, Cookie Caldwell, has underbid on the valuable item.  

It seems that Cookie is not well liked in her new home of Scumble River, and after Skye takes over the job of yard sale organizer, she stays away from her prior boss.  But when Cookie is found dead in a large antique that is for sale at the Denison booth, the sheriff begins to suspect that Skye harbored hard feelings over her termination.  When another victim appears with ties to Skye, she becomes nervous and investigates the case...even though forbidden by the disgruntled, harried sheriff.  Skye solves another case just in the nick of time, and somehow manages to find a way to mend several broken relationships in the process. 

This is a great series!  This book was one of my favorite installments, and I loved the unique setting of a city-wide yard sale.  It was nice to see Skye at a job other than in the school system...and I like the mystery surrounding Skye's love life.  Simon has become quite a stale character in the series, and I was happy to see a little bit of zip in Skye's step again over a potential romantic interest.   A great addition to the cozy genre! 

The first book in the series is called "Murder of a Small-Town Honey".  Enjoy!
