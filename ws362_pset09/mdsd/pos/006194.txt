Don't get discouraged just by the title. Usually when you see "3 minutes" for an entire workout you think its a scam. It is not. This book is great. Kurt teaches you about the abdominals and importance of them. He also informs you what sections you will be strenghening. The program is nuts! For three days you work different parts of your abs: obliques, lower abs and upper abs. Whats convenient is the exercises are only 3 minutes. But also they work. You can feel the excruciating burn in your abs. The program is very challenging. Before I was doing 500 situps after every workout. After I do the ab workout that Kurt offers in this book I feel like I just completed 500 situps or more. I've only been doing this for a week but I will say this is honestly the bast ab workout ever. And if you diet, workout, do cardio, and do this simple 3 minute routine you'll get the results you want.
