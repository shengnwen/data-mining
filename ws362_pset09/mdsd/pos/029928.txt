What a refreshing book! No cliched reminiscences of golden days afield here. Rather, Paul Schullery uses his training as a historian to examine the history of a classic fly, the authorship of classic trout literature  and all manner of fly fishing icons.  Throughout, his tone is genial but  mildly cranky (he reminds me of Arnold Gingrich at his best).  Go buy this  book
