Too many advice books talk down to the readers; not everybody is scared to find playfulness alongside of Plato. This is like hearing what youf best friend's older sister says about her boyfriends and sex: it's honest and funny and TRUE. Great supportive wedding book, esp, for those entering a second marriage
