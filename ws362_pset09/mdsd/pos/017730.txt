J.C. Masterman's &quot;The Double-Cross System: The Incredible True Story of How Nazi Spies Were Turned into Double Agents&quot; should be required reading for all counterintelligence and other human intelligence (HUMINT) personnel.  Even after a 20+ year career as a human intelligence professional myself, this is one of the few &quot;spy&quot; books that I have.  I consider this book a counterintelligence &quot;how to&quot; text book.  To get the full impact of this book, I suggest first reading Ladaslas Farago's &quot;Game of the Foxes&quot;, based on the files of Nazi Germany's intelligence service.  After reading the German side of the story, the full impact of J.C. Masterman's book and this amazing intelligence operation will hit you right between they eyes
