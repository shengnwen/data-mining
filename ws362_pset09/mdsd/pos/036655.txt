This is a pretty good book. The two main characters in the book are Cloyd Atcitty and Walter Landis, an old farmer. This book is about a 14 year old boy named Cloyd who is part of a Native American tribe called the Utes. Cloyd isn't a very intelligent boy because he has been skipping school for years. Cloyd has been sent to Walter in Colorado to help him do some chores. The conflict in this book is between Walter and Cloyd; Cloyd finds out that Walter has some friends who hunt bears. Once Cloyd finds out about Walter's friends, he destroys a part of Walter's farm. The setting of the story is around an isolated farm in Colorado. Near this farm Cloyd fines a turquoise stone in a cave up high in the mountains, it's a carving of a bear. The Utes have a special relationship with bears so this stone is a very special to Cloyd. 
This book has an action and adventure genre. Bearstone is for those readers who like to read a book about a boy who goes to the mountains alone, and goes to a gold mine with a friend. I think this book has a good story line and readers won't get lost while reading it. Readers of 9 and up will enjoy this book.
