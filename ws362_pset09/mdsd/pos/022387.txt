I read this book while I was still pregnant with my first child.  It was such an amazing inspiration.  It included sweet ideas of how to express cute actions of love & positivity for your children.  The prayers and scriptures were very motivational and reminded me, once again, that God's glory is great for the mind, body, & soul and is all you need when it seems that your daily routine has steered you away from the  positive mental attitude you woke up with (with which you intended to face the new day). This book reminds you to take those necessary moments to pray and remain spritually focused to enable yourself to have the power of a positive mom and wife, as well as impacting the lives of your family with words of encouragement of God's eternal love. After reading the first couple of chapters, I decided to start highlighting and book-marking certain paragraphs and pages that I wanted to refer back to once my son was born.  Before I knew it, almost the entire book had been highlighted bright yellow and mini post-its were stuck in between so many pages it buldged. I have bought this book for 3 of my friends who have loved it just the same!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! God Bless
