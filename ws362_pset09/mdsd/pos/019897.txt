I am a fourth generation Chinese American living in California.  I loved this well written, lyrical and engaging book, and recommend it to all.  I have not read much about the Chinese-Canadian immigrant experience, and this book was very rewarding in terms of telling the story of the Chinese in Canada in the background of the  main story line.  The characters are extremely vivid in the book, and one really cares about Su-Jen (aka Annie) right away.  The author does a very good job of sketching the lonely life of this isolated Chinese family in this small Canadian town.  I particularly felt she handled incidents of racial discrimination experienced by the sensitive Annie during elementary school very poignantly.  You really  feel for this little Chinese girl, stuck between this lovely unhappy mother, a frustrated and good looking half brother, a traditional but kindly father, and her Canadian white classmates.  It is a great read.
