Book #7 in the In Death Series.
In this book there is a serial killer out there who dresses like Santa and kills people while leaving a gift representing one of the 12 days of Christmas and a tattoo that says their his true love.
This is a creepy Christmas tale.  The love hate relationship between Peabody and McNab heats up as they are forced to work together undercover in a dating service.  An interesting and different murder mystery with some surprisingly heroic moments from all the characters.
Peabody gives a jerk a bloody nose.  As always there's a whole lot of comedy and romance mixed in
