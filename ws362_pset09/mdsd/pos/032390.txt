I picked up this book used to get me started writing my first resume.  It offered serveral examples of good resumes, along with a few bad.  It also offered examples of cover letters.  I found the book very informative.  The introduction set a good foundation for me to focus on while writing the resume.  I was very happy with the results and would definitely recommend this book
