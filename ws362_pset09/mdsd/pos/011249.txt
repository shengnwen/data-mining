At first, I thought that Smith was mining the same ground as Andrea Levy's SMALL ISLAND: examining the lives of immigrants in postwar London and tracing the routes that had brought them there. But while Smith does not quite have Levy's intensity, she spreads her net wider, dealing with several different cultures (Bengali, Jamaican, Jewish intellectual, and British working-class) over a span of three generations, only the first of which coincides with Levy's. Eventually it becomes clear that her main focus is on the youngest generation (presumably her own), and she chronicles the troubled nineties with sharp observation, vivid and often colloquially profane language, and considerable humor. I felt that the narrative lost coherence and the plotting became less plausible as the number of characters increased, though it may just be that I had less time to read. But Smith's central theme --- the difficulty of maintaining cultural identity in a strange land --- is extremely well addressed and chillingly relevant
