I bought this book for my 13yo son as a supplement to his 8th grade history.  He ended up reading almost the whole book the first day it arrived, even though I planned to use it for several weeks.  Since then, he has reread several sections, and really enjoys it. 

There is a lot of information in this book (as might be expected from a DK book.)  Each year has at least a 2 page spread with lots of pictures and around 4 short articles. (These articles are interesting enough that not only my 11 & 13yo sons have read them, but I also was quite interested by many of them.) In addition, there is a short box at the bottom of the pages for the year with short headlines for other important events of the year, in medicine, sports, politics, entertainment, etc.  Many years have 4-6 pages dedicated to them, instead of only 2.  

There are also introductory pages with features like what children of the past thought the late 20th/early 21st century would be like, what modern day children think are the best and worst things about the past century, children's thoughts and hopes for the 21st century, etc. 

Overall, this book is an excellent starting point for any child or teen wanting to know more about the 20th century.  It is even a pretty good starting point for adults.  (Teens and adults will want to find more books or other sources to learn more about their favorite eras/topics, however.
