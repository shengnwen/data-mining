The Camel Club is back in this new book by David Baldacci.  We first met the Camel Club in the book of the same name.  The Camel Club is a group of four men; the unlikeliest group of people you would ever think would be friends.  Their occupations range from cemetery caretaker to a conservator of rare books in the Library of Congress. While some people might call them conspiracy theorists, they prefer to think of themselves as observers of the government.  

When the Speaker of the House is gunned down, the blame was laid at the door of terrorists.  But the Camel Club is not convinced of that, especially when the wealthy director of Rare Books and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress dies in a strange manner.  The coroner rules death by natural causes, but the Camel Club is not convinced and sets out to get the answer.

And then to throw some more grease on the fire, the author brings in Annabelle Conroy, a scheming con artist who plans on walking off with $30 million dollars swindled from an Atlantic City casino.  

A thoroughly fun read, I enjoyed it immensely.  Although a long book (432 pages) it only dragged in one place, a fact easily overlooked.
