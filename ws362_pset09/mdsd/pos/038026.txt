I really enjoyed reading this book to my own child, and he requested it again, which carries more weight with me than popularity and gimmicky-ness (I avoid digitally produced illustrations if at all possible).  The illustrations in this book appear to be a combination of line, charcoal, and watercolor, and very unassuming, almost childlike themselves. The repetitive nature of the storyline allows the child to participate in the story whether by reading it or not, and predict the next event.  In the end, one gets the feeling that all of the animals are conspiring with the bird in transforming the farmer's attitude about the importance of posessing his hat.  We were all happy for the farmer that he got a new hat out of it, and for the bird that he got to keep his new nest
