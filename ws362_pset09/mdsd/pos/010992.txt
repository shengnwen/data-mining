This is a very difficult book, but also very rewarding for people with patience.  I usually find experimental writing gimmicky, but the Atrocity Exhibition is haunting, paranoid, claustrophobic.  Readers should be in the write state of mind to deal with a sometimes unpleasant read; those who do are usually transformed by it.  This is a stunning work; I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the edition...
