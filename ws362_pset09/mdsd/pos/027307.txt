I have read the majority of Lee Childs' Reacher novels.  They are always enjoyable.  Reacher is a fascinating character...brutal, engaging and entertaining.  

The story starts off with a bang.  You are immediately thrown into Reacher trying to save a kid from a firefight on a college street.  It is an interesting situation where you thought you knew Reacher and you are surprised by how he handled the situation until you hear more about it as it is retold early on in the book.  

Reacher is faced with going up against an old aquaintence that he is shocked to find still kicking around causing trouble.  To say that Reacher hates this man, Quinn, is to put it mildly and you can sense and feel Reacher's desire to do whatever it takes to take him down hard.  

The novel takes Reacher undercover in search of another undercover agent who has gone missing in this family of rug dealers whom Reacher and a part of the government obviously feel is something much more than just selling and importing rugs.  The story is slow building and the 'mystery' begins to unravel as Reacher imbeds himself as security detail for this family.

The final 40 pages are riveting, brutal and face paced.  Overall, the novel for me was a 3-star effort, but the solid ending and solid beginning make up for the often slow moving middle of the story.  Another good Reacher novel..
