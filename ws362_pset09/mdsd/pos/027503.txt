I read this book so frequently when I was a child that my copy literally fell apart.  I've now purchased a copy to read to my own son and am sure that he will enjoy the story of the determined fox family that consistently outwits the greedy farmers just as much as I did.  I always liked Roald Dahl's books because they were not the usual sunshine and teddy bear genre of most children's books.  Instead, the focus is on overcoming adversity with a bit of humor and a lot of sass
