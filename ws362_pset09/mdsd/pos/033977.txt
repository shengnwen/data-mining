My mother bought this book for me since I was a very shy and reserved child.  She is a teacher and wanted to help me overcome the shyness.  We read this book together and as Elizabeth Ann became Betsy, I began to open up as well.  The growth of this little girl is evident and you really want her to achieve things.  She is so likable as well as the other characters in the book.  Dorothy Canfield Fisher should be congratulated in this "growing up" kind of book.  This is a must read for any girl, even the not so shy to understand what others go through.  I can't wait to read it to my 4 year old  and 11 month old girls!  A real treasure of literature
