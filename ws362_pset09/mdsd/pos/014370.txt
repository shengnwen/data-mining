I'm 54 years old and have had grey hair for about 10.  When I heard the author on NPR, I decided I had to read her little book, even though I've haven't seen childhood for a long time.  Since then, I've given a copy to 5 "grown-ups".  This book is especially wonderful for those of us in a 12 Step program.  So, open  your mind and  your heart and read The HigherePower of Lucky
