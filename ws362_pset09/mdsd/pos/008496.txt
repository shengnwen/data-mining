I seem to be working backward with my Women's Murder Club reviews, but I get what I can when I can from our library exchange program.  This is the best of the WMC books since 1st to Die, and maybe even a little better on some levels.  Cold blooded kids are everywhere these days, and Lindsey's account with the two juveniles who shoot at her and her partner after going on a nasty killing spree is bone chilling, not to mention that the court case is riveting as well.  

Also, we get a double feature of sorts as Lindsay gets tied up in a series of brutal murders while staying at her sister's house that will leave you guessing until the end about who is doing it.  I will admit that I figured out early on who one of the murderers was, but was completely wrong about another.  The thing that surprised me most was that I was under the impression there were only two people involved.  The third party was a real shocker, but I won't give that one away.  Lindsay solves this one with almost no help from her WMC friends, and the story is stronger in some ways due to that fact.  Thouroughly enjoyable from start to finish, don't miss 4th of July, which also introduces us to newcomer Yuki Castellano.
