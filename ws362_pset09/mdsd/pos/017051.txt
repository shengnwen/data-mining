My therapist recommened this book and what a great find.  Coming from an abusive alcoholic family, and until I read this book didnt realize I was one of these women.  It points stuff out that make you realize your not alone and your actions are for good reason.  It did have a lot of Personal Accounts and stories, but all in all, its a great book
