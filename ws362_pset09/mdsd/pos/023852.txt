Unlike the books written by Michael Nelson, this former MST3K writter's offering is more art than humor. He uses the seemingly silly stunt of seeing a movie eery day for a year as a way of talking about film in general. He shows us how theatre goers reflect society in genral, and how much the rise of megaplexes has taken away something of the specialness of seeing films.

There are moments in this book where Kevin relats painful, personal stories about his exploits, and other moments when he uses this book as a pulpit to preach to us about our behavior as fans. At other moments, this becomes an interesting slice of history, chronicling what films were out in 2001, and which ones we should try and forget from that year
