Subtitled "An Entertainment," this terrific 1958 work surely is much more than that. Wormold, a failing vacuum cleaner salesman in Havana, is divorced and the father of Milly, his ravishing and very Catholic 17-year-old daughter. Desperate for money to satisfy Milly's extravagant expectations, Wormold is drawn into the shady world of British espionage. Completely perplexed as to what to do but needing to justify the money he's earning, Wormold begins to cite real people as his agents, invent covert activities, and write plots and counterplots in his reports back to the home office in London. The London office loves his work so much that they send him a secretary and an accountant to support his obviously important operation. Of course, London doesn't know who Wormold's reporting on; they could be the Americans, the Germans, the Russians, or the "rebels." All too soon, Wormold's fictions spin out of control and the line between invention and reality vanishes. 
I was struck not only by the economy of Greene's effortless and crisp writing, his rich array of characters, the metaphors that worked so well, and Greene's hilarious satire and comedy, but also by the resonance this story has with today's world of secret agencies, events spinning out of control, and the absurdity of our blind faith-based leaders as they invent their own reality. Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld are a perfect fit in Greene's London home office. If Greene were with us today, he would have no shortage of material to write about, although he might be hard pressed to find jocularity among today's dangerous, thick-skinned philistines
