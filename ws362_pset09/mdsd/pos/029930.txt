Andrew Isenberg presents an array of complex and systemic causes that brought about the near extinction of the North American bison.  The author's breadth of knowledge related to the bison demise is incredible.   The reader is not bored with endless details behind these knowledge blocks,  however.  Rather, in fairly short order, the reader understands how  climatology, geography, economics, sociology, migration and immigration,  policy, and anthropology all played a role in the bison's destruction.  And  while the author presents an incredibily well researched description of the  bison's destruction, along the way, the reader learns volumes about how  Native Americans lived, changed their lifestyles, and were linked to the  bison.  The reference listings are impressive for those needing further  information and authentication.  Anyone interested in how the American  plains were settled and shaped, this is an enjoyable read.  For the  researcher, this book is a gold mine
