In her Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series Hamilton pioneered a unique synthesis of horror and eroticism.  In this first volume of a new series, Hamilton takes sex to new levels.  On the surface, Merry Gentry is a lovely young woman making a living as a private investigator in Los Angeles for a firm that specializes in supernatural problems.  Merry's magical talents are enough to keep her employed, but nothing to write home about.  Especially if home is the high court of the Faerie world.  In fact, Merry is a faerie princess on the run from relatives who would kill her in an instant.  She fled the Unseelie Court after realizing that Queen was turning a blind eye to her son's attempts to assassinate Merry.  But now Merry's running is over.  An unfortunate encounter with a magical substance called Bronwyn's Tears has revealed Merry's true identity to the world.  She is forced to return to the Unseelie Court to face the wrath of the Queen, her aunt.  But three years has changed much at court and Merry just may have a way to save her life and help her friends.  Although the Anita Blake books contain uninhibited sex, in this book Hamilton outdoes herself, creating a supernatural culture that thrives on sex and pain.  The fey world is filled with unusual and sensual species and Merry is a girl with a healthy appetite.  Hamilton's writing about fight and battle scenes are just as sharp as her sex scenes.  This book is a promise of great experiences to come
