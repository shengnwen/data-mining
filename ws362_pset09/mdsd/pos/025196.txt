Gabaldon has built a huge fanbase on her Outlander series which spans literary genres from romance to science fiction to just about everything in between. Lord John Gray is a minor character in the seris, and never one of my favorites. When I heard that Gabaldon had written a mystery novel in which he takes center stage I read it more out of a sense of loyalty to the author than a genuine sense of interest in the character. I was surprised by how enjoyable I found it. Obviously the book is musch smaller in scope and size than the Outlander books (which average about 1000+ pages each) but Gabaldon establishes Lord John as a highly sympathetic caharacter in his own right, and tells a story almost completely separate from the series on which she made her name. Naturally this is jarring to readers initially, but going into the book with an open mind and no expectations yields rewards from a skilled novelis
