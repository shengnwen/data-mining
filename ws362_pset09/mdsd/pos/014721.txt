The Diaries of Adam and Eve is a great book for pleasure reading or for research.  It isn't as well known as some of Twain's other works, but it displays his amazing wit and sense of humor.  Adam is a couch potato, while Eve is a stereotypical chatterbox.  The book is set up as a series of diary entries by both Adam and Eve.  These entries tell the creation story in a fresh, amusing way.  Twain may have been influenced by Milton's epic poem "Paradise Lost.
