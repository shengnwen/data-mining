It's been a chore being a fan of Stephen King's these last ten years. This stellar book made all the time and money I spent buying and reading such dreck as From a Buick 8 and Dreamcatchers worth the effort.

Lisey's Story bears a passing resemblance to Rose Madder in that both stories feature female protagonists who must escape into another world to escape the harm present in ours.  Lisey is much better than Rose.  For the first time in over a decade I can recommend a book King's written without hesitation.  

Allow yourself to start this journey, and you'll soon be caught up in the spell of Stephen King's best work in ages
