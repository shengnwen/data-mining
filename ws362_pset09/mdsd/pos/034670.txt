I ranked this 4th best of 7 "decorating small spaces" books I bought.  One unit featured in it had enough useable ideas for me
that it justified its price.  Pros: great photos & blueprints; variety of sizes (300-1,000 sq ft) & tastes shown. Cons: European-NY exclusivity (more on this in my NOTE in review of "Small Apartments"); many featured homes shriek "interior designer," i.e., all about aesthetics rather than liveability (pebble floors, molded plastic chairs, etc.). Speaking of impractical: one of the 8 featured homes is a modernist London dwelling, 11-and-a-half ft. wide, seven stories high, with one room per floor. She should have decorated the owner's elevator, as that must be where he spends all his time
