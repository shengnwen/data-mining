I selected this book at an airport because I wanted something short to read on a long flight. I was amazed I had not heard of this memori before! I could not put this book down and found Judith's words and her style courageous.

I think the other reviewers have touched on what this memoir is very well, but I wanted to put my voice her as well. This memoir is worth a read for anyone. I am glad to see that a thin person reviewed it as well as heavy people. As a person who has struggled with my weight and body image for most my life I felt particularly drawn to the title and the story within.

Judith is strong to put down on paper the blunt truth about her situation. She went through a lot of pain and continues to work on herself. She does not ask for pity or forgiveness, but at the very least I hope everyone can find some compassion for the heavy people they see on the street.

I highly recommend this memoir.
