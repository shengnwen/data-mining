Original socialists (sic) wanted to emancipate the honest workman. Undereducated, he was not well equipped to improve this position or negotioate. 

At least in Europe, there was some success... between 1880 and 1920! They got -somewhat- liberated.

Ever since, instead of freeing people, the socialist wanted to develop a nanny state, where Mother Knows Best(tm). And as the State grew, freedom deminished.

It's pretty amazing so many people still fall for the trap of the Do-gooders, who lead people to believe they can get all kinds of freebies on OTHER man's wallet.  

Yet the only thing they achieve, is distributing money OUT of the wallet of average people, making them more dependent, and less able to lead their own lives, and make ends meet.

Now everybody turns to the state for answers. Most money is however wasted to endless bureaycracy, not end-goals.

Do-gooders very eloquently shows how this develops, the attitudes, reactions of people. Real world examples. I just hope many people read this. Once you do, not only do people immediately recognise them to be true, they might see the emerging trend.

I don't remember who said this: "Knowledge is favourable to liberty. Educate the people and they will apply the remedy."

This is another startingpoint.. A good one, too
