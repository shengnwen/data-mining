Many people have complained about the pace and tone of this series, but if you start with the first ("Hotel Paradise") and carry through, they are delightful and far better written than the Jury books (which always strike me as near-miss, since the basic idea often is fine but they are B-grade writing and plotting).  I really love this series (including what people complain about as "bratty" or "mean" behavior by Emma, although I'm a little puzzled as to exactly what decade they are in, and how old her mother must be, for the various time intervals mentioned as history to work) and can't wait to read more.  I particularly like the maybe-supernatural touches, and Emma's observations (and her development of coping skills, and even a conscience) about the world.

I hope that Martha Grimes will focus on this series, and let us hear more from Emma
