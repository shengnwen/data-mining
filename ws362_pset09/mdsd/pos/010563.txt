I have read all the Sara Linton-books, and I am finally starting to like them. Faithless moves fast with a very interesting plot, and it is hard to put down, once you've started it. 

Sara and Jeffrey are having the usual relationship-problems, and I am at the point where I want to them figure out if they are going to marry again or just split up. Sara seems to be the one having the most difficulties, and I sincerely hope the next book solves their problems. Same with detective Lena Adams, now we need to see Lena growing into a woman, instead of acting like a spoiled child, all her trauma considered.

When the characters has been laid out, we move on to the horrifying case they have to work with: young girls being buried alive in the woods. Pretty soon the investigations lead to a religious sect, which is not, so it seems, very likeable. The members of the sect act strange, and everything they say and don't say seems suspicious.

What has happened to the buried girls, and how far back in time does Sara and Jeffrey have to go, until they get to the bottom of this case? I was very well entertained while reading this, and am looking forward to the next one, out any day now
