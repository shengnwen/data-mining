The story is about a year of a family's life in a log cabin in a forest in Wisconsin.  The main character is Laura, who lives with her Ma, Pa, older sister Mary and baby sister Carrie.  We follow them as they collect food for the winter, deal with dangers, like bears and cold winters, and make a life for themselves in the middle of the big woods.  The details are somewhat realistic, like how to make Johnny cakes, maple sugar and cheese, yet there seems to be a lot of fun times.  I think it is a well balanced story and I remember my Mom reading it to me when I was a child.
