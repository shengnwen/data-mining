This review needn't be long, for the title tells it all.  Whether you want to know the origin of blue jeans, dental floss or a comb, you'll find it here.  Because for some reason or another, I am on an unfulfillable quest to always know more and more, this is the type of book I love, and one I'd recommend more than any of the others I've read.

The book is broken up very nicely into setions so the thoughts are coherent and the content flows.  This is actually a book you can read before bed or on the train - rather than others written in similar style, but that are better for reference.

Enjoy
