I am going on a cruise to Alaska this August and this book has all the information about the areas of Alaska that you can visit, so I feel for the money, it is an excellent investment!  However, I would suggest purchasing the current Frommer's guide to go along with it because it has the most current and up to date contact informaton for all of the excursions that you can take when you are at port in the cities you will be visiting.
