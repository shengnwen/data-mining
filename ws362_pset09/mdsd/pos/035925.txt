I think this book was a little scary in the begining, but in the end it was a very good book and was worth to take the time for.  I think that a lot of people would enjoy this book.  I thought that the Mason's would adopt them and that they will always be together, but I guess I was wrong.  I also think they should make a better ending instead of walking home. I read my mom the first chapter and she wouldn't let me read any more because she thought it was so sad. I think that they should have had Carlie run away and then come back because she realizes that she misses the Mason's and Carlie and Harvey so much
