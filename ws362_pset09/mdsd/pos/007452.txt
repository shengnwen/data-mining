THIS WAS MY FIRST NORA ROBERTS READ! WHAT A GREAT ONE IT WAS.  THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL DEVELOPED AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH KELSEY AND GABE.

IT SATISFIED MY OWN LOVE FOR THE HORSE WORLD, LOVE AND MYSTERY!  I ACTUALLY CRIED IN THE END AND WAS SAD TO HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THE CHARACTERS!

THIS IS A MUST READ.  I ONLY WISH NORA ROBERTS WOULD DELIGHT US AND PRODUCE ANOTHER NOVEL DELVING INTO THE FUTURE WORLD OF THE CHADWICKS AND BYDENS, AND NEW SLATER FAMILY.
