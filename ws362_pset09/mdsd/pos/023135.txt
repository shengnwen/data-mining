On a recent trip to Gran Canaria I planned to unwind, 7 days by the pool, beer in hand, three good books. I read all three but Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure proved to be streets ahead, what a great read! The appeal for me - his adventure being so far removed from normal daily life. This resulted in my imagination being able to wander at great speed. All the 'real-life distractions we fall victim too we're there also. Delightful, entertaining, gripping, a 'can't put it down' book. I am in no way a professional reviewer, just an ordinary bloke who enjoys a good read. Believe me therefore when I say 'this one is a good read'
