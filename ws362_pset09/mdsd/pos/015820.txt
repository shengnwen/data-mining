Irenaeus' work in refuting the Gnostics of his day provides an acute understanding of the problems facing the early orthodox church. Had Irenaues not dedicated himself I have to wonder what free-reign the Gnostics would have had as oral tradition declined and interpetation developed as a reliable understanding of truth. Irenaeus focused his attention on the Valentinian Gnostics and especially criticized the Gnostic Marcus. The notes in the book are remarkably helpful in determining what Gnostic heresies may have been preached against by the New Testament writers. Whats disappointing about the books is that the publisher only provides book one of Irenaues five book volume. The reader is forced to search on-line for the refutation volumes (the most important part) to understand Irenaeus principle view. The book is copyrighted in 1992 and part of an extended volume of ancient christian writers, therefore I'm not optimistic that further volumes will follow. I would still encourage any theological minded individual to make this book part of their library. As for the harden Catholic that previously used this book review as a proselytising forum, The translater (Dominic Unger) just lightly touches on the subject in the preface. As for Irenaeus, his argument is ment in the ecumenical sense of the Church of Christ that share the same tenets of faith. To classify Evangelicals in the same manner as the Gnostics is a dishonest exaggeration and she should have spent more time reading the book rather then writing a misleading agenda.
