What I enjoyed most about this deck is the universal appeal. For example the images of the God and Goddess cards include subtle symbolism that connects them with any cultural expression (Celtic, Germanic, Roman, Greek, etc).  The God card features Harvest Lord symbolism, waning & waxing year symbolism, woodland symbolism, warrior symbolism, and solar symbolism.  The Goddess card features celestrial symbolism, nature symbolism, and Underworld symbolism.  This type of depth makes the deck ideal for any tradition of Paganism, Witchcraft, or Wicca.

In addition to the general widespread Pagan connection and appeal, the deck also includes cards that are typically associated specifically with Witchcraft and Wicca.  However, in reality this is not entirely exclusive, as the companion book presents general themes of Paganism that are also associated with the cards.  Here again the deck shines in its universal application.

An exciting aspect of this deck is its unique use as a system of divination, a teaching tool, a ritual kit, and a source for guided imagery journeys.  This makes the deck ideal for solitary practitioners, and people who require privacy when practicing.  I read on a forum that military people are finding it useful to perform full moon rituals at sea or on base without drawing attention.  Another person noted that the deck would be ideal for prisoners, as the cards provide them with ritual tools that they cannot otherwise possess.

If you want a deck that speaks to you, and goes beyond the standard stuff we've all seen over and over again, then this is the deck for you.
