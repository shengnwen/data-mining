Gets to the Heart
I have read the whole series of books by David Pelzer, each is better than the last. I recommend these books to everyone I know whether they have been abused or not as they lend insight, courage and determination sometimes in the face where none exist. Again, This newest books shows the depth that david Pelzer is.

Also recommended: Nightmares Echo, All David Pelzer Books, Running With Scissor
