I loved this book.  Although, I, too, found it very far-fetched that Una met so many 'famous' people from the 19th century, I decided not to be mad at the author (or her editor) for that.  She, in my opinion, simply was carried away with her research.  I found that I really like Una and that was enough for me to suspend my skepticism.  I liked that she was so educated and liberal minded.  I loved her curiosity and independence.  I loved her passion and her unflinching love of life- no matter what price she paid for that life.  This was a big read that lasted me more than a couple of days (a major accomplishment!). In fact, I enjoyed Una as much as I love Scout, from To Kill A Mockingbird- very likeable and plucky young ladies! I thoroughly enjoyed the book and even shared some of it with my Creative Writing students.  AND, I've gone back to Moby Dick to remember all that Ahab's Wife brings up for me
