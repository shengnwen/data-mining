This book offered a lot of helpful information about detoxification through fasting.  It gave me step by step, what to do to cleanse my body through fasting.  However, I had read more than half of the book before I actually got any usable information.  For such a small book, I thought it would be packed with info and how-to's on detoxification, but it constantly tells you to buy her other book "How to Feel Great All The Time".  If you do lots of research on holistic health as I do,  there is a lot of general information about eating healthy and such in this book, which I already know a lot about.  If you know nothing about holistic health, this book will be an eye-opener
