In the past there was a boy named Benjamin McDonald a six-year-old boy who lived on Hawk's Hill.  Ben can communicate with animals.  He can communicate with animals better then he can communicate with people.   Ben does not really get along with his dad. One day Ben wanders away and meets a female badger.  Then at supper that night he tells his family about it, and his dad tells him to stay away from them. Ben does not like that so he runs away.  Will Ben survive?  I like this book because it is about  animals and people.  If you like adventures and animals you will like this book
