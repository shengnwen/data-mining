The Plague was a difficult read for me: I was used to the spareness of The Stranger, and I still find the Plague a bit too long (however, this serves to convey the length of time the people of Oran suffered).  It isn't the best-written book (Camus, did you HAVE a thesaurus?), but the idea is much more important.  
What makes us human?  Can things ever go back to the way they were?  Were things ever really that great?  Camus questions these things, and, like the great philosopher he was, he makes us answer them ourselves.  I personally liked Tarrou's question of how one can be a saint even if you don't believe in God.  
I can't write a really long review of this book, because you're meant to experience it yourself.  But always remember that we're never safe, so experience it soon!*
*P.S. I read this book in French, so some of my comments on style may differ due to translation differences
