This book provides a student or casual reader interested in Greek warfare and anthropological study a good base from which to work from. A little technical at times, he sometimes gets bogged down in some areas, but finishes brilliantly. With the history of Greek warfare fresh in your mind, it's a must to go into "Soul of Battle," right after - it's a wonderful transition into a supurb book on leadership.
