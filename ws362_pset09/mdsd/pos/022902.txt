It's a perfect book for anyone who wants to know more about soil ecology. It gives introductory basics on some soil chemistry and pedogenesis, but then dives fully into the different ecological processes (and a large section on the critters) at work. I'm using this book in a class I am taking and I would definitely recommend it. Its language is simple enough to express some of the more difficult concepts, but it is complex enough to keep you from being bored. Plenty of graphs, pictures, and studies to accompany readings
