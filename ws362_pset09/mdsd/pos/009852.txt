I have read the other reviews posted here for Love @ First Site and see that it is either a love it or hate it kind of book. I happen to be in the loved it catagory.

Jess is celebrating her 34 birthday and at this stage in her life she would love to find the right man to settle down with and start a family but to no avail. As a gift, one of her friends signs her up for an online dating service. Jess is against the idea at first but with the support of her friends she decides to at least try and we end up seeing Jess go through a few dates that just dont pan out as well as her friends expected.

With a supporting story about Jess' sister suffering from breast cancer, Love @ First Site is more than just your average chick lit. It is also a smart and not always funny look into the life of the average woman and not just about a 30 year old single desperate to find the love of her life.

If you are a fan of Jennifer Weiner or Jane Green, and have not tried Jane Moore yet you might want to give this book a whirl. You just might love it too
