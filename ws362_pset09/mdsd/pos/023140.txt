I have all her books and her writing is pure magic. The kind of book that holds mystery and an eerie sense of the past within it's pages.

The little poems are brillant, they transport me to another place and a timelessness. I adore the artwork within as well, it adds to the book immensely. Worth was obviously intune with the ways of nature and the traditional witch...she was born with it in her soul....as some of us are.

Don't miss this absolute sparkling gem of a book...a true treasure
