"Mothers who cry in the night" is a phenomenal read. It starts as a journal, looking for answers to the confusing enigma that is her child. As the answers make themselves known, so does the free spirit that is Bennett. We, the readers, take a swirling ride that is not only in the life of Betsie the adoring, saddened mother but also that of Bennett, a life-force uncomfortable in these earthly surroundings, searching for his own reality, his propose. It not only helped me to have a better understanding of the correlation between genius and addiction (self medicating), but also to better understand my own purpose in this life and what will come after. We are all the same journey and it has no conclusion, only growth.
