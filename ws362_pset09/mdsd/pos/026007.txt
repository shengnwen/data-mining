Although being a scholarly work, fully footnoted and with a complete bibliograpy this book, unlike much of academic production, is a great read.
I enjoyed it immensly. 
It is a good companion to Michael Channan's book on the same topic."Repeated Takes: A Short History of Recording and Its Effects on Music".
If you are interested in the history of recording or just curious about how what we listen to came to be the way it is this book will delight you
