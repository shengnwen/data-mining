I've read every Pendergast book, and Still Life with Crows is by far my favorite. So I tend to measure each book by Still Life. This book, while a lot better than the previous Dance of Death, still doesn't eclipse Still Life. However, it's good for what it is: a fairly predictable and formulaic Pendergast novel. But what's wrong with that? The formula is fun, Pendergast is an intriguing and neat character, and the expanding role of Constance Green is well worth a return trip to whatever Pendergast novel comes next
