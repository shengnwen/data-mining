For the hockey enthusiast or the novice reader, this book has it all.  From the historical references of Minnesota High School hockey's past to the dynasty and powerhouse that was the Bloomington Jefferson Jaguars, Rosengren recounts Tom Saterdalen's storied program perfectly.  As a Jefferson grad in the mid-90's, I can honestly say I was hooked on this book from the get-go.  Hockey was THE sport to be in at our school.  I witnessed first-hand what was written about in this book, and it brought back some great memories.  My hockey-playing friends and classmates went through a ton of pressure to make the program what it was.  But you need not have been a Jaguar to appreciate such a legend as "Sats" and the awesome domination during his thirty-eight-year career behind the bench.  He expected a lot out of his players, sometimes too much, but got results that yielded him immortality in the high school hockey coaching ranks.  This book also goes in-depth into the lives of these high school hockey players: on the ice, in the classroom, and in their private lives.  It explores substance abuse, suicide, peer pressure and other facets of teenage life on and off the playing field.  It is truly an inspirational and well-written story, even if you've never heard of the Jefferson Jaguars
