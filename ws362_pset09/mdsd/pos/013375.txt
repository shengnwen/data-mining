Bryson visits Africa at the request of CARE and sees many of the tragedies and horrors there - and the opulence that lives along side it.  Thrown in is some typical Bryson humor, but it is tempered by the subject matter and the brevity of the book (49 pages!) but it was a charitable project and you can't expect a full length novel in such a circumstance.  Thanks for the insight Bryson
