The NBA today basically ignores the NBA that was home to places like Syracuse, Cincinnati and Rochester. That is why first-person recollections are so important as the history of those seasons fade with the passing away of former players and owners.

Critics can state with some credibility that Red Auerbach has had so much written on him and by him that Let Me Tell You A Story can be overlooked. But John Feinstein brings new life to old stories by piecing together biographical information with recollections by Auerbach through interviews at weekly lunches conducted by the hall of famer and friends.

For older fans, it is a travel down memory lane. The fans who started with Bird-Magic, Michael or LeBron will learn where the league was not so many years ago and how the foundation was set to make the NBA truly a world league.
