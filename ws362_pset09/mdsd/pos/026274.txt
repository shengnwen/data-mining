I gine this book a 5 star rateing because it is a good lesson teacher to all children of every age.  These books always have a good outcome and they teach a lot.  The berenstain Bears is a make believe family of bears.   Sister bear gets in a fight with her friend Libby.  In the long run the end  up getting in a fight, but soon after they all make up and talk things out.   It teaches kids to talk out problems and not to fight
