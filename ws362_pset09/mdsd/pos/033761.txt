I have watched Grizzly Man about six times and read enough reviews of this book to understand what it was about.  
Imagine growing up in NYC, that concrete jungle, the drugs, dealers, the alchohol.  I can see why TT ventured out so far to find a cure from that hell.  I think he went too far.  There are therapies that you can use to help heal you, even in NYC, meditate in your own apartment, find peace where you live.  Leave the bears where they are, goto the Zoo, be a tourist, look, watch, even go camping in Alaska, but not next to some Grizzly Bears.  We can all save the bears by leaving them alone, 'really alone'.  Tim could of been helped, where was his family, his friends?  Where was the voice of reason in Tim's life?  I don't mean to blame his parents, TT was a grown man.  But after watching his parents, especially his father in the interview, they seem like they almost seem dismissive about him.  Maybe they cared, and maybe they did not.  Why couldn't we help him while he was here?  I think Tim should of kept taking the anti-depressants.  It was his decision to stop.  We are all ultimately in charge of our own fates.  P.S.  Touching the poop was pretty weird...:-
