Samuel Beckett's, soon to be classic, drama about two men, Vlad and Estro, transcends stage-play drama. Beckett's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic, literal story. 

Most drama should be seen on stage, so that the performers can give their characters shape, bring in an audience, and produce a night of dramatic arts. That is not how this story seems to go; not at all, indeed.

Beckett's story can be seen as a naturalistic look at the life of the poor. Here are two men, both obviously at the end of their ropes, but each keeps this asinine hope that "GODot" will show up. But, he never does. Extra characters, like Pozzo and Lucky, simply add to the intended confusion.

As several previous reviewers have taken note--there is not action. While this idea is spurred by "The Threepenny Opera," Beckett takes postmodernism another step further. The characters' are so disillusioned the question becomes, Godot isn't coming, so did he ever care? Could Godot actually exist he allows these poor fellows to exist in such a state. 

A fantastic read, and one of the best dramas ever written. This fairly short play should be read by EVERYONE.
