I do agree with the previous two reviews.  It is true that most of the bags are plain rectangles and are similar in construction.  They may not be creative and interesting in construction.  However, they all are very cute.  I would like to knit them all.  If you do not mind having many pattens for the same construction with variety of design, this book is worth looking at.
