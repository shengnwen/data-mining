I bought this book on an impulse. I have family with ADD and manic depression. I read through the book in 2 days, because it was so easy to read and understand. The author does a lot of explaining that makes sense to me and it fits my family members who suffer from depression. This book turned a light on in my brain as to the &quot;why, who and how comes&quot; of depression. I am buying more of these to give as gifts. I recommend this to those who have loved ones who suffer and for those who suffer the pain of depression. It's not a cure, it's a door being opened.
