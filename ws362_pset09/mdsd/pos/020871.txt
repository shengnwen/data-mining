I think everything that needed to be said has been said by Richard. This is an excellent book for those who want to get their hands dirty with Wireless Security. One of the areas in IT that will never die down, not anytime soon at least, is security. IT security is especially HOT right now, and a lot of companies are paying more attention to what they should have years ago. In my home city, Philadelphia, there is a project called Wireless for Philly that is supposed to bring wireless connection to everybody. Now, while people see that as just another development in this great city, I look at it as an opportunity for people who are smart enough to protect this kind of network. This book does the job. I am going to suggest that if you know you are not going to have time to dedicate to this book, don't pick this book up. You're better off! Because if you do pick this book up, it's going to be hard to put it down
