This is a scholarly history without the flash, trash, hype, and jive of journalism.  The authors had access to the decrypt of Soviet messages from the 1941-1945 period as well as the Soviet espionage archives and the FBI archives.  They explain in detail how they obtained their information and then described the activities of Soviet agents.  At the end is a list of about 450 people who were Soviet agents.  For those of you who are not interested in the historic details, the bottom line is that everyone who was publicly accused of being a Soviet agent was one.  Senator McCarthy was right and the professors and journalists were wrong.

I also recommend The Venona Secrets : Exposing America's Cold War Traitors by Herb Romerstein if you want more detailed information from an experienced espionage agent of the time.  This other book, available here on Amazon, will tell you many more interesting things
