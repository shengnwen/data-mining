I am so glad this book is still in print.  It is one of my very favorites, and I read it at least once per year, like Huckleberry Finn.  For those of us who love nature, and tales of growing up in the out-of-doors, this is a beautiful book of the natural world and agricultural lands.  It contains wonderful sketches about farm life in the turn-of-the century English countryside, school life, and village characters.  This book reminds me of Cider With Rosie (also called The Edge of Day) by Laurie Lee, another excellent book about growing up in England, set around the time of WWI.  This is truly worthwhile reading. If you have read "Lark Rise to Candleford" and enjoyed it, another book by Flora Thompson, "Still Glides the Stream", deals with the same subject matter and is also very good
