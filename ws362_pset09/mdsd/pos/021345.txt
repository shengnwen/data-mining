A fantastic history of the 14th century.  A must read for any history buffs.  By following the life of Coucy, a particular Frankish knight, Tuchman takes us through all of the major events of the 14th century from the Hundred Year's War to the Great Plague to Nicopolis.  By following through the eyes of Coucy, she makes the story more person than is typical for a historical work and the reader finds him/herself caring for the well-being and outcome of particular individuals rather than merely being seeped in facts and figures.  

The Calamitous 14th century is clearly one of Tuchman's best works, and indeed I enjoyed its prose more than "The Guns of August".  For those who enjoy medieval history, in particular, this is an excellent selection to buy for oneself or to find under the Christmas tree
