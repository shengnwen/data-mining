I must admit Anne Tyler is not my favourite author, although I have read all her books.  Somehow, her humour does not shine through as it does with authors such as Dorothea Benton Franks and Lolly Winston. However, "Ladder of Years" is my favourite of Tyler's novels and it is easy to see why it once placed in Time's top ten books of the year.

The book is based around a woman in search of herself and life's purpose.  Many readers will ask, "How could she go to the beach with her family, take a walk down the shoreline and intentionally disappear?"  It might be something many woman have light-heartedly contemplated at least once in their lifetime, but most likely never followed through.  There are some very unique, well developed characters in this book and it becomes a real page turner.  As for the ending, some will say she did the right thing, others may disagree. She really does have "two separate lives" on the go - which one will she choose?  Although the book was most enjoyable, the plot did not seem realistic or plausible and, for this reason, lost a star in the rating.  Overall, it is still the best of Tyler.
