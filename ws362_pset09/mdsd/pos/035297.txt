Inevitably, the King James Version of the Bible will draw fire for its archaic language. I do not believe that this is a fair basis on which to critique a particular printing of the King James Bible.

Aesthetically, the interior of this Bible is lovely; the illuminations, headers and latin numerals are truly charming. The typeface is quite legible, though rather small. After only a little reading, one becomes accustomed to the V in place of U and the curious spellings of many words. The text commands one's attention; I personally believe this to be a good thing.

Qualitatively, however, the paper, gilding and cover design all leave something to be desired. The paper is thin and of the variety that crumbles with age, the gilding on the pages comes off on one's fingers and the enormous "1611 Edition" stamped on the front cover borders on vulgarity. There also appear to be a fair number of typos in this, though I would imagine these to be original to the text and not mistakes of the modern publisher.

I am quite pleased to find a leather bound King James Bible with the Apocryphal books. For some time, the only such bible on the market was in paperback format, which does not hold up well to the rigors of daily handling.

All in all, I like this edition very much and can easily imagine enjoying it on a daily basis for years to come. 

Do have a look at the publisher's other materials; Hendrickson has a knack for publishing beautiful and affordable reference volumes (such as the Septuagint, AnteNicene/Nicene/PostNicene Fathers, etc.)
