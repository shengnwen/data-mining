Another great story.  Stephen King is not typical in this book.  The development of the characters is awesome.  You felt everything that Dolores was going through and you know you would have done the same thing.  You route for her.  She is spunky, bitter but she means business.  Great book.  I highly recommend this book.  I read it in about 6 hours
