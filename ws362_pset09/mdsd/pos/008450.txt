Louise is the first lady of the healing arts and hers was one of the first book I ever saw on the subject. It totally changed the way I thought about healing and led to my writing my own book, some 12 years later. 

You Can Heal Your Life is a classic book, one that should be on every shelf. It contains methods of healing, affirmations, and the reasons why many of us become ill. You will learn how illness has an emotional connection and how by altering your life actions, you can also change your illness into a path of wellness. 

My favorite section is chapter 15, which contains "the list." In this newly revised version, the list of ailments and likely emotional connections is separated into colorful columns which make it easier to read. This version is beautifully decorated with pastel flowers, hearts, and other beautiful details. A great book to leave out on a table for others to browse. The "turtle back" cover, which is strong like plastic, but soft to the touch like a paper cover, will survive years of wear and tear. 

Of course, the book contains many exercises and processes to help the reader better understand themselves and in the process, heal and revive not just their bodies, but their lives. 

My sincerest gratitude goes out to Louise and her work which has opened the door for so many of us to follow.
