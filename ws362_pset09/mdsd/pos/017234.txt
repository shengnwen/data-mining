I thought I would hate this book.  It is big and refers to lots of places we know very little about.  But Strassler makes the whole text come alive.  Plenty of maps and notes to clarify the obscure.  Now it doesn't make any of the Peloponnesian War EASY to follow -- it was a long time in coming, and it was a very complex war, but the period shows how easy it can be to go to war even when one doesn't want to, and how hard it can be to get out of war after things like Honor, Fear, or percaptions of Public Interest are at stake.  

I especially liked the appendices and definitive index, which made the complexities of this topic a bit easier to follow.  Certainly a book I would recommend to bright high school seniors and to all who aspire to serve as officers in any Western military.  (Why?  Because Thucydides is very fair at depicting the Spartans and the Athenians, depicting their very human foibles, courage and personalities, and because it is amazing to see how many of the speeches of 2500 years ago seem as if they could be written for today's world.  (I especially liked Cleon's speach, not because of what he said, but because I could imagine it being lifted by some Capitol Hill or White House speechwriter, and being read unwittingly by one of today's jingoistic politicians.)
