When I first saw this book I thought it would be just another book that I would have to read for English. But as it turned out it was a book that really got me interested and has really changed my life for the better. 

This book is a book about 3 young men growing up in the ghetto and changed there life around and made a pact that they would all be doctors when they got older and make it out of the hood, 

I am still confused at what made them decide they wanted to be doctors and not anything else? Why did they choose this job?

I defiantly would recommend this book to anyone that is either growing up in the hood or who is in a bad situation and needs to figure out a way to get out and know that it will get better if u just strive for what you really want and set a goal.
