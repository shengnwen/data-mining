In Worlds of Wonder, Days of Judgment, David Hall makes a strong case for defining popular religion in early New England as an interdependent endeavor influenced by both clerical and lay forces.  Hall analyzes the relationships of the clerical and lay populations at the book market, in the meetinghouse, and during the performance of rituals.  He asserts that these locations act as significant social and religious intersections in which the clergy and the lay population must negotiate their differences.  The consensuses they reach are often unstable and must be renegotiated, but this seems to be the major impetus behind Hall's work: Popular religion is about negotiation, market competition, meetinghouse parleys, and arbitrated ritualism.

The final chapter of the novel is a treat of sorts - selections from and analysis of the diary of Samuel Sewell.  Sewell's writings bring Hall's book together in the words of a real person who lived in Early New England.  I recommend this book for its intelligence, clarity, and unique subject matter
