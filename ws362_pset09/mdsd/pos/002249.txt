If you want to know all the details about Ingres' paintings, read this book. It has pages of resources and details about the artist's subjects. Frankly, more than I want to know. If you want to see beautiful reproductions of Ingres' work, buy this book! He's one of my favorite portrait painters and the book is loaded with great images. I enjoyed the comparison between Ingres's work and other painters. Also, the binding on this book is top quality.
