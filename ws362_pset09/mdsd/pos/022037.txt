If you heard a voice speaking to you, what would you do? Would you run away? Would you go to a doctor? Or would you listen to the voice and interpret what it was saying? In W.P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe, Ray Kinsella, an ordinary farmer from Iowa, hears a strange, but mystical voice. The voice says, "If you build it, he will come." After hearing the voice say this, Ray's life is flipped upside down as his priorities are changed from life at his farm to mending a field and listening to a voice that he doesn't even know is real. 

What I liked about the book was the fact they gave about Shoeless Joe and the rest of the 1918 White Sox, a.k.a. Black Sox.  You also got to see what it is like back then and the book gives you a view from Shoeless Joe's point of view. I felt great reading this book. Shoeless Joe is great book for people who love sports and/or have a great imagination. It is not too hard, so it can be read by an 8th grader and above. Though through some parts of the book, you may get lost and become confused, it still turns out to be a great sports book because of the way it portrays a belief in magic and the belief that wishes do come true.
