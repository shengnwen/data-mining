The book itself is the best work of literature written about the Stalinist purges and probably Serge's best novel too.  What the other reviewers all have to say is true; a European classic, a reflection of the twentieth century, etc.  I would only warn readers about Susan Sontag's introductory essay which, although characteristically well-written and sometimes moving, contains a number of major historical inaccuracies.  The most glaring is her unqualified statement that Serge became a left-wing 'anti-Communist' who took a side in the Cold War.  There is nothing to substantiate this but a quote from Serge's diary about simple platitudes like capitalism and socialism no longer being satisfying.  That doesn't say much, and that Sontag would choose to extrapolate such a far-reaching conclusion about Serge from it is indicative of her whole attitude to her subject.  Trotsky, with whom Serge had principled differences (see 'The Serge-Trotsky Papers' at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745305164/ref=ed_oe_p/002-5822057-0932809?%5Fencoding=UTF8) when they were both in exile in Europe and Mexico, is dispatched with one snide parenthesied sentence: "(For Trotsky, the problem was that the wrong people were being shot)." There's nothing wrong with asserting the 'truth of the novelist' over the 'truth of the historian' as a coda to the life of this extraordinary individual, but it's no excuse for lying. 

It's unfortunate that this is the way most intellectuals now choose to regard Serge's legacy.  Still, it's well worth having the book back in print.  Contrary to what Sontag would have us believe, the struggles which animated Serge and his contemporaries are not dead.  The continued resonance of this novel, the work of a man who lived and breathed his ideas, is proof of that.
