This book was simply wonderful and a must read.  

I was amazed at the presentation of the story and the way Harper Lee draws you in.  The narrator is an 8 year old girl named Scout who is both innocent about the world and its social norms; while at the same time curious enough to be engaged and question "why does it have to be this way?"   It is from Scout's perspective that you are able to see the silliness and real injustice that we (adults) create by continually abiding by these destructive social norms that we consider "the way it has to be".  

On the surface, many readers will read this book and say that it is about "race relations".  But upon taking a deeper examination into the book, you will find that "race" is just the example used in order to convey an even bigger message on the importance of being both open minded and aware of oneself and the world around you.  Harper Lee, through the innocent eyes of Scout, challenges us to think outside the box, to accept people for who they are, to be open-minded, to challenge social norms and to start thinking for oneself.  

I have rarely identified with or have been more inspired by a fictional character as I have with Atticus.  He embodies every characteristic I wish to have from having compassion and love for everyone (even when it is undeserved), to his ability to critically think through issues, to his capacity of fairness, open-mindedness, and knack for remaining calm and peaceful in times of hostility and high stress.  What an amazing character.

To Kill a Mockingbird is not just revolutionary in its day for implying that blacks should be equal to whites; but is revolutionary even now because the underlying themes and messages it states still need heard and practiced today.  This book will impact you and challenge you, and should make you a better person.
