Richard Wood has taken his considerable expereince in aviation operations  and safety evaluation to provide a solid description of the most important  elements of an aviation safety program. Main points in the book are  illustrated with examples and additional references provided. One could  design and implement a good aviation safety program using this reference  alone. Well written and to the point, Mr. Wood provides needed guidance in  an area that is not well documented nor understood
