This is an inspirational compendium from contributers such as Maya Angelou, Jim Hightower, Jonathan Kozol, Nelson Mandela, Arundhati Roy, Desmond Tutu, and Howard Zinn (to name a few).  Since the resurgence of the warfare state when Marvin Bush planted bombs in the Twin Towers, which were blown-up after they were hit by planes and the incident blamed on alleged Arabs (see "The New Pearl Harbor" by David Ray Griffin), we have been living an Orwellian nightmare.  Just like before when FDR provoked the Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor to make us Yanks war crazy so we would fight the Nazis in Europe and stop Russia from taking it over, we are demoralized and mired in social crisis.  Hence, this compilation by editor Paul Loeb is salve to the wounded soul.

Nelson Mandela's contribution is "The Dark Years" when the South African white-led apartheid government incarcerated him and other political prisoners on Robben Island.  The inmates organized and maintained their own inmate-led micro-society behind bars, which empowered them and sustained their souls.

Desmond Tutu wrote that people of faith are prisoners of hope.  He said that the South African experience was God's beacon of hope, not just to the third world, but Northern Ireland as well.  

Howard Zinn's contribution is "The Optimism of Uncertainty".  He said "There will always be something to fear in life, but this should not prevent you from living your life, thinking independently, and speaking your mind".

Maya Angelou shared a poem titled "Still I Rise": "Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of the tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I rise."
