I absolutely recommend this book to all readers.  Walter Dean Myers does a fabulous job in showing Jimmy's varied perspectives towards his father.  This was a well-written, realistic fiction book that had a perfect mix of action and emotion.  This book had plenty of surprises, too.  One example is when the police caught Crab and Jimmy.  As I was reading this book, I couldn't wait to discover the content of the following page, due to the fact that Jimmy and Crab are always looking over their shoulder for a dangerous finish.  For all of those who enjoy an exciting quick-read, this book is for you
