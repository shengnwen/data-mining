A proper critical account of Swift's text would exceed by far the space given here. As someone doing scholarly work on Gulliver's Travels, I would merely like to point out that Mr. Rivero's edition is a bit confusing. For some reason, he has decided that it was a good idea to move the letter prefacing the text to the end (which, as the "Advertisement" itself says should be "prefixed" to the volume). The critical apparatus is truly commonsensical, and at times, reduces the novel to a sad, straightforward allegory. One would only wish that the criticism section were as interesting as it is extensive. All this said, there is nothing violently "wrong" with this edition
