I opened this book when I was browsing in the bookstore and I have to say I couldn't put it down.  I loved this book.  First of all, I was deeply appreciative of Marla Paul's openness and honesty.  She says, "How could I have gotten to 44 and not have enough friends?"  This was breathtaking candor in a world where we all want to look very popular.  Secondly, she is both very compassionate and very practical about an issue that requires some good tactics for change, not just attention to our feelings.  And thirdly, as I read this book, she encouraged me to do some self-reflection.  I asked myself, "How am I as a friend?  Why do I feel lonely at times?"  Finally, she puts this in context.  The world that we live in is just not that conducive to making new friends, especially during mid-life.  Let's not take it personally, but let's get out there and find some like-minded souls to share life with.   Overall, I found this book to be very helpful, very worthwhile
