The Lord of the Rings is particularly amazing and unique because of it's depth. There is a whole history behind it, the past is not just referred to but exists as a whole in its own right; all created by Tolkien. He creates languages, genealogies, in fact an entire world in breathtaking detail. Tolkien was a scholar and as such recognised the importnace of history and how it impacts on present events and choices. Inevitably this makes Lord of the Rings both an engaging story and a complex tome which bears rereading for both pleasure and depth of understanding.
It is a shame that the criticisms of these classic books are not even spelled correctly
