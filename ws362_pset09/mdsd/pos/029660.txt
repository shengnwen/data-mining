Just got this muffin cookbook in the mail and I love the way it's arranged.  Easy to read recipes, all annotated, clear instructions, and lots of variety in the ingredients.  They all look so doable with ingredients I have right in my kitchen.  None appear greasy or hugely fattening, yet they look tempting and make me want to head for the kitchen.  Muffins sometimes just fill the bill for something sweet (but not too), filling and just enough for a healthy snack like in the middle of the afternoon with a glass of milk.  I like to keep 'em in the freezer and zap for 30 seconds in the microwave.  Perfect.  This book looks like a winner.  Thanks
