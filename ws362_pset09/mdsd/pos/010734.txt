Even though I have rated this book, I have never read it.  Why? Well its  for the simple fact that I can't find it anywhere.  I know that it is out  of print but I need it for a class and also for the fact that I want it .   Iv heard so many interesting things about The dinner Party.  I hope to  share this not just with my classmates but with my mom and in the far, far  future when I decide to have kids, I would like to share it with my little  girl.  so hopefuly whom ever reads my review (so to speak) it will be  listened to and the people who need the book will have it as well and the  people who want it
