Living a full life requires getting the most out of it from a variety of areas.  

Being a great lover, father, brother, friend, employee, manager, entrepeneur, community activist, and/or adventurer usually depends on the number of healthy relationships a man is able to cultivate and maintain in his life. This book discusses ways to become a universally appealing man who is able to bring out the best in those around him requiring a display of his own personal best.

This is one of my favorite books.  I give away copies as gifts whenever I can.

Those that wrote a negative review probably don't understand that life is a game and to succeed (not just professionally) you need to know the rules.
