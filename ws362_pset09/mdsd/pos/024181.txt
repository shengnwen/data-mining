Not being a builder, this gave great ideas for basic approaches towards building a tree house... Everyone's will be different, but this gets you off on the right start... Highly recommended... Not given 5 stars, because the 5-6 ideas are either really basic or quite complex... I started with one of the really basic ones and added on some ideas of my own once the project was under way...
