This book is basically the nuts and bolts to good design. If you are not interested in reading about theory and want to jump into designing correctly or you want to improve your designing skills IMMEDIATELY, this is the book to buy.  Many design choices (mistakes) are addressed and explained in simple English. You are able to enhance business cards (for ex.) without reading a complete chapter.  This book offers instant results. This is definitely one that should be in your collection whether for small business needs or a designing career. 

I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wish the author would have given a bit more suggestions
