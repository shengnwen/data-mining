Mr. Hastings does an admirable job in this narrative of the fall of Nazi Germany and should be commended for tying together the multitude of issues inherent in this tale ... and doing so in a cogent and engaging manner. While reading this, one does feel as if "You are there". The writing is that good. My only fault is that at times, especially in the middle of the book, the first person sources/narratives became, (at least to me), somewhat repetitive. On the other hand, and what I felt is one of the major strengths of this book, is the author's fearlessness in crtiquing/second guessing military, political and strategic decisions made by some of the "giants" of the 20th Century and which today we make take for granted as have being the "right" ones. Other reviews have listed many of these including Market Garden, not winning the war in 1944, Stalin's motives, culture and casualties and how J.C.H. Lee kept his job. The point here is that although one may not agree with all of the author's assessments, he does make you think ... and what more can you ask for from a book that details such an important time in history.
