"Ethan Frome" is basically the classic literature version of a chick-flick on Lifetime.  While normally I wouldn't watch the movie, the book is wonderfully written and engrossing.  There's love, tragedy, a surprise ending, and a heavy dosage of emotion evoking scenery - a great story.

Ethan From is a young man who is stuck in life.  At the beginning of the 20th century, he must work hard, love hard, and deal with the struggles of life.  He is virtually a slave to his hypochondriac wench of a wife, who constantly blocks Ethan's every possibility for enjoyment of fulfillment in life.  He's a prisoner to his responsibilities, and combined with the restrictions of hard winters, it's sapping his strength.

Ethan's life changes when his wife's cousin comes to stay with them.  Since his sickly wife, Zeena, "can't" do any work around the house, her cousin, Mattie, is going to trade work for room and board.  Soon enough, the classic love triangle develops, tearing Ethan between his guilt-ridden traditional marriage and his heart-wrenching desire for new love.  Ethan is in agony, not just because of the internal struggle of decision, but also because of the sheer joy that he experiences from the slightest interaction with Mattie.

With the brilliant foreshadowing throughout the book, and the descriptive prose that allows the reader to experience the scenery and town, the "classic" label is well deserved.

While unknown to anyone but himself, Ethan is forced to make a decision is the essence of this book.  It's a story of morality and obligation.  Do what is perceived as the correct thing to do, or follow your heart without reservations?
