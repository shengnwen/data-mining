I was using this book more as a costume history reference than as a book  on art history, so I won't comment on the coverage of art history.   However, as a costume reference it is extremely good.  The book is very  well illustrated with pictures of people, and includes many pictures not  shown in &quot;costume books.&quot;  Worthwhile, if you are seriously  interested in the period
