I've been fortunate enough to have taken a watercolor workshop with Jean Grastorf, and her book is almost as good as being in her presence and watching her work.  The art itself is worth the purchase price, and Jean's step-by-step instructions are lucid and easy to follow.  I especially appreciate Jean's emphasis on compostion and value studies.  Her book--as well as her watercolor technique--are about much more than pouring watercolor.  This book would be an excellent addition to any artist's library
