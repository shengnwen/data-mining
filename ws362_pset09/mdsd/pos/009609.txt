I liked this book, not as much as some of the others in the series, but it has its distinguishing points.  As other reviewers note, the characters are well drawn and believable.  I most of all enjoyed the squire and the earl.  The squire especially struck me as a sort of realistic Ebenezer Scrooge with the sharp edges much removed.  I liked his sister   Lady Julia.  Crosbie is an interesting semi-cad. The descriptions of the hum-drum of the clerks' lifes in the City were revealing as well, and reminds one that Dilbert has his Victorian counterparts.  The introduction to Plantagenet Palliser is finely done
