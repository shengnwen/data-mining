I haven't read a novel by V. C. Andrews since the series that began with "Flowers in the Attic", but that was a long time ago, and I should have expected something different. I was still somewhat disappointed that this one wasn't in the same genre, and more in Young Adult territory, but it was entertaining all the same.  This is the story of three teenagers from different walks of life, but each firmly on the path to self-destruction.

Robin is from a broken home, doesn't know who her father is (neither does her mother) and has been forced to move to Nashville with her mother, who is pursuing a singing career.  She constantly gets herself into trouble, until she meets a boy with even worse problems, when everything finally falls apart.

Teal has everything a girl could dream of, except the love of her parents.  She was born after her parents had passed the point of wanting children, and never felt like a part of the family.  To get the attention she craves, she keeps pulling wilder and more dangerous stunts, and when she meets a boy from the wrong side of the tracks, she stretches way too far on her already insecure limb.

Phoebe was born into problems, with an irresponsible mother and a weak-natured father, and when her mother takes off for parts unknown, her father leaves her in the care of her aunt and uncle, who are strict disciplinarians.  Unable to stay out of trouble, she meets a wealthy young man who has selfish motives of his own.

This is where the story leaves us high and dry, and you need to get the sequel "Midnight Flight" to see what happens to the three in the end.  The story of the troubled teenagers is a "to be continued"
