Behind the egregious figure and powerful significance of Poe, there is a neurosis. To interpret his work, in function of this anomaly it may be abusive or legitimate. Arthur Shopenhauer affirmed that there is not any circumstance in our whole life that is not voluntary. In the neurosis as well as another misfortunes, we can see an artifice of the individual to get a purpose. Poe sacrificed the life to the work, the mortal destiny in relation to the posthumous destiny.

Of course that the last Century was by far, much more unfortunate than the XIX ; that would explain simultaneously that the subsequently elaborated hells by Henry James or Franz Kafka are more intimate, flecked claustrophobic and intimate respect Poe stories. As a matter of fact you may find in Poe certain signals of the future Existentialism, since the simple fact to live for Poe was atrocious  

The death and madness (Ligeia `s tomb, The dwell and the pendulum) were the main symbols used by him to communicate his horror of the life. Accused of imitate the German literature, he could reply with absolute truth: the terror does not come from Germany, but the soul.

Poe considered himself a poet, but the circumstances led him to write tales. In some of them the circumstantial invention endures, but in others (Rue Morgue murderers, The stolen letter) comes the copious police genre, that actually fatigues the press, and besides will never die.

Poe belongs to non temporal and the eternal. He was a missed angel, his existence worked out as an immense link that joined from the hospitals of the hell, the delirious anguish  and unfathomable horror through his tormented soul, could be preserved for the future generations of avid readers, who will contemplate the same cycle of the life, perhaps with other eyes, under different circumstances and protagonists but with the same result: the death without possible redemption.
