I just finished this book last night and LOVED it!  I read MY Sisters Keeper last year and was exicited to read something by the same author. But I was concerned with some of the negative reviews about Vanishing Act, but after reading it I was very pleased.  I started it on Tuesday and finished Friday, once I got about halfway through there was no stopping me. So if you are not sure this will be excellent like her other book My Sisters Keeper, rest assured this one is just as good or better.
