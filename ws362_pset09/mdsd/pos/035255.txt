First things first it is in my opinion that Dean Koontz is one of the greatest writers of our time. Dean never seizes to amaze me ,or any reader for that matter, as to how his novels have a spell like effect on the reader. Cold Fire is no exception to this patteren either. In the book a man by the name of Jim Ironheart ,a skitsofrenic telekentic, saves people from allmost certin deaths. Why? Jim saves them because he is working under the powers of a higher being & they hold immportant keys to our (civilization's) future. This book is a flat out must read for any scifi or horror fan
