I was inspired to read this book after a 7 day bicycle trip in and around Lancaster, PA. Certainly any cultural group which resists the juggernaut and onslaught of American consumer culture bears study, and this book must  be the definitive look at this group. How do you keep people interested in  looking different, in downplaying their individuality in favor of the  group's needs; in foregoing creature comforts like cars and electricity?  And what is even more amazing is that there are many more Amish today than  there were 50 years ago; unlike the Shakers, this sect is thriving. I  recommend this book highly.R
