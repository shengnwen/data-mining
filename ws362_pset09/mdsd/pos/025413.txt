Thos book has so much going on in it; I love the way Shreve switches back between Maren's letters and what is going on in the narrator's life.  The historical parts of this story (the murders, the trial, the evidence) make it a great read for anyone who enjoys crime/mystery. 
 
The ending shocked me - and while I dont want to ruin it for anyone - I must say I was not expecting it to end that way for Jean.  Maren, well, I guessed at that somewhere in the middle.

Anita Shreve is becoming one of my "it" authors - I hope she continues to provide such excellent novels as "The Weight of Water" and "The Pilot's Wife
