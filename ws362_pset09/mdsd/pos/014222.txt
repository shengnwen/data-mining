Russell has the incredible ability to teach me a lot-the hospitality industry, West Point and the military, personal history of presidents, dueling, and more-while telling great story.  Travis was a wonderful character.  His descriptions of the Washington D.C. area are excellent.   Even though it definitely bogged down at the end, I started in early in the morning, read it at lunch and finished it when I came home from work.  I really enjoyed this book
