I have read many books on healing and energy therapy, and this is the one that has had me booking a place to travel half way round the world for the next seminar in Los Angeles (there are no practitioners in my country of residence.)  As I am not very sensitive to subtle energy I have not had the effects reported by some other reviewers, but I am expecting developments at the seminar.  
The book is well written, Eric Pearl is articulate and has a sense of humour.  The stories are well told and Eric's account of how he came to have this gift is highly entertaining, and the gift itself a marvel.  
This is the first time I have felt inspired to write a review of a book purchased from Amazon.  The only way it could be improved is by making it longer
