Grace Archer is a former CIA operative who has been in hiding on Charlie's horse farm in a very small Alabama town.  She and her eight year old daughter Frankie are also overseen by Robert Blockman, a CIA operative who lives in the town undercover.  The four of them have good times together and have become fast friends over the nearly nine years Grace has been in hiding.  Unbeknownst to Grace her former coworker and lover, Jake Kilmer, has stirred up the pot and now the evil Marvot is sending everyone and everything after Grace and her daughter.

Of course the only one that can help them is Jake who is no longer directly or indirectly with the CIA.  Grace trusts him to take care of her and Frankie but as for more personal trust--that will take time.  Grace has an almost magical way with horses and thus Marvot wants her back in El Tariq to help him with a very special "Pair" of Arabian horses.

I enjoyed the danger, intrigue and adventures and less the "paranormal" aspects of this story although I usually enjoy some paranormal twists but I felt that the story needed more background on how Grace developed/discovered her talent and how she had used it before to help make it more plausible.  A fun read nevertheless
