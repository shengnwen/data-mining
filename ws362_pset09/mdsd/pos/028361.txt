A wonderful self help book for women who, after setting aside personal dreams and aspirations for the sake of others, seek to reconnect with their own unique dreams in life. Based upon the Girl Scout Model of the Merit Badge, Lauren Catuzzi Grandcolas' book defines a step by step approach for a variety of accomplishments, big and small.  Menors who are experts in the field provide guidance and advice. 

For those who do not know, the author, Lauren Catuzzi Grandcolas, tragically died on United Flight 93. She had (and has still) a special gift for mentoring and encouraging other women. Very refreshing for today. Proceeds from the book, which was finished by her two sisters, goes to Lauren's favorite charities. 

This is a very touching book through which the spirit of a vibrant, compassionate woman lives on.
