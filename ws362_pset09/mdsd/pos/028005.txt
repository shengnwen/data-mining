I am a big fan of Ms. Robert's In Death Series.  I felt that this was a great story the delved into some of Eve's past. However, the problem I had with this book, and it's not stated in the description, is that the BARGAIN BOOK is NOT a full size book.  It's actually a book club edition.  For someone like me who likes to collect the series in Hardcover, hard to do when most were only published in paperback I know, not metioning that this was a smaller version of the original was a suprise.

I will continue to buy this series but I'm staying away from hardcover BARGAIN BOOKS
