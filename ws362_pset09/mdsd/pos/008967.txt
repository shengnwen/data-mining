I'm not a fan of Martha Stewart's books, show, magazine, etc, but I think that Martha Stewart is a genius. This book does not treat Martha very nicely, but it shows you why she is successful and how she did it. Her audaciousness, as mentioned in the book, had me roaring with laughter at some points and in awe at others (why didn't I think of that???) Let's face it, if she were a man and her name were Lee Iacocca or Donald Trump her critics would have been singing her praises, and pronouncing her a visionary. If you have a business or plan to start a business you will benefit from reading this book.
