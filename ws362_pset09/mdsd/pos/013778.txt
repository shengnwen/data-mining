I can't count how many copies I've bought of this book because I keep giving it to people. Years ago, it got me to study my cat tracking a cockroach without letting the bug know he was watching. That started my process of becoming more carefully observant of everything around me. It isn't ESP. It is, simply, paying attention. Most importantly, it is love, respect, and appreciation for All Life. By the time you finish reading (no doubt still hungry for more), you'll have gotten the message and probably given it a try. If you're serious about it, you'll find your life changing little by little and you'll discover how you can improve your relationships with others - animals or people - or insects, plants, and the planet itself. Once I chose to be somewhat of a reclusive hermit, but I couldn't do it because I have literally millions of intimate friends.  The evidence of long ago that there was harmony among all on earth is still present. In choosing to stand there, we can begin to resolve our differences. We can evolve as humans. We can put an end to war and pestilence unfailingly, "whenever the human does his required part." Written in 1954, Boone's message is more important for us now than ever.
