I just finished reading the Between The Ropes book and thought it was a great read.  Good information on the biggest promotions over the past decade with some very interesting quotes from wrestlers mixed in the chapters.  Plus, the book has some good stories behind the scenes of the Between The Ropes show.  

A great read for anyone who already enjoys wrestling or for anyone who wants to learn more about it.  This book has all the details you need to know.  I highly recommend it
