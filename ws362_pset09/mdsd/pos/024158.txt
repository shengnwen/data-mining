Tolstoy is just powerful...with his words. He talks about everything, describes every aspect of the surrounding down to the very last intricate detail. The result? An extremely enthralling and moving book. Apart from the widely discussed infidelity and love themes, this book manages to transport the reader to Russia in the 19th century, and to blend into the background whilst Anna and Vronsky's sordid affair takes place. The translation was wonderful; it is hard to believe that this isn't the original. I did however, wish I knew Russian so I could experience Tolstoy's actual work. 

I loved this book. I read it long before Oprah decided to add it to her book club, and so I have the Oxford Classics edition, which isn't as nice to look at and the translation is slightly different. This however, does not influence the book's distinction as one of greatest novels ever written
