This book does a pretty good job of starting you out in Windows scripting.  I purchased it because I am a Windows server administrator and it looked like it would help - and it did.  It has to be said that the entire text of the book is on Microsoft's web site in the Technet Scriptcenter, but sometimes you want the paper in your hands as well.  Another recommendation is Advanced VBScript for Microsoft Windows Administrators (also MS Press, ISBN 0735622442) if you are looking for some goodies for Windows admin like me
