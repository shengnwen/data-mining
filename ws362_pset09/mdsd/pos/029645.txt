Somebody once said that everyone has two business: the business they are in and the movie business.  That means that just about everyone should love James Parish's new book "Fiasco".  It is delicious to read these stories about some of Hollywood's biggest disasters.  And when you couple people's fascination with Hollywood backstories with our natural inclination to enjoy other people miseries -- especially people with these over-inflated egos -- then it's hard to see how someone would not enjoy this book.  The chapter on Madonna's "Shanghai Surprise" is worth the price of admission -- she apparently only picked up the script in the first place because she liked the color of the cover. So sit back, grab some popcorn, and revel in the schadenfreude
