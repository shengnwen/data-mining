I bought this book for my two year son to introduce him to Halloween and the autumn season.  From the moment we received this book, it was one of his favorites.  The book goes step by step in planting, taking care of, and harvesting a pumpkin patch.  The pictures are so colorful and bright.  It is really an enjoyable book to read
