This is not DFW's best work in my opinion but it's still excellent. I particularly liked the story "Good Old Neon." The first story of the collection "Mr Squishy" was boring and overcooked to me and the worst of what makes DFW's writing so distinctive. I was afraid I wouldn't enjoy the collection, but I'm glad I persisted, because I've liked all the subsequent stories a lot. 

As I say in the headline, I think if you like DFW's style, you'll enjoy this. It's very much "him" and in no way a departure. There are less footnotes, but the parenthetical type lengthy digressions are still there along with his slavish devotion to grammatical sentences, the sort of errant pedantry up with which most writers will not put. But for him, I've always found it charming. He has the intelligence and talent to make it work. But if you've read his other works and found this sort of thing tedious, you'll surely not enjoy this one either
