I had always avoided the subject of death, my main motive being that I don't want to think about my beloved ones dying, but this book made me think differently. Although Roach's and my sense of humour are different, I appreciate the fact that she tackled the subject in a light-hearted way. In fact, I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it.  I can be squeamish, but I had no problems reading this book. I highly recommend it.
