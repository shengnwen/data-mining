Women if you are tired of endless Doctor visits and multiple prescriptions, if you are tired of having your health problems ignored, misunderstood, overdiagnosed and dismissed- READ THIS BOOK.

This book is for women of any age.

This is the first book I have found that helped me gain control of my health. I went through surgically induced menopause, ineffective and damaging conventional hormone replacement, excessive weight gain, depression,lack of energy and thinning hair. I also developed osteopenia and Syndrome X!

 I saw numerous health care providers who were at a loss to identify, explain and or treat these symptoms. Then I began to suffer from digestive problems, severe stress and inability to concentrate. This book helped me regain control of my health. 

We must take charge of our health. The solutions offered in this book, provide simple, low cost and Effective answers to not just treating the symptoms of disease, but get to the underlying causes.  See Dr. Cass' website for more guidance. www.cassmd.com

I have found bioidentical hormone treatment, destressed, stopped bone loss, cleared my brain fog, treated my hypothyroidism, lost weight, taken control of my metabolic syndrome and am now able to live a healthier and happier life. 

Thank you Dr. Cass for showing me the way to take charge of my health. I don't know what I would have done with out your book.

You can do it too! Please read this book and take back control over your body. You will be happier and healthier than you could have ever imagined.

P.S. I am sending this book to my daughter
