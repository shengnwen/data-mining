This is a general book, it crosses all specialties. It is primarily intended for the primary care physician, but would also be of great value in some nursing environments, in remote clinics where a physician might not be available and for specialists in one field who may need information on other areas. 

I imagine that most people thinking of getting this book are at least familiar with it. All I can really say is that this is the latest edition, it's updated with the latest information, it's the standard by which others are compared.
