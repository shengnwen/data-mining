 When I completed my reading of this text, I was the owner of unexpected information about and of profound respect for Paul Revere. David Hackett Fischer provided the reader with a depth of knowledge of Revere's implementation of his very own communications system.  Revere organized a vast, fast, and efficient method of warning the countryside surrounding Boston of the intentions of the British Army.  I, too, was one of millions who thougt Revere, himself, rode from village to village to warn that "the British are coming."  Mr. Fishcer exposed that myth to be one of the worst ever foisted upon the American public.  What Revere did accomplish, was to set in motion a well-disciplined group of riders who actually carried the message to the Boston hinterlands.
    Also, I came away from the book with a deeper understanding of the forces that shaped the revolutionary zeal in Boston prior to 1776.  Fischer's explanation of the people, both British and American, who were part and parcel of those forces, explains why so many Americans were opposed to British rule.
    This book has a prominent place in my library and I look forward to reading it again and again.  It is a clear and honest appraisal of the people and events that shaped Paul Revere's revolutionary spirit and his celebrated "ride."
