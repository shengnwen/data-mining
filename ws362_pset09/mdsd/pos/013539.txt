This book, is for the beginner, just starting to ponder various realities and possibilities, as well as for the advanced and seasoned practitioner of spiritual enlightenment.  I love sonia, she is down to earth, makes clear sense of intuition and how we can use it to attain a greater enlightened self awareness. Some of the things in her books, might seem silly, until you put them into practice. I have her other book, Ask your Guides. In one of the books, she talks about "runners." Runners are spirits that go ahead of you to clear the way, if we only ask them to. Example, please get me a parking spot.(to the runners, we ask).. at first, I thought, o.k. this is a little nutty...guess what, have been doing this now for about a month, the runners are there, people, even when it looks like I will not find a spot when I need one, at the last minute someone clears out, or there is "one" spot left...usually only "one."  It is quite amazing when we "ask.
