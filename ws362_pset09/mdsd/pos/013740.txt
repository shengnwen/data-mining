I am 14, I don't do hot in Language Arts, but I certainly can read like my sister. This book is probably not for kids though, there is some vocabulary in here that is kind of hard to understand. I am on A New Hope right now, on page 60 I think. So far, there are things that are included that were never in the movie. For instance, when in the book Luke is talking about a space battle he saw with Biggs and Windy and some other people I think. In the movie, this never happened. Also in the book that didn't happen in the movie, is when Biggs was talking to Luke about he was going to the Academy. I don't really understand why this is, but it just is. There are also some parts in the book that are reversed or in different spots than in the movie. This is still very similar to the movie.. except in words. I would definitely highly reccomend this book to anybody that's about my age ( 14 ) and up
