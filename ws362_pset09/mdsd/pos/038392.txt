My family went to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks last June and this guide was a great resource.  At the moment, I'm planning another national park trip and pulled the book off the shelf so I could get a guide by the same author.

He marked Signal Mountain Lodge in GT as a "** find" and was it ever!  It's managed by a different vendor than the other lodges in the park and I'd stay there again if I return.  I used his suggestions for "If you can only go on one hike, do this..." and the suggestions were awesome.  The hike to the top of Signal Mountain (most people drive rather than take the 6 mile easy walk) was so beautiful and peaceful that I hiked it a second time before leaving.

This book gave suggestions that you'd expect to get from a friend who has just visited an area and says "Hey let me give you this great tip."

I would definitely recommend this book.
