Here's the thing about this book:  your opinion on it will change depending on the point-of-view from which you read it.  

As a Sox fan (and a relatively new one by the 2004 season), I drank up the book.  I loved hearing all about the individual games, reliving the key moments (like the time stupid A-Rod decided to challenge The Sox and Varitek), and of course...reliving the amazing comeback and subsequent victory in the World Series. 

As a new baseball fan...I was confused and overwhelmed most of the time with player nicknames, so-and-so who played for This Team or That Team in '84, '88, and relieved for That Other Team in '99, and now is managing etc etc...  O'Nan and King did nothing to help their readers understand what the heck they were talking about, either.  For about a hundred pages, I wondered "Who in the name of heaven is "BK?"  And "Balco Boy," who's that??"  However, I wouldn't say that this hindered my enjoyment of the book.

Finally, as the recipient of a BA in Literature, and a lover of reading just about anything...this book has about as much literary quality as a comic book.  I really enjoyed King's sections MUCH more than O'Nan's.  This may have something to do with the fact that, before this book, O'Nan was virtually unknown to me.  King provides much more of an emotional, "you almost feel like you're there," mood, while O'Nan, as many reviewers have said, came across as childish, annoying, and frankly - boring.  There wasn't enough of a balance between the two writers as I would've liked.

All that being said, though...I recommend the book to a Red Sox fan.  Just don't go into it expecting TOO much.  As many have also said, there are other books out there.  Some of which I plan to buy as soon as I post this review.

GO SO
