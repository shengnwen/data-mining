Through a God-given gift, Elisabeth K. Corcoran has written an amazing book that mothers and women of all ages will relate to and be encouraged by.  I took time out of my own chaos to read this book from cover to cover in one sitting.  I am so glad that I did!  My relationships with God, my daughter, and my husband will benefit from it, too.  This book is personal, honest, humorous, thought provoking, touching, inspiring, comforting, and life changing.  Beth is a wonderful example of a Godly woman, mother, and wife.  She has helped me put my &quot;chaos&quot; in order and proper perspective by putting many of my own thoughts and feelings into words.  This book is very refreshing to read, and it has helped renew the joy of my salvation.  It celebrates motherhood, which is the greatest privilege that God has blessed me with.  Mothers, our children are only ours to borrow for a little while, so enjoy them while we can!  Read Calm in My Chaos and be blessed
