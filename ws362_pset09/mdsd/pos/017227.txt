Mr. Hamel's book is a refreshing, much-needed view of the intricacies of family violence.  he, hopefully, puts to rest the "one size fits all" approach to the diagnosis and treatment of intimate partner violence.  in fact, we in the field had drifted away from diagnosis, assuming that men were always the perpetrators just because they were men!  assumptions will not help families struggling with this difficult issue.  hopefully his approach will help the lost children whose lives often do not improve if only one parent gets treament.
