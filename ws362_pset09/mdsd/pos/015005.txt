For the longest time after reading this amazing and wonderful book I  worried about George Packer - how he had gotten on, if he was successful,  where he had gone, and if he had written more in the same lucid and  painfully honest style he used in this autobiographical essay on his years  in Togo as a Peace Corps volunteer. So it was with special joy today that I  discovered not only that he's just written a major work (on American  liberalism) that has been reviewed by the NY Times quite favorably, but  that's he's written other works as well. Truly, Packer has an intellectual  honesty that is extremely rare, coupled with an innate ability to put in  words the deepest and most sincere and heartfelt feelings of Peace Corps  volunteer and of those who have share the volunteer experience,  particularly those among us who were blessed with service in Africa. The  Village of Waiting is a &quot;travel narrative&quot;, you might call it,  that transcends the genre. Highly recommended
