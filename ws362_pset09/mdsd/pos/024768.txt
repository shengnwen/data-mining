"There are places in the world where darkness rules. Where it's unwise to walk. But there hadn't been any trouble out at the lake for years, and Sunshine just needed a spot where she could be alone with her thoughts. Vampires never entered her mind.

Until they found her... "

What a beautiful story. The mixture of reality, light & darkness, magic and mystery will make you turn the pages without wanting a break.
Sunshine/Rae is a simple girl, working as a baker at Charlie's coffee-house.She is definitely fascinated and pretty much obsessed with cinnamon rolls :) Her life is very simple, quite uneventful. The same routine every single day. But everything changes when she takes off for a drive on her own one night. She drives to the lake, where she used to spend a lot of time when she was little with her grandmother. Something has been wrong with the lake for as long as she can remember, but nothing unusual has happened there for a few years. So she drives up to the lake, gets out of her car and sits down next to the lake enjoying the solitude and the calmness of the lake. The moon shining over the black water, and the sweet silence soothing and helping her "recover", relax and collect her thoughts.
She never hears them approach .....

I loved the story, all the twists, the mystery and the suspense. I do agree that it is not your usual inhumanly handsome vampire falling in love with the heroine kind of story. In fact, the vampires here are hideous monsters, with grayish skin-colour and they smell awful. But different doesn't always mean bad !!! Darkness and light compliment each other in the best way possible.
Get the book, read it and enjoy it !!
