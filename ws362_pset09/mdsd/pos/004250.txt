I am a sucker for &quot;books about books&quot;, and this is another valuable resource for the bibliophile, written from a Christian perspective. Actually an expansion from his earlier work, &quot;Great Books of the Christian Tradition&quot;, this is an excellent reference for great books whether classic or contemporary. Glaspey is not afraid to recommend books with worldviews that are opposed to the evangelical Christian tradition, which I find very commendable. Unfortunately, there are some dubious choices included here, in my opinion, that don't stand up to the other great works included, like Jan Karon's terminally boring &quot;At Home in Mitford&quot;, or John Grisham's mildly entertaining but far from transcendent &quot;The Testament&quot;. But you have to admire a guy that has managed to read all these books (you have, haven't you, Terry?), and his enthusiasm for great literature is contagious. A must-have for book lovers
