I lost my Dad in September, days after the holocost in New York.  He was a New Yorker and as such the days before the tragedy, was, himself, very agitated.  Had I not read Alexandra's book I would have dismissed his need to get to an airport, get to New York, get to his old office on Hudson St. as the rantings of a man in his death throws.  Not!  It was true, he was reacting to the universal energies that were out there long before the plane crashes and it was a profound moment for me and my brothers and sisters that he shared it with us.  He was courageous in dying, sharing every moment with us, but more important, we were able to share every moment with him because of the blue print Ms. Kennedy provided us with.  This book needs to be read by anyone who's involved in the culmination of life as we know it and what's more important, by anyone that still has doubts about the dignity death.  I shall be forever grateful for the bridge that Alexandra has created for those of us that survive
