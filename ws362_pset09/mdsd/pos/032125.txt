Coulters maturing of the Sherlock and Savage team is obvious in this continuation of her FBI thriller series. The story is gripping and keeps you wondering who did what. I was alittle dissappointed in how easy it was for Savage to figure out who the killer was and the "ghost" of a women murdered 30 years ago coming to Savage on the side of the road while he changed a blow out was differrent but the story flowed well and keeps you reading. Overall this is a great read and I recomend it to Coulter fan
