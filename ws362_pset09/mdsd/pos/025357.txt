I love this restaurant very much.  The food is solidly fantastic, if not very adventurous.  I eat here because I want to eat fantastic quality food, beautifully and carefully prepared and I want to do it in a warmly lit, unpretentious (and untrendy) space. 

The restaurant itself translates almost exactly into the cookbook.  Beautifully prepared, if a little unadventurous.  Intensive, if unexciting.

That makes it a difficult book to review.  I own it and I am very glad that I do.  I love the food, I think Nancy Oakes does a beautiful job.  

I'm a quite competent cook, I live in San Francisco, and I think, for someone of my level, this isn't the kind of cookbook you really -need- but it's the kind I definitely enjoy just -reading-.

I think most very competent cooks will find it a bit boring and most less skilled cooks will find it daunting.  It's best suited for people, like me, who enjoy paging through stacks of cookbooks for visual and other sensory inspiration.  And for that...it's perfectly suited
