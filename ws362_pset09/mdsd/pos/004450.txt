I loved this book!  I have Botecelli curls, and I find using mousse instead of gel works better for me (mousse really controls frizz for me).  I followed all of Lorraine's suggestions, but switched back to mousse instead of gel after a few weeks.  Now I'm a very happy Curly Girl!

I use Pantene products, always have, and have had great results.  After reading Curly Girl I stopped using shampoo and I REALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE!  I use Pantene Hydrating Curls conditioner to wash my hair, not rinsing all of it out.  Remember, hydrating your curls is the key to great looking curly hair.  I squeeze my hair with a towel, then spray my hair with the Lavender Mist (recipe is in the book - very easy to make), then scrunch with Pantene Hydrating Curls Mousse.  I use small butterly clips to clip my hair up along the top and upper sides to give some lift.  This routine is working great for me
