These volumes treat Peanuts as art not just entertainment.  First of all, there are insightful essays in each volume from people who know comics and love Peanuts.  Next, the physical volumes are beautiful and wonderfully present the strips as they appeared at the time.  Then there are the strips themselves; has any artist noted the passage of the seasons with as much simple, bittersweet joy as Charles Schulz in Peanuts?  That is truly one of my great joys of reading these comics compiled rather than as a daily strip.  The way he subtly notes the first snow of autumn, or a spring shower is unsurpassed in any artistic medium and gets me in touch with my connection to the larger world as well as my own mortality.  Finally, it surprised me how quickly Schulz reached his mature style.  By the early part of 1953, the look and the nature of the major characters is pretty much Peanuts as we know it today
