I read this book about a year ago.  I found it immensly disturbing.  Yet, at the same time, it is a fascinating and important book.  I've not known many Christian Scientists, but I have read Science & Health and am well acquainted with many of the ideas of Mary Baker Eddy.

Among the contributions of Mary Baker Eddy has been to highlight the relationship between faith and health.  However, I do believe that one should not negate medical science.  The world in which Mary Baker Eddy lived and our world today are vastly different.  Seeking healing through prayer might have very well been prudent in the 19th century.  Medical care was not what it is today.  I count myself as a religious person, but I don't see the need for abandoning medical care.    

While highlighting the good of Christian Science, Carolyn Fraser also lets us see another side.  It is a profoundly disturbing picture
