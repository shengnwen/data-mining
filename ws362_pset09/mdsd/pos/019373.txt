I purchased this book on audiocassette and, as someone who enjoys both murder mysteries and cats, enjoyed it thoroughly. The author certainly is a cat person, and she spices the whodunit with humorous cat incidents. Each "kitty break" brought a smile to my face. It's also nice to enjoy  a family-friendly story for a change
