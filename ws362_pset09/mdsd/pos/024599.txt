A well written insprirational adventure book. 

Erik suffered from retinoscheses at an early age and progressively lost his eyesight by the age of 16. However, determined not to lead a sedate and mundane life ordained for the blind, Erik pushed known physical limits and set high water marks by climbing some of the most difficult mounatins in the world. In doing so, he made true friends (Sam, Chris and Jeff) who selflessly linked their fate (and lives) to his on the high mountains. Erik's mother (who tragically died when he was still young) provided the guiding spiritual force. Erik's father untiringly and relentlessly helped him realise his dreams. Erik found true love in his wife Ellie who selflessly backed him achieve his destiny and break all boundaries that other people were eager to set for him. 

Somehow, adventure travelers and high mountain climbers have a knack of writing compelling, inspirational, humurous and entertaining books that are tinged with spirituality: Erik more than maintains that legacy. There is a certain innocence in Erik's writing that lingers long after you've finished reading the book.
