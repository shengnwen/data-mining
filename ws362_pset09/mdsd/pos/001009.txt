This is a biography of a criminologist (Lonnie Athens) who doesn't buy the &quot;born bad&quot; theory of criminology.  Rhodes writes a personal and intellectual biography (the two are inseparable anyways) of a man who grew up in a violent home but didn't end up in prison.  He carries his narrative of Athens' life and works past a mere recounting of the criminologist's experiences and writings by comparing Athens' findings with other classic studies of violence, often finding in what appear to be contradictory studies evidence of the truth that Athens uncovered by his unconventional approach of actually interviewing men and women who had committed violent acts.  This book is for the politician and the voter who is looking for fresh and pragmatic insight into the problem of murder, rape, and assault
