Jodi Picoult's forte is picking a moral problem with lots of gray areas and writing a novel about it which contains riveting characters.  In this book, the main topic is supposed to be euthenasia.  The people involved are Jamie, who is deeply in love with his wife Maggie, who has cancer.  She persuades him that her life is not worth living and that he should kill her to release her from her misery.  He does so, and then admits what he has done to Cam, a police chief who is also his cousin.  Soon, Jamie's story is put on the back burner and Cam's infidelity with his wife Allie's employee, Mia, takes center stage.  I agree with some of the other reviewers who feel that there are too many distractions in this book which water down the main topic.  Cam's connection with the ancient McDonald clan in Scotland seems unnecessary as does the oft-related dreams of the main characters and fleeting appearances of Maggie's ghost.  Although the characters are not as appealing and deeply-written as those in some of Picoult's other books, their interactions and feelings are believable enough for this to be a four-star book
