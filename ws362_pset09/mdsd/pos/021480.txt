Having read all of the other Conversations with God, Home with God was still as fascinating as the first book in the series.  And, having studied Eastern and Western religions as a hobby, I find that there is absolutely nothing to disagree with.  The bottom line of religious thought (the mystical revelations) are very much in sync with Walsch's writings. I feel that the material in the book is consistent with my own revelatory experiences
