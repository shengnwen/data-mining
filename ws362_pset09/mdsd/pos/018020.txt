As Crystal notes in the introduction, this is a book explaining the "how" of language, not the what.  His chapters are short and to the point, not getting too deep into technical terms but explaining ideas as needed.

The diagrams give all the pertinent information and are useful in understanding the physiology of speech, especially.

His examples are revelent and interesting.  Sometimes he seems to pick and choose which points he puts in the book and which he doesn't, giving the book a feel of being unbalanced, but this could just be my own emotions reflected on the material.

I would buy it again
