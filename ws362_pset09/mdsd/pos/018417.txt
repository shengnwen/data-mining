This story is obviously (read the other reviews!) great for transracial families, either by adoption or marriage, and because it really doesn't specifically talk about adoption or adopting as an infant, I think it would be great for children who do look like their families, as a way to talk about loving all different kinds of people.  It's a great way to start conversations like "Can you love someone who doesn't look like you? What if they look or talk 'funny'?" It would be good for talking about people with disabilities, the elderly - someone doesn't have to look just like us to be lovable.  I recommend this book for all families
