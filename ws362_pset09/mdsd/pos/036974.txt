The dollhouses in the book originated from a contest sponsored by Sustainable San Mateo County in California. The participants were challenged to design and build functional and aesthetic pieces that would inspire people of all ages to make their own homes more environmentally sustainable and healthy. 

The Green Dollhouse could be the perfect gift for a friend, child or someone interested in the subject of architecture, sustainability or the innovative process of transforming common household materials into functional pieces of art.
