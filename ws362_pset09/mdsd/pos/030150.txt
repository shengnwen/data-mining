this book pulls you in the first 50 pages with a really disgusting opening first few pages.  after the first 100 pages, the next 300 pages or so move slow as hell and nothing interesting really happens until page 374 where the husband character gets into a fight with an overweight black woman who ends up urinates on him.  

if it wasn't for that HILARIOUS scene i would have given up on the book by page 400 i'm sure.

king has written better books like the shining, hearts in atlantis, the stand, and the eyes of the dragon, i would suggest reading those before coming to this boo
