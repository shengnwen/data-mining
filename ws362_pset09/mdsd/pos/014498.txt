The title of this book is based on a quote from Marcus Cicero, the Roman Orator. That quote decribes the secret enemy within the city gates, and among the halls of goverment as more dangerous than an overt enemy.

From this foundation Savage (Michael Wiener) draws upon his personal experiences in a humorous, if not somewhat colloquial way, as a basis to describe current problems of 'liberalism' in our society. These are not problems of classical liberalism, but instead those of division, coercive thought, politically correct jargonism and negativity toward the majority. His motto: "Borders, language, and culture."

Throughout the text, Dr. Wiener describes specific incidents and persons to back up his argument. He explains how our courts have been taken over by special interests (example Ford Foundation) and what needs done to fix it (impeach judges). An index follows the text.

I have taken off only one star due to the short sentences and sometimes off the hip style of Savage. But, at least he is an honest man.

If only our politicians were so honest!
