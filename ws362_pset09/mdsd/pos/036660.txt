Using the precepts of God's Word, this book will give you the tools to have the loving and fulfilling marriage that God designed.  This book acts as a guide to show you what God has to say about marriage, and what a truly beautiful covenant God meant it to be.  As a newlywed I am so thankful for this book and have seen God use it to change the hearts of some &quot;oldlyweds&quot; and restore marriages.  I highly recommend the study guide.  This is a great present for engaged couples.  In fact I've already bought two for engaged friends
