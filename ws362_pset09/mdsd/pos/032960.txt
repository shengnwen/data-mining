I love this book.  I've been using it for several years and recommend it as a good monthly guide for `Living the Magical Life' year round. If you want to learn more about keeping the Wiccan calendar this is a good source. You can begin living the magical life anytime, as each solar cycle brings a wonderful progression of the old holidays. WHEEL OF THE YEAR shows you that even in months without a major holiday, there are many opportunities to reconnect with the ground of your being and celebrate the seasons of Nature and the natural world. 

If you are inclined to connecting with the other world, Samhain is the best time to undertake living the spiritual life. October is nearly here, and thus Samhain and the New Year are upon us, making this is an especially good time to buy this book.

The text is interesting and contains many nice illustrations. As the book is printed on soft paper with a soft cover, you can take it out doors where many practices are to be undertaken. It won't hurt the book one bit if you spill a little oil or candle wax on it.
