(My first grade students have created a review to share with other readers.  This what they wrote.) 
  There was a little boy, James, who lived with his two mean ugly aunts.  Sadly, his mom and dad were eaten by a rhino.  The aunts made him work, he couldn't have friends, and he couldn't go to the beach.  One day a little green old man gave him magical crystals but James dropped them!  Later, in the spot where he dropped them, James found a huge peach.  He went inside and found a strange surprising sight and his life was changed!
  We thought this story was totally awesome because there were a lot of surprising things that happened.  Every day, we couldn't wait to read the next chapter!  James and his new friends went on a great peachy adventure!
