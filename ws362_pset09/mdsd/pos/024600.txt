I think Dr. Nuland's book is very good but like a previous reviewer, I  don't understand how he comes to the conclusion that random chance  mutations produced something as awesome as the human body!  I think his  bringing macroevolution (an unproven theory that to the honest, open-minded  person has no supporting evidence)  into the discussion of anatomy is  gratuitous
