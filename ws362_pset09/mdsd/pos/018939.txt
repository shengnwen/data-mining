This is the first in what will eventually be a quadrilogy of books, but be warned. There were around 12 years between books 2 and 3 being published so don't hold your breath for book 4.That aside, these are lightweight stories but still entertaining and worth reading.
Elvenbane is a tale of the struggle between 'half bloods' and Elves. The lordly elves rule the land with savage brutality. Humans are their slaves and viewed as little better than animals. Occasionally half bloods (a mixture of elf and human) are born. These are feared by the elves due to their strong magical powers, and are usually destroyed as soon as they are born.
Shana, the heroine of the tale, is one such half blood. Born in the desert to a mother who died giving birth, Shana is found and fostered by a dragon. No one knows dragons exist until Shana, following her fate as the 'Elvenbane' calls on them for help in the battle against Elves. The last such 'Wizard war' almost wiped out humanity; will it be different this time?
Enjoyable story for anyone wanting a quick read
