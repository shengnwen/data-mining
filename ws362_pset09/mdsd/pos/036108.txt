I teach NEC articles dealing with low-voltage issues and grounding to custom electronics installers.  This is by far the best book I have ever used as a reference and I've seen a lot!   The text is very clear, the illustrations are amazingly good.  I have spoken with Ray Mullin the auther on many occassions and am always impressed with not only his knowledge but on the TLC (tender loving care) he puts into each edition.   You can't go wrong with this reference
