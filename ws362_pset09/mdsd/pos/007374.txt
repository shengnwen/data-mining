Amazon has delayed the order three times, and now they want me to review the item!  I don't know if I will like the book, but I know I will never use Amazon again.  Maybe they meant "usually ships in 1 to 2 months", instead of "1 to 2 days".

If anyone from Amazon reads this, please, please, please send my order or tell me why you mislead me on the availability.  I get upset by misleading web sites, since they do a great disservice to the ones that are honest merchants.
