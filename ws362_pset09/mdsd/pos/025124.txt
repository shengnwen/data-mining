I like this book much better than Wild at Heart, though I tought students from it for about half a year. The basic thing I've taken away from the books is that it teaches us to be open about our futures and grab some nostalga along the way. Waking the Dead like Wild at Heart focus on what most conservatives will call OPEN THEOLOGY. This approach to God creates a sort of open question as to the future and whether we have a hand in it. John frequently sets up statements that lead conservatives to view them as redefining God, His intentions and what scripture says.

While conservatives can tear apart these writings based on John's innaccurate portrayal of scripture, none I have spoken with have not liked the book. One man said they got him off his duff, out dating again, and on with his life - all good.

Scripturally sound, no. Biblically accurate, no. Encouraging and exciting and forward thinking, yes. It's a great read but just not to be reconciled for accuracy
