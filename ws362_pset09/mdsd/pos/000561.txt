In &quot;Ancient Greece&quot;, Thomas Martin manages to present a cohesive and fundamental narrative. His synopsis is brief, but to the point, and provides an excellent building block for further inquiry. Martin's prose maintains the readers interest in a superior way without overly technical terminology. Encompassing the Paleolithic through the Classic era, Martin artfully presents the politics, the economy, the confrontations, and the everyday life of Greece and it's inhabitants. I believe it an excellent work and one that will inspire further and more specific inquiry into the life of the ancient Greeks
