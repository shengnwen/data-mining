I purchased this as my first book on Astronomy and I can recommend it for this level, or for a young person.  I am now purchasing Backyard Astronomy Guide which I believe is more advanced.  Sometimes a more advance book, in  the beginning, may stifle one's interest.  This book was so colorful and  easy to understand that it increased my desire to know more about this  interesting and complex subject
