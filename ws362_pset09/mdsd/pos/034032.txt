Repairman Jack at his finest!

To get the most from this series, you should read 'The Keep' and then 'The Tomb' first.  And once you get this far, each new addition to the series is like a visit from a long lost childhood friend on a rainy afternoon.  

Reading about Abe's expression over one of Jack's disguises is absolutely priceless!  Had to re-read that section a few times and it just got better and better!

The series as a whole and especially this book are well worth the investment of your time.
