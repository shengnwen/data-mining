This book was suggested to me ater recently being diagnosed with ADHD. Anyone who has a brother, sister, child, mother or friend with ADHD should read this book. Because it is so well written it gives the reader real insight into how the ADHD mind intereprets and responds to everyday activities. Books like this one will help to dispell the myth that ADHD= "hyperactive, over drugged kids who refuse to pay attention" and "lazy, irresponsible adults looking for excuses"
