I really liked this book, but it made me depressed.  It was anything but predictible, and the book was great... but the movie, let me put it this way... SUCKED!  It did not follow the book whatsoever.  The book is a  helluva lot better.  Don't waste your time on the movie if you're planning  on seeing it.  If you liked anything that Larry McMurtry has written you'll  like this one
