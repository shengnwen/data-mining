This book explored a lot of different cases and included a lot of material you don't find in other forensic/crime books, such as the interview with Jeffrey Dhamer. However, Robert Ressler has a HUGE ego problem and seemed to spend a lot of time boasting about himself and his work, his overwhelmingly large picture on the front of this book is just a small comparison to whats inside. ;
