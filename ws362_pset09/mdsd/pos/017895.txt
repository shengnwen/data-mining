I just finished reading What Every Business Owner Should Know About Valuing Their Business.  As a partner in a midsized insurance agency, I found the case studies to be very thought provoking as we begin thinking about ways to increase the value of our business toward our ultimate goal of selling the business as a means of funding our retirement.  Although we found the insurance agency case to be the most interesting, the other case studies were also very helpful in illustrating different valuation related concepts.  I would highly recommend this book to any business owner who would like to learn more about various elements that drive valuation.  This book would also be helpful for people buying a business so that they can get a better understanding of the thought process of both sellers and buyers
