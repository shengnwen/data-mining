I picked this book up not knowing what to expect.  I was slightly familiar with Belzer's stand-up, but hadn't read anything he had written. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  

I have always been slightly interested in conspiracy theories, but with my interest came a bit of embarrassment. Belzer's humor effectively dissolved my embarrassment.  If I started feeling a little ridiculous when I found myself seriously considering an off the wall idea, Belzer's wit would put me at ease.  The humor made it easy to tell yourself, "I'm not crazy, Belzer is."

I can't say that Belzer was able to convince me of anything, but he certainly managed to pique my curiosity.  Should I decide to learn more about the theories Belzer presents, I can simply turn to the helpful bibliography of conspiracy books and resources that Belzer recommends.

The bottom line - this book is a great blend of conspiracy and humor and I think it could be enjoyed by someone looking for either
