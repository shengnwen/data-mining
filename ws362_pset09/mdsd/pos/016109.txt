I had read "What to Expect When You're Expecting" but when I saw this book in the library I was all over it - something that caters to the over 35 woman!  It was easy to read and had a lot of good technical information as well as a personal touch as the author herself had an over 35 pregnancy as well as some miscarriages.  I'm not pregnant (yet!) but I look forward to being able to go back and take advantage of the week by week format that the author presents. UPDATE 4/26/05:  My baby is now 3 months old and I can say that this book as well as "The Pregnancy Journal" were the two books I referred to throughout my pregnancy and were both so helpful
