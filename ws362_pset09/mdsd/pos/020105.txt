I've used this text for over ten years for my graduate and upper division  undergraduate courses in Research Methods.  While there are a number of  other introductory methodology texts, I prefer Babbie because the Student  Guide that accompanies the text has so many strong features. One of the  most important is the experiential nature of many of the problems,  questions and especially the exercises that appear at the end of each  chapter. The book is voluminous, containing a wealth of material on  methodology.  The Student Guide provides not only an excellent chapter by  chapter review, but a true supplement to the text. Answers to the matching  and multiple choice questions that relate to each chapter appear in the  back of the Study Guide.      The two chapters on survey research are quite  good as an introduction to this type of methodology.  Additional chapters  cover other important topics such as experimentation, field studies,  content analysis, and others.  The chapter on evaluation research presents  a good conceptual overview that can be applied to many different settings.   Once again it is important to stress that the Student Study Guide provides  such vital support when using the text that I would only recommend using  them together.  Babbie touches on quantitative analysis, but mostly on  basic concepts and fairly simple techniques. While the language is  sometimes obtuse, this can be overlooked when examining the book in its  entirety.        Most of the applications or examples used in the text are  from the field of sociology, but an experienced instructor can provide  examples from other fields (eg: political science, psychology, public  administration, etc.)  There are several other computer-based support  items.
