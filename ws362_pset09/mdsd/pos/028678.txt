James and the giant peach is a great book!I love the pictures.James is a young boy with nagging dumb parents.James had a peach tree in his garden and in a few days the peach was huge.James found a hole in the peach and went inside it.James just saw yellow flesh.Then he cut a piece of and clibed inside the peach.When the creatures inside saw him they were in a panic.James was greeted by the silk worm and the glow worm.The other creatures made a drink because James was thirsty.James started to get used to them.I recomend this book for children who like Rhoal Dahl
