More than any other book written in the last 10 years, this shows how character counts.  While George Washington risked his fortune and his life, as did Arnold, Washington let his sense of duty and honor rule over the types of personal attacks and insults that drove Arnold, a genuine hero but of a much weaker character than Washington, to betray his Cause, his Country, and his own men by attempting to turn over West Point (and probably the war) to the British.

While I wish there was more detail of Arnold's life after he switched sides and after the war, it is still a wonderful read
