Tom Ripley is one of those characters that leaves you wondering. Should I admire this guy?  Is he a total schmuck?  Should I pity him?  How can he live in his own skin?  These characteristics and contradictions within one character testify to the depth and talent of Highsmith's writing.  The other characters are less well developed - a bit two dimensional.  But Ripley's character is enough to keep the book interesting.

The plot line comes and goes.  There were some points where I got bored and tired of the self-pitying characters.  But this is who they were and this is how we should see them.

Another nice plus is that the book is not set in any particular time.  It was first published in the mid 1950s, but it has a feel of the 1960s "beautiful people" or of the 1920s.  This lends a feeling of mystery to the writing
