I am devoted JD Robb/Nora fan. Conspiracy-Survivior-Born are my favorite Robbs. Born has such a complex feel to it. Naturally the Mavis baby bits are wonderful. The sense of frustration and anxiety felt by both Roarke and Eve contribute to the enjoyment of the book. Surv. is also great because of the child issues that both Roarke and Eve have. Born in Death also addresses those concerns that they share. Read and Love Eve.
