I am a multiple, but not of the sort Truddi Chase is. It's important to remember that each multiple is different, and each multiple's experience is different. In that way, I find the idea that this is an "insight into the world of MPD" to be laughable.

I am of the view that one can be multiple, and one can be disordered; the two are very different things. However, if you are multiple, and have been disordered, you might well end up like this. 

Nonetheless, I found it a fascinating read - and just incidentally, a direct documentation of the sorts of sickening abuse that many children are subject to. 

In that light, I find the infestation of "denial" reviews to be fascinating. Consider the fact that "they" do not want you to read this book to be it's own perverse recommendation
