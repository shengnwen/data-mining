The Pelican Brief is one of John Grisham's more fast paced and exciting book. 

Two supreme court justices are murdered by someone who does such a good job that there are few if any clues to go on. Darby Shaw and her lover/professor are intrigued by who could have done this so Darby does a ton of research and writes the "Pelican Brief". Her boyfriend/professor is a good friend of someone in the FBI and the file gets distributed. The bad guys find out about Darby, who apparently has hit the suspects right on and the chase begins. 

This book is very entertaining with nonstop action. You'll be constantly turning the page to see how Darby and friends etc keep escaping and how the plot will unfold. 

The only problems with the book are as follows: 

1 - The book has so many characters that it gets confusing at times

2 - The book is all action and adventure and little else. Once it's done you'll never go back and read it again. This would make a very poor book club book.

3 - A little over the top on the implied sex etc between Darby and her professor etc... (but nothing compared to what you'll get in other books)

Overall a very entertaing and exciting book but not a lot of "soul". I would definitely recomend it to anyone who likes action books.
