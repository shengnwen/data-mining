This is such a rich and deep work. Its exploration of human longings and relationships is powerfully poetic. One of its predominant notes is longing and disappointment in life. The Masha who opens the play telling of her unhappiness seems to signal what is to come, a series of lonely cries from characters each of whom fails to attain what they most want. The estate owner Sorin laments never having fulfilled his dream of being an author, or his dream of having been married, and now even his dream of living out his last years in the City, in Moscow. His sister the actress is in one sense a typically Russian character filled with passionate contradictions, generous in helping the misfortunate but unbelievably vain in regard to her own status as actress. Her son Constantine frustrated by the love of the actress Nina is too troubled by the sense of inferiority which comes from his having spent a childhood in the company of his mother's successful friends. Nina herself madly in love with the writer Trifonov with whom she runs off with, only to be abandoned by , is too another broken character who nonetheless persists and fights on, as she goes out to the provinces to renew her acting career. Fame and success too do not provide the key to happiness as is demonstrated in the life of Trifonov. 
This play demonstrates Chekhov's incredible capacity for creating living characters, and the tremendous emotional richness of his work.
