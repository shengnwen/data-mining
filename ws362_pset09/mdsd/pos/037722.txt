A complex plot that may keep you hooked, but the main combatant Delta/Cain is unbelievebly tough -- he beats up or kills countless bad guys -- almost like superman. He is incredible but too unreal for me. If you want to read about a guy on the run from everyone and is more like a real person, try "The Dogs of Riga"
