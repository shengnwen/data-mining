Beautifully presented, this book provides two different functions.  The first part of the book is a standard introduction to container gardening, with information about how to plant pots, the order, and how best to arrange them.  The author has some very nice instructional graphics to illustrate the steps, disembodied hands working in the dirt.  The second and more interesting part of the book involved his breakdown of container plant types by color.  Each main area of the color wheel is given a section, and plants for that color are described for spring, summer, and fall/winter.  If you like to work and create your arrangements by combining color schemes, this will be very helpful.  I'm still at the stage where a book like Hillier's `Container Gardening Through the Year' was more appropriate providing concrete examples that you can go out and put together.  Joyce does do that for a variety of pots, indicating through pot-maps where things should be planted etc., but that's not the main thrust of the book it appeared.  I did like the presentation and can understand the high rankings this work receives
