Ingmar Bergman's status as a master of cinema derives less from individual films than from his totally distinctive style and abiding preoccupations... Few directors have repeatedly given voice to such a deeply personal vision of human suffering and solitude...

In the mid-1950's, Bergman began a series of dark, brooding films about the nature of good and evil, about faith and death, about the psychological and spiritual torment of mankind... 

In "The Seventh Seal," a medieval knight returns from the Crusades to challenge Death to a symbolic game of chess while he seeks the meaning of life... The scenes depicting the burning of a young witch, the masochism of a procession of flagellants, and the suffering of plague victims constitute an unforgettable visualization of the wretched condition of the human race... But in the end, the knight manages to save from death a family of strolling players--a father, mother, and infant who are obviously symbols of Christianity... 

This striking allegory, which established Bergman's international reputation, is still regarded as one of his best films...
