As I read this book, I couldn't help but laugh out loud at the pictures and events that happen to Junie B. as she joins her mom and dad on a paradise vacation to Hawaii. Mr. Scary makes Junie B. the first official photo journalist from Room One before leaving on her vacation.  With that title, Mr. Scary included direction to take pictures and write captions along the trip to put in her journal.  Two events I especially enjoyed reading about and imagining from the story occurs when Junie B. becomes friends with two different kinds of birds. The text in this story is well written and gives many detailed events to help paint a picture as you read. I was a little disappointed in the ending.  The story begins in Room One but ends on the last day of the vacation.  You never know what really happens when Junie B. returns to Room One and shares her journal with her peers.  You will laugh out loud too as you read this story.  It might even make you or your child want to become a photo journalist on your next vacation
