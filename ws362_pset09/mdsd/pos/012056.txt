   I've read numerous sailing adventure books, but this one is a true page turner!  You learn about all of the differnt sailors on board each boat that gets swallowed up in a Force 12 storm.  You begin to bond with these people and feel their anxiety and fears right along with them.  One thing that stands apart in this book, verses others that I've read: is the author takes time to pay tribute to the heroics of the rescuers who are sent out to sea, to risk their own lives to save the lives of others. If you want fast paced, gripping suspense and adventure; then you'll certainly want to read this book
