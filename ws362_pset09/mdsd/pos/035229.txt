This book is a great book, don't get me wrong, but has a slow beginning, slow enough that I actually became discouraged and thought about putting the book away, but once the book really gets going it is thrilling and very fast paced. If you can make it through the initial crawl and into the heart of the book you will not, at all, be disappointed for sticking with this novel. The concept of this book is fairly simple; something in the scientific world is being done that the church strongly disproves of, enough disproval that it drives them to kill. The victims are all the same: a mother and a male child under the age of 4. The victims that are targeted all have one thing in common, they all went to a clinic that was doing top of the end research and was very successful at allowing those that were infertile or too old the possibility to have children. The clinic helps out those who want to carry children and are otherwise deemed untreatable, and also carrying out research that could alter the world forever, an extremely delicate subject that threatens to change the way our entire history, as human beings, is viewed. Through the whole debacle many lives are lost in hope of protecting something deemed sacred. 

The thing that is terrifying about this book is that it COULD actually happen. The idea is fairly far fetched but, in some discreet lab I could actually see research of this kind unfolding. The fact that John Case dreamed up the idea shows that maybe others out there have thought, or even tried this idea out. The epilogue of this book is just fantastic, and could actually lead to the writing of a second in the series, something that would have the potential to be far superior to its predecessor. Overall I really did like this book, a book that opened my eyes to the writing of John Case, something I look forward to exploring in the future.
