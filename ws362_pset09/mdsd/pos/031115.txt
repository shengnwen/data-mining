Edith Hamilton (now passed) has a living work of art in her stead by the name of Mythology.  This congolmerate work of the world's oldest known tales is likely the most concise and accredited version worthy of the haughtiest bookshelf.

I breezed through most of the short stories and really ate up the ones of tragic love and happily ever afters, but through this version, readers can easily distinguish the story being told and enjoy the characters.  Hamilton's writing it prosaic and timeless, perfect for Greek Myths.  This collection is something that can even be of use to students of all ages and I can easily see myself coming back to this book a great many times for not only learning but enjoyment.

Highly recommended read, especially for the Greek in all of us
