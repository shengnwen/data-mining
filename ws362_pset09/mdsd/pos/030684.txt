OK here's the truth:  This book is an awful text when accompanied by not so great prof is teaching from it (e.g. one who delivers nothing but the text). BUT... once you begin to understand enough to know that the "trivial" "exercise" and "left to the reader" proofs are quite straightforward, the book is probably the best reference in Algebra you can hope for
