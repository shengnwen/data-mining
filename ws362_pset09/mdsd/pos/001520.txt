For most of the past ten years Andrew Greeley has been slowly developing his conclusions on &quot;Catholic Imagination.&quot;  This latest effort is indeed his best.  The book never really defines &quot;Catholic  Imagination,&quot; choosing instead to describe it over and over in various  ways -- an effective technique.      Seven chapters go through various  aspects of life -- place, time, desire, community, authority, etc -- and  explain that there is a distinctive and particularly Catholic way of  understanding and living those realities.  His unique style is to spend the  first half of each chapter explaining his point, and the last half citing  sociological data confirming his conclusions.      The book would be good  for Catholics seeking self-understanding and non-Catholics trying to get a  grasp of why Catholics are sometimes so different from Protestants.       Greeley is a good author so it is an easy book to read.  The introduction  is an absolute necessity and the first chapter is the most difficult to  understand. It would be easy to give up on the book about page 33 or so,  but that would be a mistake.     It is well printed, good type face, wide  margins, but only minimally adequate pictures
