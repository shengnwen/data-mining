"On Guerrilla Warfare," by Mao Tse-Tung, has been translated into English by Samuel B. Griffith II.  Griffith also provides a substantial introduction to the text.  The book is written in the context of China's guerrilla war against Japanese occupiers; this conflict is mentioned often by Mao.  In this book Mao discusses the differences between guerrilla and "orthodox" military forces, as well as how such forces can work together for a common goal.  Other topics covered include propaganda and political concerns, the formation of guerrilla units, the qualities of a good guerrilla officer, discipline in a guerrilla army, and guerrilla bases.

Mao stresses the importance of speed, surprise, and initiative in guerrilla war.  Among the most interesting sections of the book is a code of conduct for guerrilla fighters.  Most of the book is fairly dry and matter-of-fact, but there are welcome flashes of passion, poetic imagery, and global vision that make this more than just a textbook.  Translator Griffith notes that Mao's text was first published in 1937.  Despite the passage of time, I believe that this is still a relevant text, and I recommend it in particular to all professional military personnel
