This is the third in Simmons' hard-boiled series of Joe Kurtz books, and it's another winner.  It's a little more predictable than the first two (not surprising with later series entries), but still a good read-- and we now know who Kurtz's father is (or we do if we are fans of Richard Stark). 

I'm used to noir heroes getting beat up and abused: Philip Marlowe and the Continental Op and Travis McGee and every two-bit gumshoe gets pummelled into unconsciousness or winged by a gat or tortured unmercifully on every other case.  But Simmons is REALLY cruel to Kurtz. In every book, he's so abused you just wanna tell him to sit down and have a beer and watch Oprah and recover a little.  Hell, I thought he was pretty much dead at the end of the second book.  Now, here he is, back again.  Ten pages in, though, he's pretty much dead again.  Simmons: Give Kurtz a break!

Simmons is always worth reading-- if you've read the first two Kurtzes, you'll want to read this one
