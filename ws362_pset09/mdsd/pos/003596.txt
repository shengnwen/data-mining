After reading the negative reviews on this book I tried to keep those complaints in mind when I sat down with my copy. I have to say that, for me, this book was thoroughly enjoyable. JAK delivered on all accounts as far as I'm concerned. We get more insight into Ethan and Zoe's relationship, which is beautiful and steamy as they share their insecurities. Ethan having been left by 3 previous wives causes him to question how long before Zoe does the same. And Zoe, knowing Ethan isn't big on the psychic "woo-woo" thing is afraid that he'll never fully know/accept her differences. Previous characters share in the story but not the "spotlight." That can be annoying, I know, but these are characters that you love to hear about and that also carry major roles in this Mystery and in no way detract from the story. I also love the fact that we follow a multitude of Ethan's cases. Some intertwine, while others are an added layer of interest. In my opinion you can't go wrong with this author, she is very talented. This is a romance/mystery mild on the suspence, not at all like Karen Rose or Anne Stuart darker novels. JAK is what she is, in my opinion always enjoyable.
