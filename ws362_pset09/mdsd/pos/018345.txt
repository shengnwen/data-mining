My daughter loved this program!  She is homeschooled, and listened to it on her own every day (over & over) with no nagging from me. Because of the use of songs, I feel that a child who enjoys singing will gain more from this program than a child who doesn't.  (most children's language programs I've found use a lot of singing) The reviewer who disapproved of the use of witches etc. in the book may not understand that the text is very *German*... I found after living in Germany that Germans have their own ideas about what is appropriate for children.  (I see no point in learning a language which has been disjointed from its culture.) My daughter was 8/9 yrs of age when she used this program (cassette version) and nothing was offensive or inappropriate.  All in all, a wonderful start to your child's study of German!  5 stars for being fun, easy to use, and educational. I only wish there were a level 2
