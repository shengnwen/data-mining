I came across this book in my daughter's kitchen while visiting her in Oregon.  I found myself reading the whole thing during the course of our one-week visit, but it was after I had copied out the third recipe (these are two unusual acts for me, reading whole cookbooks and copying recipes) that I realized another copy of the book deserved to be bought.  For good recipes covering a wide terrain, and for short, honest perspectives on a lot of different relationships, it's an excellent book.  And I'll admit: I'm far from a saint, but it is nice to be able to read about other guys and occasionally think "well, gee, at least I never did THAT!
