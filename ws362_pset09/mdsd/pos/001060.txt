Dorman has taken his fascinating documentary film about the &quot;New York  intellectuals&quot;, added new material and turned it into this book.   Forcing the subjects of the film to actually talk about their ideas in  simple sentences makes them frequently more comprehensible and accessible  than the sometimes abstuse books they write. Dorman is surprisingly  sympathetic to neoconservative godfather Irving Kristol, treating him with  the same respect as the other three subjects (&quot;surprising&quot;  because like here talking with Irving Howe, he is usually denounced by the  left as a traitor and &quot;spokesman for corporate interests.&quot;)  The  book has an elegiac last chapter lamenting the decline of the &quot;public  intellectuals.&quot;  Academia has degenerated into a group obsessed with  left-wing theory and jargon: one critic says &quot;You notice immediately  they can't write, amd notice gradually they can't think either.&quot;   Public intellectuals who still believe that truth can be recovered, that  actually believe in the possibility of objectivity, and disinterestedness  as a virtue are a vanishing breed in the age of spin and deconstruction.
