The quality of the book is very impressive. 400 small quilts reproduced with comments by the makers. If you are interested in what's going on in art, and/or quiltmaking, you will enjoy having this book. I am a biased reviewer - I am proud to say I have a Journal Quilt in the book. The process of using art to keep a journal was a freeing experience. I think the book will inspire others to start their own small projects, or just be a great book to page through and enjoy
