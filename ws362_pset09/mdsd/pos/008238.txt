I read several books a week, and this is one of the best ones in a long time. For a first time author, it is well written and well edited. The story falls into place with impecable timing, and literally had me cheering for the two main characters in the story. The mother was very likable as well.
I have already pre-ordered this writer's upcoming book, and look forward to many more. She is one of the more talented ones
