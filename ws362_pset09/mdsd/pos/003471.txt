The Deeds of the Disturber finds the Peabody Emersons returning home to England so that Emerson can finish his book, but it's not long before they are embroiled in yet another mystery.  The mystery here is interesting enough, but Amelia and Emerson belong in the hot sands of Egypt, not foggy, damp London.  The book shines a light on the character of O'Connell, a wily, Irish (if not a bit stereotypical) newspaperman and introduces us to the newspaperwoman Miss Minton.  Both are great characters that drive the plot.  There is also the introduction of a woman from Emerson's past, which creates an interesting subplot of jealousy for Amelia.  Also introduced in this book are Amelia's nephew and niece: Percy and &quot;dear&quot; Violet.  Both are necessary, but extremely obnoxious, characters that bedevil Ramses and reduce him in the eyes of his parents.  This whole storyline is the main reason I've lowered my rating to 4 stars.  Amelia's treatment of her only son borders on abuse and it just spoils an otherwise good book.  Don't let that stop you from reading The Deeds of the Disturber, though.  The mystery is good, and different, and you'll find yourself well invested in the plot and characters - even the annoying characters
