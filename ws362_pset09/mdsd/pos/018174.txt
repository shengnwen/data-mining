Great Reading for business or personal interest!

Having owned several small businesses I was intrigued by Darby's latest book. Over the past year or so I've been trying to implement some of the concepts he brings out, and my reading of "Leverage" was perfect timing. His book has helped to clarify my ideas and put 'meat' on the bones of a more solid business plan.

His personal touches help to bring into focus the reality that the 'business' person cannot be separated from the 'whole' person. Using his 25 Leverage Points will be of great value in bringing the process to full circle. The values he describes are very strong.

Thanks, Darby
