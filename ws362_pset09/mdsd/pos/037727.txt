A good friend of mine convinced me to buy this book.  "You'll love it" she said.  "You will discover funky things about you and me" she said.  So I bought a copy and immediately hated the cover ~ but after reading the first two pages I was hooked!  

 

"Compare" takes six major elements of personality - IQ, Creativity, Romance, Sex, Happiness, Work Ethic - and gives us a fresh perspective on each.  You learn interesting tidbits about each topic, then get to take scientific, yet fun, quizzes on each.  Then the amusement really begins, you compare your scores, thoughts, and feelings to all the other people who have taken these tests at universities around the world.  You truly get to learn about yourself then see `how you compare' to everyone else.

 

This is not your typical self-improvement book.  In fact, I'd really call it a book on understanding others.  Hint: It is more fun to take these tests and read the thoughtful commentary with friends.  You can really learn about what pushes their buttons and what makes them tick.

 

So, once you get past the awful cover photo, you will be delighted with this book.
