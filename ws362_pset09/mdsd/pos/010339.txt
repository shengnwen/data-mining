I'm a big fan of Larry Bond.  Computer Harpoon and his previous novels are great reads/games.

This novel meets one of my requirements for a good techno-thriller.  The "techno" parts are either dead on or seem to be dead on.  Almost reads like an introduction to 688 class submarines and what it takes to qualify in one.  The description of what a "trim party" is assures you that someone involved with the book has served on submarines.

I do note that the action was a little long in starting, with some tantalizing glimpses of what was to come.  I also note that some of the equipment is not fully explained, specifically the Manta remote vehicle, which is central to the plot.  What is it doing there?  What does it do?  We don't find out until late in the book the whys and wherefores of this thing, and only then just enough to get on with the story.  A little fictional background would have been helpful.

The characters are definitely uneven.  The captain is a whip-cracking martinet.  Or is he?  We don't find out why he acts as he does.  The same for the two civilian technical reps that are onboard.  Even the main character, Jerry Mitchell, is sort of a hollow cutout.  In fact the only character that received any sort of depth was the Senior Petty officer that gives Mitchell a hard time.  We find out why he does what he does, but even that isn't enough development of character.

There are some very loose ends left undone.  Does the XO ever find his "commissioning dirt"?  A nice little side plot that could have been done better.  What happens between the civilian tech Emily Davis and Lt. Mitchell?  Much is alluded to, but we are left hanging, and not in a "sequel" sort of way.  It just felt unfinished, almost like there was a rush to print.

But even with my quibbles, and that's what they are, I still recommend this as a good read.  Not a great one, but a good page turner, especially if you like sea stories
