MOJA MEANS ONE not only teaches people how to count to ten in Swahili, but it also is filled with information about East African culture. The illustrations are pleasing to the eye and add to the effect of the counting. For example, on the pages for tano (five) their is a brief description of the animals found in Africa and there are five animals in the picture. This is a good book to read not only to children, but is also good for anyone who is interested in learning about foreign languages and cultures
