Heat is a book you don't often pick up on the book shelf.  It is something that will keep you reading no matter what.  Every thing about it makes it amazing; though the two things that really made me love the book is the characters and the surprises.  Both of these things are not the whole book the book is something you would have to read to believe.

The characters are amazing.  My two favorite characters were Michael Arroyo and Mr. Gibbs.  They both were interesting and thought up hilarious but sometimes meaning full things.  All of the characters had different personalities and different ways of thinking.  Though all the characters did not agree all the time they always seemed to make things turn out right.  When one of the characters was having a problem or something was not right another character soon helped.  My favorite thing that one of the characters did was when Uncle Timo acts as if he were Michael and Carlos's father.  When they did that it made me laugh very much and I was amazed they would think of something such as this. 

Something that makes me loves books is when they give you a lot of surprises.  This book had a lot of surprises.  Some of the surprises made me happy and some of them did not.  One surprise that really mad me sad was when they said that Michael's father had been dead for around three months.  Though this book had many happy moments that one meant the most to me.  If you read Heat, which I very much suggest, you will be in for a trip because this book always has a surprise coming up. 

Characters and surprises are two of the many things that makes a book great to me.  While you read Heat you will be in a world that makes you laugh, cry, and have mixed feelings.  I suggest this book to anyone who loves to read and is in the mood for  a great book.
