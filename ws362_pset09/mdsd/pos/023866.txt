I've spent my life in the western U.S. outdoors, but until I read this book I had no idea that a fish and game warden's life could be so interesting.  Terry Grosz is not a polished writer, as mentioned by other reviewers, but he very is entertaining and obviously has a way of seeking out adventure in his love for nature.  Each chapter is a fairly self-contained story, which is nice for those of us who only have time for a brief read between work weeks.  Grosz points out that game wardens are more likely to die violent deaths than cops, which sort of sets the stage for his action-adventure tales of wardens vs. poachers, all the while emphasizing the importance of wildlife preservation.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the western US outdoors experience, wildlife preservation and even  someone just looking to be entertained.
