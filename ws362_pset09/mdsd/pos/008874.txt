My experience reading RU&RD was more conventional; I read the volumes straight through.  I have 2 hours of commuting on the subway each day so I get a lot of reading done.  I started in May and finished volume seven in August with one month off while I was on vacation. I never found it tedious or repetitive. If one topic did not particularly excite me he would be on to another in 5 or 10 pages.

The binding and slipcase is gorgeous. When my copy first arrived the slipcase had been damaged, but McSweeney's shipped me a new case free of charge- and I didn't even buy it from them.

The only thing I can add which has not been covered by other reviewers is the photography.  Vollman includes a couple dozen photos in each volume- i believe all of which he shot himself.  They include shots of a friend of his who had just been killed by a sniper, a woman in columbia pointing to a bloodstain where her daughter was slain, child soldiers in Burma.  I found the photos helped reinforced the reality of the exotic and often novelistically rendered personal experiences he offers in the second half of the book.  I really enjoyed them.

The other thing I find amazing is that Vollman is working on another seven volume book about the 'symbolic history of north america.'  I would have thought this would be considered a lifes work
