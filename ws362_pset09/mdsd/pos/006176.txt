"Ripley Under Ground" is the second novel in the Ripley series by the talented Patricia Highsmith.  In the first novel, readers were introduced to Tom Ripley - a poor player who wishes for a better life and achieves it through ill-gotten gains.  The charm of Tom Ripley is that even though he is an amoral murderer, the reader roots for him to get away with all the evil deeds he has committed.

This second book finds him married and living a rather quiet, peaceful life in France.  He is the conspirator of Derwatt Ltd., a company that manufactures paintings by an artist who has supposedly been dead for the past six years.  When questions of forgery arrive through an American visitor, Tom impersonates the artist but to little avail.  He later introduces himself to the American visitor as Tom Ripley, and invites him to his home in France to view the two Derwatt paintings he owns, in a desperate attempt to persuade the man to change his mind.  Despite all his charm and storytelling, the man refuses to budge on his theory and plans to seek out an expert when he returns to London.  Tom knows that he must take matters into his own hands to prevent this and the damage it would cause to everyone involved.

Tom Ripley is a thoroughly interesting character.  He is intelligent and philosophical despite his amoral adventures into corruption and murder.  He truly believes that he is doing what is best for himself and those involved.  As the story progresses, and the situation becomes even more desperate, there seems to be far too many loose ends to tie up - and Highsmith doesn't end them tidily.  She leaves room open for the series to continue, with questions abounding in the readers' minds.  And through everything we witness Tom do, we still want to see him succeed, even in the most grisly of tasks
