Michael Novak's book is one of the most concise and still thorough treatment of the issue of religion and the Founding. A look, not just at obvious conservative figures such as Washington and Adams, but also of the religious ideas of Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton (in other words, not the typical people you think of associated with the ideas of God and Government). One complaint: NO INDEX!!! The font also could be more readable, it looks like bold Times New Roman. But no complaints on the manuscript. Perfect
