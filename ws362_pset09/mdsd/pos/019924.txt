This book definately is not for everyone.  Dick considered himself a fictionalizing philosopher and this book really epitomizes that statement.  If you're a fan of bland easy to read scifi than this book is not for you, but if you like things with a little more substance (but possibly less structure) this book is great.  I just finished it and already I already miss the characters.  Dick had a talent for making characters that were archetypal and yet entirely human at the same time
