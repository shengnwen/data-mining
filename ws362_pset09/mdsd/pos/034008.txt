Just opening this book draws you into our pioneering past.  You will find a mixture of photos of pioneer children and families along with delightful quilts in the fabrics and styles of nineteenth century America on the move.

The excerpt for the diaries by pioneer children will both charm you and help you realize the hardships these children went through.  The information in each chapter will get you in touch with what life was like for these children.

But this isn't just a history book. There are patterns for the quilts and other projects that are related to the aspects of pioneer life described. All of Kathleen Tracy's patterns include clear and complete instructions so that even a beginner can make these lovely little quilts.  

Some of the patterns would be perfect for a child making his or her first quilt.  Others could be a joint mother and child project.  But of course grown ups will have a wonderful time making this quilts either for the children in their life, for their doll collection or just for fun.
