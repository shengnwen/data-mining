Robert Lowell was a great poet to be sure. These letters shine a bit of light on his non-public side. He is rude to his parents, snide in fact. In the 1st 2 sections he asks for money from them again and again, though he treats them as imbeciles and abuses them through his letters and in person. He boasts about his brilliance and believes that the path he is on will lead to fame, as it does. But at what price? 
It is hard to like R. Lowell as a person. I had moments when I wanted to yell at him (crazy, huh?). I believe that we should sometimes settle for art rather than the artist
