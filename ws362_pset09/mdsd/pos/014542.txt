I started this book knowing very little about the main characters. I never heard of Michael Milken or Ivan Boesky until I read this. It was interesting and entertaining to understand what they achieved and what they threw away. This is greed at its best. Some of the most intelligent and successful people in wall street who couldn't handle the success they already attained. I also enjoyed how the author made some of these people look like complete fools. The ones who couldn't succeed on their own so they had to cheat the system to look powerful. Then the ones who could succeed on their own but let their self-indulgence get the best of them. Once you finish this book you will realize these people were the biggest players in the market throughout the 80's.
