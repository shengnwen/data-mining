This may be the compleat Viking saga, however unlikely that sounds. It just seems to have everything, including Viking girth, humor and robustness. However, if your interest in the Vikings is only superficial,  and your mastery of English is not quite up to it, you won't read very far.  Gwyn Jones has written a densely-packed narrative (for, in spite of being  very much non-fiction, he manages to keep us in a narrative stream) which  requires only so many mouthfuls at a sitting. For my money, only the  experienced or very persistent reader of Norse history will get along with  this work, but oh what a ride he or she will have. Jones is, oh happy day,  the sort of writer whose scholarly leanings have not over-reached  themselves so far that he cannot take risks, sometimes in the most  delightful fashion. The text abounds in marvellous one-liners, so that it  is possible to imagine the writer acting the fool to some sixth century  prince of a Northern realm, and having to be very quick on his feet to stay  alive. There is much history here, no doubt, yet Jones has taken it and  presented it all with a very large grain of salt, such that I for one, am   very confident about the skipper on this particular voyage. It's a  remarkable book, what more can one say. Thoroughly recommended
