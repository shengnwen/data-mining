This book includes a patchwork of material from other authors ie Heidegger & Gadamer, etc.,which is noted in the Notes and Bibliography section of this book. This is really not unusual in a book.  It is just that the flow sometimes felt interrupted when transitioning from one topic to another.  Several pages discuss certain aspect of questions and listening.  After page 52, I resorted to skimming...I am not into philosophy. 

I reconnected to page 99. . . to a section called Silence & Dialogue. Fiurmara presents a viewpoint about silence and understanding that is right on target with listening. And after this Chapter Silence and Listening, I was pretty much done with the book.

If you truly enjoy Philosophy you will enjoy this book.
