Winchester takes an academic subject and makes it read like a Victorian thriller.  He weaves together the lives of two strange and complex men to tell a story that has touched the entire English speaking world  -- the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary: THE authority on the progression of the English language over the past millenium.  If you love history, language, literature, and tragedies this is a book for you.  Beware, this book will make you want to run out and buy your own OED -- well, a full set will run you at least $1000!  There are compact and CD-ROM versions available for under $200.  I guess I'll just add it to my amazon wish list and hope...
