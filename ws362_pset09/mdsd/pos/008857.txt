I bought this book first and then bought Chris Cunningham's book.  Both books compliment each other and since I do not know much about this process, I consider both required reading before I build.  I really enjoyed this book.  The author really tries to stay faithful to the spirit of the craft where possible.  Of course, sealskin is no longer used but there is no glue for the joints (just lashing) and no varnish (linseed oil) so that the boat can remain as flexible as possible.  I like that several designs were provided to show the possibilities of making skin on frame boats besides kayaks.  It is a fascinating read of an ancient boatbuilding method.  I am used to building small boats with wood, epoxy and varnish.  I always like to try and learn new methods, so I am glad I came across this book.  While this book does not provide all of the minute details and pictures of the Cunningham book, it still is very worthwhile getting.  The author's fondness for this craft is contagious and comes across well.  I would love to take a course at his shop sometime
