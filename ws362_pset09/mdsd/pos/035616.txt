I've read, written and collected TONS of prompts of all kinds over the past couple of years.  A lot of places repeat the same old tired prompts, but this book was filled with a large array of new prompts and 'thought joggers' that I haven't seen elsewhere.

I enjoyed just flipping through this book and now look forward to going back and start writing from the highlights I've made
