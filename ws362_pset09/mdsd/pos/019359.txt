I never knew tofu could be so exciting and delicious.  Akasha's comments after each recipe make this cookbook very personal and real.  I have tried 6 or 7 of her recipes and every one turned out great...a far cry from many  previous tofu recipes which tasted so blah and &quot;diet-food like.&quot;  I also enjoyed the various tips on how to use tofu instead of... A great  little book to keep handy
