I was somewhat dubious upon reading Looking For Alaska's despcription--it sounded like a tired story that had already been done. But one chapter into the book, I was completley hooked. John Green masterfully tells the story of Miles "Pudge" Halter, a somewhat geeky, rather antisocial sixteen-year-old who has never dared to do anything more exciting than memorize "last words."

This ingenious novel is as well-written as it is humorous and introduces believable teenage characters with memorable personalities. The book is not sutiable for teens under fourteen due to sexual refrences and strong language, but it appeals to both genders and a wide range of ages. 

Parents who are concerned about the drinking, smoking, and sex should understand that it is not portrayed favorably and there are several "lessons" cleverly woven in throughout the novel. I strongly recommend you read Looking For Alaska: you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll lose yourself in the incredible story.
