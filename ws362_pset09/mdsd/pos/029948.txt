I decided to read the book after watching the movie, created by Disney, of the same name.  While the movie is based upon the book and generally entertaining I found the book to be so much more fulfilling.  

I have always had an interest in wolves and Mowat provides the right touch in his writing to entertain as well as educate the reader on their behavior.  He also provides insight into the bureaucratic functions of the Canadian government which provokes laughter throughout the story.  

If looking for a general introduction to Wolves I thoroughly recommend this book.  It provides wonderful insight into their behavior, public misconceptions, and the affects that hunters and trappers have on wildlife in the northern regions of North America
