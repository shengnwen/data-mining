I used this book for a class in International Relations last semester, and I must admit that I was quite impressed. Morgenthau provides us with a sound and instructive discussion of the way international politics is functioning from a realist ponit of view; he also supports his argument with nice and useful examples. I do think, however, that he occasionally goes into extremes and uses terminology that does not entirely apply to the present day international situation, which might render his work somewhat incomplete. I believe the problem lies in the relevance of these issues to the modern political world: now that the Cold War is at least officially over, a  new approach to politics is needed to fill in the gaps that Morgenthau fails to address. One might also encounter problem with the readability of some of the chapters, especially if not a native English speaker like me, but, all in all, it is well written and structured. I would recommend this book as an absolutely necessary reading for everybody pursuing interests in international politics
