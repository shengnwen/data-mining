I leave off a &quot;star&quot; only because viewing Kentridge's drawings can not substitute the experience of viewing his films.  Indeed, looking the charcoal drawings I wonder at what stage of the sequence it is in.  Is this the last step in the drawing?  Looking at a drawing outside of its time base can also be a positive.  I love searching the surface for smudge marks and erased hands and arms.  His drawings end up being a record of movement (something that most single drawings fail to capture).  For anyone who doesn't know, by the way, Kentridge animates his charcoal drawings using filmic stop motion techniques.  The results are amazing.  Anyone interested in drawing and painting, the birth of early film, and South African Politics: here is your artist
