I felt as if were reading my own life story in the first 100 or so pages.  I have followed a similar track, but do not have Dr. Boylan's gift of prose and humor in explaining this to the layman.  Very painful, realistic view of the decisions a transsexual must make to survive.  Dr. Boylan is luckier than the vast majority of trans, in keeping her marriage relatively intact, but she is particularly adept at showing how stressed this process has made the relationship.
