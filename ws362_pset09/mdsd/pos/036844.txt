I thought this was agreat book because it has time travel and all the stuff about King Arthur and Merlin.  It was kind of cool because he tried to change how it was in midieval times by adding all this electric stuff like phones and lights and other modern stuff from his time, into the past.  He tried to change them entirely to a new government and basically a new place.  The ending was different from normal books because it didn't end well.  It had a twist to the ending.
