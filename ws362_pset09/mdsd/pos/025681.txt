If you buy only one book about the Beatles, it needs to be this one. Not only does it contain unique information not found elsewhere, but this unique info comes right from the four guys who should know better than anyone -- John, Paul, George and Ringo. Even though this came out a few years ago, put it at the top of your xmas list for the Beatlemaniac in your life. There are a couple of other great Beatles books out there (TURN ME ON, DEAD MAN by Andru Reeve and JOHN by Cynthia Lennon are just two that come to mind), but be sure to get this one if you haven't already
