Gene and Cathy Florence have done an outstanding job on this book. The pictures are outstanding and an excellent source for identifying various glass pieces. The descriptions are clear and very informative. My only issue is with the prices quoted. As Internet auctions, such as eBay are now the premier source for purchasing or selling depression glass, prices are drastically lower for most items listed in this book. This is also true for other similar books by other authors as well. As on-line auction sites are now the dominant source for depression glass and other collectables, the average prices seen over time on on-line auctions must be taken into account for future values.
