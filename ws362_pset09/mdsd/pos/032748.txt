In my past reviews  I applauded Mr. Larson's " Isaac's Storm " , also  his       " Devil In The White City " .   He does go into much detail when he writes but, in his defence , when you finish one of his books there are not questions left unanswered . so, it seems for once I agree with just about every review on here  as well as publishers reviews . If you read one of his books and enjoyed the ride  I can only  suggest you try the rest .
 Bravo again Mr. Larson...Brav
