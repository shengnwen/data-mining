I just finished reading this book.  Boy, it is almost nothing like the movie.  Aside from basic plot of "three witches in the town of Eastwick fall under the influence of a new man in town", the book and the movie have almost nothing in common. I don't want to give away too much of the book's plot, but the witches here are more promiscuous than in the movie.  Just about every married man in town has an affair with one of the witches.  Anyway, the book is a "good read", as they say, and you will probably enjoy it if you are not offended by sexual content
