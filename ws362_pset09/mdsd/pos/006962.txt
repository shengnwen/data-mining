Dr. Chapman is one of those authors who is able to blend a certain degree of humor, practical advice (that actually works), and yet is able to basically tell it like he sees it, all without irritating the reader or giving up his pastorship in the process. I love this guy.

Dr. Chapman wisely writes about the big hitters in a marriage; money, sex, personality, and even in-laws (something that is always needed to be discussed but rarely is). He does add a healthy dose of religion, but this shouldn't scare the non-religious reader because it is definitely not overbearing, nor is it "preachy" and you'd miss a whole lot of wonderful advice. This book is both suitable to the newly married, the veterans, and probably even those thinking about it.

This book is an update to one of his earlier books, "Toward a Growing Marriage." If you've read the former, this book might not provide you with anything really new so you may want to choose another. However, if you haven't read the former, this book is definitely a more accessible version for the average reader so buy this one
