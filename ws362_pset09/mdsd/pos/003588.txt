If you're a coach or a leader of any kind, do yourself a favor and make time to read about Red Auerbach, a managerial genius.

I have not (yet) read other books on Auerbach (but I will!), so I cannot say whether this is the best book, but it certainly contains many wonderful stories.

I enjoy John Feinstein's straightforward and unpretentious writing style. I also like that he quotes people directly rather than paraphrases them.

The only reason I give this book four stars instead of five is that I found the framing story (about all the weekly "China Doll" restaurant lunch attendees) less interesting than Auerbach's stories themselves. Regardless, this book is definitely worth reading. It's fun to read and full of wisdom.
