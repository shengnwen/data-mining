The Shaum's series are great for any student to use as additional study aids and for reference. I used this mostly for reference during some other classes as well. (Comunications thoery, Signal proceesing theory, etc) Don't expect it to teach you the topics from scratch, you must be vaguely familiar with the terminology and what to look for
