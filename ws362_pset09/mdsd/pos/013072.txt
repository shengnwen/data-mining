If you have the liner note, PBS special, quickstep history of Jazz in your mind, you need to read this book.  Bop may have been led by Gillespie, Parker, Monk,Powell, and Roach, but it came to fruition because it reflected ferment, not just in society, but ferment among the musicians that produced it, and change not only in the music, but in their lives. This book documents that change, not just in music but in the life styles, impressions, and experiences of the musicians, some famous, some not so famous, some who went to Bop, some who stayed with swing.

   The whole mid 1940s Jazz scene is one that many, if not most, Jazz lovers are ignorant of beyond the recordings that Bird made. Most people who should read this book will have never heard of Claude Thornhill, or even Woodie Herman. Sadly, there are a lot of folk out there who think they are Jazz lovers who never heard of the "The Birth of Cool."

     Dig deep into this book because not only will you know about it and add some dates and people to your history list, but you will see what folks used to call THE BIG CHANGE documented in the real lives of real women and men.  Of course, after you read this, you are going to be searching Amazon for the sounds the people here made.

       Number one is to get anything done by McShann in the 1940s.  After that, The Birth of Cool. You need the best of the many compilations of Woodie's Three-Brothers herd.  You will know what that means by then!
