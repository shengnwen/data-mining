This is is not a "how-to" book but is a great resource for "why" to homeschool your child with special needs.  We are just entering the realm of considering it for ourselves and this was a great way to begin our search.  

As a speech-langauge pathologist there were a few moments when I bristled over quotes from parents - no, it may not be "rocket science" as one parent was quoted as saying (p 203), but we do hold a master's degree and our expertise covers a much wider range than fixing an "r" or "s" (which are not always straightforward things to correct).  Certainly parents can do a lot to help the process at home but a qualified clinician can set up a properly designed home program to facilitate the learning of a new skill (in any therapy realm). At the very least get an initial assessment or consultation to get a good picture of the problem you are addressing.  And, I don't know any therapist in my field, or related ones, "whose sole purpose for entering a profession is based on goals toward abundant wealth" (p. 215), never mind one who has actually become abundantly wealthy!  It is my experience that my colleagues are genuinely interested in helping their clients succeed & it is sad to read accounts from parents who have experienced anything less than that.

Aside from a few of these moments in the book it does offer a very supportive look at homeschooling a child with special needs and is one I would recommend to parents considering the idea.
