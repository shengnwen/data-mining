I have taught drawing classes at our public libraries in my city. Some of the topics were Star Wars related. Although this book has a wealth of information and the artists are really first rate it is my experience that pre-teens and young teens may have a tough go of some of the practices and trying to imitate the artists of the book. It is somewhat of a drawing crash course and I have found trying to tell students "practice and most of all have fun" does not really communicate the time it takes to make a polished drawing as shown in the book. I am not saying it is bad but it is also not a step by step book exactly. Case in point: Jabba The Hutt. The book shows a build up from basic, to middle, to detailed stage. I have found students will have a lot of problems with the middle phase because they look so great in the book. The break down into smaller steps is needed. Since the publisher is aiming this at kids I think parents and teachers should be aware that yes it will teach them to draw Star Wars but it may be more work involved than a standard drawing-for-kids book would be like. I recommend the book but be prepared it is not exactly easy. I also would warn parents and teachers that the spiral bound pages are easy to get snagged and tare. A little extra care is needed in turning the pages but this also allows the book to stand up with the hardback binding and it also allows the pages to lie completely flat. Well worth the asking price for any Star Wars fan young or old.
