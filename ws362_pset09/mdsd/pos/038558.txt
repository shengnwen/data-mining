Baldacci does a great job when he concentrates on writing mystery/suspense novels and The Collectors is no exception. David nails this one with a cast of characters that are not the run of the mill "perfect spies" that so many authors fall back on. Instead we get an unlikely team of 4 older men and a new delectable con artist who will outwit the bad guys in ways you can't imagine.

I liked watching the pieces coming together as I read this book, wondering how Baldacci was going to weave it into a seamless story and he did. His characters have history, depth, soul, intellect, and spirit without being cloyingly perfect.

The ending sets us up for the next novel to take right off with his new character, Annabelle, and perhaps the conclusion of her con. The storyline is fresh and interesting and seems very reasonable.

Bravo David. Can't wait for the next novel. This was worth the wait
