As a beginning rune caster (coming from a good understanding of tarot), I find this book very helpful and very clear to understand (as opposed to a guide that came with purchased runes, which were too vague and hard to interpret.)
Not only does it help to make solid associations with each rune, it also explains how to make your own runes and talismans and includes lots of other useful information, including suggested reading. 
I'd imagine this is also a great book for someone who is experienced with runes
