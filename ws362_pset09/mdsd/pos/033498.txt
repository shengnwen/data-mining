My children,ages 14, 10, and 8 really enjoyed this book. The main character,Myles, gets into all kinds of mischief. He makes the book fun. We used this book at the end of a homeschool Middle Ages unit study. I wish we would have used it in the beginning. This book, in my opinion, is the best by Howard Pyle
