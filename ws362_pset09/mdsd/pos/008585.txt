I first came to know the work of Legorreta on a visit to San Antonio &amp; it's new library.  The loud colors and monumental scale struck me as odd and distracting in a library setting, but it definitely was a building that  made you look twice and want to explore it more.  Soon after, I moved to  DFW and lived a stones throw away from Solona (the IBM complex).  Here is  where I learned the true beauty and intelligence of Legorreta's designs and  his special notice of the individual and their experience.  The colors no  longer struck me as loud, but as vibrant and cheerful.  This book embraces  and shows off this enthusiasm and intelligence VERY WELL. This is a very  attractive book with lots of pictures that do justice to Legorreta's  palette of colors.   There is some narative for each project giving the  basic information along with the main design considerations.  Also along  with each project is a partial floorplan.  This is most useful in the study  of what is happening in the pictures.  When you find an element or view in  a picture that intrigues you, the floorplan let's you better understand how  that effect was achieve and how it interacts within the context of its  adjoining spaces.  This is especially important in understanding  Legorreta's use of entry sequences and volumes.  This also allows you to  study how he uses water, stones, and  other features in ways that can be  experienced from multiple vantage points to create multiple perspectives.   If you have experienced Legorreta's Architecture in person and want to  understand more about the places you've been, or if you want to see new  places that you WILL WANT to experience, then I whole heartedly recommend  this book.  Buy it, and Enjoy it
