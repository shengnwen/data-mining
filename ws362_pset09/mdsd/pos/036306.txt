This is the absolute best guide to Colorado Trails I have ever seen.  The explanation of each trail is very good and the directions precise.  The book gives you the areas on the trail that will be more difficult, places to see and things to do along each trail, and practical advice from someone who has actually been on each trail.  The book is divided into geographical sections so you can really plan your trip around whatever area you are visiting.  Whether you are wanting easy going family trails in your stock SUV or hardcore driving in a fully outfitted rig, this book should be your companion
