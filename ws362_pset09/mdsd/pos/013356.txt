This book is very helpful because it cuts the useless trivia and gets right down to the point. The math section is simplified and makes it easier and faster to answer questions in physics and chemistry once you've learned the techniques. The verbal reasoning section even though very small comparing to other VR books is very powerful. I think it is a perfect book to start with, but you will need to buy more verbal reasoning books to practice
