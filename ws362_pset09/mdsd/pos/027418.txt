This book is a good reminder that we need to get back to the basics of life and begin to trust ourselves again.  With the over whelming information we get from the media: TV, Newspapers, cell phones, work, etc. We need more than ever to sit down and listen to our inner voice that never gets a chance give us the most important information we need....the God within!  Love this little book
