As an editor of an online publication, I find myself picking up Wired Style again and again. It has great definitions for terms that frequently come up. Want to know what open source is? Or asynchronous transfer mode?  There's also cute stuff in there, like who coined the word nerd (Dr.  Seuss). I'm not sure I would pick this book up just to read, but if you're  in a position where you need to look up terms quickly, this is the best out  there in the high-tech arena
