I read this book to get some new and different ideas for upgrading the  Drama Dept in the HS where I teach, and it did not disappoint. While  obviously not every suggestion will work in every school situation, the  author's years of experience naturally lend themselves to some excellent  advice. Of particular help to me where the chapters on how to run  auditions, and how to select a play to perform. I highly recommend this  book to all teachers and staff in the school setting who are responsible  for theatrical productions
