Thank you for asking me to review this great book.  First of all this book should be read by both women and men.  I believe that the lies which are mentioned, not only pretain to women but to men, also.  Second this book brings to light the lies we have gotten caught up in without even knowing what was going on. We used this book as a study in our Ladies Bible Study and you would be surprise how it has changed our outlook on life and helped us to be more aware of what is really going on around us. We should always put to the test, no matter the issue, does it line up with Scripture? What does God's Word say to this issue? When we keep our focus on God's Word, the Truth will set us free from the lies and God's forgiveness will give us peace and joy.
I highly recommend this book.
