I found this book to be a clear exposition of the main tenets of libertarian socialism. The theory outlined is particularly strong in its critical elements, which comprise the first and second parts of the book. The firsts and second parts of the book deal with Berkman's critique of industrial capitalism, and provide a framework for understanding the motives behind political discourse in such a system. The framework is familiar, for those who have read Marx or Bakunin. 

The book is somewhat weaker in its attempt at outlining a thorough-going positive theory of society organized under workers' councils, absent a legal framework for dispute resolution and protection of rights. Instead of a positive theory of law, Berkman interposes a, frankly, underdeveloped and, at times, naive theory that sees all disputes in a modern industrial society as the product of the distortions of human nature that naturally result in capitalist systems. 

Berkman seems to believe that no similar disputes would exist in a society that is more humanely and rationally organized. However, he fails to outline what new problems might arise in an council-socialist system, and how those problems might be handled in this radically different type of society. Although such a theory may exist, Berkman fails to provide it. He also fails to provide convincing reasons why those rights we intuitively understand as "basic human rights," would be upheld in the face of, and in opposition to, the interest of the workers' councils. I was left with reservations, also, regarding the efficiency of the type of council socialism that Berkman supports. 

This is, however, an excellent introduction to libertarian socialism. The questions it raises are ones that we would all do well to wrangle with, whether or not we subscribe to the underlying theory. What is more, any purely capitalist theory, it seems to me, must acknowledge, and ultimately answer, Berkman's timeles criticique.
