In 1971 in England I was lucky to take over ownership of one of the last pre-unit BSAs (my brother's 1961 Superocket - much the equivalent to the Bonnie of its day but with only one carb - easier to keep in tune). Shame the unit BSAs (A50 & A65) were never so good 

I then went 'japanese'(not that there was anything wrong with that), though am now lucky to own a BMW (my dream bike - I got left some $$$).

I did own a (used) Bonnie - around 1977, I think - but it was unfortunately one of the least revered types - the oil in the frame (below the seat) models. Still, at least I was able to work on the engine (I bought it with a loused up engine), unlike modern machines.

I collect books on BMWs, though I have some books on other makes. I found this book to be excellent & on par with many of the best BMW books - great pictures & as far as I know an accurate history. It certainly is easy to read.

My only fault with it is maybe the price - maybe a bit steep for a relatively slim volume - though I'm very happy/fortunate to have snagged an almost as new one via Amazon for only $6 + $3.49 shipping - a great deal!

I would love to own a(nother) Bonnie - this time one of the classic models. It would be light enough for my wife to ride (why did bikes get heavier despite the use of modern materials?) and a joy to throw around curves (no, not scraping the footrests - I'm too old to risk breaking a leg after almost 40 years riding with no broken bones!) It would however have to be in a restored state so I guess, not being able to afford it, that will never happen. 

Ah well, maybe one day someone will give me the $$$ to go & buy either a new one (which look great in the dealer's showrooms) or a restored old one. In the meantime, this book will more than do
