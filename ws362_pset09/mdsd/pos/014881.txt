In my view this is a good book for someone who remembers home and wants to duplicate some of home in a far away place.  I grew up in New Orleans and now live in Texas.  If you don't know it, we New Orleans people are picky about our food.  I have also spent a lot of time in a lot of places outside the US.  Sometimes you just want to taste some of those simple things you grew up eating.  The hardest thing is finding the &quot;stuff&quot; you want and deciding on a reasonable substitute when you can't find it. So, I really appreciate the list of where to get the &quot;hook-up&quot; in Paris.  There is noting worst than being in Paris or Lisbon for a few weeks and just wanting some red beans, greens and corn bread and not knowing where to go to get the dish or the ingredients.  Now I know it is not just me.  I love the art work and the background material
