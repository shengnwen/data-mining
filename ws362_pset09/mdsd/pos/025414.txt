This book is packed with insights, substantiated by research and observation.  
Klein takes some valid issue with traditional decision-making theorists.  For instance, he notes that the "tests" which demonstrate that the availiability heuristic (a phenomenon which contaminates decisions) uses selective data which thereby skews the results.  It seems that where Klein is going with this exposition, and the whole of the book, is to say that you can't rely on decision-making rigors.
The case studies are fascinating and they provide a compelling argument for the "something else" that takes over in high-stakes, complex decision-making contexts.  Elegant, brilliant decision-makers don't list pros and cons, nor delibertately cite heuristics at play or even run simulation models with likely payoffs.  Rather, they have a store of knowledge -- stories, vignettes and ideas they have seen played out.  That, Klein says, is expertise.  At the end of the day, expertise in what he calls "natural" settings (i.e., not classrooms nor computers) is what is at the heart of brilliant decisions.
However, the utility of this book is not that it replaces traditional decision-making theory, in my humble opinion.  One might conclude that Klein has proven that trusting your gut and going on instinct is the preferred decision-making technique.  Instead, what this book shows -- wonderfully -- is the virtuousity in decision-making that can be attained after years of disciplined decsion-making.  You can't get to virtuosity without practice -- be it in art, music, sports and even decision-making
