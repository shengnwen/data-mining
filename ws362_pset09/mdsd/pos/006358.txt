Fuel Cell Systems is an exellent compilation by sixteen authors who are experts in  their fields.  It covers not only the details of the electrochemistry and thermodynamics of fuel cells but also the economics  and limitations of fuel cell sytems.  It also has excellent chapters on  fuel processing and details on each different type of fuel cell.  There is  a history of fuel cells at the beginning of the book and a section of  marketing at the back so it covers all areas that one could be interested  in.  The editors made one chapter logically lead to the next and included a  good index at the end.  I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to  understand the technical aspects of fuel cells and their applications.   Since fuel cell technology is advancing very quickly and the book was  printed in 1993 it does not include the very latest developments but the  principles it explains are applicable to almost any system
