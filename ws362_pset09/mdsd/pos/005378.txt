I got this book from a used bookstore years ago.  It's a testimony to Boyd  that it's still in print.  I liked the book, but have not tried to make a  knife the way he described.  I'm more interested in forging, which Boyd  does not talk about.  The book concentrates on the method of stock removal,  i.e. how to grind a knife shape out of a blank and then hardening and  tempering.  Still if you are interested in how a knife can be made, this is  a good book to read.  Very entertaining
