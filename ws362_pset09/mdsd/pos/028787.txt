Many reviewers tell of the plethora of new and interesting ideas in this novel, which was ground breaking for 1951. Yes, the ideas are still fresh but, as has been pointed out, there are many holes in the ideas concerning Espers (a new evolution of mindreading humans). Put that aside and you have a great early sci-fi novel that rivals that of Asimov or any other of their contemporaries and a pretty good mystery to boot.

A part of the book that impressed me was that the climax was strung out for such a long duration. For the last one-hundred pages I kept thinking that there could not possibly be more, but Bester surprised me again and again.

I highly recommended this for those looking for their Sci-fi roots.
