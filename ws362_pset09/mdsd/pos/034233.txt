Awesome book!  Everything you wanted to know about Buffets life and how he became such as keen investor.  Also builds up confidence in the reader than research, common sense and patience can get you ahead with stocks.  Not a common view now a days.

My only gripe is it doesn't cover the last 10 years.  Time for an update
