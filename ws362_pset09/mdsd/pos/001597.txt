I found the book to be very enjoyable for not only my children but also myself.  I have found as with all Helen Oxenbury books they are bright and colourful to catch a childs attention. These books will be enjoyed for generations as I was first introduced to Helen Oxenbury books in 1985 when my eldest son was born, and I have passed them down to my younger children and they are having as much pleasure as he did
