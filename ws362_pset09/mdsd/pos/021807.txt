This was great Palm when it was new.  It's clear, complete the author knows the Palm and it's and not oversimplified.  Even now I would recommend this as the place to start for those who are not technophobes.  But the book is over two years old.  There's lots of new software out like Wordsmith which gives you real fonts and the ability to save in .rtf, and peripherals like those folding keyboards
