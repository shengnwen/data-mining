If you are a Star Wars fan you will delight in the first of the Jedi Academy Trilogy dedicated to Luke Skywalker and his attempt to re-establish the Jedi order.

There is a lot of classic Star Wars action and characters with the scattered remains of the Empire thrown in just for fun.

The events in this book, and all three books, take place after Return of the Jedi but before the New Jedi Order series of books.
