Dear Reader,

 I have found this book a tremendous blessing. Since purchasing it, I have used it for personal devotions and preperation for preaching and teaching. 

 Some of the sermons I have prepared using the Theme Study are...

(1) The Do's of Friendship
(2) The Don'ts of Friendship
(3) Exposing Witchcraft
(4) God's View of Profanity 

In Christ,
