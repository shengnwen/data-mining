    I have probably read about two dozen books on the hooli scene and this has to be one of my favorites. Though it is like most hooligan books in that it is a diary of "I went to this ground and had an off with this firm" kind of thing, Cowens manages to capture the feel and the buzz better then most of the others. Also, unlike some Cass books where he claimed 40 ICF ran over 700 of Everton's top lads, this one rings true in every detail. He admits when the BBC got done and who did it, he admits they have had to leg it, and doesn't paint his mob up to be this mythical super firm. He just tells it like it is and makes no apologies. In fact, fellow yob Andy Nichols even backs some of Cowens claims in his own work. 

    I also found it refreshing to read a football hooligan book that doesn't forget the football. Cowens is a true fan and not just some violence loving nutter. He loves the match as much as the row and it shines through. This is a well written recounting of the BBC and their run in's with England's other top firms. He gives credit where credit is do and tells a great story without just attempting to promote his own mob.

    I would put this book in the top five along with; Hoolifan by Martian Knight and Martian King, Congratulations You have Just Met the I.C.F. by Cass Pennant, Scally by Andy Nichols, and Soul Crew by David Jones.
