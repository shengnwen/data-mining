This was the first romance novel I ever read at age 16.  I was babysitting and I found the mother's stash of romance novels and this was the first one I picked up.  I'm the kind of romance reader that LOVES angst, forbidden lovers, circumstances keeping them apart... so on and so forth.  

Since this book I've gone on to read thousands of romances novels, I thought the love scenes were written very well.  

Also the part where Pecos's horse dies... oh my god.  I just cried my little heart out.  I felt like Angie. 

Just a great novel and probably the reason I became such a romance fan.
