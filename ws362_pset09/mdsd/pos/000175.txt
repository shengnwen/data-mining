Why even bother trying to learn about the historical Jesus?  Why try where so many others have given up or gotten bogged down in disagreement?  In his great, academic book, Fr. John Meier recalls Plato:  "The unexamined life is not worth living."  For the Christian, some things are sacred, but nothing about Yeshu the "marginal" Jew is forbidden in a proper historical examination.  And Fr. Meier does just that in this, the first of three volumes.  Was Jesus an illegitimate child?  Could he read?  Did he have brothers and sisters?  Why was he "marginal"?  What was his early life like?

The scarcity of the evidence can at first be discouraging, but Fr. Meier takes us through the centuries of scholarship and the best available modern evidence to paint us a picture of the young son of Mary and Joseph.  Faithless and faithful alike may be unhappy with Meier's conclusions, but his arguments are well-researched and presented.  You can read the text and skip the chapter endnotes for a decent academic presentation, or you can delve into the notes and branch off into the cutting edge discussion on the Jesus of history.

Most interesting to me was the fact that the book bears the Imprimatur of Bp. Sheridan, but does not have the Nihil Obstat, or the approval of the Church's censor office.  Normally the two go together.  Fr. Meier's message may not be popular among modern Christians, Catholic or otherwise, but he's not been censured either.  It's a testimony the the impeccability of his scholarship and the validity of his message:  The historical Jesus is not the Jesus of faith.  He is also not the "real" Jesus, irrecoverable now after 2000 years.  He is simply the Jesus that we can recover from "purely historical sources and arguments.
