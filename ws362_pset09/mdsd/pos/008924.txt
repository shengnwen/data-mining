This is the first E.M. Forester book I've read and it affected me greatly. When I write 'reviews', I don't mean to give a traditional book review, but to note how the book affected my real life.   

This is how:  One of the characters, Cecil, is a bit of a snob and looks down on the common homey interests of his betrothed's family.  He is good with books,art, ideas and 'things', but when he interacts with real people, his personality 'kills' any chance of having an intimate relationship and thus, his life is one of ideas rather than people.

How fiction unwraps itself and reveals itself to be true!  This was looking into a mirror for me.  What my friends won't tell me, a good novel will!  Doing well with "books, ideas and things" is not the epicenter of living, says Forester, but the nitty gritty give and take of affectionate living is where life's eruption takes place.  Art and ideas and books, although glorious, arise from this center, not vice versa. First comes the flesh, then the idea.

Thus this 'old' book, written over 100 years ago, performs the magic of all good literature:  it makes me act and think differently.  I now, attempt to(!), treat the person who stands before me, not as an idea, but as another real, carbon-based life form! 

"A Room With A View" tells the often told story of a young person learning to stand in her own place rather than where society demands she stand, yet Forester's characters are so complete that this old story is like a skeleton that is dressed up in finery and begins to walk!  I fell in love with the characters and recognized myself in all of them; yes, even in the old biddy Charlotte, who, as it turns out, wasn't so old fashioned and possibly was the master puppeteer.
