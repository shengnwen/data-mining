I still have my twenty year old book report on Sheila the Great that I wrote in the fourth grade. Obviously, this was one of my favorite childhood books. It is a book about a ten year old girl who goes to a cottage on a lake with her parents and annoying older sister for a summer vacation.  Sheila is terrfied of the whole experience- meeting new people, the weird dog they have to take care of, participating in a play, and taking swimming lessons. I still get a kick out of it, because when I was Sheila's age, I was a lot like her- fearful of most everything, especially swimming.  The wonderful thing is though, like Sheila, I got over most of my fears, in large part due to my parents' encouragement and determination.  I love all the characters especially  Sheila's new pal "Mouse" who is a yo- yo champion who helps her get over some of her fears.  I think all kids, both male and female, between 8-12 would love this book.  It is one of the few non- trashy/gross Judy Blume books that I would recommend to children. Teachers, do your students a favor by reading them this highly entertaining book
