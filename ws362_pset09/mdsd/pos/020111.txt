This was one of the greatest photography retrospectives and the book pretty much summarizes as well as delves deeply into the issues covered by the show.  If you missed the exhibition, this book is a good substitute.  If you want to know about what you saw in the show, this is an indispensable guide.  Highest quality reproductions, even in the paperback
