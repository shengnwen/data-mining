I was a little reluctant to read this one, mainly because I was so bored by Grisham's "The Client" and because I heard this was a "funny" book. Usually funny means excessively silly and cute.

However, just a few pages into this novel I knew it was different. Maybe becuase I could relate to the Rudy character, having graduated grad school not too long ago and having concerns about what Id be able to do with my degree, it kept me reading non-stop. 

THe writing is personable, like it's really written by a young man just out of law school. The humor in it is just right, not over the top silly, but enough to make me laugh every so often. It's also fascinating material for anyone who has considered going into law ot just like watching law-based shows on TV. 

A few reviewers have pointed out that there are a couple inconsistencies with the story, particularly the ending, though by that time I was more than willing to cut Grisham a little slack and overlook it. THe previous 500 pages of enjoyment I got gave him some leeway in putting together an ending that was, maybe, a little clumsy.

Whenever I read one of Grisham's novels I think that the main characters, in some way, reflect on his own experiences and opinions from when he was an attorney. All I can say is that I am very glad that the legal profession turned out not to be his true love and that he decided to become an author. I highly recommend this book
