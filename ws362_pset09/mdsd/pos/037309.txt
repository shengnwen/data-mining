A delightful little book waiting to be enjoyed by fans of the Bronte sisters' after they have read their more famous books. Not as sweeping a story as Tenant of Wildfell Hall but deserving in it's own right. Anne is a new discovery of mine and I like her just as well as Charlotte and Emily! Her style of writing draws you in. At the end of Agnes Grey, she writes that she could go on further but will end the story here. I found myself wishing she would go on further.
