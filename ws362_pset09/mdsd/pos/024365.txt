I grabbed a copy of KILL ZONE after Malcolm Gladwell described it as "fascinating" and "extraordinary" in his new book BLINK.  KILL ZONE does not disappoint.  In fact, it is a wonderful read, taking the reader inside the hearts and minds of our nation's police officers in a way I've never seen before.  KILL ZONE presents the stories of dozens of cops who have shot suspects in the line of duty and lived to tell about it.  In five lucid chapters, it covers 1) why men and women become cops, 2) the training young officers receive about making the ultimate decision that Gladwell focused on in the last chapter of BLINK, 3) how cops manage to avoid pulling the trigger when they have justification to do so (some incredibly scary stuff), 4) gunfights (the stories of officers' perceptions during shootings, as Gladwell touched on in BLINK, are quite amazing), and 5) how officers live with the knowledge that they have shot someone.  I was particularly taken by the story of a young female officer who killed a carjacker after he shot her through the heart, staved off death by the sheer force of her will, and then went back to work to keep protecting her community.  In all, KILL ZONE offers a compelling portrait of how America's cops deal with the awesome power they have over life and death.  Like I said in my review of BLINK, anyone who wants to learn more about decision making under extreme pressure and the intriguing topic of police shootings should do what I did and read Klinger's KILL ZON
