I recently began looking at the Old Testament with greater vigour. 

My focus has historically been on the New Testament, as I venture is the case for most Bible reading and studying Christians. Sure, I reference the O.T. when reading the N.T., and spend time in the Psalms and other well-known passages like Isaiah 52 and 53, Daniel, Job, (particularly the first few and final few chapters), Genesis and Exodus, etc. And I read through the O.T. regularly. However studying the O.T. is another thing. 

I just wanted to advise you laymen out there who have a similar desire to dig in to the other two-thirds of God's Word that this book was a significant help to me. It 'broad-brushed' the issues in such a way as to make it a most enlightening read
