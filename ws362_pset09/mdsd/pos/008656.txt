I LOVE this book!  It has terrific drawings wit great colors for one thing but even more important is the great writing, which is easy to get into, and incredibly informative.  The level of detail is at the family level - e.g. &quot;woodpeckers&quot; or &quot;flycatchers&quot; But within the section, individual species are discussed.  The level of detail is perfect and subfamilies are addressed.  Foraging habits (with drawings in some cases) are discussed, habitat that the birds live in, variations in colors, breeding, vocalizations, the whole nine yards!  Its fantastic.  I started this review by mentioning the drawings because they really are the icing on the cake - an example is the face of a flycatcher drawn to show the bristles around its mouth.  Terrific!  I like the Stokes books on bird behavior too but this is one big complete reference
