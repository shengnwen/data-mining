This is a good read, although it seems to drag a bit of information a long way. It became fairly obvious that Johnson was trying to dumb down certain ideas for the layman, so this book is a bit lacking in depth. If I was rating it through this alone, this would get 3 stars.

The aspect I really, really liked about this book was that the author relates many personal experiences - it's his own narrative of self-discovery and we're along for the vicarious ride. Johnson does a good job in transferring a meaty sense of wonder.

Although he doesn't present anything particularly new, this book can be compared to a very good documentary or extremely long magazine article.

Fascinating and speculating, Mind Wide Open brings up several interesting aspects of our brains to think about and consider exploring.
