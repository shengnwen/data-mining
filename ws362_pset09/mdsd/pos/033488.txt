This is a great reference book for UMTS and does a great job of explaining real world examples of protocol flows.  I have all of the other "standard issue" UMTS book both on the RAN and Core, this is the only one that covers all aspects.

The main author Ralf Kreher is very knowledgeable; I have attended a number of his training sessions.  His views on KPI's have helped to guide our strategy on UTRAN and Core analysis.

I highly recommend this book...
