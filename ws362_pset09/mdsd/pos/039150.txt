This book does a great job at exploring the various options for starting a legal business entity.  The writing is straightfoward and interesting, and the organization of the book is spot on.  The book serves as the perfect primer for business law, and will help readers identify what legal structure is best suited for their needs.  Once this is done, I'd recommend finding a book (or lawyer) that focuses on that entity
