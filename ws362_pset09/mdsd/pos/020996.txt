I couldn't disagree more with the comment below that this was written by "some over-educated women with too much time on their hands." Actually, I know one of the authors (I used to babysit her three wonderful adopted daughters).  I found the book consistent with my experience of her:  as a dedicated, sensitive, gentle mother who cares deeply about her children and wants to help adoptive parents learn both from the research about adoption and our personal experiences as adoptive parents.  This book is a gem!
