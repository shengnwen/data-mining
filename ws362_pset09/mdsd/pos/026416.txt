This is a wonderful biography of Clare.  Bate not only paints a convincing picture of this largely self-taught genius, but he also provides illuminating information about the social context in which Clare moved.  His speculations concerning Clare's mental illness are also on the mark.  Take your time with this book.  It's an enjoyable ramble through the fields and by the end you'll have a well-rounded picture of John Clare and a greater appreciation for his work.
