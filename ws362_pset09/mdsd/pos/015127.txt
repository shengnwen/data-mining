Shusaku Endo is a great writer. The way he recreates with painstaking details both physical surroundings and state of mind of main characters leaves you feeling like you experienced it yourself. At the same time the main focus of this novel is religion, particularly christianity. The other stuff, such as description of travel by japanese envoys to Europe that took place in seventeenth century, although extremelly vivid and interesting, serves mostly as a background to more deeply embedded line of deliberation on the meaning of christianity. The book also helps to better understand the modern Japanese society through the prysm of the first experience between japanese and european societies. I gave it only four stars because I found the novel to be sometimes too slow, even repetitive, But it could me just my perception.
