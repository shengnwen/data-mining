I was so impressed with Peter's first book: Well-Fed Writer, that I wasted no time grabbing up this one. And I was not disappointed. 

Bowerman gives true life gems, suggestions to make your freelance business take off, and writes in such a way, you're laughing your way through page after page.

He is a gifted writer, mentor and freelance master. This book is a MUST HAVE for anyone contemplating going into freelance copywriting. If you're already freelancing and haven't been able to quit your day job, this book is just the tool you need. 

His advice really does work!
