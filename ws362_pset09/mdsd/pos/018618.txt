Like most people, I associate John Lithgow with interesting, off-beat acting rolls: the eccentric engineer Walter Curnow in 2010, the bemused and crazed father in Harry and the Hendersons, Professor Solomon in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and the voice of Prince Charming in Shrek.  In examining his vita on-line, I find that he has had a long and varied career.  With his first book, The Remarkable Farkle McBride, Mr. Lithgow can happily add "children's author" to that vita.  

The Remarkable Farkle McBride is a delightful short story about a musically gifted child.  The style has the rhythmically catchy poetry of a Dr. Suess, but unlike the latter is grounded more in the reality of a child's world.  It reads quickly and would be a good before bed story for very young children-although I suspect you'll have to read it more than once each time to please your audience!-and a good first reading book for pre-schoolers, although it may require some explanation, since some of the vocabulary may be a bit advanced.  

The art by C. F. Payne is wonderfully whimsical.  The exaggerated facial expressions on Farkle's face are delightful, and so typical of children; it's like having a photograph of kids at their funniest and most dear.  So endearing are the sketches that I plan on keeping the book in my own collection-something I don't often do-and donating another to the hospital where I work.

A great first book, Mr. Lithgow
