This was a really great and lengthy book to read.  I really loved what you were writing in this book.  It clears up alot of things that I needed to know about what society was like before the 1980s and America's Post Industrialism.  As a child of the 1980s growing up with He-Man, TransFormers, Star Wars, and Nintendo I was always curious about how society was like before Reagan.  I am always brainwashed by marketing of the time like Michael Jackson.  Basically there was no mass production of PCs, most Americans payed a 90% tax rate and industrialism was the norm.  There is an eerie reminder of society with Bush and LBJ.  But anyways, Vietnam was over and Post World War 2 Keynseian Management was considered dead.  There needed to be fresher leadership and Reagan was it.  Great writing yet again.
