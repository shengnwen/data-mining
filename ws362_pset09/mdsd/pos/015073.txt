Do you like Harry Potter? Then the series of Charlie Bone are for you! 

Jenny Nimmo is one of my favorite authors so far in my life.
Charlie Bone and the Time Twister is the sequel to Midnight For Charlie Bone. This serie is labeled as adventure and mystery. I saw the first book as an advertisement in 6th grade, the guy said if you like the Harry Potter series then you'd like Midnight For Charlie Bone. Charlie Bone and the Time Twister is the book that shares the joy and danger of adventures from kids 12+. Charlie is a 14 year old boy who has a unique talent of hearing and seeing the people move in pictures and paintings. His grandmother discovered that he started having this power so she sent Charlie to a school called Bloor's Academy where other kids have special talents as well. There he meets new friends, weird teachers, and enemies. A boy who comes out of nowhere appears in the academy and he becomes friends with Charlie. His name is Henry, Charlie figured out that Henry is his great-great uncle from about 80 years ago. Henry should be over 100 years old by now but he came to this time because of the Time Twister so he looks like a regular 14 year old. I would be amazed if I get to see an ancestor of mine 80 years ago! I would ask so many questions about how life was when there was no techology and things that we have now in 2006. So Charlie's evil principal, Ekziel, who is Henry's cousin wants to capture and torture him because Henry was always better than him at everything. The adventure goes on but you have to read the book to find out if Henry will be safe from harm. I would recommend this book to everybody. I give this book 4 out of 5
