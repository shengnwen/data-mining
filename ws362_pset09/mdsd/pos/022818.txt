This is a book about love and hate.  It's about laughing out loud and crying out loud.  This is a novel which explores the passions of the human soul.  

The setting is a small Cretan village and the two main characters are polar opposites.  One is serious, contemplative, intellectual, and ascetic.  The other is funny, cumpulsive, wild, and pleasure-seeking.  But they become the best of friends.  

This is a wonderful novel which will leave you laughing and sometimes crying, but most importantly, it's a novel which will challange you to explore your own soul.  If I had to recomend just one book, this would be it
