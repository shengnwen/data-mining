This book is my second fav Steel book.  Beginning near the depression era and progressing throughout WWII it talks of life of an American woman living in France.  It's the typical Steel story, where it goes through an entire life of the main character until her death.  I love Thurston House, but this one is a close match to being #1.  If you like the WWII era and add a bit of romance and overcoming tragedy throughout a lifetime, then you'll love this one
