Scientests may find Wolke's explanations too simple (that's why he has a nitpicker's section), but for those who are not trained in technical or scientific fields, this books is just the thing. Wolke does an excellent job of explaining science conceptually, and he might just raise the curiousity of a few non-scientists that they may want to read more widely. I would highly recommend his two books on kitchen science
