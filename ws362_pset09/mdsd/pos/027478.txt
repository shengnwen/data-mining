The Interior Graphic Standards is an excellent resource for Interior Designers and Architects.  We've already bought a second copy for our office because it is in demand among our designers.  The graphics are clear and illustrative, and the content covers each topic very completely.  We have people who are just starting out in the profession who use it as a guide on &quot;the basics&quot; before drawing a detail, as well as seasoned professionals who refer to it to keep up to date on current technology and standards.  I recommend it
