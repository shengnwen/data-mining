	Jacqueline Winspear's latest Maisie Dobbs book is extraordinary in several ways. First, her writing pleases and captures the heart of the reader. Secondly, as Maisie grows with each book, the reader is allowed insight into the very soul and essence of the main character, and I suspect, the author.

	 Winspears's book could not be more timely. The vehicle she uses is the world of art and the murder of an inspired artist. But, the message is about the horrors of war. While many want to romanticize the war because they are the "observers back home, the truth is the antithesis, the sheer horror of the `boots on the ground experience'. The artist depicts the reality in his art much to the chagrin of many.

	Maisie morphs during the process of investigating the case by realizing the whimsy of the rich and the plight of the poor. There are many philosophical musings uttered by the main character that tend to influence the reader to commence thinking in loftier tones. What is the greater good for society, for those less fortunate through no fault of their own and more importantly, what can be done to solve the inequities? Maisie does find answers, in most unique places. More importantly, if you have read all the Maisie Dobbs books, you will become a part of the seasoning and development of Maisie. 

	There is more than one messenger in "Messenger of Truth". Do not miss this one - and if you have not read the three books that came before this, you will want to do so. Growing with Maisie is the richness of reading Jacqueline Winspear.
