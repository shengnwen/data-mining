That this book is a classic should come as a surprise to no one, so my reveiw is strictly based on the audio version. I first read this novel years ago but recently listened to the tapes on a long car ride with my children. The reader did an excellent job and the story kept us all interested. I recommend this as a great way for a family to share a classic.
