Wow, having not read a single Hemingway novel (I put him in the old and boring category), I read this one and was blown away. Nothing super-spectacular, just well-written characters that make you read on and on without caring about laundry or dinner or cleaning the house. I read for hours and didn't want to stop other than to sleep and then start again. Witty writing that made me laugh out loud, great detailed descriptions of foreign countries, and unbelievable emotion evoked from a few characters that you've met in some form during your life. I see why he is one of the best. And at a shade over 100 pages, you can knock it out with a few glasses of wine
