This is a perfect book for those of us who have forgotten many of the specifics concerning the way in which America obtained its freedom.  Wood offers a concise summary of the main revolutionary events and also discusses the factors which proceeded rebellion.  This is not a book for historians but is an excellent introduction to the era.  Oftentimes we forget about the neoclassicism of the age and the way in which Rome and Greece influenced the political outlooks of the men who forged our republic. Wood's examination of equality and the philosophical influences that embody our state are quite enlightening.  I wish that this text were used in the schools as it would undeniably foster a high level of appreciation for just how unique the American form of government actually is
