This anthology, superbly edited and introduced by Michael Cox and R.A. Gilbert, is a great way to begin your library of supernatural fiction.  Even the connoisseur will find some rare gems. From the first of the chronologically arranged stories, &quot;The Tapestry Room&quot; by Sir Walter Scott, you'll be intrigued by the incredible variety.  Whether you enjoy the swooning Romanticism of Vernon Lee's &quot;A Wicked Voice,&quot; the dry restraint of M.R. James &quot;Oh, Whistle,&quot; or the naturalistic American dialogue of Mary Wilkins-Freeman's &quot;The Lost Ghost,&quot; you'll find stories that will linger in your mind. Almost every story is of high literary quality as well as great entertainment.  The anthology also shows how differently good writers can handle the stringent requirements of good supernatural tales.  These tales are on the surface escapist fiction, but on closer study prove to address themes of life after death, guilt, fear, love, the effect of inner states on outward perception, and the struggles of the individual within society. Not every story will appeal to every reader, because there's such a wide range of styles.  But I think every reader will find many to savor time and again
