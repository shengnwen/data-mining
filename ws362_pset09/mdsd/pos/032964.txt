I'm not very good at science. The things the instructor and textbook throw at us usually just make me feel foggy. This book cleared away the fog. The writing style is minimal and casual. It just gives you the very basics, at a very basic level. It fills in the gaps that the instructor passes over. I think the thought that I had most often while reading was, "So THAT's how it's done! Why didn't anyone say so?"

The chapter sections are short enough that you don't feel overwhelmed, and every chapter has problems that let you practice the very simple skills that the textbook glosses over. Without these skills, you'll pretty much be lost! It's as though everyone else is composing symphonies, but you don't know anything about music. This book teaches you about notes and rhythm and how you can put them together so that you can create music, too.
