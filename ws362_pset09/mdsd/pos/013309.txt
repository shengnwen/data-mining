I found this book to be very interesting and informative. Without a doubt it gave me a look into the life and times of Willie Brown and the state of California.  From growing up under the repressive laws of Jim Crow and segregation to becoming one of the most powerful men in California,Willie Brown is a courageous and complex figure in California's history.  In the tradition of &quot;showmen politicians&quot; like Adam Clayton Powell, Huey P. Long, and Lyndon Johnson, Brown is a part of a by-gone era.  With term limits well in place, we will never see the likes of such a powerful and personable politician. President Clinton could not have said it better when he arrived in Sacramento and met Willie Brown in person for the first time. He stated, &quot; now i have finally met the real slick Willie&quot;.  Whether demon or devil, Willie Brown changed the face of legistlative politics in Califonia and paved the way for the state to expand in many other areas. After reading this book, you wonder how California can survive without Willie Brown
