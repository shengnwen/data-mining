I am a high school English teacher and purchase this book in August.  Somehow, it ended up in my classroom library and my students love it!  In fact, I haven't been able to read it because it's been loved by so many others instead.  The first student who read the book had remarked just prior to opening it, "I hate reading.  It's so boring!"  Within a couple of days, she had changed her mind and now can hardly wait for silent reading time each day!  

(This book has been rated 4 stars only because I haven't read it personally and can not really attest to it's quality, although the students give it two thumbs up!
