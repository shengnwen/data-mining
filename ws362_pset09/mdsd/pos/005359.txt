As a middle school counselor, I have used the activities in this book with kids of various ages and ability levels.  While some of the activities do take some prep time, there are also many that you can use with what you have on hand, which is great for the busy school counselor.  The activities are a lot of fun and teach great skills such as teamwork and decision-making.  Well worth the money
