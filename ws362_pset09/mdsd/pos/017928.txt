A very scholarly and thorough account of  the evolution of  scriptures of the Abrahamic lineage. I don't know of any other work that gives the perspective as clearly as this from the view point of each of the monotheistic faiths and yet maintains the banner of "rationality and reason come before and  above doctrine." 

Sure to become a standard work  on comparative religion. Should be essential reading for people from all monotheistic faiths and for all historical and theological students with interest in scriptural history and evolution  including  teachers.

Highly recommended.
