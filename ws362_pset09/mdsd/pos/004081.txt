I have now read all of Sedaris' books (just finished dress your family in Corduroy and Denim), and I have loved them all.  They are great coming of age type of stories for any orientation and very funny.  not just gay literature -- just funny literature.  Not quite as funny as "Running with Scissors," but probably more poignant and identifiable to more of us.  Running with Scissors is hilarious, but seems out of this world. Sedaris as 99% as funny, but much more identifiable to us and seems much more like a family member of ours gone awry in a funny, funny way.  Plus, we all know that if our siblings were to rant about us, we'd be characters in a book like Sedaris' too!  I highly recommend this.  Quick read, and very, very good
