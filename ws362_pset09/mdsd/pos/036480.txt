Scott R. Garrigus' soundcard setup is a delta 66 and SBLive card.   its the exact setup that i have.    Scott wrote the book in plain english so that even a not so computer literate person can understand whats going on.    even if you've never used a computer music recording program before, Scott makes it simple...
