This is a book that enables the reader to discover an unfairly overlooked artist. No one better than Schad succeeded in depicting the underworld of high and low society in Germany's Weimar Republic of the 1920's. His portraits are masterpieces of psychological insight. This is German New Objectivity at its best. If you missed the exhibition, don't miss the book
