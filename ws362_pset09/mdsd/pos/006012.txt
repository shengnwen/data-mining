This is no "Far Side" or "Alien Encounters" view of Heaven and the afterlife.  If you've grown up with the view most Americans have of Heaven, this book, drawing from hundreds of Biblical scriptures, will radically change how you view Heaven!  You'll find yourself getting hopeful and excited... for the first time, realizing that this time on Earth is just the introduction to a long and exciting adventure that awaits believers in Heaven.  

I used this book to lead a women's Bible study, and women young and old found themselves first saying, "wow- this seems way out in left field... I've never thought of Heaven like this!"  Then they began realizing that Alcorn's book is scriptural--not just a couple of verses out of context--but truly a cover-to-cover in-depth look at what God Himself wrote in His Word about the place of Heaven.  As we continued reading through the book, the excitement and delight built.  

This book radically changed my perspective on Heaven and ranks as one of the top 5 books I've ever read.  I HIGHLY recommend this book.  It will motivate you to live your life in such a way that God will be pleased with you at the end of it.  And it will motivate you to look Heavenward with delight.  GET THIS BOOK!
