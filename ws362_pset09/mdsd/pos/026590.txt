I actually came to Amazon looking for another book on Jack the Ripper.  The reviews were really critical, and recommended The Complete History of Jack the Ripper by Sugden as being a much better book, so I bought it instead. 

I think this book is very well done.  Sugden gives a complete history of the case, and the facts, as they were known to the police back then.  He describes each case in detail, along with any eyewitness accounts and leads that were pursued.  While he does go into all the big theories everybody had at the time, he doesn't presume to "know" anymore than the police did then.  

I also liked his treatment of the victims.  He looks into their histories, telling where they were born, what their family and life was like, and how the came to be in Whitechapel.   I think this does a better job of humanizing them than just listing their names, what they did their last night, and the condition of their bodies.  

And on the occasions where he mentions what is wrong with another author's conclusions, he does so in a respectful manner.  He states what is wrong with the other's theory according to the facts, without trashing anybody in the process.

While the book did seem to be a little bit of a slow read in a couple places, all in all I think this is one of the best Jack the Ripper books out there
