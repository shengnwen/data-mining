Going over complete games covering all parts of chess has been my most useful and favorite way of improving my ability to play chess. The planning ahead part of chess using "general rules" which is covered throughout Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors teaches you what is important to know. You also learn when and why there are exceptions to the general rules, making this book much different than the other books I have seen that tell you about every move in the games.
I have also improved my openings. The games are arranged by type of opening and there are 24 entire games. The important variations of the openings in the games are told. I counted three very helpful endgames. The Bishop of opposite color with doubled pawns endgame was the best.
I also learned a bunch of stuff about sacrificing on weak squares and how to attack against the castled and the uncastled king. One of my favorite lessons was the first one where the king was chased around the board. It was helpful because it teaches about how to attack and how to defend all in one game.
I will be getting the second book after this one called More Unbeatable Chess for Juniors for christmas
