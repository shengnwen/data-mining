This is overall a good compilation of patterns.  However, all the patterns are for back and forth knitting.  It would be nice if in the round instructions were also included.  Also, some patterns start with Row 1 on the right side, and some with Row 1 on the wrong side, which makes it hard to try to put them together.  Sometimes it is easy to figure out how to change these patterns to make them work as in the cases above, but not on the more complicated ones.
