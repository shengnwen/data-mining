What sort of person do you really hate to engage in conversation?  For me, it's somebody who doesn't know when to stop speaking.
Frank declares that the basic attention span is about 30 seconds, and that if you don't make your point in that amount of time, you've lost your chance to be heard.
He then goes on to tell you how to deliver an effective message in 30 seconds.
The book is very well written, and only 120 pages long.  It's well worth reading
