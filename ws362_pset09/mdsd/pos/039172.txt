If you are college bound this book is a great choice for you!  It gives specific guidelines to help you find a career, pursuit, purpose and mate.  Dr. Dobson helps you by giving you tips on decision making, especially tough ones in your future.  If you are struggling with any of these issues you should pick up this book and read it!  Dr. Dobson is a great Christian author who ties Jesus Christ into all of his sections of this book.  This especially is a great book for Christians because they can really relate to what the author is talking about, but it is good for non-Christians or non-religious people as well.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is making important decisions in thier life, particularly ones for thier future
