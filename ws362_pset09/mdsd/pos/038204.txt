My work has provided me with the opportunity to travel a good bit.  I am the type of person who wants to get a working background for my destinations, both in terms of history and geographic layout.  Because I work, I don't have a great deal of time to spend reading and studying different, often lengthy, travel guides before or during my trips.    

Because these guides are concise, beautifully illustrated, relatively compact, and impeccably organized, I cannot recommend highly enough the Dorling Kindersley Eyewitness Travel Guides!  The DK Eyewitness Travel Guide is THE guide I buy for every destination.  Not only do I get a quick history and background of the destination, but I also will be provided with a visual guide to everything.  The visual detail is really what sets the DK Eyewitness Travel Guides apart.

The street maps of common destination points are drawn in dimensional detail so you will visually recognize when you "get there."  This is particularly helpful when you don't speak the native language.

The regional maps are colorful and concise.  However, the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide really shows its stuff with the drawings associated with attractions such as museums.  Their presentation of museum layouts allow the traveler who is short on time to quickly see the best of the museum within the time the traveler has to spend.

Each DK Eyewitness Travel Guide has a good summary section in the back with practical information about where to eat, where to sleep, what to do, and how to get around.  

While I may supplement the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide with others for a more detailed travel guide, the other guide is only more to read, not more to see.  Buy the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide first for any destination.
