This classical story about the search for wealth (diamonds), for a lost brother and a lost kingdom is heavily tainted by the colonial mentality of the British Empire, 'the wisdom of the white people'.

It has a racial undertone: 'Can the sun mate with the moon, or the white with the black?'
It extolls war: 'It was a splendid sight to see brave battalions come on time after time over the barriers of their death'.
It asks full obedience to the powerful: 'Behold your king! fight and fall for him, as is the duty of the brave man.'
It shows the 'pleasures' of merciless shooting of elephants for their tusks.

But on the other hand, it contains general human insights: 'the eyes of mankind are blind to the discredited and he who is defenseless and undone finds few friends and little mercy.'
And what is life? 'It is a feather, it is the seed of the grass, blown hither and tither, sometimes multiplying itself and dying in the act, sometimes carried hence into heavens.'
'Out of the dark we came, into the dark we go. Like a storm-driven bird at night we fly out of the Nowhere, for a moment our wings are seen in the light of the fire, and, lo, we are gone again into the Nowhere. Life is nothing. Life is all. It is the hand with which we hold off death.'

Apart from its biased mentality, this book about the 'journey that a man sets his heart to', remains a classic adventure story of the battle of the brave against evil, hostile environments and adverse fortune.
