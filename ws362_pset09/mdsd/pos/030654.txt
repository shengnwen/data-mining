What a great history book.  Robinson starts off with the English revolt of 1381 and moves into the crusades and inquisition and ties them all together with Masonry.

Robinson even highlights such historical figures as William Wallace, Robert Bruce, King Phillip II, and more.  A fast and easy read, loaded with information, "Born in Blood" does a great job of answering so many questions regarding Freemasonry and crushing the myths
