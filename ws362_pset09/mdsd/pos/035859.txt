Dyer is rather a leftist, and I'm more of a libertarian, but on this subject we see eye to eye.  The politicians, corrections industry, and opinion pollsters have formed an &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; in support of  ever more incarceration.  In particular, large numbers of nonviolent  offenders are being locked up for no good reason at all.  (The resulting  clog tends to make it harder to put away those who really belong behind  bars, too.) The really bad consequences of this (millions of people with  grudges against society, learning a lot about violence) have yet to really  be visited upon our society.  But they probably will be, and it won't be  the politicians and lobbyists who pay the price
