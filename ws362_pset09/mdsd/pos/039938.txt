Good read, enjoyable, but I have to complain on two points:
Sure, Stone Barrington makes a cameo appearance, for no reason at all except that we like him and he's easy on the eye.  BUT - he's there to buy a plane, tail number November 1 2 3 Tango Foxtrot.  Then in the end, when the bad guys are escaping, they escape in a plane with the tail number - you guessed it - November 1 2 3 Tango Foxtrot.  Did they steal Stone's plane?  Was the mysterious John actually Stone Barrington?  NO!  Wow, what a great plot twist was missed here.  Or maybe Mr. Woods just likes that number - maybe he has a plane, too, with the tail number - well, you get the point.
The other big boo-boo was having the bad guy go to Ham's for a drink, and nobody thought to get his fingerprints off the glass.  Well, he could've been wearing gloves, but you'd think someone would notice THAT.
All in all a good read, doesn't require a lot of mental investment on the readers' part, and a fairly good description of Florida's Treasure Coast.
