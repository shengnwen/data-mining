This book is awesome !!! It is my Bible and the only tool I needed to help me understand, find the right help and support for my daughter who was recently diagnosised with Dyslexia. I have recommened it to all my family, friends and colleagues. 
I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for help
or infomation "Everything you need to know" on Dyslexia.
Thank you,
