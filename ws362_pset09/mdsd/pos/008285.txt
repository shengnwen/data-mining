If you like Jon Landau after reading this book, there could be something wrong with you. Not only did he have a hand in producing one of the most egregiously muted rock records of all time (the MC5's Back in the USA), he was a definitive driving force behind the corporate side of music. He's not the only slimey piece of work involved in this book, there are many.
There's no question that Landau made a lot of money for a lot of people (including himself), as did all the 'buisnessmen' in this book, the problem I have is that they cannot be considered music fans. If they are at all, it's a distant second to their love of money. A good book that's worth reading.
