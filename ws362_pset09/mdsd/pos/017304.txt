Not wanting to wait until I've cooked a majority of the 4,500 recipes in the book, I'll focus on the Introduction as symptomatic of the lingering trust issues I have with this book - despite the considerable improvements to the much-maligned '97 edition.

For one thing: While coyly hinting how the title will treat us right from now on, it never openly acknowledges how it screwed us over the last time. I'd have an easier time trusting in Ethan Becker's newfound commitment to "hominess" if he was honest enough to say, "I got seduced by trendiness and forgot what made 'Joy' what it is. I'm sorry for tarnishing Mom's and Grandmom's legacy and apologize to the buyers who were disappointed." He's not.

He also drops a parting comment on how he hopes "Joy" may be a comforting touchstone in what are "troubling times" for the country - or words to that effect. Now don't get me wrong: As I've made abundantly clear in some of my other Amazon reviews, I think the country is far worse off than that. But I didn't ask for his political opinions - however much they may resemble my own - and that kind of self-aggrandizing does not inspire confidence in his respect for the book. Besides, the kitchen is one of the few refuges we have left from the growing horrors out there. The last thing I want is to be reminded of them when baking some blueberry muffins.
