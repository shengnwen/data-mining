My husband is an independent photographer, so the Nolo Press books are great for him, geared as they are to all those wishing to handle all the paperwork for themselves, instead of the usual array of lawyers, accountants, etc.  He keeps it as a reference book and can easily turn to whatever subject he needs more information on.  Well-written and easy to understand, as are all Nolo books, these books are wonderful to review periodically
