When a pair of writers with special skills in the social science of espionage put their heads together, you can hear the resulting &quot;click&quot; in the pages of this very special book. Espionage, after all, is the art of the possible. A knows something and B wants to find out A) what A knows and B) how he knows what it is. It's a simple, elegant geometry, and Shulsky knows it better than LeCarre. I came to this text hoping to find out more about the world of intelligence. I figured, there's got to be more to it than the cartoonish figure than Kiefer Sutherland plays on TV's 24, surrounded by his loyal staff Tony and Michelle.
 
 And there's got to be more going on but if so, how did the USA land in such an awful dilemma as to depend on its intelligence committees which suggested that, for example, there are WMD's in Iraq when as it turns out, if there ever were any, there don't seem to be any now. As Shulsky points out, there's almost no blame-sharing protocol within intelligence agencies. It's as if God made them and then forgot to teach them the words, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; This is the one book in which you can learn why this should be so. Intelligence has changed rapidly in the years since the Cold War ended, and there are some satisfying books you could follow up on for post-graduate work, but SILENT WARFARE is a savvy place to begin
