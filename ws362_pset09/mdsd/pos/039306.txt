I have read The Gunslinger four times now.  Every time that I read it, I tell myself, "It's time to read the entire series."  But for some reason I always quit after this, the first novel in the series.  I'm still not sure why I have never continued on with the other books, but I am currently on another mission to read the entire Dark Tower saga.  After finishing The Gunslinger (again) I think that I finally realized why I haven't gone on to finish the series.  I think that I am afraid to find out the answers to all the questions posed in this amazing novel.  I'm just afraid that I'll be disappointed with the ultimate answers.  The conversation at the end of this novel is totally amazing and completely invigorating on an intellectual level.  So how can Stephen King possibly follow it all up?  I hope that he does in a grand fashion.  Because this time, I intend to find out those answers
