Beautifully drawn, and the message is important.  The ironic tone may be lost on some children - it was certainly lost on some of the reviewers!  Told from the perspective of an anonymous child in her neighborhood, Velvet is 'odd' for choosing quality and beauty over quantity and conformity.  Her classmates ultimately learn by her example.  The narrative style will be confusing to younger readers, but it's a hell of a better read for the parents than 'Sheep in a Jeep'!  Good for a five year old
