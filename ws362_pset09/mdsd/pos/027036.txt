Letters to Karen was a wonderful book.  I an not getting married any time soon, but the more I read about Karen the more she reminded me of me.  She,like myself, have dated a lot of guys and got board very easily.  Her father started writting her letter when she announced her engagment.  Her father gave her a lot of advice on what to do in a marriage and what not to do.  The book also gives good advice on fighting, finding one's true self in their spouce, and loving eachother.  I strongly suggest the women read this book when they start getting more serious wither their boyfriend.  I also suggest guys reading Letter to Philip
