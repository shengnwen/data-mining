As I understand it, this book is not aimed at people with any more than a passing interest in philosophy. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I can't help but compare it to "Best of the Classics" type CDs containing excerpts of classical music which have become `semi-hits' through featuring in TV ads. 

How you feel about this book will then largely depend on how you feel about this popularization of was once believed to be culture intended exclusive for the intelligentia.

I've never had any interest in really studying philosophy, so this was a good introduction to some of philosophy's Greats for me, but the book only skims the surface of each. Anyone with a real interest in a particular philosopher or philosophy in general will certainly need to dig deeper. Having said that, this book could be a good starting point - I have highlighted some passages in my copy as cues for further reading.

As to whether this book can serve as "consolation" or help in dealing with "the problems of everyday life" I'd have to say that my jury's still out.
