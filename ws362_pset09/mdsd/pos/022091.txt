Excellent book for fine children's literature with African-Americans.  

For busy parents, this is an excellent reference book. There are many lists which to choose and select books.

The book has separate categories by age. Wonderful.

Each reference of the book, the author lets you know if the book has received any awards such as the Coretta Scott King, Caldecott, Newbury, Reading Rainbow.  

What a great idea!!  The authors have done all the research for the busy parent who wants to buy fine literature for their kids. 

I want to thank the authors!!
