This atlas is well worth the money.  The book covers all of the LOTR series.  It first goes into the layout of Middle Earth with respects of what type of rock for each areas.  Valinor is covered, as well as Beleriand.  Then, the battles are covered from the Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and the LOTR. Many illustrations are in the book, including the Tower of Cirith Ingol, Ederas, and Minas Tirith. Then the author has painstakingly taken the pathways of the Nine Walkers, from Bag End to Mount Doom. This includes dates, times, miles traveled, campsites on the map, ect. The author then goes into landforms - how the continents in Middle Earth could have been formed, the languages used, and the climates of Middle Earth.
    This book is invaluble for the true Tolkien Fan since Middle Earth is well discribed and the paths travelled by the Nine Walkers is shown out day by day.
     Combine this book with the Maps of Middle Earth, and the Lord of the Rings A Reader's Companion, and your knowledge of Middle Earth will make a wizard jealous
