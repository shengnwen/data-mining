I wasn't expecting much from this book at first. Why would Fodor's review a book? But as I crept in from page to page it made perfect sense. The book evokes every scene and landscape in the Da Vinci code, bringing new layers of both the book and the scenes its set in to life. A totally engaging read. Even if you can't travel to Europe to explore this first-hand, this book will totally reel you in, making you feel like you've been there. It made me want to read the Da Vinci code again
