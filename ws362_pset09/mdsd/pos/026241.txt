The staircase was an excellent book. I was reading this for a children's literature class and I am glad I picked this book.  I love the character of Lizzy.  She goes through so much in this book and you can't help but be on her side when Elinora tries to get her in trouble.  Lizzy does not care how others thing of her she just wants to get out of the all girls' school.  This is an excellent book for children to read.  The plot was very interesting and exciting.  The characters are likeable and true to life, Rinaldi's writing is very descriptive.  This story is about friendship, families, and lessons of life.  This book would be an excellent read aloud.  It introduces friendships and how to learn to be on your own
