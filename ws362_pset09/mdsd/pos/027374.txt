I read a lot of books about MBA admissions.  Your MBA Game Plan was the shortest, simplest ... and by far, the best!

The book taught me about the admissions process - what schools are looking for in students, how I can demonstrate those qualities, and how to avoid the most common pitfalls of applying.  More importantly, it helped me develop a clear, organized, and easy-to-execute gameplan that kept me on track throughout the (grueling!) journey that is MBA admissions.  

Thanks in large part to this game plan, I was accepted at Harvard Business School and Stanford's Graduate School of Business
