I was going to write that my young daughter adores this book, but I have to admit that I love it too! She's read it cover to cover many times over, and now selects her "favorite parts" for me to read aloud at bedtime. Coville has authored a whole slew of books, but this is the one I like best, with the exception of his Shakespeare adaptations. The book is full of enjoyable characters and intriguing plot twists.
