I cook from scratch and cook daily and thought this book was an excellent reference when planning a get together for family or friends. Many of the recipes are colorful, healthy, offer texture and are tasty. These recipes can easily be co-ordinated with any menu and many can be used as an appetizer course. This book took much time to produce with pictures and presentation ideas for every recipe. I save all of my food magazines and am lucky to get 3 -4 usable recipes. [...]  This book has received way too much hype. I thought it was very basic and had very few good recipes that were new or creative.
