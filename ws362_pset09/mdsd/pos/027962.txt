	McGrath is his inimitable self in this book.  He never fails to impress with his intellect, his global knowledge, his ability to explain, and his eloquence.  On the other hand, I was surprised at the amount of repetition in the book.   From time to time I thought I was having d?j? vue. I enjoyed the read for the most part, but some of the material could have been left out and his arguments would have seemed tighter.  He evidently admires Thomas Torrance immensely, since he repeatedly mentioned his name, but I can't recall anything Torrance actually said.  
	His choice of the scientific method as ancilla theologiae is a good one for several reasons.  First of all, as he says, it is the closest thing we have to an objective and culturally inert system of inquiry.  Secondly, it goes far to disarm the religio/scientific conflict by making friends of enemies.  Not that religion and science are enemies at all, but as Hamlet says, "thinking makes it so."  Adopting the methods of the natural sciences also gives him a great advantage when navigating between the currents of modernism and postmodernism.  It gives him a "third way."  
	This introductory version has wetted my appetite for the mother tome(s), but I wonder if his choice for a grid such as the natural sciences may not in the end prove to be as limiting in some ways as it is helpful.  I get the feeling that he wants so much for the marriage of natural science and theology to work that the marriage bed may end up being the proverbial procrustean one
