A fasciniating account of the friendship between two geniuses, who although complete opposites in many ways, shared a passion for the truth in the worlds of mathematics and physics.  The book makes you wish you could have eavesdropped on their conversation during the walks they took together at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton.
