Good Morning gorillas
Good Morning Gorillas is by Mary Pope Osborne. In this magic tree house book, the main Characters are Jack and Annie is in the rain forest. This book is about jack and Annie meeting a little gorilla who leads them to his family and becoming close friends.  What I think the author is saying is you can become friends with animals.  I can't tell my favorite part because it's the end and I don't want to give away the ending.  But even though it was sad I loved it.  I think it would be a good book for people who love animals.
