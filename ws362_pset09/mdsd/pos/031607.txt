In college and throughout my student teaching, I felt strong in my classroom management.  Then I started substitute teaching in urban schools, and I found myself at a loss and not understanding what I was doing wrong.  Then an assistant principal handed me this book.  This book saved me! This book has practical advice and skills you can begin applying the very next day.  The advice makes sense and it works!  I wish I would have read this book in college.  They should teach a college class using these methods! Without classroom management, how can we actually teach?  Read this book.  Of all the books I had to read for college, this has proved the most valuable in the practical "real" world of teaching.
