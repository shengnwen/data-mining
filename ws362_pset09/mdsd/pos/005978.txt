&quot;Having moved across town and across the country on nine (9) occasions from Rochester, NY to all parts of CA, back to Rochester, NY and now to Columbia, MD, I can assure readers that this book offers an island of calm in the &quot;ocean's roar&quot; of the moving experience. Leslie's writing reflects a diverse group of movers who's life experiences pave the way for a more peaceful transition from a loved home to a new house and community. Too often, &quot;movers&quot; are caught up in the process of moving and forget moving is only the first part of uprooting your life and beginning anew. The hardest part is not the move but rather the new beginning. Having a resource that encompasses all parts of your life experience is invaluable. Thanks Leslie
