FRANGIPANI by Celestine Vaite
March 18, 2006


Amazon Rating: 4/5 stars 

I can't say enough about FRANGIPANI, the debut novel by Celestine Vaite.  It's funny, charming, delightful, and is told by narrator Materena Mahi, a Tahitian woman who loves to dispense advice to all her friends, neighbors, and strangers.  The heart of the book is her relationship with her daughter Leilani, who proves to be almost too much for Materena. While she is very proud of her smart daughter, she also cannot understand this new breed of Tahitian woman.  

It's the story of Materena's journey from being a Professional Cleaner to a Tahitian celebrity, but the heart and soul of the book is the relationship between mothers and daughters and about strong women everywhere.  I cannot wait for the next two books in the series to be published in the United States.  FRANGIPANI is highly recommended
