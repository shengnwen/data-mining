. . . it still takes too much time to do my own taxes. Who wants to spend all that time reading Greek? Tax laws just change way too much! Besides, I was an Education major not Business. I found an alternative option online called ProFaxTax after spending a lot ot time doing Google searches. I'll probably still keep buying the book for reference purposes and to ask intelligent questions of the people at ProFaxTax, but I won't be doing my taxes myself anymore.
