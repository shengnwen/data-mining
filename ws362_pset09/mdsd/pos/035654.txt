_____________________________________________
Mia, a 94-yr old woman at the close of the 21st C., tries a new life-
extension treatment.  She emerges in the body of a thrill-seeking 
20-yr-old.  .  .   you say you've seen this story before?  Not as 
related by master extrapolationist, storyteller & all-around fine 
writer Bruce Sterling.

Let's go into the polity, the medical-industrial complex that rules the 
world,  where "the whip-hand of coercive power is held by 
smiling & stout-hearted medical rescue personnel.  And by social 
workers.  And by very nice old people.  .  ."

"There were, of course, some people who disagreed with 
the entire idea of life extension.  Their moral decision was 
respected & they were perfectly free to drop dead."

The story-line is  simple:  a bildungsroman, the wanderjahr of a 
95-yr-old girl thru 21st C. Europe.   

We're at a fashion show in fin-de-siecle Roma.  Mia is getting ready:


..they put the wig on & she left human perfection for a 
higher realm.  It was a very smart wig.  This wig could have leapt from 
her scalp like a supersonic octopus & flung its piercing tendrils right 
thru a plaster wall...  It was a staggeringly pretty wig, a wig in rich, 
solid, deeply convincing, faintly luminescsent auburn, a wig as 
expensive, as cozy & as well-designed as a limousine...  When it 
curled lustrously about her neck & shoulders it behaved the way a 
woman's hair behaved in daydreams...

The models were old women, and they looked the way that modern 
old women looked when they were in truly superb condition ... 
They showed none of the natural signs of human aging, but they were 
just a little crispy, a little taut.  The models were solemn and sloe-eyed 
and dainty and extremely strong...

Their clothes were decorative and columnar and slender hipped and 
without much in the way of a bustline...  The clothes were 
splendidly cut...  Rather ecclesiastical, rather bankerly, rather like the 
court dress of high-powered palace eunuchs from the Manchu 
Forbidden City...


Well.  I could go on, & probably would if I had a scanner, or was a better 
typist....  but you should be picking up the flavor of the book, the 
richness and density of invention.  Sterling at his best reads something 
like a collaboration between Tom Wolfe & John McPhee.  Folks, I've 
been reading this stuff for 40 years. and I'm hear to tell you, it don't get 
much better than this.  

Highly recommended.
