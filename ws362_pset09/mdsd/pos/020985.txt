This was an excellent book. I read Understanding the Purpose and Power of Men first.  I was very pleased that I read that one first.  It put into perspective many of the issues that I knew existed all along in the difference of men and women but both books offered wonderful advise how to remedy the problems that exist in today's society between men and women.  Dr. Munroe is God sent!! He is truly enlightened in the ways of modern day issues between men and women and I am greatful to his messages.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking knowledge in relation to &quot;fixing&quot; the man--woman issue.  Both books should be read by the men and women who love each other.  The books give a better understanding as to God's purpose in our lives and relationship
