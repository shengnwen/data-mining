This true story is well written and fantastically illustrated.  It's about the amazing walk of aerealist Phillipe Petite between the two towers of the World Trade Center.  When he is on the wire, the perspective showing how high he is, is so well drawn that my stomach flips.  This amuses my children to no end. Added to this physical sensation is that it is on a tri-fold page which gives the viewer a real sense of being out there way above lower Manhattan.  We've had this book for three years and enjoy it as much today as we did when we first brought it home.
