&quot;Alphabet Soup&quot; is a beautifully-illustrated, whimsical book that beginning readers will enjoy. Unlike other alphabet books, this book encourages discussion about animals and foods, as well as some pretty funny  situations. My favorite letter in the book is &quot;W&quot; for &quot;Wing  Walking Weenies&quot;, with hot dogs doing death-defying tricks on the  wings of a biplane! It's the best! A highly-recommended book
