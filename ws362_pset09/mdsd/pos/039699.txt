The brilliant young protagonist, who has a rather uncomfortable relationship with laws, considerable financial resources, and access to a fantasy kingdom composed of fairies and others, leads his reader on a merry adventure.  It seems he has constructed a computer-like device based on pilfered technology of the fairies.  His attempt to sell it to an obnoxious and unscrupulous adult business mogul goes seriously badly.  From then on, it's Artemis and his resources working to right the problems that deal-gone-wrong has created.  This is my first taste of Colfer's Artemis, and I enjoyed it enough to look forward to reading some of the others.  The blend of fantasy, contemporary fiction, science fiction and adventure works well.  The reader can overlook Artemis' questionable choices and find an engaging young fellow, one easy to root for.  The secondary characters, the bodyguards and fairy-world folk in particular, are lots of well-made fun.  Young readers will surely enjoy it, and I must wonder if, after the final installment of Harry Potter, his readers will turn to this.
