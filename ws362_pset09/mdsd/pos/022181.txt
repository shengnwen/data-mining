I have just started reading this one, and so far it is very good. This novel has remnants of another fairy tale favorite of mine. The name of that story is called "allfur" or "a coat of many colors". Robin does a remarkable job with breathing life into an old tale. I myself am currently working on a novel based on norwegian folklore, and it is not an easy thing, but robin does it with ease and finesse
