I luv, luv, luv this book.  If you are a Patton fan and you love leadership you get two for the price of one.  Great history as well as great leadership principles.  Down to earth, short, wonderfully written vignettes that capture the essence of General Patton and "real" leadership.

If you love wimpy leadership principles this book IS NOT for you.
