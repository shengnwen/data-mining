Yes, much of the book was spent explaining how difficult it was for Brooke to become pregnant.  Perhaps it was explained to demonstrate how badly she and her husband wanted a child, only to have Brooke feel the complete opposite once her daughter was born.  I read this book while suffering from PPD.  Brooke's words were my words, she was speaking FOR me, when I could not articulate my thoughts, and was afraid of myself.  I finally had faith that I would not be "the excepton" and that even I could overcome PPD.  Also good reading is "Conquering Postpartum Depression" by Dr. Ron Rosenberg.  He's a dedicated doctor
