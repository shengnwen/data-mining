This is a hilarious second take on the action in Shakespeare's Hamlet, from the point of view of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the two unsavory nobles who think they are escorting Hamlet to his death via a distant king.

In this play, the two titular characters are fleshed out to be absurdly, and comically, inept in some ways, and very human and sympathetic in others. They play at deep thought, and this play is meant to lead the audience into musings that aren't necessarily articulated on the stage. 

The humor is very off the wall, reminiscent of both Waiting for Godot, to which its often compared, and certain parts of Douglas Adams' "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" trilogy. 

The showdown between logic and the absurd is always, thankfully, entertaining, and this is as much fun to read as it is to see on stage. In fact, it might be a better read than it is a play, as the slow, thoughtful pace may give some audiences too much time for checking their watches.
