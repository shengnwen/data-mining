Thursday Next rocks. There is English Classical Literature. There are delightful puns on poem and novel titles. There is time travel. There is gunfire and violence. There is a red sports car. There is more snark than you can shake a very sarcastic stick at. There are various devices and abilities allowing characters to actually enter books and have vastly entertaining conversation with various famous literary characters. If you enjoy the witty banter of Joss Whedon, the impeccably polite sarcasm of Austen, the deadpan quips of Dickens, you will love Thursday. She is my hero. Jasper Fforde is a genius for inventing her and the alternate universe in which her adventures take place. I save his books for after particularly grueling or involved reads, when I need something fun and light-hearted to make me feel less depressed
