As a former High School and College Baseball player, and a current high school baseball coach, I have never read a book that epitomizes youth baseball today more than this one. Lewis' description of his experiences, and his coaches experiences, regarding todays parents/athletes could not be better. Every parent of a youth/high school athlete should read this book before they even consider complaining to their child's coach. I am only in my mid 20's and I can relate to many of the experiences described in this book. It's a very quick read as well. If I could give it 100 stars I would.  For those readers who complained about the length of the book, yes it is a quick read but the book only costs 10 dollars.  Anyone who is looking for a lengthy book should know not to purchase a book that is 90 pages long.  For those of you who were, and then bought the book, that's your own fault.  Great book.
