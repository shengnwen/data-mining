To my money better than &quot;Shoeloess Joe&quot; or even &quot;The Natural.&quot; The peculiar style of dialect narration and formal dialogue put me off at first, but it quickly charmed me, and helped define Wiggen both as person and as &quot;author.&quot; The sentiment came quietly and  truthfully, and unexpectedly, particularly when a &quot;throwaway&quot;  character reveals the source of the title, and in the great line from  legendary catcher Red Traphagen about what this book should be about. Hint:  not baseball ... as a baseball fan and a literature fan, I must say this is  a wonderful book
