Its a bit of a grab-bag, but that is kind of fun too.  I would probably not have read some of these things had they not been put in this collection.  

This is a really easy book to read by the way.  It is not some very dry, quant oriented book.  But is a lively, entertaining, and often funny collection of wisdom and insight.  It is well worth the money and time.
