Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980.) 

As long as there had been motion pictures, there had been science fiction films. Unfortunately, very few of them ever managed to hit the spot. That was, until 1977 rolled around. It was in this year that George Lucas would change the way we look at science fiction. How would he do this? With the film he released that year - Star Wars. The film was so successful, that two sequels were released, and not surprisingly, they were novelized. Read on for my review of the novelization of The Empire Strikes Back.

BASIC PLOT: 
The basic story of the movie goes something like this. Three years have past since the events of the first Star Wars film. The Rebel Alliance has gone into hiding in a base on the remote, icy world of Hoth. Unfortunately, the Galactic Empire discovers them. After an intense battle against imperial forces, Luke goes to a distant, swampy world to begin his training to become a Jedi knight, while Han and Leia get chased by the Empire, and a number of bounty hunters employed by them. The climax of the film comes in a lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader, in which Vader makes a startling revelation... 

OPINIONS: 
A great story - no questions asked. This is a rare example of a sci-fi tale nearly thirty years old that doesn't seem dated. Even by modern standards, this is still an excellent film. This is, by far, THE BEST STAR WARS STORY THAT WAS ALSO A FILM. Like with the other novelizations of classic Trilogy novels, the film version is better for a number of reasons, but still this is a good novelization. 

OVERALL: 
The Star Wars saga consists of science fiction masterpieces that don't fail to stand the test of time. Hell, these tales are better than most of the modern sci-fi stuff out there! If you're a fan of the genre, the Star Wars series is not to be missed.
