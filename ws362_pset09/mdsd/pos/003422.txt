I think Shadow Spinner is an awesome book because of its ability to captivate the reader.  There are secrets and struggles, along with many things unknown.  Shadow Spinner is a story about Marjan and her life in the harem.  When she was younger, her mother crippled Marjan's foot so she will never become a wife of the Sultan who had been killing wives everyday, until Sharazad.  Sharazad tells tales every night and stops at an exciting part.  The Sultan lets Sharazad live until the next day because he wants to know how things turn out.  One day, Marjan goes into the harem, when Sharazad is desperate for tales to tell at night, with her Auntie Chava, and ends up telling a story to the harem children.  If you like suprise endings, you'll love this book!
