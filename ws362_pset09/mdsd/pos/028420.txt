Stunning. One of the top 10 books I have ever read. The author writes it so that you can feel the characters emotions. The ending of the story really touched me. I find it hard to read books about changes. I sort of want things to always be the same. "I'd also lost the notion there was magic in the world. I guess you could say I'd lost my childhood," is in my opinion one of the saddest parts of the book. Also, the part where Kneebone tells Buck that the good times are gone forever and that things would never be the same between the two, and the part that Buck says that Obie lost his heart for the Bay. I could go on forever talking about how great this book is. Its a moving book and I would recommend everyone who needs a good story to read it
