If you think writing for children is 'child's play'- think again! Just as adults want good content, settings and characters, so do children. Ms. Lamb's expert advice, based on her many years of successfully writing children's stories, is invaluable whether you're a seasoned children's writer, or a novice. Learn how to turn your children's story into the one you've dreamed of. Create plots that will hold a child's interest, and characters they'll believe in and want to read about. I highly recommend this wonderful, insightful and clearly written book
