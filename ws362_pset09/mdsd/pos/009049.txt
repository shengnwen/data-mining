Years ago I read the Hitchhikers series and loved it.  Then I was so thrilled when the movie came out.  More recently a friend of mine suggested the Dirk Gently series.  I am grateful to that friend for suggesting them.  This is a wonderful and fun read with many illusions and references to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and his literary works.  Dirk Gently is a one-of-a-kind character and there is no way not to love him.  Only Adams could have thought up this great bunch of characters, the incidents that happen to them, and pull them together in such a clever way!

I highly recommend this book whether you have ever read Adams or not.  This is a wonderful book which will stay with you for quite a while after you have finished it.  In fact, I didn't want to stop reading it but I didn't want it to end either.  Too bad Adams didn't live long enough to write more Dirk Gently books.  A really terrific read
