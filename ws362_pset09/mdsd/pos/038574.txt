I love this work.  I first ran across it in 1972, read it to my grandchildren and have used it in the class room.  This is the story of a town that is overrun with wasps.  It is a story about what the town did about it.  They built a giant, and I mean a GIANT Strawberry Jam Sandwich!  The verse as written by Janet Burroway is truely good, catchy and funny.  The story, text and illustration are of a very high quality.  Kids love this one and it is a fun book to read to the kids for the adult reader.  There was obviously a lot of work that went into this book and a lot of thought.  It shows.  Recommend this one quite highly.
