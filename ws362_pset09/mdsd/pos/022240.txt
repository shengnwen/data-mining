This book just happens to be one of the many books in the Berenstain Bears collection. Each book is writen in which to teach children. This book teaches children that they should appreciate what they have, and that they're not less fortunate like many others. This book, along with the rest of the Berenstain collection is marvelous. The authors, Stan and Jan Berenstain,  put every responsibility, and lesson each parent wants their  child to know, into fun and wonderful stories
