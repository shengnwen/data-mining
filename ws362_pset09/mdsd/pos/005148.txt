It can be very effective to help people who are stuck and seem to not heal because of psychological reasons. Often one session is enough to treat/cure a phobia for example! TFT is the main healing modality in use today to address emotional and spiritual issues. You'll find it is truly remarkable the way TFT combines Oriental Medicine (acupuncture points) and Body Centered Psychotherapy in one effective treatment. The other great thing is that it is possible and easy to treat oneself for a lot of conditions. Roger Callahan's system is composed of procedures that consist on tapping on certain acupuncture points that are connected with certain types of emotions. By tapping on these points, we are able to cleanse the emotional energetic charge that is connected with a particular situation or event that is the source of stress, fear, anxiety, pain and sorrow, anger, rage, and so on. So that at the end of the treatment we are able to be neutral and non-affected in front of this particular situation or event or while remembering anything traumatic that happened in the past. From this neutral place we can look at a traumatic situation and just say, 'yes it happened' and move on with our life
