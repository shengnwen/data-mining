Having read the Chronicles many years ago, and recently picked up the first volume of the Lost Chronicles, I turned to the Annotated Chronicles to mine the original stories for the best scenes and see what was contributed by the commentary of Weis, Hickman, and other members of the original Dragonlance design team. It's rare that one gets the opportunity to read authors' commentaries on their own works, and I found it overall a worthwhile experience - better, I say, to have this sort of thing than not (imagine a Lord of the Rings annotated closely by Tolkien!). Comments range widely from explanation of scenes, background to the plot, character origins, analysis, and development, and so on. Some of the notes explain the obvious but many give you an insight into what is for the reader unknowable (for example, concerns that Lord Soth, like Milton's Satan, would dominate at every appearance, which he tends to do...). I didn't find the notes obtrusive and tended to look forward to them as they appeared on the marginal horizon. A couple of things in conclusion: the annotations are not comprehensive (there is bound to be something that cries out for comment but does not receive it), nor are they systematic or (for the D&D folk) technical. If you have not read the Chronicles don't start with this edition. The annotations give too much away. Come back to it later
