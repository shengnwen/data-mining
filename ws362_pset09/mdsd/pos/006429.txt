The review below is another fake.  Please disregard it.  The author has explained numerous times that the grammatical errors in her book are due to the publisher's error. A first time author doesn't have the pull that one expects. Secondly, the author has already explained again and again that the book is NOT ABOUT THE DOG FAITH - When will the readers understand that the book is explained on the back. You don't have to buy a book because an advertising agent said it was good to read. The book is excellent. A master of wit and a great story about a great family and how they survived much that other families have had to endure. The book about Faith is coming in November and will be all about Faith. NIKKI M is probably just the stupid ex again trying to create problems for an obviously glorious book. Grammatical errors and small font should tell you that the publisher made the errors. When is the last time an author had control over such things?  The 2nd Edition is best. Buy it. ISBN: 142-57-1849-
