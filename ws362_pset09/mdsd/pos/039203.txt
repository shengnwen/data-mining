I have been reading these mysteries from the very first book, it was a nice change to have the book read to me. The book was well read except for some for the pronunciations of some of the famous and infamous locales. I admit I cringed every time I heard Susan Ericksen say Ghirardelli Square.

The characters have evolved nicely over the years and I highly recommend this book, personally I love the audio cd's during my commute to and from work
