I am a novice herbalist, not an expert by any means, but herbs are definitely my first choice when it comes to helping me or my family's body's deal with infection, boosting health, etc.  However, when it came to pregnancy I was stumped with what was safe and what is not.  This book really answered a lot of questions as to what is great to take to nurture the pregnancy as well as what to take if there are problems encountered. I was also VERY impressed and influenced by Romm's perspective on women taking back their right to deal with their pregnancy as a natural occurrence rather than the way western medicine deals with it almost as a sickness. In addition this book inspired me to utilize the help of a midwife rather than a M.D. during my next pregnancy.  I absolutely recommend this to women who are seeking to be pregnant or are already pregnant and wish to utilize alternative natural means to aid your pregnancy
