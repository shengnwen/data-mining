This play by renowned playright Sam Shepard was entertaining enough. However, it's anti-war political agenda was too obvious and not enough to vault this play to a lasting level of literary greatness. All that aside though, the storyline carries the reader/viewer along and reads fast enough that it might be worth picking up.
