Edward Teller and George Soros shared few common traits; nationality, religion, and globalization. Both were Hungarian, Jewish, hard workers, and stubborn thinkers. Teller dreamed of the Hydrogen bomb and believed earlier that a nuclear explosion might detonate the earth's atmosphere and ends civilization. Even with the fission bomb out-of-reach, Teller was living in the dreamland of the nuclear fusion. Soros is less fortunate in reaching his utopian dream despite his billions. Sociology isn't physics. Soros' players have emotions and beliefs that impact their decisions. The Russian robbers had outsmarted him, as they did with Napoleon and Hitler. Yet, his driven obsession with open society made him repeat the same mistake in Macedonia and Ukraine. 

Teller also confronted opponents, yet with like scientific minds and confronting limited physical constraints. Knocking down Oppenheimer was Teller's big chance to keep his status, though never became billionaire. In Soros's realm, there is no known opponent to knock down in order to satisfy his utopian dream of open society. His sense that his efforts might lead to lasting changes on the long term, even in his absence, might well be true. Ideas outlive people, though Soros' generation is unique in many ways. 

Soros's basic concepts center on reflexivity, fallibility, far-from equilibrium economy, and open society. His basic tools are economic and mathematical analysis of supply and demand. The greatest challenge to his effort to utilize his tools in achieving open society is the lack of concrete principles for predicting human emotion. Not only the little players like Macedonia, Albania, Iran, and Israel are driven by emotions, but also the American Superpower shares the ailment.  Noticeably however, financial investors possess detrimental emotion as well. They must win in the first round or get out before another loss. Soros' judgment on the imbalance of receivables and production in the new Russia is an example of an impatient, selfish, and zealous financier looking merely for his immediate gain.

In his comparison to the sudden decay of the Soviet empire with the British Empire, Soros cannot conceal his wishful desire of a mechanical history. He bitterly blames the West for betraying Mikhail Gorbachev and accuses the latter of being naï¿½ve. Yet, he admits that the sick mother of communism could not carry her fetus to full term.  His paternal views that eastern European and third world nations need be or anxious to be told what to do when given financial assistance, omit national emotions. Nations have pride as do individuals. Coercive politics might hinder the progress to open society. Past Germany, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, Iraq, Syria, Cuba, and Yugoslavia are examples of how imposing politics perpetuated long conflicts.    

Where does his utopian dreaming lead to? The Internet, he claims, is opening society and might seal the death of fascism, communism, and the like. However, anything could happen in the future since our civilization is fueled by energy which is getting scarcer everyday. His assumption that a new scientific breakthrough, such as carbonless extraction of energy from coal, or other innovations that secure renewable energy, could safeguard human civilization from inevitable catastrophe. 

Soros' resort to philosophy is driven by his economic undertaking. In order to make financial profit, he has to tackle the emotional factors of key players. Against the common wisdom of history and science, emotional policy-makers are still blundering national treasures and human lives. Defeat or victory in war is still the controlling principal in curtailing stray emotion of nations.
