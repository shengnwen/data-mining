This was an extremely well-written and well-executed book from a technical standpoint.  The writing was smooth and concise, with excellent flow, and the story unfolds in a way that seems almost effortless.  Wolff adopts a remarkably objective tone in examining his own life, a tone which avoids making a melodrama out of his unfortunate childhood, while also creating a certain honesty that (eventually) makes you feel sympathy for a teenager who is not always easy to like.  A side-effect of this detached viewpoint, however, is that at first I felt somewhat removed from what was happening.  But I slowly warmed up to the young Wolff, and by the end I came to cheer for him.  I also recognized many of the feelings he had while growing up, feelings that are hard to admit to and even harder to put into words.  Wolff did a great job of exploring these feelings in an honest, tasteful way that was somehow both subtle and clear.  Overall I would recommend the book highly, and I plan on reading more from this author
