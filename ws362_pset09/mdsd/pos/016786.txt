the true story about the holocaust was wonderful! the authors kept you interested through each chapter! since jacob is a jewish boy forced into hiding with the roslans who are polish, he is given the name genyek. many exciting events take place in the story inculding two deaths in alex's family. I love the book which i did a big report on . I found it made me understand the holocaust better than i did before
