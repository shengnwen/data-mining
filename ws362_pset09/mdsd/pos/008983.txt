Buenos Aires is by far the most European of the great Latin American cities, it is a city of cafe's and grand avenues.  This book captures the essence of this unique city, it gets up close and personal and gets the flavor of the town.  I must confess I knew very little about Buenos Aries before picking up this book, I just knew about Evita, uh thank you Madonna, and I had seen pictures of the capitol building, but I really had no idea what a beautiful city this was, well at the very least it photographs well.  The people are very Western and sophisicated and don't ever forget these are the people that created the Tango.  If you have any interest in this great city, then I highly recommend this book
