This book is by no means a wonderpill for awful relationships or a bible for the newlyweds, but no book really is.  What this serves as is more of a running start for people who plan to stay together forever.  The advice is sound and badly needed, although some of the "experts" have been divorced several times.  Other than that, it's a solid four out of five as far as good advice for long, loving relationships.  And the reader doesn't feel like they're being psychoanalyzed by a book.  This is the healthy marriage book for people who don't want to be therapied to death
