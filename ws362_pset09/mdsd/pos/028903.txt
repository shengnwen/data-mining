Last year I had this calendar and was very happy.  For 2007 I thought I would try a different Mom's calendar.  Within the first month, my husband told me to go back to the Sandra Boynton one.  So I agreed and I would buy it for 2008.  He disliked our new calendar so much, that we threw the new one away and ordered the Sandra Boynton one again!
