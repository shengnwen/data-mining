I purchased this book a few months ago and I haven't placed it in my bookcase yet, I'm continueously referencing it!

The format is great and topic detail is execellent!  A specific example is the Long-Running Operations topic in chapter 14 where control interaction across threads is explained in detail and much more clearly than other books I have referenced.
