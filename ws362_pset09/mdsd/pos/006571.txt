I haven't even finished the book and i can't disagree more with the reviews people have written here. My question is, should it really have been marketed as a "business" book. I would classify it as a book worthy required reading for an American Studies course. It fits in with the idea of "the other", people who had "deviant" ideas and thru their actions propelled society to move ahead. These deviances then become the so called "norm". They move society/culture whether it be "pop culture" or products. Hmmm? does America have "culture" other than "pop culture" which is so tied in with consumerism. I think this book is more for the creative thinkers/artists etc. than for business people or people who want to "cash in" on an idea. This book is for people who as kids did NOT color within the lines. I found out about the book thru a radio show interview that was so interesting. This is the type of book that you don't read in one sitting. It is not a "get rich" quick book. duh!!! This is a book where you can read one concept/idea they have pushed forth and you put the book down and "THINK" about it. I think it is brilliant
