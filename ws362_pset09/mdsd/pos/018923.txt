Buteo identification has always been a challenge for me, but over the Christmas Day Birdcount I was able to get an identification I would have never gotten without the volume.  The subtle parsing of the various colors, sizes, behaviors, etc. of raptors makes this more useful then a field guide for understanding on what you should be focusing when catching that 5 or 6 seconds of "flying away raptor".   

Another reviewer mentioned the grainy photographs, which is dead-on.  Unfortunately, I have to say that those photographs are (approximately) how I am seeing most of these birds.  So, they are an odd bit of help, really.
