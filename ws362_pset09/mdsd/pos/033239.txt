In "Villette," Charlotte Bronte tells the story of Lucy Snowe, a young English woman who loses her family early in life and ends up traveling to a small village in Belgium where she becomes a teacher at a girls' boarding school. There she meets a dynamic but somewhat eccentric literature professor named M. Paul Emmanuel and they embark on a rocky friendship that will eventually lead to love.

I had never heard of this book until recently finding it on a shelf at a local bookstore. I then did some research on the internet and discovered just how popular it is. With good reason! The opening chapter draws you in immediately and except for a few places here and there where the pace slows down considerably, I found the book to be completely enthralling. The character of Lucy Snowe is very similar to that of Jane Eyre in that she is also intelligent and strong, and not afraid to state her opinions openly. I have to admit, though, that there were a few times during the novel that I actually disliked Lucy and wished she would try a little harder to be likeable. Still, this is a wonderful story and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Be prepared for a surprise ending, though! One I certainly did not see coming and am still trying to come to grips with.

*There are quite a few French phrases in the novel and if you require these to be translated, I don't recommend this Signet edition. The translated phrases are listed in the back of this edition but there are no numbers directing you to them in the text, so you end up having to flip back and forth constantly. I ended up purchasing the Barnes and Noble Classics edition which has the translated phrases at the bottom of each page.*
