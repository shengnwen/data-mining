My daughter had to read this as part of her middle school book challenge and I'm the one who reaped the reward. Slam is a great character, one who feels most in control when on the basketball court. As a basketball lover, I loved all the action scenes and could feel all the tension in Slam's life, both on and off the court. Attending a different school from the one he'd been used to, Slam has a lot of team issues to deal with that he didn't before. One of them is his attitude, the other is maybe being a little too good. He beats the coach one-on-one and it haunts him throughout the season. He also has things to deal with at home, like the out-of-work father his mother loves so much. Greg (Slam) need math tutoring but doesn't want to displace his father with another man. As his best friend starts wearing a beeper and nice clothes, Slam's life seems to be getting more difficult. The truth about his friend's new life is staring Slam in the face but he doesn't want to see it. In the end, Slam is forced to see the truth about himself, his neighborhood and his friend. He realizes that life is just a game and he's going to have switch up his plays off court if he wants to win. Like in Sharon g. Flake's MONEY HUNGRY, I love the love and friendship in the community that Myers portrays. Yes, there are bad things, hard things, but there are good things and good kids too. Great book
