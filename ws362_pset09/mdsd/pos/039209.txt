I have this book and five others.   I like this book better because it covers a variety of topics...even after birth which is where many books stop. In my opinion this book is more useful since you're given more indepth information in terms of nutrition, breast feeding, exercises, bonding, etc. The other books are more clinical and make you want to panic everytime something changes
