Grisham departs from his usual genre to write a book with a strong sense of place and time (Arkansas, 1950s). The events of a summer of cotton picking unfold gradually through the narration of young Luke Chandler. 
The author creates much the same feel that you get from Rawling's The Yearling, though this is not really a coming-of-age story. As you sit on the porch listening to the Cardinals baseball game on the radio, you become one of the family in this book. You hear the local gossip, worry about the uncle in Korea, and feel the desperation of a struggling farm family about to lose their crop. 
The relationships and events become complex with the addition of the migrant Mexican workers, the hillbilly family and a varied neighbors and town folks. 
I'm not quite sure what the painting of the old house was supposed to signify, but the relationships held my attention as the story flowed and unfurled through the eyes of Luke.
