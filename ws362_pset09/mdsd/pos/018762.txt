I CAN'T believe there was a reviewer who said it was "boring"! I have bought this book at least 5 or 6 times because I've lent my copy to people and never got it back because everyone thought it was so good. (No worries, those people were family....figured I'd overlook it *this* time). I've also read it at least 4 times over the past few years. It's simply wonderful; it delves into your heart and stays there. You will not regret purchasing this book
