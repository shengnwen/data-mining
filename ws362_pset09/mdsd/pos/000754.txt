As a former sex worker, I want to praise the author of "Sex Workers as Virtual Boyfriends" for his insightfulness into hustlers' lives.  For two difficult years I put myself through college as a parking valet.  The work was hard, the pay miserable, and I breathed in a lot of polluted air.  Then I started escorting.  The job was easy for the most part, the pay excellent, and my health was not in jeopardy.  Like the author says, a few clients did also become good friends.  ...  Of course, it is older dudes paying for the services of the younger guys.  They get paid *because* they are younger and nobody is being exploited.  We, young escorts know exactly what we are doing, and the older clients spend their money to fulfill their needs.  I highly recommend the book to anyone who wants to understand the life of sex workers
