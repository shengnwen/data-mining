Bob Gormly wrote a great book on his 30 year experiences as a Navy SEAL. He recounts how he passed the most gruelling toughest training in the world to be a SEAL. His 2 tours of duty in Vietnam are filled with pulse pounding action. He then led the most elite of SEAL's, SEAL team 6, into combat in Grenada. I really liked his discussion of Richard Marcinko the convicted felon who founded six and left it's reputation tarnished. This is a great book for those interested in SEALs or Special Operations Forces. Thanks Bob for this great memoir
