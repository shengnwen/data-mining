David Kennedy believes that government health officials and the medical community at large are in the hip pocket of big drug companies. This conspiracy has caused important, effective, powerful remedies, like vitamin C, to go unnoticed and unsupported. History will tell whether he is right about that.

What may be more important is that Kennedy and others believe Vitamin C can prevent and treat the avian flu. If this is true, Vitamin C can provide an inexpensive, powerful, effective treatment for a lethal virus.

It now seems clear to every serious-minded person that the Asian Bird Flu is going to attack, the only question is when. When the epidemic strikes, it will be deadly and fast. According to Kennedy, mega-doses of Vitamin C will be effective in protecting people against the flu. For those that have it, he believes that mega-doses of Vitamin C, administered intrvenously, may save many lives.

This book is mostly about the curative effects of Vitamin C. Based on studies and reports of it curing polio, cancer, and other deadly conditions, Kennedy, Linus Pauling, and others state that the health benefits of it are dramatically understated and even unknown. 

I don't know if Kennedy is right about the pharamaceutical industry, time will tell. If he is right about Vitamin C and the bird flu, our family will be protected by an inexpensive, easily-available remedy. If he is wrong, we will have taken a lot of Vitamin C.

The highest potentcy in tablet form I am able to find are on amazon.com at 2000MG. Forget Tamiflu and pass the orange juice.
