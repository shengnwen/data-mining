This book is terrific!   Annie B. Bond has such a lovely way of writing and she pulls and lulls you into this book with her writing style.  I loved every topic in her book and have so many pages bookmarked so I won't have to hunt for them later.   I'm all for healthy, toxin-free living and this book hits the mark exquisitely.  She gives you great receipes for natural, safe cleaning products and takes you through-out your home with great suggestions for its care.   She ends her book with addresses of govenment or company names to find information or products of all the items she covers in this book.   The is a book that will always be close at hand for me to refer to.  Thanks Annie
