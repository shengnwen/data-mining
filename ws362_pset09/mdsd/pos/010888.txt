This book has marvelously drawn characters and a deft plot.  But what lingers in my mind are the constant, droll little absurdities that abound in the characters' world, understated seeming little asides which charactertize postmodern American urban and media life.  And give Andersen credit that he was actually prescient, in that things we accept as unremarkable are getting more postmodern and more absurd all the time.  Every time I see or read about something like the Secretary of the Treasury touring the Third World with Bono, I think to myself, &quot;this is just like something out of 'Turn of the Century.'&quot
