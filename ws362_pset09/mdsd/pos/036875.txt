This new atlas has LOTS of additional photos of pathologic specimens (both gross and microscopic images, with many helpful radiologic correlations) not included in the 7th edition of Robbins & Cotran. The photos are of excellent quality, and follow along, chapter-for-chapter, with the text for ease of review. Key features are highlighted by use of focal symbols placed within the images to direct the reader to landmarks detailed within the corresponding captions. The captions are substantial, and reinforce important concepts by using many of the same key words and phrases found in the more detailed text, as well as including additional information to enhance understanding. One thing is certain: In the field of pathology, pictures always help! This atlas wasn't available when I took sophomore pathology in medical school, but I am glad to now have it as a companion to "Big" Robbins as part of general pathology practice and review. So why didn't I give it "5 stars", you ask? Because there is always room for improvement, and since this is R&C's first atlas, more reviews are needed for this and future editions before extoling perfection. Regardless, I think they're off to a good start
