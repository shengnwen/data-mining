I have been reading Greg Iles in reverse lately. His latest, The Turning Angel was recommended by a friend and turned out to be one of the best novels I have read in some time. The Quiet Game is a sort of prequel which I then read and also enjoyed. When I find and author this good, I tend to keep reading earlier novels and having now finished Mortal Fear, I think I will take a break before resuming the Greg Iles reads. This last one wore me out (in a good way).

Harper Cole has an "interesting" life. A very successful commodities trader, married to a beautiful and brilliant doctor who was his high school sweetheart and the father of a little girl everyone thinks is his neice. "Mommy" is his wife's sister a drop dead big city model who has come home to Mississippi and gotten married to settle down. The parentage of the little girl, Holly, has been kept a secret. 

Cole has a "hobby." He is a systems operator for an erotic on line service which is quite expensive and sophisticated and caters only to those who can afford it. It offers total anonymity to those who purchase it's services. It is also being used by a brilliant and devious killer who's victims are being stalked for a diabolical pupose.

How these beginning story lines grow and intersect into a very compelling read is what makes this book worth reading. I used to think that I would not want Jeffery Deaver's nightmares after some of the horrific stories he has written. I now add Iles to that list.

I will agree with those that feel the story meanders a bit for maybe half of the book, but the buildup to the conclusion is do- not-put-down-unless-you-have-to eat, sleep or go to bed type writing.

Just listen to Harper Cole. He has quite a story to tell.
