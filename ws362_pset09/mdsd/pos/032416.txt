I have been waiting so long for new poems from Mary Oliver...and it was worth the wait.  These are just as beautiful as the poems in White Pine, Twelve Moons, etc.  I especially prize the way Oliver finds lessons about love and life from her observations of nature.  Check it out, you won't be disappointe
