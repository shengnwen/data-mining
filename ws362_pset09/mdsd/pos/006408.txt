In his review above under Library Journal, Jeff Ingram proves that he either did not read all of the book, or he did not understand it, but either way he commits two of the errors which the authors specifically raise: the trivializing of misandry, and the justification of it. 
Now providing us with a classic example of these, first Ingram trivializes misandry by apparently saying, 'oh well, the media is going to engage in this sort of thing anyway..'; he then justifies misandry by stating 'someone has to be the bad person', implying that it might as well be the man (and it usually is, which Ingram would know if he had read all the pages).
Finally, his notion that this one volume, will somehow 'balance' the massive feminist literature on misogyny, is a joke.
Thank you Mr. Ingram, for inadvertantly endorsing the book
