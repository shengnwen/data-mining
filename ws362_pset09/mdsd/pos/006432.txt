Great book, and it truly is an eye opener. If you want to get back to eating healthy, then this book is a must. Most of the stuff Kevin Trudeau talks about we probably all know, it's so simble, but he puts it over in such a way that makes you want to put it into action! I have implemented some of his advice, and have lost 10lbs, without even trying to lost weight! Just pure basic, healthy eating.
He has opened a can of worms relating to drug companies and the medical profession that we should all be aware of.
