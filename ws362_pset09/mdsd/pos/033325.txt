Doug Hoffman's book provides the most balanced and wide reaching view of operational risk in print -- the book addresses large corporate, societal, and management issues, in addition to the more standard operational risk topics, such as quantification and regulatory matters. This is the type of perspective that only someone from the industry -- who spent a number of years as a practitioner can provide. And the inclusion of real life cases brings the whole discussion of operational risk down to a practical level and can serve as a blue print for the implementation of an operational risk program. This book is a great value and already a classic text in the field
