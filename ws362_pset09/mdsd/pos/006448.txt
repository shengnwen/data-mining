This is a real page turner, and that's really saying something considering that this book is hella long.  Clavel is a real student Hong Kong high society, and it is fascinating to watch the Anglo Ian Dunross navigate his way through the Asian way, the mini series of this book is exceptional, I saw it as a kid, and I remember how much I wanted to be Pierce Brosnan, nobody could have inbodied Dunross like Brosnan.  If you enjoy a good read and love learning about a different culture then you will love this book, but be forewarned, is is LONG, and be sure to pick up the mini series it is a wonderful compliment to the book
