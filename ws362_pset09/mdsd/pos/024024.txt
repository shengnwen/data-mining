Everything you want to know about corn is found in this book.  And I mean everything.  We see corn growing in fields everyday but do we actually stop and think about it?  Do we pull over to the side of the road and LOOK at it?  It's amazing how corn has been around longer than anyone will know.  This book covers an overwhelming amount of detail.  If you don't find it interesting you're just not a corn person.  In fact, the only thing it doesn't answer is why I threw up over a bad cob one time.  I don't throw up.
