This book held my interest from start to finish.  Once I started it I could not put it down.  I had to get to the next chapter to find out what would happen to Alex next, or what will Alex do to his foster parents next!!  How will the next event be handled.  What other abuse could this poor boy be subject to.  This book is extremely graffic, the details of his abuse are given in detail.  He suffered physical, sexual, emotional and even ritual abuse.  I believe Alex, I believe his foster parents.  Some of you may not. Whether you believe the story or not, you'll gain a great perspective about MPD, and you won't be able to put the book down! This book is about a boy's abusive family, most are about girls.  I applaud Alex for his courage to heal and to tell his story
