This book is an excellent choice for new moms that want to record their  baby's life. I love the samples of colorful layouts  by other moms. The  supply list on all the page samples are a wonderful help. The advice on  lettering is also a plus. I use the sweet dreams alphabet in my own baby's  scrapbook. The fact that the book covers the span of pregnancy through the  baby's first years means you'll get much use out of this book
