In self-publishing my first book "Making New Friends" money was tight.  I knew I needed to promote the book but wasn't quite sure how to approach PR.  I purchased this book and found I could not put it down.  Jodee's keen insight into publicity has been extremely helpful to me.  The book contains excellent advice and examples of publicity techniques. It truly is a complete guide to book publicity.  I highly recommend this book for all self-published authors that are looking for guidance on book promotion and publicity
