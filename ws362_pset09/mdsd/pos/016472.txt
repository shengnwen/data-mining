This book was sent home with 100 unifex cubes to use along with the book.  We used the cubes as the ants.  We started off with one line of 100 cubes (as the ants).  Then, in the story, they split into 2 lines of 50, so we split our cubes, too.  Then, 4 lines of 25, and so on....  Excellent book to use with the cubes to demonstract how many different ways to make 100.
