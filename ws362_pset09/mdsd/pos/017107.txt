This was the most insightful commentary on the Bible I have ever read.  

Literary analysis was never so meaningful. In fact, I believe the author read in more intricacies from J than were intended. Perhaps, perhaps not, but in any case I now have a far greater understanding as well as a greater appreciation for the Torah. 

I have often felt that the drama within Genesis was Shakespearean in quality and design. But for difficulty in translation and an awkward sentence structure from Hebrew to English, this idea of mine was mere guesswork. I now know it is the case. It was explained beautifully. How many new doors are open?
