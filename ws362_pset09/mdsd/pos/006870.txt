I agree with another reviewer that this book is useful even for the staunch believer in ESP. It is a very entertaining reading which is not often the case (I found Martin Gardner`s books rather boring and sometimes arrogant). The two authors are never arrogant. I particularly loved the last chapters that show how common &quot;non-scientific&quot; thinking is among said scientific communities. He gives some examples then concerning psychiatry and medicine. If you remember the Uri Geller craze you will enjoy the opening chapters also
