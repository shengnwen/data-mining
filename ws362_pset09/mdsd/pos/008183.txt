Walk On, The Spiritual Journey of U2 brilliantly tells the story of the spiritual side of U2, arguably the biggest band in the world.  The author does a good job of not spending too much time on any certain period of time.  Rather, he outlines the changes the band has gone through, and the frustration of being typecast by the church and the media alike.  The author describes the feeling you get at a live U2 concert.  How does one retain their Christian views when you're not able to attend church without a crowd gathering?  This book answeres this question and many more.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys U2's music, or anyone who still hasn't found what they're looking for
