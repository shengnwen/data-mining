Manifold: Time is absolutely bursting with amazing science.  Anyone interested in cosmology and the physics of time will love this book.  Stephen Baxter early on provides a mind-blowing ride from the beginning of the universe through the end of time.  After jangling our gray matter about with this whirlwind tour, he then zooms through ever deeper arguments about time and how it fits into our universe.  The book encompasses cosmologically huge timescales (bigger than I imagined would be possible), and gives the reader at least a chance to comprehend the universe's huge extent in space and time.  

Manifold: Time has some other very interesting scientifically based arguments to make concerning the short-term survivability of humanity on earth.  A look at the bibliography at the end of the book demonstrates how strongly hard-science based this book really is.  Less hard science, but a lot of fun, is Baxter's use of augmented squids to "man" space flights.  

For all these positives, Manifold: Time unfortunately also has some major faults.  Baxter asks a lot of big questions, and the various outcomes he envisions might be correct.  But the people that populate Manifold: Time are not up to the task: they never have enough depth in character or in numbers to match the questions posed.  And Baxter is too secular with the story; religion and faith might not have the answers, but humanity would force them to have a much bigger part (both positive and negative) than portrayed in this book.  Baxter's presentation feels incomplete and somewhat sterile.

The key to Manifold: Time and whether you might enjoy it is cosmology and time.  For many, the science may go overboard, and the flawed character development and negatively sterile view of humanity might disappoint.  But if you are intrigued by scifi extrapolations about the beginning and end of the universe, and find time paradoxes fun to contemplate, then you will surely enjoy Manifold: Time.
