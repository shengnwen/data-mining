BLACK MISCHIEF is the sixth Waugh book I've read, and it's one of his funniest.  The plot concerns goings-on in the fictional African empire of Azania (which is supposed to be off the coast of present day Somalia).  Civil war has just erupted, and an English educated Azanian named Seth ends up the victor.  He gets caught up with the British legation, including frivolous Basil Seal (an acquaintance of the recurring Waugh character - Lady Metroland).  Basil is made the Minister of Moderization and has Seth's constant ear.  Naturally, things spiral downward from there.  BLACK MISCHIEF starts off a bit slow, and the first 75 pages are a bit tedious and confusing.  However, things really take off afterwards.  Waugh is always funny, but this book has more laugh-out-loud moments than most of his novels.  Highly recommended for fans of Waugh and good satirical novels
