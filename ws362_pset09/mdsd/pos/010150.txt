Our firm is in cost cutting mode, so I got this book looking for practical tips on how to cut our considerable telecom bill.  What I liked was the step-by-step approach covering local, long distance and alternative technologies.  Instead of a lot of theory, it gets down to USOCs and has a checklist of specific savings ideas.  The audit program at the back rambled at bit but had plenty of detail.  The book throws in some useful &quot;shovelware&quot; at the back too -- sample RFPs, contracts, things to look for in a good contract, etc.  Defintely worth the money
