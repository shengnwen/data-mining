Starbucks, it seems as if there is one on every corner. So I had to find out why, why are there so many Starbucks, why is it so popular. Well after reading this it seems to because of its founder Howard Shultz. He gives away his secret, hard work. It is a very inspiring story, although I do feel he is a little bit over driven. But he certainly does deserve all the success he gets. The real reason I read this book is because my son and daughter-in-law work at a Starbucks. I wanted to know what kind of company Starbucks was. Well I found out it is well run and seems to me to have an unlimited future
