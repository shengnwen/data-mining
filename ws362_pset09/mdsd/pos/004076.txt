One of the harder Hiaasen novels to come across, this 1989 Florida adventure revolves around the lucrative and unlegislated world of plastic surgery.  Hiaasen as always has created surreal and dim-witted villains along with other characters that only his mind can.  Skin Tight isn't as fast paced as Hiaasen's masterpieces such as Sick Puppy, Skinny Dip, Lucky You, Stormy Weather, Native Tongue, Strip Tease and Hoot.  Those books from the first page you just could not put down until the final page. Skin Tight lacks that but is a worthwhile read, just not in the same league. Skin Tight also does slightly touch on the Florida environment but the passion for conservation Hiaasen normally includes in his work is no where near as strong here.   

If you have read all of Carl Hiaasen's novels and are still hungry for more of the same then check out the author C.J. Box who writes similar surreal novels set in Wyoming instead of Florida with passionate extreme environmentalists, corrupt public officials, dim-witted rednecks and other Hiaasen style characters.  Open Season is a good book to start with.   Fellow Floridian and Miami newspaper writer Dave Barry has also written a few fiction books which are very close to Hiaasen in style especially his masterpiece Tricky Business.
