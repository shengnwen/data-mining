Stone Soup by Marcia Brown is not only a a wonderful teaching tool for young children but a book filled with wonderful illustrations. To read this book is to feel the movement of the characters and the joys of learning to share with others.  Even if it is very little.

When 3 soldiers approach a town the inhabitants don't want to share what little food they have.  But then the soldiers teach them how to make soup from water and stones which turns out to be a different soup that they expected. A good lesson is learned by all of the townspeople as well all of those who read this book.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it the next time a young person says, "I'm bored.
