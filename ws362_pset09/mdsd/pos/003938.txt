Nowadays, it seems that poker is the big hot game.  With it showing up on multiple TV channels and poker columns showing up in the newspaper, it is not surprising that we would see some poker-based fiction.  Interestingly, however, Tim Powers was ahead of the trend with Last Call, written over a decade ago.

Last Call follows Scott Crane, a middle-aged man with troubles in the past, present and future.  In the late `40s when he was a child, he was targeted for a special sort of sacrifice by his father; he is saved at the cost of one eye and his mother's life.  Raised by his foster father to be a professional poker player, he gets involved in a strange poker version called Assumption.  Though he doesn't know it at the time, the result of this game will be the eventual sale of his body to be literally possessed by another.  Now, around 1990, his wife has died, he has descended into alcoholism and worst of all, it is soon time for his body to be assumed.

What follows is a complex tale of Scott trying to save himself with the assistance of his foster father Ozzie, his foster sister Diana and his neighbor Arky.  At stake, beyond just his own soul are the lives of his friends and family.  There is slim hope in the next round of Assumption, to be played at the same Lake Mead site as the previous game.  Done correctly, Scott may be saved, but he needs to calculate a winning strategy while others will also be competing for the immortal Kingship that is up for grabs.

While generally well-written, at times Last Call gets a bit confusing when dealing with the Assumption game and the powers involved with immortality.  Nonetheless, in a genre often filled with tired cliches, this fantasy novel stands out with its originality.  Overall, I'd think of this book as a full house:  it may not be the best, but it is definitely worth holding onto.
