In an age of pop up books and over stimulating books, Elsa Beskow books were a wonderful find for us. The illustrations are amazing- I think I will buy duplicate copies of some of the books and frame the pictures! Most of her books have one full page as a picture and the page opposite is the words. This particular book is longer then say.. the Little Old Woman but sometimes we just read 1/2 at bedtime if we are really tired. The story is very "real" in that there is a mom, dad and 4 kids (tom, harriet, sam and daisy. The kids play at the pond with the frogs like Boffo and Renata the bat, then their dad kills Vara the viper snake (we skip past that part as my son is not ready for that yet), then the boys learn never to harm forest creatures unless they mean them harm when they poke an ants nest and get stung. While they are picking berries the troll in the cave laughs at them and scares them away. They harvest berries and mushrooms and cotton grass and learn that everyone pitches in. The mother spins that into sweaters for them for the winter. Sometimes they dance with the forest ferries in the moonlight. The mother takes them to see Mrs. Owl who knows more about plants trees and flowers and teaches all the children of the forest. Winter comes and they put their heavy doors on and snuggle in their warm gear. They go for a sleigh ride drawn by a white rabbit/hare in the snow. They share their food with other creatures who don't have enough in the winter. They sit by the fire and listen to their father tell stories about when he was a little boy. Spring comes and the birds sing and newborn creatures are all about and they also get a new brother of their own too!  Awesome tale
