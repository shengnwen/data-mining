I've studied flower essences for over ten years. I own several books on flower essences + animals, and this is in the top four. I use it all the time for my several cats.

However, I am giving this book only four stars. As nice as this book is, it is limited to ONLY Bach's original 39 flower essences mainly from England. Nowadays, flower essences are much more than the first 39, including flowers from North America (Northern California, deserts of Arizona and New Mexico, Hawaii, Alaska, Florida); Scotland; Australia bush; New Zealand; South Africa; South America; Central America; to mention a few. Bach died young in 1936, leaving his work unfinished, and many people in the last 70 years have taken up where he left off, much expanding the number and quality of essences (depending on where in the world the flowers are indigenous).

Frankly, books on Bach's first 39 flower essences are so ubiquitous that I now avoid them in favor of books covering flower essences from other parts of the world besides England. Plants of England are not the only plants in existence! I am REAL tired of books getting published involving only Bach's original 39 essences. Even though Bach "bumped into" his first 39 essences, Bach's essences are not the holy grail of flower essences! Look further afield than Bach's essences
