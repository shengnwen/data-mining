Edmund Gravel traverses through this quick but enjoyable read by Edward Gorey, including his great illustrations.  A bug-like creature leaps from Edmunds tea-cozy and takes him on a Dickens-like &quot;Christmas Carol&quot;-like journey.  The stories are sad, depressing, and amusing all in one.  Great holiday entertainment, and a great gift for the scrooge who has everything but this book
