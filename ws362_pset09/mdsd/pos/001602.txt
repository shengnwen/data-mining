THE WRONG MAN is the first novel I've read by John Katzenbach.  I thought it was a very effective thriiller.  Katzenbach is plainly a very skilled writer and I thought he did a very good job building the tension.  This is a good page-turner, albeit a slightly verbose one.  

The plot of THE WRONG MAN concerns a stalker who grows increasingly violent, eventually threatening the family of the young woman he's obsessed with.  This admittedly sounds like a very familiar plotline.  Indeed, the first 350 pages of this novel are relatively predictable.  However, for the last hundred pages, Katzenbach takes this plot into a direction that I did not expect.  Eventually, the family hatches a remarkably convulted and unethical plan that I will not reveal here.  I personally didn't find this plot development to be particularly credible at all -- I couldn't imagine such a plan working in the real world.

This is also a rather odd novel in that the three main characters are each experiencing a mid-life crisis.  Katzenbach devotes a lot of prose to their inner thoughts and emotions -- too much time, in my opinion.  I understand that Katzenbach is trying to make a point here about the emptiness of suburban, middle-class life, but this theme has been done to death. I eventually grew rather weary of these characters, who struck me as somewhat humorless and unhappy about their lives.   

Overall, though, THE WRONG MAN is a good literary suspense novel.  If you like this book, you might want to consider the work of Peter Abrahams and Joy Fielding, who write in a similar style
