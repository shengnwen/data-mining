This book is entertaining.  It is not as enthralling like other books Sheldon has written such as The Conspiracy Theory, The Stars Shine Down or Nothing Lasts Forever.  I found myself bored at times when reading this and then in a &quot;can't put it down&quot; mode at other times.  If you are a Sheldon fan, it is worth reading, but if you are new to this author try a different title first.  He is an exceptional story teller
