Should be required reading for many of the gutless politicians of the 
political LEFT ! As a Korean volunteer and veteran I appreciated the 
author's credibility and his expressions of the normal interaction with 
his squad members . It's a tough book but that's the job ! This case 
was plaqued by McArthur level screwups . Unfortunately , Truman did not 
know or remember his prior failures in the early years of WW II .

Good book for good young men . Fighting for our country is real and 
personal !  I bought it for my grandson , a 1st Lt. in 82nd Airborne .         Dick Jones
