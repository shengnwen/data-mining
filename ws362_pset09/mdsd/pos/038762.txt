I actually went to this site because I was looking to see if an Animal Miracles II was out.  This book was one I read to my children, ages 10 and 7, as well as on my own.  The cries of &quot;one more, please Mom&quot; warmed my heart.  My 10 year old son, who reads on his own quite well, always wandered into the room when I read this book.  I have recommended it to many of my adult friends to read to their kids and they have loved it too
