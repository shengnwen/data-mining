Eloquent, empassioned speech from the accused "self-loathing homosexual," Larry Kramer is a loud and urgent wake up call to the gay community to take responsibility for themselves and also to rally against the right wing conservatives who undermine them through religion and politics.

Kramer most vividly hits the nail on the head when he reminds us that his so-called activism isn't special or noteworthy: we should ALL take part in fighting for equal rights. Our own and those of others
