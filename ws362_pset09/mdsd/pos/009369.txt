Cloud Atlas is a complex and intriguing book. I titled my review, "Am I Smart Enough to Review this Book?" becuase there are so many levels, I am unsure where to begin a review. I, therefore, will keep my review basic.

This novel is constructed of six narratives who's characters are connected. Each narrative is begun and then cut off at a critical point. Mitchell builds the six stories from the time of Melville into the distant future and then completes each narrative closing the book where the first short would have ended. Each story is connected not just by the characters themselves but by the themes.

Mitchell is exploring our past, present and future through universal themes of what it means to be human and have humanity. He has a strong use of voice and the stories strongly hold your attention. The first time there is a break in the narrative you are very annoyed!!!

I think there is so much more that could be discussed with this novel. You could approach this novel to analyze: the comet tattoo, the theme of slavery, the structure of the novel as a muscial piece! There are so many opportunities for thought and exploration that again i don't know where to end or begin.

I personally enjoyed this book for its strength of narrative even though the first two narratives sounded very simliar for the most part and the future sections had a lot of sci-fi conventions. Mitchell can be forgiven for these small slips, if you can even call them that just simply for having the skills of creation. I even found I had to slow down and really read given the complex and consistent vernacular used in each separate narrative.  I would not recommnd this novels for everyone. You have to really want to explore. If you are up to the challenge. Enjoy
