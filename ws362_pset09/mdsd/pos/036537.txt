This book is radical and calls for fundamental change in our educational system.  I happen to agree!  No longer can we sit idley by and watch the power structure of our nation maintain status quo at the expense our children's future.  Kincheloe exposes the greed and motives of our inherently racist and classist system.  Cheers to Kincheloe for having the guts to point out our nations biggest flaw..... materialism and ambition for power
