     In the deep jungle of India there was a little boy name Mowgli. Mowgli is an Indian infant who is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan (the tiger) kills his family. Mowgli was raised by a pack of wolves and is taught the laws of life in the jungle. His closest friends were Baloo, (the bear) and Bagheera (sleek black panther). Mowgli learns how to speak to the animals his childhood seems pleasant. Shere Khan is a dangerous tiger that is seeking revenge on Mowgli. Shere Khan is the enemy and is feared among all of the animals in the jungle. Mowgli was taught there was a certain place in the jungle that he was forbidden to go to. Bagheera and Baloo are trying to teach Mowgli the Laws of the Jungle for his own good. They are having a difficult time with him because he is small and young. Bagheera is more concerned with Mowgli being on his own because he has not learned how to kill his own food. And they are worried that Shere Khan will come after Mowgli and try to kill him. Riki-tiki-tavi is a mongoose, a hunter, and a great fighter. Riki-tiki fought anything that came in his way, but when Nag and Nagaina (the cobra couple) approached him it was different. Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose's eyes grow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a little kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass.
     I really enjoyed reading The Jungle Book. Kippling had a great imagination, especially since Mowgli could talk to animals. I thought the characters were shown though their actions throughout the book. Rikki Tikki Tavi has always seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature.
