This was overall pretty well done, but not quite as spicy as I like. It was still worth reading and more exciting than some of the snoozers they have out. They just don't make them like Ann Rice anymore, do they? her 'Beauty' Trilogy is the best I have ever found. More recent is Nancy Madore's Enchanted, which is probably one of the best erotics I have seen lately
