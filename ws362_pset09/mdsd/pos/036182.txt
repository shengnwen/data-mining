I purchased this book on a whim 9 months before my wedding just to try to get myself in shape. I had never seen the TV show. I just wanted to get some help preparing my body for my wedding day.  I ended up completing the 6 month portion of this book with my two best friends (who were not getting married) and we all looked amazing at my wedding. We still talk about getting this book back out b/c we were the BUFFEST we had ever been after in just a short time with this book.  I recommend doing any exercise program with a friend.  This one definately made my evening workouts great! There is a lot of variety on what exercises you can do.  I even bought my friend who helped me get in shape for my wedding the Buff Mom's to Be when I found out she was pregnant.  I highly recommend this book if you don't belong to a gym and want your arms neck and back to look amazing in your wedding dress
