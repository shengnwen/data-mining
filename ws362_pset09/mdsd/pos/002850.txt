Excellent review of the war in the pacific. This story is long overdue. Hats off to Mr. Astor for the way he intermingled history with the personal stories of the courageous men and women who endured, fought and overcame an  extremely vicious enemy. Anyone who had a family member in the pacific  during WWII should read this book! Thank you Mr. Astor for a job well done
