This was one of my favorite books as a child!  I read this many times in the attic of our summer home, looking out the window at our apple tree.  I was recounting the story to my children the other day and we stopped in at Borders and I ordered the book.  I'm so glad it's still in print.  It's truly a great family-oriented read-aloud story - perfect for the younger set! My emergent-reader 1st Grader was able to read this with me
