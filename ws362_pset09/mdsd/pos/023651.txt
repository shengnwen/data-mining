Obviously the protagonist Carol wants more to life in Gopher Prairie. She wants culture and intelligence and witty conversations. Of course where can you find that now without paying a price. Even in the urban cities lies problems beneath the surface, I think Carol should learn to appreciate what she has much like the author who despised small town America. If you come from a small town, it does not mean that your mind is small. Of course, most people travel around the world seeking a utopia or paradise to call home. Carol represents the author's resentment and hatred toward his hometown. I thought it was funny that the author wanted a Pulitzer when he would receive literary's highest honor of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the first American to receive such an honor. Oh well, be grateful what you have and remember the grass may not be as greener on the other side
