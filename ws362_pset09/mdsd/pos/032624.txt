This is a wonderful young adult novel by Ms. Martin.  Belle Teal is a thought-provoking and beautifully told story of one child's experience with desegregation.  Belle is a strong female character who gracefully stands up for herself and her beliefs; a terrific role model for girls (and boys) learning to navigate a larger world in which people don't always agree.
