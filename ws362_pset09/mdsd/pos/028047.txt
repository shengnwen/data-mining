I read this book, here in Cearï¿½-Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I also like to read history's books.And this book is good to read.
The subject of this book is the relation, between USA, Mexico, Germany and Japan, in two firsts decades of XX Century.If this is history's book, the historical facts showed in this book are sometimes, comics or similar to absurds.Even so, this is a correct book.The failures of this book are small.To example, Woodrow Wilson went to be against Huerta, by racial prejudices or by economic reazons?
