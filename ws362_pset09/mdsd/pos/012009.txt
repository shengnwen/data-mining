Read it through in one sitting--very diverting with interesting characters and you even feel as if you're learning about American literature and academia along the way.  My only quarrel is some of the dialog--especially  the male characters is a little flat or even occasionally unrealistic.   Overall though very good and I plan to buy her next one in hardcover
