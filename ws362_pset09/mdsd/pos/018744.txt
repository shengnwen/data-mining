I'd rather dine out than in, and I hate to cook, but I like Laurie Colwin's style of writing, so I bought this book.  Even Ms. Colwin admitted that she bought cookbooks just to read them, but I'm sure she tried some of the recipes as well.  She described, by name, several cookbooks she had on hand, most or all out of print, and it made me wish I could read them as well.  To show how cleverly she turned a phrase, I was inspired to cook something and did!  I tried a recipe for bread that, when she wrote it, had me almost tasting it.  Alas, said bread did not turn out as hoped.  I had someone else (an experienced cook) try it as well, and it was somewhat disappointing.  No big deal.  I'd rather read than cook, anyway.
