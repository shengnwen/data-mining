This book followed the lives of about a dozen black men and women, each who migrated to one of three different areas in the US, during the great black migration.  The book has details of each persons life starting from  before they migrated, all the way untill they had been in the area for a  while.  The recent publishing date gives you up to date information on each  persons whereabouts at this point in time.  A very good, worthwhile read
