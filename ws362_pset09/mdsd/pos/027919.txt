If you have any desire to get a sense of what it's like to actually be a public defender, Dylan Schaffer's books are a must read. While the main character himself in this book and in Misdemeanor Man may not be typical of public defenders, the courtroom action is dead-on.

I Right the Wrongs is in turn funny, touching, and engaging. Schaffer has a writing style that truly grabs the reader. My only criticism, is really not. I can't pick up one of Schaffer's books when I don't have the free time to actually read it non-stop, because I generally lack the willpower to put it down.

I can't wait for the next chapter in Gordon Seegerman's career
