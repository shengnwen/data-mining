Ramez Naam does a good job previewing our future.  If you want to get beyond the alarmist neo-Luddite propaganda against biotech, stem cell research, and "cloning," this is a good place to start.  But the book does not address why these developments are good (as the author claims) and not bad (as Bush's "bioethics" czar claims).  Only a new worldview can do that.  And I strongly suggest "The ImmorTalist Manifesto" by Elixxir.  (Also available on Amazon) 

Instead of obsolete religious worldviews from thousands of years ago dictating our future, instead of 18th-19th century philosophies like Capitalism or Marxism, we need a new worldview which interprets our new world.  Of course, beware that every new idea starts as heresy.  And The ImmorTalist Manifesto, while the companion to this book, is new wine, and strong indeed.
