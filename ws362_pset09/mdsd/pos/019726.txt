I am a Japanese Historian and I feel that Sheridan Prasso does a good job explaining the myths.  She writes very effectively in this book describing the stereotypes. I truly enjoyed reading it for what she intended the reader to get out of it.

I did find some mistakes in the book and feel that she clearly could have researched this better.  My one true example is when she mentions the TV miniseries Shogun and states that Toronaga was Mariko's husband.  Lord Toronaga was her master.  Lord Buntoro was her husband.  He was the one that beat her and tried to impress/intimidate Blackthorne by shooting arrows from inside to a post outside.  Anyone who has seen this movie clearly knew that he was her husband.  So I found that disheartening that she did not research this better.

There were a few other points that I felt like her comparisons were a little bit off but as I stated in the beginning this was a good book
