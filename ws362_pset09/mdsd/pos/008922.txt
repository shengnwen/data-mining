     I read this decades ago, when I was barely more than a child.
     It is a brief volume. I recall that I burned through the first 50 pages before I even realized what was going on. Then I had to start over from the beginning so that I could really begin to appreciate it.
     This is a novel that fulfills all the usual requirements of a novel. But just not in any of the usual ways of a novel. There is poetry in it. And ideas. Ideas that shed light on ideas. And ideas that shed light on ideas, and maybe on people, but definitely on ideas. 
     If you want something different, but not painful, then this might be it. But it wants to make you think, as Calvino usually does, so it might seem a little bit boring or tedious until you make the effort to try to understand. 
     There's trying, and there's succeeding. All you have to do with this one is to try. Whether or not you succeed doesn't matter. If you just try, you'll have fun.
     Or at least that's what I recall from decades ago when I still expected greatness in this world.
     YMMV,
