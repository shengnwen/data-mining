How sad to hear this author passed away; I believe this is his only book in print. If so, what a nice legacy to leave for us. While an enjoyable and touching read for all, I suspect this book will have greatest impact on those wrestling with, or in the process of, coming out. Fox captures the frustration and insanity of dealing with such a process while still in high school. In the 1960s, no less, which, while certainly more tolerant than previous decades, still had a ways to go on gay awareness & acceptance. (By the way, we still have a ways to go  even now, in this post-millenium decade). Framing the book around RFK's asassination heightens the drama. Cleverly, it also draws in those who are old enough to recall that dark day, because that is a time we don't forget easily. I don't want to comment further on plot, as this is a short book, and I don't want to give anything else away; suffice to say this is an enjoyable, well-written book, and if you like coming of age, coming out stories, this is a great one to choose
