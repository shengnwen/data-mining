The book is entitled American Cichlids I - Dwarf Cichlids.  You won't find  any African cichlids here, but you will find an in-depth useable reference  for Apistos, the various dwarf acaras and checkerboard cichlids, etc. Much  easier to read than the Mayland &amp; Bork book, although that one is  slightly newer and covers more Apistos, more in depth
