An unbiased look at the kingdom of darkness in action thru the eyes of a shaman in the amazon.Carefully read how the people are manipulated ,taught to kill, kept in fear and desperation by these spirits. Also carefully read how that changes as first one; then more villages accept the influence of yai pada (the father who loves them thru Christ His son). More real info on spiritual warfare here than almost any written just on that subject. Absolutely explodes the contention of many that there is no devil or evil influence in this world
