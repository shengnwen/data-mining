I dont agree with some people here saying that this book is a repetition of Phantoms in the brain. Rama introduces many new concepts here. Though he also mentiones many concepts he explained in Phantoms.

Ofcourse, one issue is that the book is more speculative(less rigorous) than Phantoms, and Rama readily accepts it. But given the nature of the subject, its a bit harsh on the author if each concept is expected to be rigorous.

Anyway, the topic, irrespecive of it rigorousness, is so exciting that, I even enjoyed the speculations of Rama.

I am expecting to see more in his new book "The artful brain
