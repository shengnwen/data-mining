There isn't another commonly available resource of this type that I know of and I have found it very useful. You don't get very far into Arabic before you learn the joys that are the hollow verb (those with a long vowel in the middle) and the defective verb (those that end with ya or alif maqsura) not to mention the shuffling short vowels between present and past tense. My textbook (Ahlan wa Sahlan) conjugates only a small representative few in the index so I really needed a reference such as this.

As you can guess from the title, this book takes 201 verbs and conjugates them in Active and Passive voice (where relevant) giving these forms:

1.) Past
2.) Present
3.) Subjunctive
4.) Jussive

As well as providing the imperative, active and passive participles, and the root-very handy for beginners dealing with quadriliteral verbs. Each verb is provided along with a brief definition. No, it's not as thorough as a dictionary but that's what Al-Mawrid is for, right? 

I liked the selection of verbs (I was very happy to see that the verb for "to see" was included), the index that listed the type of verbs (e.g. verbs with initial hamza, verbs with final waw, etc.) and the printface is legible and of decent size. Compare with the Hans Wehr budget print dictionary and you'll appreciate how nice this is. They also clearly provide all short vowel markers which aren't always in dictionaries.

The biggest complaint is, as other users have stated, there is no index of the specific verbs provided as examples. As I've looked them up, I've started just writing them in the index but this is messy. I'd also think some brief explication on how to create passive, subjunctive, etc. would be a good addition but perhaps that is beyond the intended scope.

If you have a particular verb type that really confuses you-defective verbs give me fits-then this reference will definitely be helpful
