I first came across this "story" in a college engineering class where the instructor showed the film strip, early 1960's. 

Much later I came across the actual book; I didn't even know it was in print. Since then I have given away as many as 20 or more copies. 

I contemplate who will become good friends by how they react to this book... if they don't "get it", we have little chance of becoming close friends.

It's a great visual story for adults, probably more so than for young kids
