We try to visit DC every couple of years, and next time we were thinking of paying for one of those guided city tours.  We don't need the sites pointed out to us, but those tour guides always seem to have good information and anecdotes about the sites that you don't hear anywhere else.   I thought that maybe we could save a couple hundred dollars if we could find a book that has that type of information.  I bought the Unofficial Guide to Washington, D.C., and I also checked out the Frommer's Guide.  They were very informative, but they didn't get me excited about any of the sites.  They were pretty much just reference books (with very limited photos).  However, when I opened up the Eyewitness Travel book, I was blown away.  The color photos and color floor plans/cutaways of the buildings are outstanding.  It really got me interested in places that I wouldn't have thought twice about if I had read just a text description.

The book also tells about the history of certain places and tells you what to do and where to go on three guided walks.  It is a gourgeous and entertaining book that doubles as a tour guide (only cheaper).  To keep up with the other guides, it also includes hotel and restaurant information.

I am not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about.  I find it funny how some people politicize everything that they see, hear or read.  I am into history, not politics, so this book was exactly what I was looking for
