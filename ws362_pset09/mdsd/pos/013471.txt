&quot;Cocaine Nights&quot; is a return to Ballard's psychological preoccupations. We're ushered into the quintessential Ballardian scenario: the microcosmic &quot;culture&quot; of the wealthy and retired. We quickly learn that all is not well, and follow the quasi-hard-boiled narrator as he succumbs to the community's visceral core. Bloody and provocative, &quot;Cocaine Nights&quot; is an excellent compliment to Ballard's other &quot;landscape&quot; novels (&quot;Crash,&quot; &quot;High-Rise,&quot; &quot;Concrete Island&quot;), in which he plumbs the apocalyptic interface between desire and environment, turning the psyche inside-out with the steely objectivity of a lab tech. &quot;Cocaine Nights&quot; is vintage Ballard psych-noir and won't disappoint
