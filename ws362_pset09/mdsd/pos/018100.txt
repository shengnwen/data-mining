This is a vey easy book to read written by Jack LaLanne's wife Elaine. The first half of the book gives you the lowdown on all the different foods. Here you will find the benefits of certain fruits and vegetables, what to do with the pulp etc.I for one don't have the time to use the pulp to make goodies  but usually use it in my vegetable recycle bin in the yard that gives me the best mulch. There is also a suggested improvement section, such as best juices for seniors, young people, detoxification etc. The second half of the book gives you all the juice recipes . Some of the combinations sound gross but surprisingly some of those actually turned out to be great tasting. A few years back I got a juicer and incorporated juicing, especially during summmer into my diet(not to be confused with going on a diet) and found this book had some great suggestions. Since it is not always cost effective to juice I only do it on occassion. Anyway, here you have it, everything you need to know about juicing and it's benefits. Jack LaLanne has to be doing something right, right
