This work is considered a great twentieth- century masterpiece. Written in 1931 when Canetti was twenty-six it is the story of the booklover and Sinologist Peter Kien who lives alone with his twenty- five thousand volumes until he is deceived and marries his housekeeper the sixty year old Theresa who he mistakenly believes will preserve his library when gone. 
The book is written with a kind of ferocious descriptive clarity, and it goes on to tell the story of Theresa's conspiring with the fascist concierge of the building to disposses the distinguished professor, and send him reeling through a hellish world of dispossesion ending in madness and death. 
The work is taken to be a parable of the self-destructive quality of a life devoted to intellect alone. 
However the writer succeeds far too well in portraying the coldness of obsession, the inhumane character of life by mind alone.
And there is something grotesquely unreal, unsympathetic , not simply in the relations of the characters to each other but in the whole feeling and tone of the work itself.
This work has the feeling of having been written by a person with a very hard heart indeed. 
Canetti in a small subsequent work wrote of Kafka, and one can see the same strange quality of human detachment in both writers. However the world of Kafka is so much richer in human feeling in fear, and even in sympathy that there is to my mind no comparison. 
Canetti in pillorying an exclusive reliance on intellectual brilliance , it seems to me, is describing first and above all himself.
