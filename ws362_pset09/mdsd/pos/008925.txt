I enjoyed every page of this book.  It is certainly one of the most informative books on the faerie realm I have ever read, packed not only with facts about each kind of elemental but also exercises to help the reader easily make contact with faeries.  And I admit I cried off and on throughout this book as well.  I dearly love all faeries and elementals, and it is easy to see the author has a heart for them too.  If you feel the same, you will find this to be a very special book.  One I highly recommend, since it has enriched my life in many ways
