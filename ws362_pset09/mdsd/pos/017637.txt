Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "A man is what he thinks about all day long..." We are...we really, really are. But the sad fact of the matter is, most of us do not really know what we are thinking. In fact, I would say that most of us aren't really thinking at all. Most of us are just operating on unconscious reactions to things. 

Does this make your butt twitch?
Does this make you a little nervous?

It should...but...don't get too nervous...don't go too much in a panic. If there is something from this review that I want you to remember the most, is this: 

WHAT THOUGHT HAS DONE, THOUGHT CAN UNDO!!

Think about this for the next 25 years of your life. Meditate upon this powerful Truth. Who you are is simply the residual effect of what you have thought about in the past. This is is a new day! This is a new opportunity for you to turn EVERYTHING around! If you have been ill or sick, now is your time to claim health and wellness. If you have been experiencing lack or limitation, now is the accepted time to claim wealth and abundance. You see, the universe never holds anything back from you. Never! There is only a stream of well-being in the universe...you just need to come into alignment with it...and we do this with our thoughts...we do this with our feelings...we do this with the images we are holding in mind.

Think about only that which you desire to attract. Feel the feelings of how it would be to have those things you want to attract. Imagine having those things, those experiences, that beautiful, abundant, healthy, well-lived life now! And I guarantee that you will! It is always done unto you as you believe.

This book is incredibly inspirational and so well worth it. The book, however, won't change your life. Only you can do that. And I happen to believe that you can!

Know that this is your day. You are a blessing!

Peace & Blessings, dear reader..
