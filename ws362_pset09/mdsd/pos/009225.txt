I am really enjoying reading this book.  The informative passages preceeding each recipe give some insight into the origin of the recipe and alternative ways to prepare and serve.  I usually put post-it notes on each  page that holds a recipe I want to prepare, but this book is just packed  with goodies so I won't bother with the post-its.  I particularly liked the  traditional French recipes.  Also, I feel that the methods used are  relatively simple and easy for the average cook to execute, which is a  tribute not only to the quality of Boulud's ability as a chef but also as  an author.  A lot of chefs' cookbooks get knocked (and mostly justifiably  so) for being too complicated or esoteric for the layperson to relate to  and use, but this chef's cookbook is the delicious exception to the rule.   I thoroughly recommend this book
