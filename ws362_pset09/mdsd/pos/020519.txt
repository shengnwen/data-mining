I saw The History Boys on Broadway.  I could tell the play was fabulous, very funny, with exceptional actors.  People were laughling and the little I heard was entertaining.  I was sitting in the last row on the far right of the mezzanine,  Now I have ringing in the ears, so my hearing is not the best.  So afterwards I thought I would buy the play and chuckle about it to myself.  Then, according to the Playbill, I'd go to the movie that's already been filmed with the original cast.

But first I I bought and sent the play to the woman who went to the play with me. She couldn't hear it either.   I get it when she's finished with it.  But I do know enough to recommend the play itself, the script and I hope
the movie.  Do something, at least one of the three, don't miss it
