Robert F. Williams is a man who is forgotten in most histories of The Civil Rights Movement. He talked and practiced self-defense before Malcolm X became a household name. He represented the militant leadership that was to follow him in the form of SNCC and The Black Panther Party. He correctly showed the limits of integration and why everyone could not turn the other cheek.A must buy book
