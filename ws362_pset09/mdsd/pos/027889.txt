This book is fabulous if you are looking for a historical survey of Gothic which does not lose itself in the labyrinth of feminist theory.  However, I think Botting spreads himself a bit too thin in attempting to cover works  like Gilman's &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; in one sentence.  I loved  this book for bringing out the evolution of Gothic from early works to the  present
