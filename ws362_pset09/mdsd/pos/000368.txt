Many of the self help books today are like fast food.  Made for easy consumption.
I guess that is why The Law of Success was such a pleasant surprise.  It has some real meat to it. So much so that it has taken me three weeks to digest just the first two volumes of material on the 17 Laws that are presented in the first two installments.
This volume covers the first four lessons of the 17 principles that make up The Law of Success.

Self-Mastery is engaging enough to make me continue on to volume II as well as order volumes 3 & 4.  Hard to believe it was written so long ago but yet is STILL so relevant to today's business environment.

The 4 questions on Definiteness of Purpose were the best part.  They are as follows:
1.  Have you decided upon a definite goal in life?

2.  Have you set a date for reaching that goal?

3.  Do you have a specific plan for achieving your goal in life?

4.  Have you determined what definite benefits your goal in life will bring you?
