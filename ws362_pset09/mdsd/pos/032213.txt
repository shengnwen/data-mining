Although many readers have commented on Elizabeth (a truly captivating character), her husband Isaac has been given short shift. He appears in one of the book's most poignant scenes as he straightens up after the Rosh Hashana dinner and, in an act of private accounting, chastises himself for his reluctance to support his wife in her desire to open a store. Analyzing his failings with the same critical eye he might bring to a scholarly text, Isaac then resolves to mend his ways. This scene is almost unsurpassed in its portrayal of a tender and intensely religious Jewish sensibility (surpassed, in my reading, only by Chaim Grade in the closing section of the second novella in his magnificant  "Rabbis and Wives").
