Mr. Fisk presents a point of view seldom seen in the US. He questions the wisdom of trying to spread Western-style democracy in countries that in some cases are not really countries at all (e.g., Iraq), an opinion that is a total anathema in the US. What, democracy is not the best form of government? Only if the country can really do democracy. 

I also appreciated his description of the Iran-Iraq war. It is important to remember that the US supported Saddam Hussein for a long time. That's why, I think, he thought he could invade Kuwait: his "friends" wouldn't interfere. And we wouldn't have, except the Bush I administration realized that Saddam would then have control over a very large portion of Middle Eastern oil. If we had stayed out of the Iran-Iraq war, or even acknowledged that Iraq was the aggressor, then we would not be in the position we are in now, with Iran having little to lose in continuing its development of nuclear capability. 

I thought Mr. Fisk's reportage on the bloody aspects of war and what war actually does to a populace was appropriate and important. Here in the US we are eager to believe that no civilians will be harmed during bombing campaigns. However, I have to admit that I decided not to read the chapter called "Betrayal," which dealt with the aftermath of the first Gulf war when we encouraged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam, and then we abandoned them. I just couldn't bear it. 

Mr. Fisk does have a particular point of view that many Americans do not share, but he does an excellent job of revealing events and consequences that we in the US don't want to face. He is an eloquent writer and deserves a wide audience.

I give this book four stars instead of five because it is overwhelming. Perhaps it could have been two books. But it is nonetheless excellent
