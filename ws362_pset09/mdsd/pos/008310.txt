If you're a teacher, you need this book!  What a great tool.  I've taught both intermediate elementary grades and middle school, and I can tell you that this book gives so many useful tips and strategies to help those struggling readers we all have in our classrooms.  ALL of Janet Allen's books are worth buying and reading.  I have all of them and constantly refer to them for ideas or reminders.  I do not joke when I say that several of the pages in her book are folded down, as a way to remind me that there is something incredible to remember on that page.  Her book recommendations are great too.

Another reason this book is so amazing is that Janet Allen is honest.  Not all of her strategies work every year.  We all know that we don't get carbon-copy classrooms every year and have to modify and tweak our instructional strategies to reach our students.  That's the beauty of Allen's books, you can adapt them to how they fit best with your class.

If you like this book, buy "Words, Words, Words" and "There's Room for me Here" as companion-pieces to "Yellow Brick Roads."  Great reading, and worth your while!!!
