     There are books on plague, smallpox and even typhus; the worst of them all, according to Zinsser, who has written a funny but fascinating 'biography' of the disease.  Typhus, Zinsser says, can first be traced to around the 1400's.  It thrives in conditions of war and chaos and has been a scourge to mankind ever since.  Only the second half of the book is completely on this disease, though.  Readers taken by other microbial bad guys may find them discussed earlier.  I believe most will eventually find this book worth reading.

     The weakest section is certainly the first few chapters, up to about page 30.  Here I must confess to not knowing what our author is talking about at all.  He attempts to justify his book, and goes on to write page after page of nonsense.  Whatever he is saying, I am sure the 'biography' would have been better without it
