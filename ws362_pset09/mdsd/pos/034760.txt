The difficulties of writing about trauma, about the limit cases in violence like genocide, especially for the historian occupying the perpetrator's subject position have been frequently explored and acknowledged by the scholarship on the Jewish Genocide. Akcam is a Turkish historian who for the first time overcomes these difficulties with amazing grace and brushes the painful history of the Modern Turkey against the grain with scholarly balance, honesty and moral responsibility, despite the 90-year old Turkish State denial of the Armenian Genocide during which about a million Ottoman Armenians perished. Akcam's book can be considered as the critical history of Modern Turkey since it meticulously `works through' the irrecoverable loss of the catastrophe that buried Eastern Anatolia into darkness since 1915 and especially since it underlines the links between the Armenian Genocide perpetrated by the Young Turk regime during the Great War and Modern Turkey with abundant historical evidence. In that respect, "From Empire to Republic" opens up the possibility for us the Turks to start `mourning' not only for those Armenians who were massacred during the genocide of 1915 but also for those who suffered the consequences of the 20th century's first ideologically motivated genocide pulling their lives all over again in the deserts of Syria. In the final analysis, Akcam's contention that Turkey is currently going through a second nation-building process that resembles its experiences at the beginning of the 20th century (p.116) is thought-provoking and underlines the urgency for the young Republic to come to terms with its past. I strongly recommend From Empire to Republic to those Turkish citizens who are willing to open up their hearts and minds to this `unofficial' account of 1915, which attempts to rescue the `truth' from the hands of the retired diplomats of Turkey who have succeeded in passing as `historians' during the last 50 years, to all human rights scholars, to anyone who is interested in reading a balanced account of the Armenian Genocide and finally to all writers of trauma belonging to the perpetrators' side
