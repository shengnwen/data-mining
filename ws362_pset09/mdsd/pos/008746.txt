This book was very well written.  I enjoyed all aspects of this book.  It had its parts that would make me cry, and its parts that would make me laugh, but the whole story was intriguing.  The way the author wrote it so that each individual character had their own way of speaking and their own unique dialect made it easier to relate to one or more of the characters.  I found myself sympathizing with all the characters at very different times.  I felt as though the girls' father was no only a bad man, but one who made excuses for the cruel and inhumane things that he did to his own children.  If I were the main characters friend, I would probably have asked someone for help, or gotten help for them myself.  One other thing I liked about the book was the fact that neither of the girls had mothers.  This shows very well that it doesn't matter the color of your skin or the amount of money in your pocket, all people are equal and can have the same problem or conflict, but each person has their own way to deal with it
