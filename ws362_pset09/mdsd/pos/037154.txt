When G. K . Chesterton published The New Jerusalem he was called an anti Semite. He denied it but after reading the book it's pretty clear that Jews were not his favorite people. He refers to the poor newly arrived immigrant Jews as tacky to the point of hideousness and showered contempt on the sophisticated fully assimilated upper class London Jews. He even goes as far as to opine that had a great disaster had befallen England during Benjamin Disraeli's years as prime minister, Disraeli (because he was Jewish) probably would've sailed off to America or somewhere else without a thought for England. That's harsh. 

Chesterton also had sour things to say about Orthodox Christians. His comments on the religious Jews of Jerusalem are a little kinder or at least less mean but his only real admiration seems to have been for the Muslims of what was then called Palestine. He seems to have viewed them like we view wild lions today. You can't help but be awed by the beasts but you also know that if that they're dangerous. 

Finally, this cold, gloomy book makes a startling prediction that has, alas, come horribly  true. Chesterton bluntly stated that the area known as Palestine  was  hopelessly divided if a Jewish state was ever established there the local Arabs would fight it.

 Please don't come to this book looking for the cuddly fellow who wrote the Father Brown stories because he is not here.
