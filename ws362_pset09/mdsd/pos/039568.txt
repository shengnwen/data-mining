This is a wonderful version of the classic story of the "Three Little Kittens".  The artwork in this book is very colorful and detailed and exactly right for young children.  My son (just turned 3) loves this book and must request it (we just got it) 6 times a day.  The only other thing that he shows this much enthusiasm for is Thomas the Tank Engine.

His older sister (5) and I like it too, principally because of the funny details in the background and because of the amusing expressions on mama cat's face.  

Some of Paul Galdone's best work.
