After reading this book you will be hooked on Rice's vampire books.
A real page turner. Her descriptions are excellent. You will really enjoy it. It's not like those horror books that are like car accidents where you don't want to know what is going to happen next but can't put the book down. This is very tastefully done. Highly recommended
