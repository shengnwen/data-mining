I've referred to this book on many occasions over the years. Now working on my second degree, several classmates and a professor have used it as the basis for discussions on family stress.  It covers a variety of topics and the resulting ramifications. The topics apply in all life situations and allow you to see families in a whole new light. An easy, yet very informative read. Working toward my first degree, it was the only text I read cover to cover.
