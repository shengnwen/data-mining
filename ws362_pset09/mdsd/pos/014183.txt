After our family's disappointing first trip to Disney World in 1997, we decided to purchase the Unofficial Guide to WDW before our next trip in 2001.  What a difference a plan makes! In fact, we purchased another book before our Disney vacation in 2004 and again this year for our 2007 vacation. 

By using the advice from the Unofficial Guide we were able to make the most of our time at Disney.  We rode the rides we wanted to ride, got priority seating to dine when and where we wanted to eat, (including Cinderella's Table), and saved money. 

If you don't read this book, you will not know, what you don't know, about WDW. It may sound like fun to go to Disney without a plan, but from experience, I promise you that you will leave Disney very disappointed.   I've seen the families that didn't plan: hot, red faced, screaming kids, screaming angry parents, and everyone exhausted. They leave Disney having spent a fortune and can't think of a thing that they enjoyed the entire trip.  Don't let that be you! Buy this book and read it at least 6 months before you go to Disney and BEFORE you make your reservations!
