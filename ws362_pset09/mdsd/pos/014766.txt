This fantastic writing duo has continously given readers awesome fantasy epics for awhile now. Even though I personally believe their first 2 trilogys are the best, they have still come out and given solid fantasy epics with each teaming up they do.

If you like rich fantasy-based worlds, full of fun and interesting characters, then these two writers deliever the goods
