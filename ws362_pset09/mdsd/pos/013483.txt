In her riveting, intensely researched book, Burn Unit, Barbara Ravage draws the reader into the painful and perilous world in which the seriously burned exist. One qualifies for this world in a flash and once there, life can never be as it was. We follow two families to Mass General's superior Burn Unit, learning in fascinating detail what a separate world it is. Everything in this book is so finely drawn, from the family members suddenly faced with their own conflicting emotions, to the exquisitely-trained hospital personnel, to the description of the burns themselves. Ravage has written a compelling book about a little-understood subject.  It's a book one cannot easily turn away from.
