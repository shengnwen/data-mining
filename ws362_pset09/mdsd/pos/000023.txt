If you liked Moore's earlier works (especially 'Soul Mates'), or you are entirely new to his writing..there is something of wisdom and insight for everyone in this magical volume. As is true of Moore's other, related books, they invite you to a smorgasboard of ideas, knowledge and observations. You can pick and choose, take or leave, as you like. Whilst some of his chapters are slightly 'academic', there are many aspects to his interpretations that have perfect relevance to, and resonance with our own, everyday experiences. 'Intimacy within intimacies'-this book is like the candle we hold to the dark window, as we wonder how we might feel less alone in this world. It is a guide only. However, worth the journey and the read. Even if, a little indulgence does certainly go a long way
