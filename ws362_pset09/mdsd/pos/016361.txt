My boyfriend and I recently moved the the city.  Both of us had visited Chicago multiple times and knew the very basics but realized we needed more guidance in navigating the streets and making our way through the maze of information we were finding online regarding apartments and neighborhoods.  The Not for Tourists Guide was the best investment we have made since deciding to move (excluding the fantastic Bucktown loft we ended up choosing).  Although the simple, and usually cheesy, neighborhood descriptions leave something to be desired, this guide was extremely helpful in figuring out the basics of each area of the city.  When searching for places to live, it was great to be able to pinpoint the location on the clear and detailed maps and know exactly how far each prospective home was from grocery stores, banks, shops, restaurants and L stops.  (Of course nothing was more valuable than actually seeing the neighborhoods...for which the NFT Guide was extrememly helpful while plotting our route.)  We still keep the guide within reach while exploring new parts of the city...and it has saved us multiple times while trying to find alternate routes around crazy traffic flow.  

If you are a native Chicagoian, you will certainly find that this guide is missing some of your favorite spots...but isn't that being a local is all about? This guide my not predict the places you will love the most, but for those who are still trying to discover their very own Chicago, it will at certainly help you find your way
