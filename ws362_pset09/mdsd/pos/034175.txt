The first essay begins with an obscure reference to a former pupil who, "in those few fleeting moments of ecstacy during my office hours instilled in me enormous feelings of guilt because so much blood rushed from my neo-cortex in her presence that I knew then I would change my academic specialty from Etruscan Art in Etruria to Etruria and its Etruscan Art" and then concludes with, of all things, a clarion call for Anschluss with Canada.  Strange.  The essay on Mussolini was brilliant, hampered only by the author's insistent mis-spelling of Mussolini's first name ("Young 'Bonero' earned early for himself a reputation as a pugnacious little turd, although he was an above average speller!")

A weird book from the weirdos at Oxford.  They've done it again! I only wish I could do it again.  Just once
