I was very pleased with this songbook.  My family enjoys Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, and I was happy to find this book so I could play the songs at home.  The arrangements are easy enough for a very beginning pianist to play and still sound good; yet a more accomplished improviser could easily embellish on the notes provided.  The book contains quite a number of songs, so the musician and fan alike can find plenty of his or her favorites.  We recommend the book
