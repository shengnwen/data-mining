First of all people should understand that this is from the ADULT Fairy Tale series.  Thus the themes are adult oriented and require a mature state of mind.  Read Ms. Windling's intro at the beginning, fairy tales were historically NOT aimed at children and have only been pushed that way by Disney.  And yes it is a dark and not all that happy tale.  It shows what happens in a rigid society where the haves can get away with anything and everything and those who don't have anything have to do horrible things just to survive.  It also illustrates what happens when women are devalued and seen as property in society.  That is a warning all women should take heed of in our current times.
I give it four stars and not five because the Demeter/Persephone tie ins were very weak and stretched at times
