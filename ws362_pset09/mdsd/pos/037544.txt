This book proved to be an extremely interesting read.  Not written in typical self-improvement genre, but more a scientific study.  I was entertained by it and found it both interesting and at times surprising.  It was a refreshing break from the more pollyanna viewpoint.  The last chapter disappointed me.  It seemed to deviate from the spirit of the book and I sensed the author bestowing his own dogmatic view point to culminate an otherwise good read
