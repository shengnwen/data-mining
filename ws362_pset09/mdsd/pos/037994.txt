John Stott's the cross of Christ is the most thorough examination of why the cross is crucial to Christianity I have ever read.  Whether you buy the idea that God's Son came to earth to take the just punishment for sinners or not you need to read this book to understand why this event is and has been so crucial to Christians for the last 2000 years.  

Stott examines the implications for Christ's death as well as alternative views in a charitable, but forthright manner.  In fact, I never even thought of all the ways people have looked at the meaning of Christ's death.  I leave this book with a lot to think about, and many new reasons to be grateful for my loving Savior.

This is a must read for all Christians and others who wonder, "Why do they think Jesus had to be crucified?
