The book is dense, but well-written and very educational. Dr. Geisst wrote a wonderful history of Wall Street from its early days of the late 18th century until the mid 1990s. Most of the colorful movers and shaker that Wall Street has seen throughout history are here and their exploits are lucidly, if not grippingly, described. From Geisst's accurate historical narrative it becomes clear just how speculative and wild Wall Street had been, until the Depression era regulations. This book is valuable for anyone interested in U.S. history, financial history, and world economic history. Pick it up today
