This book really rocked my world.  I had no idea what scam the Pharmaceutical companies had on us!  I think every woman should read this book.  Just becaus a doctor prescribes something for you does NOT mean it is good for you!  Quite the opposite - in fact.  I had to read the book twice, because the first go thru I was just shocked!
