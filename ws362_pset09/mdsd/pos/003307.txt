arthur machen is a great writer. his approach to his own material is calm, cold and scientific. sometimes it feels like a public servant writing a report (by that I am refering to his technical approach, like detective novels, this does NOT mean boring, it means details, objective considerations, etc), without passion. arthur machen most times only hints at what's going on, maybe letting some character come with a theory (this is what I mean by scientific). his style is suggestive. not being a passionate writer, machen doesn't carry you away, but he sure can make you believe his stories. his stories mostly dwells at one thing (a personality change, for example), making the story sometimes too boring. his greatest accomplishment is his stories about the little people, where there are many interesting stories
