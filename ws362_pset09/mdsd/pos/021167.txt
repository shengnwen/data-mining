I just received my kit and I cannot be more pleased.  At first glance, the companion book appears interesting, informative and well written.  The cards feel comfortable in my hands and shuffle easily.  The card stock is quite sturdy and should last through years of heavy use.  The art itself is something to behold and it really speaks to me.  I am an animal lover so this deck looks like it will fit my needs perfectly.  At this point, I cannot find anything to dislike about this deck.

I've been reading tarot for many years and I can safely say that this deck looks like it will soon become my favorite.  I give it my highest recommendation.  I'll post an update after I've used it for a while, but at this point I want to thank Lisa Hunt for creating something that I feel deep within my heart will become a most cherished possesion and tool for reading.  

Ps.  I just love her representation of Mama Cocha as the Queen of Cups!
