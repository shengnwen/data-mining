I would recommend this book because it is funny fun to read. It tells a story about four six grader making it to the Academic Bowl and how they won against the seventh and eighth graders. Also how they were able to win the entire championship even  though they weren't the most popular. Also even though at first they may not have been friend ,in the end they became best of friend and made themselves into  the  souls. I could not put this book down because it was interesting to see what the character would do next and I was happy to read this book it had a great ending
