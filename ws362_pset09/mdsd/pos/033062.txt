I was of course a total skeptic at first until I started doing the exercises.  After a week I was totally amazed that I had lost one inch from my waist and one inch from my hips.  I have been on a plateau for 10 months and it took this exercise program to finally charge my metabolism at long last.... Thanks Jorge
