I really enjoyed this book - I read the liner notes for it, and it really was a great, read-it-one-sitting book. Dimple is a very believable character and you can see the reality of the world in the book. I love how they give each person's passions their own real life- like Dimple with her photography, and Karsh with his music. A lot of the description that is used is full of poetry, but without being poetry really at all - but it gives you that fluid feeling - that just really makes this a delightful read. 

I disagree on that one review about the way that they did the quotes... Yes, it was a little odd at first, but once you realize that the hyphens represent the dialogue- it wasn't that big of a deal. I actually liked that- because as a writer- I never realized that you could do that in a publication- think so out of the box on what's usually considered a literary rule. 

But even that little thing is a testament to the beauty of this book. 

It made me want to run out and buy a Sari, and find all the Indian people and ask them who they are, and learn from them.
