I really enjoyed this book.  Jenny McCarthy is very up-front and detailed about her pregnancy experience.  Which is a good thing - she has an excellent, irreverent sense of humor.  Reading this book feels like a conversation with a close friend.  McCarthy has been through all the good and bad sides of pregnancy.  When you read this book, you know that she understands what it's all like, and that makes you feel a little less scared about the whole thing.

My only real complaints are the length and the editing.  This book is way too short, and it also reads like it was written in a rush.  The tone is more like an email (lots of capital letters, poor grammar, clumsy sentences) than a professionally published book.  Still, at least it is genuine.  There is no doubt that this is what Jenny McCarthy really felt during her pregnancy.

Also, you may think that a blonde TV star and former Playboy Playmate cannot possibly understand how fat you feel during pregnancy.  But in Jenny McCarthy's case, you'd be wrong.  She started out skinny, sure, but she gained sixty pounds.  So she does really know what it's like to be horrified by the number on the scale.  That helps
