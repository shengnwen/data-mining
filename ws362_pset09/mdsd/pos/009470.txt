I've just begun to read this book.  I was assigned it for English class.   Usually, the books we are assigned are old and boring, and we have to  analize them until we hate the book with vengence.  This book is surrounded  in mystery and it acctually helps to analize it.  I suggest this book for  grades 6-10 as an introduction to a high school English class.  I enjoyed  it greatly and think anyone who reads it, young or old will enjoy it :
