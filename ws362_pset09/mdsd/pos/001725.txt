Hollywood is a cesspool of the worst of humanity.  Ego, greed, narcissim, hedonism, all of it strains into Hollywood the way lint ends up in the lint trap of a dryer.  People have a notion that society today is more corrupt than it was in days gone by but that is a myth. People were simply better at keeping it hidden in times past. Hollywood Babylon was a sensation when it came out for just that reason.  It drug out into the light of day what society had known all along - that Hollywood is society's septic tank.  And it's so damn fun to read about it.  

Even though this book is extremely dated and hashes out stories long ago brought out to the light of day, it still can be enjoyed from an almost historical perspective.  It will also put into perspective the notion that the society of today is more celebrity obsesses than it ever has been.  Even in its earliest days, Hollywood inspired fascination for the world.  There were plenty of gossip and scandal rags willing to dish the dirt in those days and there was plenty for them to dish.

This book is a great guilty pleasure. It's fun to read of decadance, murder, sexual picadellos, greed and wretched excess. Hollywood dines on its own young and this book bears that out in spades.
