We purchased this book a few weeks before we got our first dog, an 8-week-old Boston Terrier puppy.  The guidelines in this book were really helpful to us as first-time dog owners.  Our puppy is now a little over 12-weeks-old and she is already close to being fully house trained.  Even though this book and other books say puppies don't have full control over their bladder/bowels until they are 16-weeks, we have followed the steps in the book since the day we got the puppy.   And now she is almost fully house trained a month early.

I would recommend this book to any new dog owner
