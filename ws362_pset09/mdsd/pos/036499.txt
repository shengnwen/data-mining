I appreciate Maria Headley's memoir because she's intelligent, articulate, and insightful. She also doesn't shy away from a challenge, and I love that she kept such an open mind during her experiment to date everyone who asked her out. Once I picked up this book, I didn't want to put it down. I read it while I ate dinner, watched t.v., and brushed my teeth. As for those who disliked the book because Maria is too melodramatic and self-involved -- these are the kinds of people who write memoirs. The average non-celebrity has to be rather self-obsessed to pull off an interesting book about a year in her life. Ms. Headley did this with a lot of charm and wit
