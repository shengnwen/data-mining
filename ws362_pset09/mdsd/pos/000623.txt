To anyone interested in reading up on the earliest of heresies, this is the book for them! Heresy is when a post-baptized Catholic, in Christ, turns from the original teachings of the Catholic church of Christ, and decides to accept the man-made doctrines of other denominations by excluding the Sacred Traditions of our fathers (appointed by Christ).  The bible warns of man-made doctrines! Protestantism and it's branch offs, accepts man made traditions (ie. scripture only). In turning to these new, truly man-made doctrines, they have chosen to divorce the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church that is Christ's.  To be Catholic and then turn from it, is divorce.  Protestants of course allow members to divorce and remarry.  It's ironic that this is how their church was started.  Rather than staying in the marriage and fixing it, divorce is chosen.  However, Jesus promised HIS church to be one and united.  For those in search of the real truth, the true Church of Christ, one needs only to search the history of the first actual, physical church of Christ to accept the Sacred value of the Catholic Church traditions.  This book is just what the physician (Jesus) orders.  Find out where the traditions came from and how Heresies began. In this book, Irenaeus proceeds to list the succession of the Bishops of Rome to his own day!  He adds that &quot;in this order, and by this succession, the ecclesiastical TRADITION from the apostles, and the preaching of truth have come down to us&quot;   I say, the study of Church history, is the end of Protestantism!
