This book is witty and funny and exciting and merits a lot of attention. Filled with avatars of Apache culture heros and the creative/destructive Vulva Woman, the text is rich with wry humor. Where else will you find a  sexy elder woman spiritual leader whose long dead or absent husband was a  preacher named John Edwards. And the brothers, each a &quot;surviving  twin,&quot; babies she brilliantly gave different surnames to trick the  gods. Where else but in a Louis Owens novel will you find the hilarious  discussion of the establishment of an American Indian theme park, or a  wise-cracking ghost stuck in an acrylic wolf suit? And the ending of this  one is sublime, impressive in its incredible appropriateness, but a real  surprise, nonetheless
