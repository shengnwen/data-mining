Anya Seton takes you back into the world of 14th century England and makes it come to life.  Not only is the book entertaining, but it has quite a bit of accurate historical information.  It helped me out in some of my history classes, because it enabled me to imagine what John, Duke of Lancaster &amp; his son Henry Bolingbroke (King Henry IV), were like.  Seton brings her characters, both real &amp; fictional, to life, she makes you really care what happens to them.  The story of Katherine Swynford is one about a love that withstands marriage, children, murder &amp; death.  It also tells of how the people, both rich &amp; poor were effected by war, political alliances &amp; the plague. Yes, this is a rather long book, but it is well worth the read &amp; has something in it for everyone
