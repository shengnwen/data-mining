I really loved the Black Jewels Trilogy and was anxious to read Dreams Made Flesh, the follow up.  It's interesting that the book is separated into parts.  The first taking place after Heir to the Shadows, the second taking place before all three parts of the trilogy, and the last taking place after all three.  The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because I just did not like the way the last story in the book (Kaleer's Heart) took place.  I would have liked Janelle's story to end much differently.  I feel that she really should have retained all her power.  I just don't like that she was less than she was when we first began reading of her journey
