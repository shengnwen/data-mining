The tenth insight is the follw up yo the Celestine Prohecy by James  Redfield and follows again our unnamed adventurer on his coincidental quest to find the Tenth insight, however this Insight is not like the others, for it must come from within and is not written as the others were.
It follows our adventurer as he remebers his past lives and his "Birth Experiance" to rememember what his life( and humanities) purpose is. 
I was mostly impressed with the chapter dealing with remembering our future" and what our future holds for us including the "end times prohacies" I am a practicing christian and I can believe "most" of what Redfield presents here, I do believe in Heaven on earth, in other realms and the fact of the Afterlife, and I believe that Redfield may have presented the best theory of the rapture I have ever read. well worth the time and money
