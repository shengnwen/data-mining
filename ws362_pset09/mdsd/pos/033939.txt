Other reviews here have explained the content and value of this book very well.  I would add only that this work is important to the practicing astrologer because it does show how to focus on key elements of tension within the chart when a client seeks a consultation.  Most people seeking  astrological counseling for the first time are in some sort of crisis and need affirmation of and help with their experience.  Using many examples that are clearly explained, Mr. Tyl does a superb job of showing how to be as effective as possible without wasting time.  This work should be in every astrologer's library
