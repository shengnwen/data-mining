I am new to Pilates, but have an extensive background in yoga and other fitness endeavors.  I thought it was well worth the purchase price of this book to read Joseph Pilates' own words on his exercise system.

It provided great insight, that is timely even today, more than fifty years later.  Some of the material (especially in the second part of the book), is very dated, and modern science can refute some of his claims (i.e. the straight spine), but overall the book shows that Pilates was, as he himself suggested, "fifty years ahead of his time".

It is well worth seeing what the original system was envisioned to be by the creator, and then choosing an instructor who teaches from this foundation
