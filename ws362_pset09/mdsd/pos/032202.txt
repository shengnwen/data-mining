This book with over ten years since its last edition ranks #1 on my list of books for parents who are looking for names for their babies-on-the-way. It's very intuitively structured: Masculine Names and Feminine Names, ordered alphabetically, with the meaning or origin of the name, variant forms and contemporary examples where they apply. Although the book is been around far longer than most competitors, it has what it takes to be useful: not too fancy, not too cool, not wanting to have tens of thousands of names. Just plain concise, useful and focused on quality over quantity
