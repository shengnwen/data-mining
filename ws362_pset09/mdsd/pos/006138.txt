This is fun to read. The drawings are detailed and the writing is very well written. There are so many things that I learned by reading this book. It will make you say..."Why did I not think of that before." I have a very good amount of wood working experience and was pleased by how much knowledge this book dropped on me.

It will open your mind up to possibilites not just limited to Routers. Even if you have no plans to build any of the jigs, you will certainly learn to think about fabricating other things in your shop to make wood working more accurate.

At less than $12, its hard not to cough up the money for the many hours of reading and brainstorming you will get back from the book-
