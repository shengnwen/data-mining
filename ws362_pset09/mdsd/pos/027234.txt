If one reads this book in hopes of getting a fairly complete overview of art of the early Twentieth Century, they will not be disappointed.  However, if one is looking for something more in depth, with various examples of an artists oevure, then perhaps they should keep looking.  One  of this book's greatest virtues as an overview is that it does not assume a  great deal of knowledge of art on the part of the reader and is relatively  engaging.  However, images are few and far between and not always of the  best quality, which I find to be an integral part of an art historical  publication
