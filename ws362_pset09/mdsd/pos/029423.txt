An interesting book , in which allowances have to be made for the fact that it was first published in 1956 (I have just read the 1967 impression).
Keller outlines the historical backdrop to the Biblical narrative , while providing fascinating archaeological and historical evidence to prove that 'The Bible is right after all!', as the author writes in the introduction.
For those who claim that the book is discredited by how long ago it was written , the passage of time since then has strenghtned , not weakened the case for the Bible as history.


Part of the evidence presented by Keller includes Egyptian narratives that speak of similar events to those in the Exodus and Babylonian narratives that speak of similar events to those in the Bible narrative.
Keller writes of a Mesopotamian story about a baby in the bullrushes , and go's throught the plagues of Egypt describing how each one of them , with the exception of the death of the firstborn , is born out by phenomena in Egypt-each plague has a parrallel seen in Egypt. 
Further the author explores the phenomenon of manna in the desert , and how it has been collected in the Sinai by later explorers.
The age of Solomon and the biography of Cyrus the Great are explored.
It is interesting that in the Persian records Cyrus was to be killed as a baby on order of his grandfather but the would be executor had no heart for the deed.
Could the Allmighty have spared Cyrus for the task of letting the Jews return to Israel and rebuild Jerusalem
The book go's up the destruction of Jerusalem in 66 CE , before exploring various scientific phenomenon , which go to prove the truth of the Bible.
Interestingly gardeners and workers sometimes still find medallions with Roman descriptions in the soil of Israel today.
This book is a good primer to the subsequent works of this nature
