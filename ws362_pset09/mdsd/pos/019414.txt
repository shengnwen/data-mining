Super book! Easy to understand. Chapters on allergy, asthma, sinusitis, rhinitis, and lung disease. Great information on medications and how they work--but understandable, not over the head of the reader. Also enjoyed the alternative medicine chapter and understanding how stress affects breathing. This book helped me get back in control with my chronic allergies. I've learned WHEN to take medication and how they will work to stop swelling and mucus production. AWESOME
