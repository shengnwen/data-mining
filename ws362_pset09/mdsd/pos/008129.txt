I enjoyed these stories of fishing for striped bass from Maine to North Carolina.  The author describes many interesting people and his experiences fishing with them.  He covers virtually every method of taking striped bass from pedestrian fishing off the pier to donning a wetsuit and pursuing them both from the surface as well as below.

This is not a "how to" book, and it isn't deeply philosophical.  Other reviewers are critical of the lack of depth.  I don't share that criticism.  If you're a hard core striper fisherman maybe there's not enough here to satisfy you, but for the casual angler, this book was a great description of an interesting gamefish, the widely varied methods of pursuing it, and interesting (and somewhat unusual) people who pursue it.  This book reminded me of "Fish Fights" by Bob Rich, an excellent fishing book
