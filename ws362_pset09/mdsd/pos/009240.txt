This is a must have for anyone building a success library.  This book is strung together from several articles that Getty wrote for Playboy. Included are a review of his success in business and what is takes to be rich, his views on morals, and an indictment of what he saw as a deteriorating social structure of intolerance of any voice of dissent against the powers that be.

I really enjoyed this book whether it was regarding success principles that are directly talking about business and wealth or the other indirect opinions he shares about the world.  He was one-of-a-kind and his work here is really entertaining to read
