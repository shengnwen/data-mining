Despite the factual errors, this book is great.  Johnny Miller gives lots of great insight into the particular golfing style of many players of his generation, as well as the current group of top professionals.  One thing I found odd, though, was Johnny's unusual praise for Billy Casper.  Sure, Casper was good, but Johnny gushes over him like he was better than Arnold Palmer.  If you enjoy golf, you will enjoy this easy to read book
