The book was definitely interesting, and I learned many things about myself that I did not know.  However, the secret to happiness was not found in here.  Not sure if I went in looking for too much, but it seemed to me like just when he might have been going somewhere, it ended.

Very interesting facts about human nature and the brain though, and excellent quotes at the beginning of the chapters.  I'm definitely glad I read it though.  Had a very scientific feel to it, like there was proof for all the ideas.

He briefly touches on positive cognitive therapy (replacing unhappy thoughts with happy ones) as one of the ways to be happy, but doesn't go into too much detail.  I believe this is the most important.  The author Vernon Howard definetely helps out in this department.  Guy Finley's another one. All about awareness and enlightenment.

But it is worth reading
