William Buckley, long before Leo Strauss and Allan Bloom noted the crisis in the elite universities, decided to defend the honor of his school. Yale's founders and trustees needed to know that the new class of professors were subverting this institution of higher learning with a perverted form of modern liberalism. Departments and courses were being polluted with faddish social science. Classical learning was being dismantled.

Perverted is too kind a word for what was done to the post-war generation of college students, families paying for them and well-intentioned trustees.

Yale, like other old colleges and universities, had a Christian foundation. Its new and false defenders of "academic freedom" were rushing headlong away from an education that places God in the center and man's soul on trial.

Buckley was a young man with the backbone to take on the false doctors. This was a time when New Deal intellectuals could strut and bask in the afterglow of Roosevelt's policies. For high-flying American liberal, there were no real enemies to the left.

It takes a person of unusual foresight and mettle to call these professors on the jive they were starting to ratchet up on unsuspecting students and parents.

This book should inspire students who wake up and realize when they have professors with Anti-judeo-christian, Blame-America-First agendas
