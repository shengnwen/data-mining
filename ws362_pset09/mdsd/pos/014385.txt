This book is a good introduction to the field of discrete event simulation and the simulation language Arena in special. The first chapter of the book about the history of simulation the generic use of it and some future use.  The second chapter handles basic concepts of simulation as content of a  simulation model, events and randomness. In the rest of the book the  discrete event simulation language Arena is explained as a sort of  tutorial, using easy to understand practical examples.  Although I reckon  myself as a simulation expert I still use this book regular, thanks to the  appendixes in which technical stuff as probability, statistics and  distributions is explained, focused on the use in Arena, but also  applicable for other simulation languages
