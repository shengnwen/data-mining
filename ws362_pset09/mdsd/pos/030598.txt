As expected, this book includes lots of traditional and innovative shawl patterns, however its true value is that it is an instruction book for designing your own shawls.

Shawl construction is solidly covered (e.g. the many ways of creating a traditional Shetland shawl, which consists of a square centre, lace border, and lacy edging), and explicit suggestions are given for how to design your own (e.g. the designer suggests using patterns with repeats of 15 or 14 plus 1).  This is where things get interesting.  You'll need to pull out your stitch dictionaries, pencil and graph paper, because after you read this book, the urge to design your own shawls will be irresistable!

A side note: if you've bought one of the later reprints, you don't have to worry about errata.  If you have a copy from the original run in 1999, the errata can be found at the Knitting Universe web site
