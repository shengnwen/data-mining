Crouse's groundbreaking book on the 1972 Presidential campaign was reveolutionary in the way it covered the reporters who covered the election.  This was the first step in to turning these reporters into  &quot;stars&quot; in their own right.  Who can doubt today that the  visibility one gets from being a reporter on a successful Presidential  campaign can transform you into a highly paid and visible &quot;talking  head.&quot;  Crouse's book is well written, informative and quite amusing,  which is appropriate since he spent the campaign hanging out with the  immortal Hunter S. Thompson.  A must for political junkies
