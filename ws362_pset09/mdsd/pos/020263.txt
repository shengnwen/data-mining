 A Room with a View is a delightful novel by E.M. Forster.  Is is a bit of a romance and was probably realistic fiction in the time period in which it was written.  The main character is a young lady named Lucy.  Lucy and her cousin Charlotte have traveled to Italy, and they meet a lot of interesting characters in their hotel.  The Emersons are a middle-class father and son who offer to give up their rooms to the ladies because the rooms have wonderful views.  Lucy learns a lot in Italy about herself and upon returning home becomes engaged to Cecil Vyse.  The Emersons and Cecil have dramatic effects upon Lucy's life after she returns home.  She discovers conflicting love within her life, and she learns that home is a lot less perfect than she had always pictured it to be.  Lucy observes that ". . . even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about-religion-was fading like all other things."  Lucy struggles to find out who she is, what she wants, and if the rules of society are to be followed in all aspects of her own life.  Lucy finally discovers her beliefs and decides whether or not to follow the trends and manners of society.
I would rate this book relatively highly.  It is only two hundred and thirty pages long, but the language is difficult.  It is a good book because the reader can relate to the characters and because it is a romance, which most girls like to read.  However, there is quite a bit of philosophy, which makes it hard to understand and it is written in the language style of the nineteenth century.  I had to read some of the paragraphs multiple times to grasp their meaning.  Wrestling with the language is a good vocabulary and thinking exercise, however.  A Room with a View is a good novel to read, but the language makes it a lengthy and difficult book to understand
