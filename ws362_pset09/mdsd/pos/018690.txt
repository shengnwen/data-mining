I'm not a Bible scholar, so I'm basing my review on ease of use for the lay person.

This Torah was written to be very easy to read. The font is easy on the eyes, and there are plenty of footnotes.

I liked how the Preface explained the history of how this version came to be, and also the guide to using the footnotes.

This review is based on the paperback version. That version is very thick (1.5" - my pockets are not quite that big for this pocketbook version!), so I later bought the hardcover edition for easy reading while doing something with my hands, like eating.
