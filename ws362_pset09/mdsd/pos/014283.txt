I found Li's book excellent on several levels.  Firstly, there is the quality of her prose -- it's elegance and quiet power.  Secondly, there is the honesty coupled with a hard-earned candor which informs the entire book and keeps it anchored in the personal.  But, unlike many other memoirs I was struck by the deep wisdom Leslie Li brought to family matters and to the art and craft of writing a memoir.  There were passages were I was stunned by her insight not only about others, but also about writing about others.

Li creates an American girl who is more of many of us than even we know.  She also is a hybrid, and her status as such has given her  a unique of deep vantage point from which to write history and story.  Never does she allow polemic to take the place of the particular; never can we escape into caricature.  She forces us to see her, and those who made her in their complex humanity.

As with any book where one has fallen in love with those in it, I did not want the story to end.  Yet, I knew that she was teaching me that the telling did have to end, as we continue to live the mystery.

A wonderful wonderful work
