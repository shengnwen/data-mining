Interesting to hear how Terry Brooks gets his inspiration and why he writes about elves.  As a writer, I was eager to see if his mind works anything like mine.  Kinda freaky to learn it does.

He looks like a handsome version of a little leprechaun to me, so I always thought his "relatives" were feeding him insider information.  Grin!

Happy to learn he's only human ... like the rest of us hard-working writers.  I always say that "writing a story is like sliding down a rainbow. ...  The actual writing when one's imagination is free to wander is fuuuuuun.  But marketing is like wading through a field of sticky, "chewed" bugglegum."  

I wonder if Brooks would agree with me.  - review by Betty Dravis, author of the Amazon Short "V.O."
