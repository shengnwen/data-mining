I read this brilliant, disturbing novel twenty five years ago when I was in high school and liked it very much. I liked it even more this time. Lawrence captures the human experience with unparalleled fidelity and uncommon audacity. That which was shocking when he wrote it today is simply piercing and perceptive, and the book is gripping, fascinating, horrifying and finally, sadly, true.

The movie is one of the best adaptations of a novel I know of, but still does not come close to the book itself. Very much worth reading at least once. 

Literature at its best and most compelling
