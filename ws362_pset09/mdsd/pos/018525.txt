I never read the x-wing or rogue squadron books, so any continuity between this book and those is irrelevant to me, as a stand alone title, I, Jedi is fantastic, multiple reads later I still enjoy it, and usually this is the book I give people when they want to see what Star Wars is about outside of the movies
