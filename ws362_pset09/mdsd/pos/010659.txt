I've been waiting for the sheet music of this spectacular show to come out for years, it feels like. If you love musical theatre or music in general. . .you need this music!Granted, no one is as amazing as Sutton Foster(Millie;Broadway)its a blast to sing. Even though the musical is set in the 20's, this music is fresh and fun. If you dont own the CD. . .YOU NEED IT!You'll love this music. . .rock on
