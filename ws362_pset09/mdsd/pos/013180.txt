Excellent book could not put it down. The book is close to 900 pages and I read it in less than 10 days that is how good it is. The story goes there is a nuclear blast in the United States and we blame Russia. Tensions are high so you can only imagine what can happen. Ryan suspects a terrorist attack and tries to stop the president from starting a nuclear war. Excellent read and a very real plot. Highly recommend to anyone
