This is my first Anna Pigeon novel and am not surprised to read from her fans here that it is considered one of the best. Barr does a good job of combining the mystery genre elements with realistic characters and well-crafted writing. She delivers a book with rare entertainment value. I had trouble putting Deep South down to go to sleep. 

One of the best things about Deep South is the way in which it delivers the comfort points of a cozy while still bringing home the realities of the death and pain involved. Too much of the time the victims in a mystery novel are nothing more than excuses to explore the world of the detective. Barr makes us feel the death of Danni Posey, and gives us the feeling that the (emotional and physical) stakes are truly high for Anna. I also like that Barr does not shrink from tackling some of the tough non-murder related elements of Anna and her new life in Mississippi.

Recommended for all mystery fans. I will be reading further in this series
