Red Dragon was groundbreaking when it came out in 1981 and has been the benchmark used by literally hundreds (maybe thousands) of crime novels since.   Reading the novel today, it does feel a little dated (some younger readers may have no idea that home movies were once shot on 8mm film & shown on movie projectors)  but Red Dragon still stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of copycat novels that have followed in its wake.
 
The plot: Will Graham a former FBI profiler who was nearly killed catching Hannibal Lecter is asked to return to the fold and help the FBI catch a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy (at least by the media).  The Tooth Fairy (who calls himself Red Dragon) murders entire families in their homes and shows a propensity to bite some of his victims.  Reluctantly Graham enters the investigation, forcing himself to enter the mind of a killer.

Readers expecting this to be a novel about Hannibal Lector may be disappointed.  Lector plays a much smaller role in Red Dragon than he did in Silence of the Lambs.   

Red Dragon is well written and provides fascinating insight into the behavioral sciences arm of the FBI and into the mind of a sociopath.  Harris has crafted the ultimate page turner (not quite as compelling as Silence of the Lambs, but almost).

I highly recommend this novel.  One of the best crime novels ever written and certainly one of the most influential.
