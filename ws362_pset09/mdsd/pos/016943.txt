Richard Jury is definitely a too-good-to-be-true character, but no less likeable for that.  There is great humor and dry wit scattered among the personal tragedies of various characters, including the investigating police and the victims/suspects in crimes.  I liked this one better than her more recent Old Wine Shades because of Jury's introspection and Melrose's difficulties with gardening and children.  I recommend this one to anyone who has read other books in the series, so that you're already familiar with the main characters and typical situations they find themselves in, and so that you can appreciate the references to characters who usually appear in the Jury novels but are met here only as 'off-camera' asides.
