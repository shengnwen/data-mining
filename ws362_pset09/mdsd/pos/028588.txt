Two sisters and a nasty, bitter and unloving mother make up the setting for the beginning of an entertaining triology.  Maggie is high spirited and artistic with a special talent for glass blowing.  Brianna is a sweet, caring homebody who longs for her own business.  Maggie is devoted to her father who believes in her, but dies early in the story leaving her to provide for Brianna and her mother.  A famous art dealer discovers Maggie and introduces her to romance and success although not necessarily in that order.  Born in Fire is a good read; I'm glad I read it first and will go on to Born in Ice and Born in Shame
