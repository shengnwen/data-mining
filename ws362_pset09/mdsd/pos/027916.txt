This is a great book for anyone who wants to know if people in business and the private sector can make a difference beyond earning a profit for the owners.  I plan to give copies of Small Giants to new college grads and ftwenty-something friends who are looking for ways to live right in the world and still pay their bills.  This book, and the companies Mr. Burlingham writes about, are inspirational.
