I found Home by accident three years ago.  Since then I've become a Rybczyski fan.  This man knows how to write and has lots of thought provoking things to say about the relationship between people and their buildings.  I recommend all his books.  Witold is on my list of the top ten people I'd like to meet at a soiree
