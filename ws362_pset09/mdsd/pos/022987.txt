Above all the 2nd part of this StudyGuide is usefull and excellent, with many charts with entry/exit points.

I would like here to underline, with regard to the first review, that Dr Elder never talked about Bollinger Bands but ONLY about Envelopes, a totally different concept. I can assure you that when there is a good trend to go long/short at the middle line with the take profit at the upper/lower band is definetely a good technique..
