Phil Lesh was in many ways the glue that held the Grateful Dead's music together (when it was together). I always found his playing to be one of the more interesting elements in the Dead's music.  He approaches music in a conceptual way as well as in an intuitive way, as he articulates here.  And now it turns out he can write compellingly too.  I had a hard time putting the book down.

The writing is discursive and goes into much of the story of that era, in a way that made me both laugh and weep at times.  Much of it will be familiar as far as the facts go, but Lesh's perspective adds a lot of depth in the telling. I was a teenage Dead fan, though it's been a long time since I listened to their music much. (I wish he had at least touched on some of their early events in El Camino Park in Palo Alto, which remain memorable).  Growing up in their neck of the woods, it is hard to overstate how much influence they had over the mindset of the generation just behind them.  

Some readers have found the parts on sound systems and recording techniques to be boring or beside the point.  Though this is not my area, I found these discussions to be quite interesting.  This book is by someone who is unapologetically serious about music as well as the other cultural aspects that went with this particular music.  It may not be for everyone but for some even the nerdy parts will be fascinating, and as a whole it is very evocative.

Probably the most interesting thing to me about the autobiographical aspect of this book is the contrast between Lesh's keen intelligence and seriousness about his music and his occasionally out of control meandering ways, but then, that's probably par for the course.
