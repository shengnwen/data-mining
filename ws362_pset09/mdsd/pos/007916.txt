Having seen many of the specimens featured in this book first hand, I would say that great care was taken in accurately capturing these specimens for print.
The details of the book are a great reference source - I am particularly lucky to have an autographed (by one of the principal specimen sources) hard-bound copy of the second edition from 1993 - this book was just recently returned to me after 8 years.

It is a great book to just sit and look at or glean for it's vital information
