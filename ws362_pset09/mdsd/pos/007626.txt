I am surprised at the low star rating on this book as it was truly a good read.  However, having said that, I'm still in a quandary about who did it!  Who killed Vance Calder?  I used to think Arrington wasn't too bad, but in this book I really lost respect for her.  She's a weak whiner and doesn't have much understanding for others or a backbone to stand up for herself.  Stone, of course, continues to be a whore and sleep with every beautiful dame that comes along.  I really hope he's finished with Arrington, but I have my doubts.  Is Arrington's son Vance Calder's or Stone Barrington's child?  We still don't know, but we have our suspicions because Calder had enough money to get the original DNA tests skewed.  I simply love Dino and Stone sure should have listened to his partner about getting involved with Dolce.  What a frightening mess that woman is!  Truly, it's a fun ride in the life of Stone Barrington...especially if you want to listen to the book on tape
