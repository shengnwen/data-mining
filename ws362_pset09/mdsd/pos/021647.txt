"The Ultimate Guide" is a bit of a stretch as not a single b-list character from Marvel or DC that I used to collect as a kid is represented here, nor many of the creators I rank among my personal favorites, but it definitely offers a wide-ranging overview - emphasis on the word OVERVIEW - of the industry, past to present. There's a smattering of independent/alternative comics and a hefty load of Golden and Silver Age oddities I'd never even heard of. Overall, a perfect gift for the newcomer or casual fan, but I'd suggest letting the more experienced fan/collector decide whether to buy it for themselves
