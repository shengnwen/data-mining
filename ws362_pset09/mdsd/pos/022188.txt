I have the old copy of their editable plants guide and when combined with this one, great!

The pics are in color but they lack detail for identifying.
Especially poisonous plants. Take poison hemlock, they tell you to be careful with look alikes, but their pics do not show the very suttle differances.
I use the editable plant guide for cross referance. That old book has black and white drawn diagrams and specifically points out identification marks.

The info in the medicinal plant guides is very good. They tell you approved uses and folk lore uses. 

Overall a great book, shame the identifing aspect lacks some. That is the purpose of the book I would think! Its a field guide after all.

I dont regret buying it, I am glad I did. The info is great. But it sucks needing another book for identifying from pics
