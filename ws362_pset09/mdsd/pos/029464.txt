This book will always remain my favorite of all the "odd" literature I was forced to read for IB English. The mystery, the silences, the surrealness of the entire world without being magical realism. It was a story where nothing really happened, and yet an entire town was brought to life. So much was said with so little. I still cannot believe that only 124 pages spanned the entire story. It is an amazing read, and from the Latin American perspective, it is considered to be on of the best (and most complicated) texts available. Juan Rulfo, you are an artist
