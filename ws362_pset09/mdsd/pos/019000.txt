Heir to the Empire is a Star Wars novel where we see an Empire that has experienced 5 years of defeat from the New Republic fighting back.  The Empires new ability to fight back is due to a new Grand Admiral (Thrawn) and his intuition for cultures and his having not being in the .  To overcome the New Republic, Grand Admiral Thrawn raids the Emperor's store house, finds a Jedi to support him, and sets commando teams on the trail of Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker. 

Heir to the Empire does a very good job of capturing the feel of the Star Wars Universe.  Mr. Zahn does an excellent job of capturing Luke, Princess Leia, and Han Solo.  The dialog and the development of the story fits very well into what we know as Star Wars.  My chief complaints are that at points it moves a little slowly and Grand Admiral Thrawn was a little to perfect.  If Grand Admiral Thrawn was as perfect as Mr. Zahn describes him, why was he unknown to the New Republic and fighting on the edge of the Empire.  Despite these detractions, I found Heir to the Empire to be enjoyable and look forward to reading the rest in this series.  Given everything, this is a strong 4 star book, but not worthy of 5 stars.
