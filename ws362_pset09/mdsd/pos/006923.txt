This was the first Ellis Peters novel I have read.  I understand that she continues the Cadfael series, and I would be interested in checking out the other books.  Brother Cadfael was an interesting mix of the world (due to  his previous life outside of the ministry-as a soldier) and the Spirit.  He  was very smart, but was not my favorite detective.  The thing I loved the  most about this book was Ellis Peters' descriptions about people and  situations.  The description that struck me the hardest was the one of the  woman's body Brother Cadfael found in the beginning.  I'd like to conclude  by saying that the historical information was invaluable as well.  A  mystery with a historical context is something I thoroughly enjoy
