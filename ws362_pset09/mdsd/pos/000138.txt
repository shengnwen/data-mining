I saw Judith interviewed on Oprah and decided to read her book. I was finishing up my master's degree at that time and found it to have a lot of theories of control that went on and on. Her interview made the book seem  more practical for info on control issues. If you are into theories and  origination of how issues evolve, this is the book for you
