The Psychology of Persuasion is a fun read. It is written so that you can be more influential with your kids, your boss or your business dealings.Another very nice benefit of this book is the subject of collecting intelligence.I promise if you buy this book you will never see people the same. You will really understand how they think, how they decide things and how they buy. It's not boring mumbo jumbo like a college text. It's readable for real people.I got so many ideas between the book and the presentation that I'll be working a long time and making even more money
