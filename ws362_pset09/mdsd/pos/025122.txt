Last and First Men has been my favorite book for almost 30 years.  W.O.S. is my favorite author of all time.  I find myself re-reading it every few years to marvel at the accuracy of his predictions.  The chapter on the Americanization of the planet and the conflict with China is eerie in it's accuracy.  This from a book written before WWII.  I've loaned out several copies and they always wind up on extended journeys.  I bought this paperback edition to give to my 17y.o.   This book is a must for any serious SF fan
