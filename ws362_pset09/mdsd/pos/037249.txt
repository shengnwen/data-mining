Restak takes the wonder of the human brain and brings it down to earth for people like me who were non-science majors. 

His books covers the latest findings in technology on how the brain works and shows how it relates to our everyday lives. For instance, scientist thought as recently as a decade ago that we learn most of what we are going to learn in childhood. But now we know the brain is "elastic" and that we can always learn new things no matter how old we are.
