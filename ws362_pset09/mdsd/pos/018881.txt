It's amazing how fast King drew me into this story. Then he broke my heart a few times before the end of chapter two, and after that I just read on like a man possessed. A few bits feel plotted, but I don't care. King's novels have never been about their plots. That's news to Hollywood, I think, but not to you and me. 

King doesn't write short books you can devour in a single sitting or two. Nah, you spend a week with one of these babies, savoring every moment. He's fully capable of being a sick bastard, don't you doubt that, but he's equally capable of messing with you on far more disturbing levels. 

I bought a big pile of King novels at the Xinhua Bookstore on Yan An Lu, which probably means the author got his royalties. (Yes, I do live in China.) I assumed I'd quit reading at least some of them after the first 10%. But, pleasant surprise here, I've read every single one from cover to cover and enjoyed them all. I'm so happy about that. I've dwelled upon them after my reading and reviewing was done. And, while I can't be certain because my Kings are in a box instead of on a bookshelf right now -- I have no bookshelf -- I think this is the last one. Egad! 

Just so my subscribers know -- all three of you, haha! -- the protagonist is an author named Michael, and his wife dies suddenly in first paragraph. Does that give King special access to what I fear the most? Nah, it actually makes me giggle at the coincidence. 

No matter. King writes so well that I forget to giggle. So well that can only say "wow" and forget my jealousy. It's enough that I can read his books. I don't have to write them. Hey, writing is hard. Reading, if the author does his job, is easy. King does his job. Oh yes he does.
