I highly recommend this book.  I have a series of books by John Walkenbach; Excel Power Programming, Excel 2003 Formulas, and Excel Charts.  I can't live without these books.  Work is always hectic with crazy deadlines and never enough time to do the job and Excel 2003 Power Programming with VBA is a great reference book that has saved me numerous times.  Since the authors examples are straight forward and easy to follow I'm able to incorporate many of his approaches straight into my work, saving me precious time.  The companion CD is a must as the PDF file of the text is searchable making it quick and easy to focus in on what information you need.  The CD also includes Excel files which are great examples
