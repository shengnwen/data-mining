From some of the quotes Kieth gives in the beginning of the book about his childhood, all the way to the end of this rather long book, you'll enjoy his rich, british, sense of humor. Bockris has written an autobiography  about his life, not just about the crazy years Kieth spent battling heroin  addiction. As hard as life can be, even being a herion addict, he can joke  about his drug use and make the reader laugh.   As much as I oppose using  drugs, I admire Keith Richards as a musician and as seemingly honest,funny  caring man who has outlasted many others in his profession. This book tells  the story of a man who comes from &quot;good stock&quot; and I am sure you  will enjoy reading it
