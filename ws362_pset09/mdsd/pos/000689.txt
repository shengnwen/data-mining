This is a very good book on modern compilers.  It covers some crucial tochniques that the Dragon Book does not, such as pipelining, handling superscalar and RISC processors, tail recursion, polymorphism and OO languages, etc.  These things were unknown when the Dragon Book was  written.   Its treatment of compiler basics is not as good as that in the  Dragon Book, but the additional material makes it about as valuable.  NOTE:   This is a theory book, not a cookbook.  You are not buying code, you are  buying a reference you can use when writing code.  You will still have to  do your own thinking and your own coding
