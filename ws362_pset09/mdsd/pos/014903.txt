Used this book in a graduate level course on SPC.  The book and the excercises were interesting and highly informative, as are all of Dr. Montgomery's numerous texts.  Most concepts are backed up with liberal examples to help understand the theory and cement the concept and their practical applications, and run the whole gamut from management to electrical engineering problems.  Many of the tables in the back of the book, such as the random number table, are outdated due to computers, however these may have been dropped in the new version of the text
