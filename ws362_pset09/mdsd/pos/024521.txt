I thought the title flip and shallow compared to the serious subject matter, but after some consideration I think it is an apt title.  Ms. Moaveni writes a compelling story, but as other reviewers have pointed out, it is an elitist, upper middle class point of view of Iranian culture and politics.  I also lived in Iran during the Shah's reign.  I also had a housekeeper that cooked too much so as to have food to take home to her family.  Ms. Moaveni thought her servant was selfish.  Did she ever stop to think that her housekeeper was probably supporting a large family?  On a fraction of the salary that the author made?  Most of the population of Iran is poor.  That is why there was a revolution in the first place.  She  mentions that the morality police on the ski slopes obviously had not been on skiis since they were two years old, like she had.  Oh how revealing.  I would like to read a memoir from someone in the working class for a change.  Having said all that, I too was clueless when I lived in Tehran, in most of the same neighborhoods that she writes about.  The upper middle class looked down with contempt on the Bazari class and the working class then and still do.  Nothing will change for the better until all Iranians are given an equal chance in life to better themselves.
