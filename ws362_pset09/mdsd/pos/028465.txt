    America's best selling book, somewhere in the darkness by Walter dean Myers has won a Newbery honor award. As soon as you start to read you will never stop.
   A life of a fourteen years old boy named jimmy is holding his own little world. He lives in Harlem. He never saw his father and lives with his mom. Suddenly one day he was walking home from school, he saw a man standing in front of his house. That's when the book starts to get interesting. 
   I will recommend this book as one of the best book. The writing style is very persuasive. The father of jimmy is very dramatic. You will never know what he going to do next. This book has professional language and easy to read. This book is like more reality then fiction.
   It is the best time to try it out. It will probably take you week and half to finish it up. It also has lot of drama. Don't waste your time go ahead and start reading today.
