I finally decided to give this series another try after getting bored with the second book a couple years ago.  This book is well written and well paced.  The action is realistic and the characterization of the main cast is consistant.  However, there was one noticeable error.  At about half-way through this book the USS Pelican (Ingram's minesweeper in Book 1) becomes the USS Penguin.  The other thing that bugged me about this book is that Ingram keeps getting his ships shot out from under him.  Is he jinxed?  Does he just have the worst luck in the Navy?  Since his ships keep getting sunk or heavily damaged, why does the Navy keep promoting/rewarding him?  But that is just a minor nitpick on my part.  Otherwise, this is one of the better series of Navy fiction that I've read
