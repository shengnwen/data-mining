I have read this book through a number of times since I first bought it back in November. I continue to read chapters of it, randomly, as I sometimes do with the Upanishads and the teachings of Dogen, among others. I have been captivated by the distinctly unique approach that the author has taken to a perennial problem: how does one speak about reality in a way that does not cheapen or discount some aspect of it. Corrigan goes to great pains to leave us with a world in which Science works, but also one where the non-dual wholeness of Reality is both accepted and presented as such. This is no small feat, as you can imagine. He presents a conceptual model of Reality as a monistic dyad of immanent and transcendent aspects that both arise from the same source, which he shows is non-individuated Awareness; but he points out that this conceptual model is just that, a model, and cautions the reader to not become lost in the concept itself, for reasons that he explains very clearly. Rather, he tells us to use it to change how we take the world to be, so that we can open ourselves to greater understanding. 

There is a bit of a blurb on the back cover about Corrigan's career in systems development and that history shows in his skillful tackling of the arguments of those that say reality consists of just the physical universe absent any kind of metaphysical underpinnings. 

The writing is tight and clearly presented. It's a pleasure to read. You have to pay attention to the arguments though. If it was simple to escape our normal understanding of reality then we would not need to read books about it. This one is for those who really want to develop an understanding and are willing to make the effort to do so
