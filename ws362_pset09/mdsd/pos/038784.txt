I just finished  listening to this book, and I was blown away. The story was very engrossing, and the character of Peacie was witty and added humor to the overall serious nature of the book. I loved listening to the reader voice the various characters- she did an excellent job and I wondered which actress it was. It turns out the reader was Elizabeth Berg herself! I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this book. It was a breath of fresh air. There are so many parallels between the various characters, and the story is deep even though told from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl (now grown up). I 100% recommend it, especially if you are going to listen to it.
