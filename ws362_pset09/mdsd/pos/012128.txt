Brenda Miller is amazing.  This is the first compilation of her's I've read, and I couldn't help but be impressed.
Sometimes the subject matter is semi-mature (birthing, intermarital relations), so some careful selection of age group appropriateness is suggested.
Miller's prose is touching and well written.  I would recommend this book to anyone who needs motivation to write, someone to connect with, or just a good read
