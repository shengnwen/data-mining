It's not first book on sex in the world you know.  But Considered the esseys in this book published in 1920s, it's so shocked and execellent.  Freud extend his own typical attitude on sex. At first, he seems to believe that the original reason of all mental disease  is on Libido or sexual  drive. it's same with his other articles like [The interpretation of Dream]  and so on.   The content of this book is composed of so many esseys  different from the &quot;real&quot; title of Book [three essays...].  He  studied from fetishism to sex life of children variously. And continued  to...anal eroticism, sexual desire of women and children...  Even Most of  people recently think children and women(especially young girl) have a  passive sexual drive or no desire.  But Freud thought the start of Sexul  desire from infant period. So called Oedipus Complex! you know.   Babies'  Oedipus Complex formed by jealousy on their fathers. Babies want to kill  their father then have [or have intercourse?] their moms according to theory of Freud.    And this failed desire make growing persons sick(of course mental disease).  These disease or symptoms divided variously e.g   Fetishism, Paranoia,  Hysteria... In conclusion, i hope you should choose this one if you wanna  get deeper knowledge about origin of YOUR Sexual desire!  Humm... mail to  me if there comments
