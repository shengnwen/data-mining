Mr. Hatch has written a taunt true story of grim reality.  Like the Titanic, The Hidenberg, The Coconut Grove and other assorted and avoidable human disasters, the reader knows the ending before opening the book.  But like all good reporters  - and Mr. Hatch is first, last and always a well seasoned newsman - it is how he stacks the facts that counts.  In Tinder Box it is not 'what' happens, as much as 'how' and 'why,' and finally, sadly, who pays the price.  In today's era of litigation, much is made of the lawyer-sharks; but before their arrival, the victims of these man-made tragedies were like guppies swimming with piranhas.  Only the victims paid.  Mr. Hatch is never brutal, but neither does he turn aside from the grim facets of those ghastly events of that day in in late 1903,when 600 victims, many of them women and children, burned to death in an "absolutely fireproof" building.  It is a great read, fast paced and gripping
