I understand why many people don't like the Grouchy Lady bug character running around saying, "Hey, you!  Wanna fight?"  But these people are missing the point.  You are not supposed to like this ladybug.  He's a jerk.

He doesn't want to share.  He's rude, even when everyone around him is gracious.  He's a blowhard and coward, who runs away when ever someone stands up to him.  And in the end, he reaps what he sows and learns his lesson.

He is the perfect negative example for a moody, tempestuous 2 year old!

Our daughter had a rough day and lost her head at daycare, hitting and kicking other kids at the slightest provocation.  Not cool.  In addition to time outs, forced appologies to the other kids and parents, and stern reprimands from both my wife and me, we picked up this book at the library and it was the perfect thing.  

After setting up what a jerk the Groucy Ladybug was, we pointed out that she had been a little grouchy that day.  "Yeah," she agreed.  We then went on to point out that not only is wrong to hit others, for all of the the reasons we listed that day, but also because sooner or later someone's going to hit back..."and that's no good.  So why do it?"  "Oh..." she said.

We're delighted to see this book is still in print.  I'm buying my own copy right now.  The book isn't perfect, but it's entertaining and educational
