If you purchase a book with Darwin Ortiz's name on it, you are making a good investment. Gambling Scams shares not only the methods used by card sharps, but also shares some of Darwin's priceless personal experiences. If you are looking to actually learn to execute methods used by cheats, this wouldn't be your best choice due to the lack of photographs and explanations. This book teaches you how to CATCH the cheat, not BE the cheat. If you're looking to BE the cheat, check out The Annotated Erdnase by Ortiz
