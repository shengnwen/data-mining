Lovely collection of traditional lace shawls and patterns, updated and improved. Some of them are hard to find, and it's convenient to have a compilation like this. It does take experience to work some of them, but the patterns are clear and certainly span the world of shawls and lace. Can't decide which to try first. Beware though - if you are not a patient knitter who can stick with a project, this is not the book for you. On the other hand,  if you're up for  a challenge that results in a beautiful classic garment, there are many ideas in this volume
