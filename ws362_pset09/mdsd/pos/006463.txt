I highly recommend this book for those in a long distance relationship.  It balances research and experience nicely and it provides a springboard for discussion with your boyfriend or girlfriend.  It offers good advice in coping with the challenges of an LDR.  In addition to learning a lot about your relationship, you will learn a lot about yourself with respect to a LDR.  This is very important because the success of the relationship depends so much on the individuals involved.  Since I am in a LDR as a result of online dating, I would have liked to see more examples of LDR's resulting from online dating where the couples have never lived close to one another.  Most of the examples in the book involve couples who already lived close to one another and then lived far from one another.  Despite this, the insight and advice was still relevant to my situation.  Perhaps in a future edition, Dr. Guldner could expand his examples to include this ever-growing population.
