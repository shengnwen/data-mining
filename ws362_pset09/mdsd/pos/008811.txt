WOW.   Exceptional historical research, developed characters and subplots, great storytelling.  A book for the ages. With Winds of War (read it first), this was a 2000+ page trek.  Worth it and very satisfying. While being entertained, the reader receives an educational narrative of the progression of events, the atmosphere, and the personalities of WWII.  Among the most enjoyable aspects for me was reading the face-to-face encounters with important personages of the war (at least Wouk's interpretation of them).  It was the next best thing to having sat in a room with these people.  By cleverly using a fictional family and its involvement in the war, Wouk takes the reader all over the world, providing a wonderful comprehensive overview of WWII.  Finishing it meant saying goodbye to old and beloved friends.  I repeat . . . WOW.
