Believing he's directly responsible for the deaths of his brother and sister-in-law, 19-year-old Ian takes on the responsibility of raising his infant niece and two young stepchildren. He grounds the children in his newfound faith, courtesy of a strange Church of the Second Chance. But as the years pass, Ian learns that despite sacrificing his own life for theirs, his nieces and nephew will stubbornly insist upon being the people they ultimately want to be -- leaving Ian to realize that his own life may have been empty and meaningless by comparison.

As always, Tyler's descriptions of regular people living regular lives are flawless and compelling.
