Novellas are an odd duck, significantly longer than short stories and much shorter than full length novels.  I suspect that it takes considerable self discipline to maintain one's focus for from between 10,000 and 40,000 words (which may explain why novellas are infrequent).  Whatever it takes, Ed McBain inveigled a terrific coterie of writers to create a series of wonderful stories which can keep you going from the beach to the mountains.

From the humor of Donald Westlake to Anne Perry's haunting depiction of northern Ireland's "troubles" to Stephen King's eerie recollection of the tangible memories of the victims of 9/11 to Walter Mosley's tour de force creation of Archibald Lawless, anarchist, McBain has forged a memorable collection of just good fiction.  Indeed, I hope that this volume becomes a real tribute to Ed McBain's skill as a story selector!
