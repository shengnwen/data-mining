This book adresses many of the questions, issues, etc. that run through an idividual's mind when they first even think of converting to Judaism - especially if you are either leaning or serious thinking about converting via Orthodox auspices.  Rabbi Lamm's tone is also very encouraging throughout;  without cutting corners on what the halacha is in regards to conversion.  Very helpful and resourceful but it is only a starting point.  This book will help you solidify your feelings of conversion before or shortly after meeting with a Rabbi
