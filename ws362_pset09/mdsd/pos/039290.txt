Blood on the Horns gives excellent insight into the greatest NBA dynasty ever-the Chicago Bulls.  This book describes how the rift between Phil Jackson and Jerry Krause developed, and how the rest of the team rallied  around Jackson.  Particular attention is paid to the 1997-98 season and the  long drive toward a 6th NBA championship.  There will never be another team  like the Chicago Bulls, and this book is worth reading by all true Bulls  fans
