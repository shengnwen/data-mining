The Siddur is a precious, age-old resource of Jewish spirituality, and the prayer service is an anchor for Jewish community.  But it is complex.  Rabbi Hammer helps us find our way, historically and in the synagogue  services of today.  A good companion book is MINDING THE TEMPLE OF THE  SOUL, which adds meditations and movements you can do in your own home.   With these, you can enrich your prayer life, your community life, and your  relationship to God
