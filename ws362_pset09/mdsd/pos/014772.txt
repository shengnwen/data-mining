I have recommended this book to everyone I know that is interested in breeding.  Very informative, good concrete tips on how to correct genetic disease in purebred dogs without loosing type.  Written for the layperson. Every breeder should read this book and use its methods to correct genetic disorders and improve their bloodlines for show. I have read it several times already. Without a doubt the best book I have read on this subject
