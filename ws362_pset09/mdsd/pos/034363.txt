&quot;Even The Stars Look Lonesome&quot;, by Maya Angelou is a collection of short insights into things that are important to her.  It is the second book in a sequence following &quot;Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey  Now.&quot;  Maya Angelou touches down on various subjects like how a house  can hurt those who live there but a home can heal it's occupants. She also  reveals her knowledge to the reader on sensuality and how everyone has the  right to sexuality.  My favorite one is her essay on how her thoughts of  growing old have changed since she has become old.  In her book she shows  the downside of having pride in her fame and she also tells of the  unforgetable lessons she has learned of violence and anger.  There is also  a short profile of Oprah and other stories fo being an African-American.   &quot;Even The Stars Look Lonesome&quot; is Maya Angelou's book of things  that she believes must be learned throught one's lifetime
