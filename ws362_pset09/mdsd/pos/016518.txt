This book is probably one of the most widely used for classes on Latin American Economic Development. It is well-structured and combines a revision of the main historic events that had impacted the economic development of Latin America with alternative theoretical explanations.  It gives special priority to topics such as inflation, debt crisis and poverty and inequality that are crucial for the understanding of the Latin American economic evolution.  Moreover, the text does not forget about the role played by the interaction between politics and economics.  In this sense, the chapter on populism is remarkable.  However, many of the statistical tables are outdated and in my modest opinion, a future revision of the book should include a chapter on the neoliberal reforms and their consequences
