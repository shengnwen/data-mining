In my opinion, this is an excellent biography. I found it well-written, balanced and full of interesting stories. I think it is sad that Ms. Wood probably wanted a Best Actress Oscar above all and never reached her goal. Although one of her nominations was for West Side Story, I believe the fact that she was dubbed in it would be a big drawback, the same way it would have been for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady (Julie Andrews should have been given that role). I also read Gavin Lambert's bio and thought it was a bit strange that no mention was made of substance abuse in this book. I don't think that consuming 7 or 8 drinks in one evening results in a person being "mildly intoxicated". Having said that, the public doesn't have the right to pry into the events leading to her death. I think she will be remembered as a very entertaining actor in comedies and a very moving one in dramas.
