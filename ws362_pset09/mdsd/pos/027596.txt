When Air America Radio started, most of their radio hosts (except for Randi Rhodes) had little or no experience at radio.  Sam Seder didn't either, but lo and behold, out of all the hosts, Seder has grown into being an excellent radio host.  He was originally hosting his show, The Majority Report, with Janeane Garofalo, a somewhat obscure but nevertheless fetching and occasionally fascinating actress, comedienne, and part time vixen, but when she was off doing various acting bits, he really made the show his own.  His book is very reminiscent of his show (co-written with one of his co-producers, Stephen Sherill), and it is very funny and interesting.  Sam is not the greatest thing to ever hit radio, but I think he is much better than anyone else at Air America.  He's not as smug and as detached as Al Franken can be, he doesn't laugh at his own jokes (like Franken), he doesn't get overly emotional as Janeane had a tendency to do, and he's not a publicity hog like Michael Moore can be.  His book is reflective of his radio show:  intelligent, thoughtful, and focused on exposing the stupidity of the right wing in this country.
