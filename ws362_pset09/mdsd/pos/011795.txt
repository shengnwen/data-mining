There are a bunch of lose weight books on the market. They talk about diet, exercise, all the same standard things that we've all been taught about for years. In this book, Mr Montignac analyzes why the French people have the lowest average body weight per capita in the Western World. As you might guess from the title, it concerns the French eating habits. 

Most popular diet books will work if they are followed. Unfortunately most people either don't lose as much weight as they wish, or they quickly regain the weight lost when they go off the diet. This book, instead of pushing a regimen that probably won't be followed, presents an eating philosophy that invludes wine, chocolate, cheese, and red meat while you are losing weight. 

The essense of the French Diet is glycemic index, which measures the portion of carbohydrates that are converted into sugar inside the body. The book discusses this philosophy and includes some 60 recipies. And a lot of these recipies aren't bad at all. Shrimp with Green Peppercorns, for instance, is cooked in olive oil and wine.
