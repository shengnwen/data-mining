Allyson's book, The Seven Minute Difference:  Small Steps To Big Changes, draws from the insight that she has gained from more than 23 years of experience in the financial services industry.  The Seven Minute Difference motivates you to question and define your purpose in life and in business, and offers simple, powerful advice on realizing your potential and achieving maximum productivity.

The key theme of Allyson's book is "Change happens in an instant. It happens the moment you decide to change."  She encourages growth through daily micro-actions that can be implemented in as little as seven minutes.  Examples of these small actions can be things as simple as creating a daily action plan, clearing a cluttered work space, or taking the time to thank a coworker for a job well done.  These small steps can bring about the biggest changes, and can often make the difference between mediocrity and excellence.

Throughout the book, she guides you in defining your purpose, outlining manageable goals, and suggests micro-actions to help you achieve them.  You will learn to prioritize, organize, and simplify the elements of your life which will result in increased levels of productivity and success.  By following her advice, the reader will begin making the small, but necessary changes that will eventually lead to personal and professional growth.
