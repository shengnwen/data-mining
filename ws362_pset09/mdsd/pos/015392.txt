First, I am 63 and have been skiing for 40+ years.  I now live in Southern California but generally ski at either Mammoth or Snowbird. I can turn my skis right and left and can usually get down most of the in-bounds trails at most resorts including the mogul runs.  I like it all, but I really like bump skiing.
 
To that end, I want to give Dan DiPiro a big THANK YOU for writing Everything... .   Frankly, my experience suggests he's absolutely right when he says that most ski instructors do not know how to ski bumps and try to teach people to ski bumps using racing technique.  So while I do OK in the bumps, I have never quite mastered skiing the zipper line the bump skiers use.  
 
Of course, it never dawned on my until read Dan's book, that the problem was not me, but my not knowing the techniques that the pro bump skiers used.  I found the way in which he broke down the differences between trail and mogul skiing to make a lot of sense and I am looking forward to using the exercises he includes in his book to develop an alternate skill set that I can use to improve my bump skiing.    So here's to Dan - for making a major contribution to skiing in general and my bump skiing in particular.
