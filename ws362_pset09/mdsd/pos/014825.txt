"An entrenched enterprise usually doesn't have much incentive to change the world, because it has so much staked in the world as it is presently ordered."

The VC Way shows the true nature of Venture Capitalists. Zygmont explains how Venture Capitalists offer more than just money, they offer expertise and connections. Starting off with An Adventure Capital Story, the author quickly gets to the point - Venture Capitalists are interested in rapid growth companies with potential for high impact, lifestyle companies need not apply.

Venture Capital is more than just about money. It's about changing the world we live in. Through money, experience in building companies, and cross-industry connections, VC's are able to bring to bear a tremendous amount of energy to effect change.

If you've ever wondered what Venture Capitalists really do, The VC Way will give you the insider's view. And if you're serious about transforming your ideas into market reality, you'll most likely need external funding from investors. The VC Way and Confessions of a Venture Capitalist (April Byvation) will help you gain insight into how investors think. With this knowledge you'll certainly be able to put your best foot forward when asking for money.
