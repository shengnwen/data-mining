This book developed out of the classes/workshops thatJohn Buscema conducted in New York. Stan Lee wrote the text in conjunction with John's approach. It is a useful book for those students wanting to draw superhero. Buscema's examples are strong and he has an excellent base in drawing the figure. In this regard, I also recommend the work of Gnass and his spirit pose book, Emilio Soltero's Draw the line with many nice figures and comic related information, the work of Gil Kane who also worked out ideas of the figure.

Stan Lee does a good job on the inking section. Buscema's comic ideal is limiting in that Lee/Buscema propose the figure to look a certain height or look, when heroes comes in all shape and sizes. However, the section on how to make the panels dynamic work well. There is a section where a boss is getting upset and the two versions they present are very different.

Buscema's art here is worth the cost of the book as most of his work was inked by other artists.

The DC books on comics are also great
