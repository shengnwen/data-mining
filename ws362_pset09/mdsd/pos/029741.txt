I have to jump on the O'Connor band wagon. This was a great one. Couldn't put it down.  Krueger has proven he can compete with the big boys.  This takes place in a small Minnesota town on the fringe of a reservation.  Cork is trying to get over losing his job as sheriff.  Some strange murders are happening in Aurora and he is lured to the investigation.  In the mean time, he is also trying to figure out his personal life. He is attracted to a younger woman but is also trying to figure out what to do with his crumbling marriage.
I liked the way Krueger developed the characters while keeping the reader hooked on the mystery. Not many authors have mastered this.  Krueger is working on becoming the master..
