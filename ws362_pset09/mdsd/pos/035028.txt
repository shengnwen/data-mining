I found this book very helpful when I decided to incorporate stretching/strengthing to my workout routine without having to sign up for a costly class.  There is a learning curve and anyone using this book  should be prepared to take some time to learn the stretches - it won't  happen overnight.  The stretches are clearly described in a step-by-step  manner with pictures and &quot;easing the stretch&quot; options to help  people of all fitness levels.  I particularly appreciated the 30 minute  routines so I didn't have to decide which stretches to perform in what  order.  I would definitely recommend this book to others
