This book won the Caldecott Medal in 1948.  It is based on a poem the author wrote which came to him as he was walking a street in New York City, on a snowy winter night.  The book takes place in the suburbs in 1948.  It  focuses on the anticipation of the snowfall, the actual snowfall, the  children playing and loving the snow and then the beginning of spring.  In  this age of FEdEX and high technology, it is fun to see a postman and  policeman walking their route.  The story really seems like a fairy tale.   It is absolutely charming.  It has endured since 1948.  Your children will  enjoy it, and so will you
