This is a book I would highly recommend.  It is well written and easy to follow.  I totally agree with his assessment of these "elite" and their followers demonizing everyone these days.  If someone disagrees with them the opponent is called hateful names and are wrongly accused as to their intent.  These talk shows on television, radio and internet become shouting matches so no one gets any real value out of any of it.  There is nothing wrong with disagreeing and in fact, good ideas come out of the combination of ideas many times.  It, like everything else, has gotten so totally out of hand these days nothing is meant to make sense!  One excellent book
