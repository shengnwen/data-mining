Joseph Petro writes a readable and interesting account of his life in the U.S. Secret Service.  He also talks a little about Vietnam, and a little football.  I mainly read this book to find out more information on Ronald Reagan, although the majority of stories were already in print.

One of the best chapters and it was the chapter with the greatest new information and insight was concerning Vice President Quayle.  It was neat to see the comparisons in the presidential and vice presidential protection details.  Also some of the stories are kind of amusing about Marilyn Quayle and the Secret Service.  Also I did not realize Dan Quayle was such a great runner.  I knew he was and is smart of course but I did not quite realize his athletic prowess, it does not however surprise me.  

Anyways this is a valuable book in terms of learning more about the protection of politicians and even the pope (JPII) when he visited the U.S.  Petro definitely has a different perspective than military or political aides.  He is able to give more of an unbiased and often professional account.  He seems like a serious and professional guy who has so far lived a pretty unique and amazing life
