Though the ideals and principles of this group are unique to put it nicely, I do like the tarot card parallels and definitions provided by them in their book.  The book falls apart rather easily, so be careful not to snap the binding by opening it too far.  The definitions are extremely simplified, so if you are looking for an in depth meaning to any of the cards, look elsewhere.  However, I use astrology and tarot together and found this to be my handy dandy reference guide when my memory fails me on a card's parallel.  It's rather small, can fit nicely into a purse or bag of goodies
