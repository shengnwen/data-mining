One of the blogs I read in anticipation of my first year was authored by an obviously succesfull student and he recommended this book. Shame he is a commie. An outline on your first year with a solid emphasis on legal writing, outlining and exams. I found the legal writing section to be very useful because I didn't have a very good legal writing professor. Some cold hearted conservatives argue that academia is where professionals who couldn't hack it in the big times end up earning their bread. If law school professorships are where dejected high power attorneys get banished, then the dregs of this barrel of dejection are inhabited by your legal writing professor and probably your career placement director. The greatest academic surprise I encountered my first semester of law school was how much effort and time learning legal writing would take on my own. This book will help you learn the formula your whacky and/or drunk legal writing professor is looking for. Unfortunately, legal writing professors are zany and ineffective in their own individual ways so the help this book provides will be minimal. Legal writing's importance cannot be overrated, any help is good help. The glossary found at the end of this 130 page outline should supplement any need for a copy of Black's Law Dictionary but waste your money if you want; Westlaw has a copy online.
