Skidmore and Smith deliver a great historical review of the development of Latin America covering the span between the precolonial period and present time. These authors further engage in individualized analysis of some countries, though leave out some with great historic importance, like Bolivia. Overall however, this book serves as an outstanding reference guide to those interested in Latin American Studies
