For years I have suffered with red eyes and lots of sneezing. My only professional advice had been 'get rid of your cat'.  I saw this book, bought it and must say that in a matter of just a few weeks I have far fewer symptoms.  This book explains in simple terms just what should be done to live much more comfortably with your pet.  If you're serious about wanting to reduce your pet allergy problems . . . this is the book to get.
