 There is quite a bit in this book that I agree with and it made me think about my positions about various issues (NAFTA, Immigration, among a couple). The book is well written with many notations and is well laid out for an easy read. I do think that Tom repeats a few items a bit too often, but other than that, I am very happy I read it and would suggest that anyone concerned with what is currently happening to the middle class read it
