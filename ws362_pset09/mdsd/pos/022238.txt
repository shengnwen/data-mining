I read this book quite awhile ago or was it just tomorrow? I am fascinated by all things that have to deal with time, the nature of reality, and God. I guess I could have worse hobbies. But things are not always what they seem to be. In truth, things are always much, much more than what they appear to be.

I had an experience once where all of the sudden I was somewhere in my past. It wasn't like a memory...I was actually there and yet I was simultaneously conscious that I was also somewhere else in time and then I realized if I could be in the past as well as the present I wondered if I could also move into the "future" and lo and behold, I was there. And then before I knew it, I was back in what I knew to be my present reality.

We cling to our beliefs of what we feel to be true of certain things and when those beliefs are threatened, we're threatened because we think we've been mislead or lied to when all that really took place is that we were given some incomplete information and that's okay, no need to get our knickers in a bunch, just go forth in this new now moment..the only time there REALLY is and accept, embrace, and embody the Truth that ALL things, including your "little" life is much bigger than you had previously realized.

I remember that you already bought this book next week and you told me three weeks ago you really, really liked. All things are taking place in the now. All the possibilities of time and space converge upon a single point. 

This is a great book and a great find. Read it and blow your linear mind right out of the waters of pragmatism
