I like Suze Orman's no-nonsense style and her clear and sensible advice.  I've read a couple of her books already, and those had non-overlapping information.  While this book has some new information because it was written later, it travels some of the same ground as the other books, albeit in a question-and-answer format.

Still, it's comprehensive and sensible advice.  The book covers everything from getting out of debt to investing in stocks, bonds, and annuities to what kind of insurance you need to making a will.  You might not agree with everything she says, but most of it makes sense to me.  If I read enough of her books, I might actually take some action on some parts of our financial plan.  The q-and-a format makes it easy to pick and choose what sections you need to read.  And there are little bits and pieces of advice that are not in the other books.

My advice would be to get this book out of the library, if you've already read some of Ms. Orman's other books
