This is my favorite Edwards book.  It is an easy read and has a great "big idea".  I have read about 5 of Edwards books.  He is great at getting you to think differently about the Christian Life and how things could (and often should) be different.  However, he often takes what would charitably be called "poetic license" when he uses the Bible to support his ideas.  It bothered me less in this book than in the others
