This book is exactly what all d&d 3.5 spellcasters need. It is a compilation of all the spells from all the major d&d 3.5 supplements, as well as a few from print and web publications. There's no fluff here, folks. Just spells. Each spell even comes with a neat description of its effects. The illustrations interspersed amongst the spell descriptions are pretty good too -- much better than the ones in most of WOTC's other d&d 3.5 books.

Never mind the name changes and the fact that it doesn't give you the source for each individual spell. This book is definitely worth getting.

Too bad the leather flap and crystal-rod latch on the cover aren't real ... otherwise it would have the look and feel of a real spellbook. ;-
