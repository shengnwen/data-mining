Sharon McCrumb has two definate sides, her fun loving side, and her more serious tone. If you are looking for a book that is funny, informative, adventurious (and know geography of England), &quot;Missing Susan&quot; fits the bill.  Do not look to it for serious murder mystery, or heavy handed suspense--this isn't the book.  I've read all of Mc Crumb's works, and this one ranks among my most favorite. It is a light read.  Elaine McPherson is never to be taken very seriously, but this book is corker
