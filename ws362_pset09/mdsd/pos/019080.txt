Ladies,I'm not a misogynist.I use vixen as I lack for a better word in describing this masterpiece of literature.It brings you into the bowels of the human element. A materclass on how to counterpoint the mean,vitriolic,scheming mind set when confronted by it.I can mention other classic masterpieces in this genre ANNA KARENINA-Tolstoy NANA-
Emile Zola,EAST OF EDEN-John Steinbeck.This is only one side of the human character. .The writing is so superb,informative,and with observant glimpses into the complex working of the human psyche,that,regardless of its rather disconsolate,and sometimes disturbing subject matter,they remain some of the true gems in classic literature.
