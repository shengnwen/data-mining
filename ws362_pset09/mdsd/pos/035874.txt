Both professors and students quote hooks, Hall, and Bhabha all the time, yet few refer to Mercer's work.  I find this to be such a wasted opportunity.  In this collection, he writes on diverse topics such as Robert Mapplethorpe, black hair, Michael Jackson, etc.  I saw him once in person and he kinda reminds me of a black George Michael.  This was strong cultural studies that I think many black thinkers and gay thinkers (and when I say "thinkers" that includes "paper writers) should find useful.  I don't agree with all of his conclusions.  Still, there is so much  here that would make any paper in cultural criticism look very well informed.  My only question for the author would be:  "When are readers going to get more great works of yours like this out there?!
