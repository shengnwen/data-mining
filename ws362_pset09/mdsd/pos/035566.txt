I found this to be an extremely interesting and challenging book, the kind of work that has to be re-read several times. It contains an amazing amount of information but reads very well notwithstanding. The information appears fairly complex, but it is given in a clear style and with respect for the reader. I am very pleased to recommend it to any thoughtful reader who wishes his/her intellectual horizons expanded and who concerns himself/herself with fundamental questions of human identity and nature.
