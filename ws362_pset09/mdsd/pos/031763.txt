Personally I just fipped through most of the "current" story the story set in the present.  I found this to be generic and not very compelling.  

I found the alternate track dealing with the "forest people" to be fascinating.  It shows the development of one guy into a real leader of his people and the idea of the histories isn't too bad either.  

Also I respect Dekker for brining us a book that is not released over a long period of time by releasing all the books over a 5 month period he is helping out those of us who don't read unfinished series'.  I learned my lesson reading Song of Ice and Fire.  So thank you Mr. Dekker keep them comming.
