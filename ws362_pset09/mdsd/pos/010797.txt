Elaine St. James has come a long way since her days as a real estate investor. One day she realized her life was too busy and complicated. By cutting back on work and eliminating physical and mental clutter, she was able to focus on what mattered most in her life.
Living the Simple Life features feedback from readers of the author's previous works. My favorite comes from David, a 42 year-old teacher who now can fit all his possessions into eight boxes. He works as a private rich-kid tutor two hours a day, four days a week. In all his free time he does volunteer work with underprivileged kids.
Living the Simple Life is written on level ground with information regular folks can apply to their lives.  Not only is Living the Simple Life an ideal asset to your personal library, it also makes an easy and helpful gift. Pair it up with any of the book in Elaine St. James series for a revolutionary and refreshing life change
