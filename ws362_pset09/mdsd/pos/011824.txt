A Great And Terrible Beauty is best described as a Harry Potter novel for "grown ups". Interestingly, this book is in the "Young Adults" section. Libba Bray's book was recommended to me by a high school English teacher. However, there are some sensual passages in this book so Beauty wouldn't be appropriate for classroom reading.

I am not usually a fan of "fantasy" fiction, but the characters brought me back to my early teen years. Remember the time when you were looking to understand yourself and gain the acceptance of others? With that being said, I did enjoy the book! Bray also offers some beautiful writing with her vivid descriptions of India in the opening of the book.

If you enjoy the Harry Potter series, I would recommend checking "Beauty" out. I will warn you that if you do read A Great And Terrible Beauty, you may have to continue to follow Gemma's journey in Bray's next book (Rebel  Angels).
