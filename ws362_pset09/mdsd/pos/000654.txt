If you're looking for a single volume on XML to give you many of the answers you need, I would suggest checking out XML In A Nutshell by Elliotte Rusty Harold and W. Scott Means (O'Reilly).

Chapter list:  Introducing XML; XML Fundamentals; Document Type Definitions (DTDs); Namespaces; Internationalization; XML as a Document Format; XML on the Web; XSL Transformation (XSLT); XPath; XLinks; XPointers; XInclude; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS); XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO); Resource Directory Description Language (RDDL); XML as a Data Format; XML Schemas; Programming Models; Document Object Model (DOM); Simple API for XML (SAX); XML Reference; Schemas Reference; XPath Reference; XSLT Reference; DOM Reference; SAX Reference; Character Sets; Index

As you can see, there's a lot of ground covered here.  Since XML is such a diverse set of standards and technologies, different readers will probably get differing amounts of value from this book.  For instance, if I was delving into CSS for a website project, this book wouldn't give me much of what I need.  The coverage on CSS is very light and introductory.  Conversely, if I was starting to use SAX, the initial chapter on SAX along with the reference chapter would give me a solid foundational base from which to work.  It seems that most of the quality material is found in the core XML standards.  And as with most Nutshell books, they are not meant to be tutorials for the beginner.  They provide a no-fluff reference for the professional to refer back to for quick answers.  This book coupled with a stand-alone book on a specific XML standard would be a great combination.

Is it perfect?  No.  But it will give you a lot of information in a single location that will prevent you from having to comb through multiple other volumes
