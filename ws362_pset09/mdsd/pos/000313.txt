As a graphic designer, I spend most of my time on the computer and have sorely missed creating with my hands. This book is bringing me back to that in an exciting way. Contrary to some reviewers I am very glad the book doesn't indulge too much in Photoshop instruction (although it does give information about  Photoshop that is most relevant to the processes, like print specifications). That would be a waste of space because there are a gazillion Photoshop books out there, but these techniques are much more rare and need as much space as possible to teach them. The authors do a great job of this. Very clear, thoughtful and succint writing. No wasted words. 
To experiment with all these processes could take years, which means to me that the book is a valuable investment. The imagery is extremely inspiring (especially Krause's). It's much more sophisticated than the cover art would lead you to believe. There are some images where I still wonder "how did she do THAT?" when it comes to things like assembling clear polycarbonate (which is the only material I'm having trouble finding) over a tin panel or a mirror, but that doesn't lessen the quality or usefulness of the book. I hope that, someday, they come out with a second edition
