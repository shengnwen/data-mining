Having trained mostly in Japanese martial arts I was not very familiar with Filipino styles. This book gives a very good overview of both the different styles and the people instrumental in their development. Some of the photo sequences are better than others but don't expect to learn any FMA from this book. That is not an especially negative comment because you can not learn most martial arts from a book. Its strong point is that it may help you decide which style you would like to explore and give you direction as you look for a person to study under. This book is also a very nice tribute to the people who have expanded and preserved their native arts
