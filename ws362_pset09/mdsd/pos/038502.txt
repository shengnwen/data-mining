Quirky apropos of its publisher, Quirk Books, "Extreme Encounters" is formatted like one of those books to keep in the bathroom: the information is fascinating but not sufficiently in depth for anything more than morbid curiosity. Nevertheless, this is a fun little book to read, with anecdotes of demise as diverse as the effects of a shark attack to Civil War amputations. In a break from the subject matter (which mostly deal with death or dismemberment), author Greg Emmanuel also describes the experiences of sky diving and rocketing into space in a Gemini capsule.

Emmanuel is definitely on to something with "Extreme Encounters". We are drawn by our fears toward descriptions of what scares us the most, and the author does describe some of the neurological processes that govern our behavior while under life-threatening stress, but the book is a little haphazard and mixed-one can envision a series of books on this topic, more in depth, with the non-lethal, purely experiential anecdotes such as sky diving filling a book of their own. 

A consistent theme in this book is our neurological responses to stress in life-threatening situations. Readers can get more information about these responses than Emmanuel offers with Laurence Gonzales' book "Deep Survival".
