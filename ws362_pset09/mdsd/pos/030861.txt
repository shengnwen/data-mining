I have a casual interest in the topics discussed in this book. One of the first books I read on this was by Ray Kurzweil, while interesting it kind of leaves you none the wiser on the way technology\computing\machines will progress in the long term. I say that simply because I expected Rays book to conclude the way it did. 

However Jeffs book here is really a brilliant book, it gave me a totally new perspective on intelligent machines, what it means to be intelligent and how human intelligence works. Its a simple theory which I think makes sense, simple theories are usual correct.

Jeff also has a great style of writing which allows non-scientific people like myself to understand what he is trying to explain. There is one fairly detailed chapter which I skipped over as it was a little too scientific for me but its not important in order to understand his points at a higher level.

Highly recommended book. I would to see Ray Kurzweil and Jeff Hawkins discuss their two points of views sometime (there are overlaps in their views but they differ on some things)
