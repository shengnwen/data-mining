Stephan Schwartz has written one of the classics in the field of consciousness research. This book should be in the collection of everyone serious about understanding psychic functioning. The book is beautifully written, and the arguments its makes are very compelling.  The first chapters tell the stories of some extraordinary people who have used their psychic abilities to locate archaeological sites.  The later chapters give the reader a context in which to consider this information. I found it a rare pleasure.
