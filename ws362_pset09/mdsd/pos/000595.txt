For a long while I went in circles over the "mystery" of my lost friendships and wondered how other people managed with hardly a bump in the road...and then this book found it's way into my life.    The stories are so heartfelt that at points I had to wait days to read another one.  It's a well thought out collection and one that will stand the test of time for all friendships long term or just made.  Ann Hood's selection is one that I won't soon forget. Thank You to all of these writers for putting into words how it truely is,no matter how hard that may be
