I found this book to be tremendously practical and helpful in preparing against disaster -- both natural and manmade.  The author has compiled, organized and condensed a myriad of information from FEMA and other government sources into a readable and useful format.  The charts were handy guides on what every household should have on hand in order to prepare for emergencies of many kinds.  The author recommended several different kinds of "survival packs" one can prepare for use at home or while out and about -- even an extremely portable "pocket pack" to help one get safely out of an urban terrorist attack.  The book was down-to-earth, emphasizing being prepared in order to help others, rather than a survivalist "me against the world" mentality.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, whether you live in the city, country or suburbia
