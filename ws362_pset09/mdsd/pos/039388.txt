Having read the incredibly disappointing Darwinia (a book whose title was the high point), I was not expecting much from another Wilson.  But the jacket looked interesting, and the bookstore was going out of business, so I was able to get it for an incredibly cheap price.  I had rather low expectations.  It's nice to be substantially surprised.

Chronoliths is exquisitly written.  Wilson grabs the reader from the very beginning and pulls you along at a breathtaking pace.  The characters are deeply painted and deeply felt; the world Wilson creates is both believable and imaginative.  Having lived overseas I could identify with the thoughts and actions of the expat Americans in Vietnam.  Initially America is as it is now, at the top of the heap.  And then as the chronoliths appear, the country becomes progressively more and more dilapidated, entering a 2/3rds world level.  This was also well described and believable.  I felt with the characters, and could easily imagine such a country.

Not everything is explained in this novel in terms of the science, but not everything needs to be.  The important thing is that there is resolution that both explains the larger issue and resolves all of the various plot threads.  This was a very fine book.
