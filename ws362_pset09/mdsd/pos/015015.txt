Introducing Postmodernism is a basic introduction to Postmodern thought. As it is a basic introduction, it does not go very far into depth on any one aspect of Postmodern thought. Still, it clearly represents the main aspects of Postmodernism namely, legitimization, reproducibility and hyper reality. Before reading this book I had no idea what Postmodernism was, now at least I have some idea. The book includes a useful list of books for further reading at the end. Also, you can read about some of the main thinkers in other totem books for example Introducing Derrida.
