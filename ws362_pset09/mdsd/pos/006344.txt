The author's approach toward economic data is very refreshing, in that he works quite hard at finding data that is predictive of stock market declines.  Just the chapter on the "recession obsession", and why its bad for you makes the whole book worthwhile.  It really put a lot of economic numbers in perspective, and made me realize it was actually possible to use economic numbers to your advantage.  

I would also add that his writing style is very easy to follow.  While it definitely helps if you have some background in economics, it is really not necessary.
