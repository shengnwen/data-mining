Simply one of the best books I've ever read!  You have to read it to understand.  It's written from the perspective of a living dinosaur---a raptor---by an author who loves dinosaurs and has an incredible ability to recreate the world in which they lived.  Read it and you'll never forget it!  Has my highest recommendation
