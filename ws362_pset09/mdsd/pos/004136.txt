Summary: Navajo code talkers, is about marines using Navajo language to get messages to the frontline to where ever. The commanders where so impressed with the Navajo's speed of translation and accuracy they went to reservations to get any Navajo volunteer who wanted to join. It is also about the Navajo trusting the United States after the long walk. This is related to World War 2 because it is in the same time as Pearl Harbor was bombed. I liked the book because of the movie I watched about code talkers. The edgy title got me interested to. I also like to study World War 2.
