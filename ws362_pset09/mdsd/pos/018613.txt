This is a fine collection of crime novels in a durable, easy to read   format.  It starts off great with &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;, the all  time best trip through a killer's mind.  The selections by Highsmith and  Goodis, while not as intense as &quot;Killer&quot;, are just as good in  their own quieter ways.  The only novel I would have left out is  &quot;Pickup&quot;; while I like Willeford I think this is one of his more  leaden performances.  I also have a quibble with the volume's title, as the  word &quot;noir&quot; has been beaten to death and doesn't tell us much  about most of these books.  &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; owes more  to Henry James than to Raymond Chandler, and &quot;Killer&quot; doesn't  feature any dark city streets.  Quibbles aside, however, the book is well  worth buying
