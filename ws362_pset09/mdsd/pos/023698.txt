I don't think this continuation in the series was as good as "Caught Stealing", but I couldn't wait to read it. This novel picks up several years (about 3 I think) after Hank's departure from New York with the 4 million. Hank is now living in Mexico, part owner/silent partner of a bar, swimming and attempting to heal from the mess that went down years before, when a Russian backpacker comes to town. Again we see Hank caught up in circumstances beyond his control. Hank is now not only fighting for his life, but the ones he loves (his parents). We ride again in Hank's rollercoaster of misfortune. Will he survive? Get the second novel in the series and enjoy. Although not as good as the first one, Huston deserves credit for being gritty and creative. What I wondered at the end of the novel, was would we see ever see the cat again?
