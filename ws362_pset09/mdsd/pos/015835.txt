This cookbook has been one of my favorites ever since it first came out in 1990.  Now 15 years later, it is ripped, worn, bent, curry stained and I'm buying a new copy. The recipes taste great,  have greatly enhanced my family's health and vitality and been enjoyed by many friends. But it's not just a cookbook.  The authors bless us with an Ayurvedic perspective on diet, constitution, lifestyle and body/mind/spirit healing and also clarify contemporary health issues related to sugar, dairy products and soyfoods in the light of ancient wisdom.  This book is beautifully written, intelligently conceived and vibrates with wisdom and love.
