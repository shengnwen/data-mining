Greg Rucka's run on the relaunched solo Wolverine title had it's share of up's and down's, and upon his departure after signing an exclusive deal with DC, Marvel enlisted Ultimates scribe Mark Millar to take over the book and inject some life into it, and boy does he.  Beginning with an investigation that leads to the discovery of an alliance between Hydra, the Hand, and an organization called the Dawn of the White Light.  This alliance has a grand scheme, and Wolverine is in the center of it as he finds himself being captured and obeying the voice in his head: telling him to kill.  Soon, Nick Fury, Elektra, and the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. are on his trail in an attempt to bring him down as a brainwashed Wolverine sets his sights on taking down the Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Elektra, and even his fellow X-Men.  The surprisingly edgy storytelling by Millar is a welcome addition to the character, while the pencils by the great John Romita, Jr. with inks by Dark Knight Returns inker Klaus Janson give Enemy of the State an awesome look.  If you missed out on the single issues and you're a Wolverine fan, definitely pick this up, and by the time you get to the last page, you'll be salivating to see what happens next
