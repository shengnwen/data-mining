It is very easy on the surface to not like Marie Antoinette. The spoiled French Queen who when told of the starving population of France was demanding bread supposedly said "Let them eat cake." Antonia Fraser goes beyond this stereotype and delivers a very captivating look at the real woman beyond the rumors and hearsay of the French Revolution.

Born the last daughter and 15th child of the formidable Austrian Empress Maria Teresa, Marie Antonia was brought up in the opulence of Vienna. When she was 9 years old her father Emperor Francis died. When she was 15 she was married to her second cousin Louis August the grandson of Louis XV of France as well as the Dauphin of France.

They lived together for several years while their relations (especially her mother) and courtiers waited for an heir to the throne of France to secure the Franco-Austrian alliance that led to their marriage.

Several years after the marriage they became King and Queen of France after the death of Louis XV and shortly afterward became the parents of a girl Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte and shortly afterward of Louis Joseph (the Dauphin of France) and Louis Charles (The Duke of Normandy.)

Even before the French Revolution tragedy struck the family. Another daughter had died several months after her birth and then the Dauphin died as well.

Then the French Revolution happened and the family became prisoners of the Revolutionaries. Louis was shortly afterward put on trial and executed. Several months later the "Widow Capet" was also put on trial and executed while her two surviving children were still held prisoners. 

A very captivating book about the life of Marie Antoinette!!
