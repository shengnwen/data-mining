This is one of the best monographs I've read. Often I get books an an aritst I like, and can't get through the awful text, I end up just looking at the pictures. The text in this book adds so much to my understanding of the work, by detailing the progression of his ideas through the years, and clearly describing the installations. The writing is very clear, I found myself reading it as if it were a novel
