I thought this book dragged at first, but then it picked up.  I think I will enjoy the Charlotte and Pitt mysteries.  Pitt reminded me of Columbo and I enjoyed that image in my mind while reading this.  There were parts I found unbelievable, but sometimes that just part of a good yarn.  
It seemed that Perry gave us a descriptive image of what things were like in that time and place.  I'm looking forward to reading her second novel in the Charlotte and Pitt series
