This is one of the most beautifully-written novels that I've ever read. The characters are interesting and you feel for all of them, whether you intially like them or not. It's probably better than the film and the descriptions and prose certainly top the movie's visuals, as good as they are. The only problem with the novel is the conclusion. The finale feels rushed, incomplete and just strange. It doesn't really fit with the rest of the novel and is quite jarring
