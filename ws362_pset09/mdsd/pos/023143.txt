I've read all the In Death series books and this is another in a line of great involving books.  I can hardly wait until Nora Roberts/J. D. Robb writes another one!  At least I truly hope she continues to write them, I'm not ready to let go of Eve and Roarke yet, hopefully that's a long way off still.
