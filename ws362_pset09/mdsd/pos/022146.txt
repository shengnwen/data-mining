Although I don't have any children, I like to keep toys and children's books around for when I have little visitors.  This book especially caught my eye because I have a bulldog who has had the same adventures as Noelle!  My girl, Patch, can't keep up with her long-legged doggie friends, and she can't swim either!  So obviously, Gloria Estefan was inspired by true goings-on with her real bulldog!
On the whole, the story is really precious, and the illustrations are as cute as can be.  I cannot wait for my friend's little boy to come over to play and read the book with me
