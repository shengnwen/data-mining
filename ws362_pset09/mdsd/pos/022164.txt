Marcus Didius Falco, what a character.  As if there aren't enough books to read set in modern times, there are excellent stories set in the past as well.  I buy these things and let them sit on the shelf and then when I  have the time to pick them up, I can't put them down.  If you enjoy  historical fiction and a good mystery story, read all of these, maybe skim  a few pages here and there, but enjoy, enjoy, enjoy
