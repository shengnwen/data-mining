"Mind of My Mind" is the story of Mary, a psychic approaching her "transition" at which point she will find out what abilities she really has.  She was bred for the purpose by a body-changing being named Doro.

While this may sound like just another sci-fi book, it's not.  All the characters are well-drawn, and within the first 100 pages you have eleven developed characters.  Almost everyone acts in a realistic fashion, even given the bizarre circumstances.  At times I even found myself asking why this book hadn't been made into a movie yet.  I could pick out certain high-profile actors who would have been perfect for the parts, and by simply copying the book word-for-word they would have produced an Oscar winner.  Virtually every line of dialogue rings of human emotion that would satisfy any critic, while also giving the masses something enjoyable.

The second half of the book is a bit less drama and more science fiction than the first, but events are taking place that change the rules applying to the psychics, so the rules have to be redrawn for the reader.  The story remains great.

The only problem I have is the POV changes.  The story is told from numerous POVs in 3rd person, but in a scene about Mary it is told from first person.  I found this a little distracting, but it's still a great read
