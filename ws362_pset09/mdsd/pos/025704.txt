Michener does an amazing job spanning the centuries of South Africa's history. His sensitive treatment of the difficult moral issues raised by racism is even-handed although not non-judgmental. That is, Michener clearly condemns apartheid both morally and predictively - he has his characters predict that apartheid will be on the way out by the end of the twentieth century. Since this book was written before apartheid ended it is fascinating to read the predictions that Michener's characters make about South Africa's future, especially the view that two states - black and Afrikaaner - would emerge. 

I gave Covenant four stars because I was disappointed that Michener did not include more stories from the perspective of black South Africans. I suspect that, for material prior to the 20th century, this may have been due to a lack of historical matierals. However, for the part of the book dealing with the 20th century, there are too few black freedom fighters as protagonists relative to the English and Afrikaaner characters. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in gaining an introduction to the broad sweep of South African history, though it should be supplemented with stories written by black South Africans (i.e., something like Mandela's autobiography)
