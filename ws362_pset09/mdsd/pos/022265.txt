The idea that there is a physical component to every psychological problem has always intigued me, and I had previously read a number of Alexander Lowen's books, and found them fascinating. Recently, I became very depressed over something in my life, a failure on my part to achieve something which on the surface level I could say to myself it's understandable, but beneath the surface I was judging myself very harshly. I went into therapy and also bought a number of self help / psychology books, nothing seemed to help much. I was having some pretty extreme physical tensions, and I remembered about Lowen and Bioenergetics. So I got this book, and what I can say is that doing some of the exercises in the book, in particular some of the exercises dealing with expressing anger, helped considerably. And it helped where the normal self help books did nothing. If you are having difficulty in your life and you find yourself interested in this approach, I recommend this book. It certainly won't cost you much and you might be surprised at it's impact.
