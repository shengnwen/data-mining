Julia and Patrick have to do a project for the Wiggle club.  Wiggle is the pet name for the WGGL (work grow give live) club, an extra curricular organization similar to 4H. The two kids partner up to do a project that can go to the state fair as both an animal husbandry and domestic  arts entry. When Julia's mother suggests raising silkworms, Patrick is excited because such a project was unheard of. Julia is anxious because it is too Korean. Linda Sue Park meets all expectations as an author and writes a wonderfully entertaining story. Park does a great job in staying focused  on the life of one girl, yet touching on tangents of other issues. Julia Song is a well-developed character that grows beyond her personal limitations to understand herself, hermother, little brother, and friend. In the character of Julie, readers experience the life of a young girl who learns to reconcile being Korean and American. It is refreshing to read about an experience with a world that in many ways is not Black and White.  In less drastic, yet by no means less dramatic ways, one is confronted with the issue of animal husbandry and cruelty. Julie learns that to get the silk, she must kill the pupae, which she has grown to love. Unlike other popular examples of Asian American literature, Project Mulberry is not riddled with flashbacks; it stays in one single narrative that is direct and still charming. Project Mulberry is a good read for third to fifth grade students.
