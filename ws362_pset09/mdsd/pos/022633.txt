I had a degree in Computer Science from a respectable university when I read the book. Still, I learned from the book so much that I realized I barely scratched the surface of OO design before reading it. 

It teaches OO Analysis and Design using many techniques, such as writing use cases, modeling the business domain, drawing UML diagrams, using CRC cards, and going through agile iterative development cycles.

This book will not only provide you with a chance to learn OO Design, but also requirements gathering, analysis, and basic architecture and project management
