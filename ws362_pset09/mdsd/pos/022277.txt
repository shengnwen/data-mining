I recommend this book only for the diehard Rushdie fans.  It has a lot of similiarites to one of his other books, Midnight's Children,-the weaving between fantasy and reality, the slightly amused but occasionally serious tone, the scathing critique of real-life middle east/Pakistan/India politics.  What it lacks is cohesion, I considered it a bit difficult to wade through.  I do disagree with a previous reviewer, you really need to give this book one hundred pages to see if you like it, by then it's too late, might as well finish.  Read Midnight's Children first, and if you hate or are lukewarm to that story, stay clear of this one.  Otherwise, enjoy
