If you hope to share vicariously any of Mozart's amatory escapades, this book will disappoint you. There are cautious suggestions of romantic entanglements, but there is also the overwhelming depiction of Mozart as a man who spent most of his waking hours composing and playing music, as any reasonable person should imagine. If you hope to penetrate very deeply in Mozart's pysche or intellect, you may also be slightly disappointed; author Jane Glover chooses to approach the composer largely from the outside, from the influence on his career of his father, wife, and the many women musicians with whom he worked. With those two warnings in mind, I can strongly recommend the book as compelling reading. The text is segmented: The first third is a concise biography of Mozart from his birth to his early death, focused chiefly on his struggle to make an independent living as a musician. The second third addresses the practical factors of performance and specific performers that shaped Mozart's operas. The third follows the lives of Mozart's sister, wife, and other women companions after Mozart's death. One could choose to read each segment as a separate article, and I suspect most readers will be most thrilled by the first third of the book. There is something eminently sensible and polite (dare I say British?) about Jane Glover's writing style, which I found delightfully incongruous when applied to the rambunctious, impish, scatological, scattered manchild who composed such grand music
