I discovered the White Company while reading Louis Lamour's "Education of A Wondering Man".  It was included in Lamours reading list from the 1930's.  On a lark i checked it out.

What a gem this book is!  I simply could not put it down.  The language, the characters, the history and the humor simply crackle off the pages.
