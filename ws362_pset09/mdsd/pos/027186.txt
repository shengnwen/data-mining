I recall reading this book in my young pre-teen innocent years.
I remember that I could not put the book down!  So I decided to see if it was as good as I thought it was.  I was stunned to see the few passages that exemplified the bigotry of the day.  But, I must confess, I again found myself giggling and unable to put the book down.  And I give the book 4 stars with a humble apology to some of my dear friends
