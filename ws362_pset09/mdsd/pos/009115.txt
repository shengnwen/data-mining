This recording is done very well.  Even though the info in this book is tough to follow Martin Shaw does n excelent job at the pronouciations and making the story line flow.  I know I couldn't have sat down & read the text version of this book, but being able to listen to it made a difference and now I understand the Lord of the Rings Trilogy better
