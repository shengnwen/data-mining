Yes, it's ANOTHER book on the Beatles, but from a unique viewpoint this time: someone who was actually in the studio with the Fab Four.  Emerick has his biases about the lads (just like everyone else), and he probabaly won't change anyone's opinion about their favorite, except maybe George Martin, who is presented as a bit manipulative.  I found myself constantly reaching for my Zune to listen for things I had never noticed, even on songs I had heard hundreds of times before!  A wonderful insight into the innovations that came about due to the "primitive" equipment of the 1960s.  He speeds over his later careeer with other artists, but of course the book's subtitle is "My Life Recording the Music of the BEATLES," not America or Gino Vanelli
