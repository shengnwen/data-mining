it's Nietzsche's "eternal return" but this time in terms of war-mongering, not self-loathing... I witnessed Mr. Berman on 
C-SPAN, as interviewed w/ Brian Lamb, and it was truly wrenching to watch such a lucid writer fumble his words... the text is terse yet yields an ample understanding of the recurrent nature of turbulent times such as the nascent 21st Century... perfect for the "short attention span" of the 'average joe american'
