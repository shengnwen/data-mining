This is a small book, but it starts with a detailed map inside the front cover that shows cities, airports, main roads, ferry ports and rail lines.  It has ferry routes between the islands of Scotland and from points in Scotland to Ireland.  There are great pictures of just about everything from cows to castles.  It has lists of the best hotels, restaurants, pubs and places to visit on Scotland's islands.  If you drink there are places you can enjoy the best malt whiskey.  I'm not a golfer but I loved the section on golf courses after years of watching the British Open.  The book is divided into three sections:  Scotland's Top 10 castles, fishing spots, golf courses, etc.  The middle of the book takes you around Scotland by car, train, ferry, etc.  The last section of the book is called "Street Smart" and gives you places to get additional information, how to plan your trip to Scotland, things to avoid, health care and security, the best restaurants, and hotels (from budget to bed and breakfast).  The book is about 6 inches long and four inches across, but easy to read.  It has much more information than I expected
