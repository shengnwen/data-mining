For anyone fascinated by the customs and dress of the American Indians, this book is a rich reference.  The adaptation of materials found in nature along with the practicality of clothing in different regions provides interesting reading for hours.  Anyone who thinks all Indians dressed alike in drab buckskins or adorned themselves or wore their hair alike needs to read about the skill and beauty involved in making their wonderful clothing and jewelry. It would be nice to see more photos and some color pictures, but it is still a great book!  My only disappointment is in the choice of the word &quot;costume&quot; in the title.  Go to any Pow Wow and you'll see today's Indians cringe at that term as it implies dressing up as something they are not.  &quot;Regalia&quot; is their preferred term for their outfits.  I recommend this book
