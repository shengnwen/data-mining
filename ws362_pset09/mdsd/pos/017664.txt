I never had a weight problem but after turning 45, age, gravity and a lifetime of careless eating began to take its toll.  For seven years I tried to lose 10 pounds that I thought would make a difference.  I had no idea how difficult that could be.  Whether it was metabolism or ineffective diets, I don't know, but nothing worked.  On a cruise last summer, the nutritionist suggested The Zone for my age, body type and goals.  I got the Barry Sears Zone books and started the diet, with immediate weight loss as a result.  I loved the idea of the Zone but found the system difficult to follow.  Finding The Formula was a stroke of luck.  The pounds melted off and I never &quot;dieted.&quot;  I have a new way of eating and I love it.  I had fifteen pounds weight loss (141 pounds to 126) with no effort.  I love the healthy, balanced meals and can't thank the Daousts enough for making a great diet even better.  It is way of life for me and something I want to pass on to my kids and grandkids.   A friend of mine just told me of her 22 pound weight loss and credits the great recipes in The Formula book that made it so easy for her.  Don't hesitate to try it--what you will lose is weight and what you will gain is a balanced and healthy way of eating that makes more difference than just weight loss
