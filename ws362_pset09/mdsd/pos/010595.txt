I never was required to read this book in school and only picked it up 20 years later at the continued insistance of a friend.  I hesitated to read it, not thinking I would like it, and to my surprise I loved the book.  Not only is it a great read but Harper Lee is a masterful storyteller whose prose and craft are exceptional.  I think I may need to reread it in the future
