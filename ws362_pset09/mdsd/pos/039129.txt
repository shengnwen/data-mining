writing a series is not easy, but to repeat the former ones again and again with too many pages, introducing the background of certain characters and incidents again and again to most of the readers who already decided to stick to the series long before, sometimes, are simply too tiresome, not only slowing down the tempo but also making readers quite impatient. flynn's mitch rapp series got such problem and it's beginning to show more pages are wasted in such backstories touch-up. 
for an c.i.a. operator, flynn also put in too much romance for this guy. of course, it might make the hero look more real and more vulnerable to himself, but it's also a turn-off. i've kept reading rapp chanting 'honey' this and 'honey' that and 'i want sex' again and again like a rapper. not too good for this kinda series. i think that mr flynn might also feel that way in the long run and decide to get his sweetheart of the chart in 'consent to kill'. that's a good decision came a bit too late.
