I've always loved the story of the Lion, the witch and the wardrobe, but was rather unfamiliar with the other stories in the series. Passport to Narnia was an entertaining, effective introduction to the entirety of the tales of CS Lewis. I found the condensed life history of CS Lewis to be interesting and informative, and easy to read. The highlight of the book for me were the illustrations by Tim Kirk, especially the full page of Aslan going to the altar. As a collector, I also really enjoyed an introduction to some of the merchandise. I bought Peter on the unicorn as a result, which should be arriving shortly! I'm glad the author didn't focus on the smaller merchanside such as the toys... they are poorly made. Rather dissapointing after the vast amount of Tolkien merchanside that was available.
Thanks for the introduction into Narnia, George!
