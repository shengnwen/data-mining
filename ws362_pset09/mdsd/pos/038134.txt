One of the great things about Inside Oscar 2 is how detailed it is about the movies that were not just nominated but were contenders. You really get a clear picture of the years 1995 to 2000. The writing is strong and there are some very funny passages in the book. One of the drawbacks is how opinionated the book is. In Inside Oscar there may be some brief sentences on how a some critic or critics disliked a movie. That was fine. Here you have Bona going on and on about how he disliked it and while sometimes that can be funny, I am not sure it follows the path set by Inside Oscar. Exceptions in Inside Oscar the years 1993 and 1994. The book is strong enough that it still is worth reading and owning even with that flaw.
