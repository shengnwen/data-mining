After reading numerous Ludlum novels I thought I had reached a point where I just couldn't take it anymore. You can only take so many one word sentences, italics, exclamation points, and wasted pages of a conversation happening on the other side of the world.
That has all changed with Janson Directive. This was a very well written book. It seemed to have more action than the average Ludlum and one hell of a main character, Paul Janson. The sniper scene reads like Clancy with all the intricate details.  It's good to read a book by Ludlum that employs more of today's technology. For instance in the Bourne Identity, Jason is constantly running for pay phones. Now our hero Janson simply goes online to CNN.com to get his information. 
Non Ludlum readers beware, even though there is a good amount of action that moves the story along, it is still a long one. 700 pages paperback!!! 
I really liked it. It might be better than my all time Ludlum fave, The Matarese Circle. It's too bad Janson couldn't have had a few novels dedicated to his days with the DIA or his time on his new job with his new partner (which you have to read the epilogue to see what I mean).
Janson vs Bourne. I'd take Janson
