Up front, I believe David Bohm was one of the most outstanding thinkers of the 20th century, if not the whole of human existence. Like removing the layers of an onion, he peels away the often faulty assumptions we all live with and quickly gets to the heart of the matter.  WHY and HOW we think the way we do are indeed more vital to understand than WHAT we think.   Rational thought and creativity are two of mankind's most valuable traits, and these are explored in detail between the pages of this book.  For any student of Postmodernist thinking Bohm is a "must read", and in fact his writings are the centerpoint of Postmodernist Philosophy in my opinion. If everyone took the time to read Bohm they would understand themselves and our world much better
