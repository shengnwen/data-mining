I really enjoyed this book, it is filled with a lot of short stories that take place all over the world.  As a surfer, many of the places are easy to recognize and the author writes in the fashion that is easy to visualize yourself there.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everyone - surfer and non - surfer
