Ha Jin's novel "In the Pond" is one of the purest and most elegant works of fiction that I have read recently.  I felt that I was reading lines of poetry, as unadorned and profound as an ode by Lao-Tzu.  Jin writes of an artist's confrontation with the oppressive Communist system, but Jin's story is more about the individual asserting the power of the self against the monolith and the artist against the philistines.  This novel can be finished in an hour, but its spare, simple truths resonate long after.
