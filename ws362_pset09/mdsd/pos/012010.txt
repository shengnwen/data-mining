When Maggie Nesbitt finds out she's pregnant she is despondent, because her famous news man husband isn't the father. Plus she suspects he might be involved with a younger woman. Then through a quirk of fate she finds out the twin she thought had died when she was a child is still alive. Happy at the chance to meet her sister, she rushes to her apartment, only to find her sister's ex-husband harrasing his daughter. Maggie pretends to be her sister, shoos the man away and follows the girl into her apartment, where she sees on television that a body found behind a gay bar has been identified as her.

Instantly Maggie knows that someone has killed her twin and the police have made a mistake with the identification. After careful thought Maggie takes over her sister's life. This solves her problem with the baby, plus it keeps her niece from having to go and live with her awful father. However there is one very serious problem that Maggie doesn't know about. The killer wasn't trying to kill Maggie, he was after sister. And he is very upset when he finds out the woman he's killed has come back to life.

This thriller had me biting my nails all the way through. I loved Maggie, she was so believable and I really felt like her plight was mine. I liked her pal Gordon, the ex-FBI agent as well and strangely enough I really liked the Killer, Horace Nighthyde, but I liked Ma, his fat and blind mother best of all. You can't go wrong with this one
