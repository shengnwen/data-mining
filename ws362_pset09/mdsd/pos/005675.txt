16 Ways to Love Your Lover is an excellent relationship handbook. Its an easy introduction to the 16 temperaments and would be especially beneficial for those who's significant others are of a different temperament to  themselves. Even though it is aimed at couples the principles of  understanding/relating to others is very helpful. It gives practical  everyday life advice, from communication to sex and money matters. The book  gives short examples of couples which helps you to see the different  temperaments in action and there are excellent graphs that can help you  solve/understand differences or trouble spots between you both. Apart from  all this, I also found it helpful in specifying my own needs and wants in a  relationship. If you want to improve your relationships, or understand  yourself better, its definitely worth a read
