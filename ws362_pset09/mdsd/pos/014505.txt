As a history teacher, I first became interested in WW1 in college.  John keegan fired some of that interest.  His work here is very detailed in places and short in others; however, maybe that was his intention.  The  20th century material is excellent.  While I struggle with the earlier  histories, I found the writing done well. I would recommend this book to  anyone who teaches a World History or Western Civ. class because the  readings are usually concise enough to share with students and have an  immediate impact.  Like I said, the WW1 writing is horrific and awesome at  the same time
