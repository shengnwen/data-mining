Having recently read 'Fools Crow' for my history class at the University of Oklahoma, I still am debating on how much/little I enjoyed this novel. We read it in class as an example of the terrors enforced upon America's Native Americans around 1870, and in this sense, it's a very effective piece of historical fiction. As a narrative, it encapsulates the reader within the Blackfeet tribe unlike any other book I've ever read. Everything tribal custom is discussed: religion, tribal structure, and the effect of Westward Expansion as mentioned earlier. The only real beef I have with 'Fools Crow' is the ending, which frustrated me on a level previously unfathomable (The ending is also why I gave the book a 4 and not a 5), but if you're looking for good historical fiction, check this one out
