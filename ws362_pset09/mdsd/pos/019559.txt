Surely all modern adventure stories, movies, etc. must trace their roots back to Sir H. Rider Haggard. H. Rider Haggard's books must be the original adventure stories. This one is a classic, no, the classic.

To get the full worth from this book, you must transport yourself back to 1895 or whenever this story was written, when Africa was unexplored, when gentlemen were gentlemen and savages were savages. Yes, it's very un-PC, but that's the price you must pay. Remember, you are reading the first adventure stories, at the time of your G-G-G-G-great grandfather.


Cons-
The prose is very old fashioned, and is somewhat difficult to read, you must read it slowly as it's so different from modern books. And like one of the reviewers said, "it's full of cliches" because it has been copied so many times. It reminds me of part about the eclipse, apart from HRH, I've also seen it used in an Enid Blyton book, and a Tintin book, surely HRH was the first to use it, but not the last.

I first read this book in the 60's before the plethora of modern adventure stories, so I don't know if any modern reader will get as much out of it as I did, but give it a chance
