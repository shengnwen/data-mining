My 4th grade teacher read this to us. She made us put our heads on our desk while she read to us, we all felt we were much too old for this book but were instantly drawn in and couldn't wait till she got to the end. I loved this book as a child, and as a parent, and now a grandparent. If your younger child loves Harry Potter, this is a great book, especially for a girl. It has a strong female protagonist and just enough humor,  as well as mystery and magic, to keep everyone interested
