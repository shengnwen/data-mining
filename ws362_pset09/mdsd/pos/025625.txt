Bramah sure can spin a phrase. The book is a collection of stories told by Kai Lung, and as such is excellent. You are transported back into this fictional China, where introductions can take hours as the two people flatter each other &amp; humble themselves endlessly. The stories are very amusing, but be forewarned; the language takes some time to read through &amp; comprehend. Not a book to breeze through (but oh so rewarding when you do read it!
