Absolutely the best/our most referenced book in our library, the Dictionary of Cultural Literacy is a MUST HAVE for your home. I have the original and it is our most used reference book. Simply put, I would not be without it. Basically, E.D. Hirsch and four or five other Harvard University professors got together and decided what they would like the average American High School graduate to know. 

It's an amazing compilation.

The chronology is good. The layout/sections are logical. 
It's cross-referenced (different font indicates further information) 
There are illustrations and maps; this is not a picture book by any means. 

Cultural Literacy is THE BEST you'll ever find. It is not the most in depth tome nor does it intend to be. You don't need to know every battle of the Civil War for instance. Therein lies the "problem" of encyclopedias and such -- the plethora of minutia oft times seems to overwhelm versus inform. Cultural Literacy provides a concise overview.

It covers everything -- literally, finding things missing is difficult. 

Okay, ours (the First/and buy in hard-cover because the paperback versions are junk/fall apart) didn't have:
Mother Teresa
My Very Elegant Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas (the planets)
Bataan Death March
AIDS 
(The kidlets thought Halloween should have been included as well.)

Still, as an overview of knowledge, you'll be impressed. I would be surprised if you didn't find things that you'd forgotten in the book. I'd be equally surprised if you didn't agree with the contents. Your challenge will be to find things missing. So have fun. And buy the book. :)

J, who seldom recommends paying retail -- but for this one, it's worth the price.

P.S. - Anyone with a child in school needs this book in their home - suitable from about Year 2 onward. Remember that "concise overview" is just what you need for younger ones. Older of course will derive many more benefits. I've learned things from the pages as well.
