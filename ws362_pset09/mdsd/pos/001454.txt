it should say how valuable the knowledge is.  The lawyer who said the book is tough-going should be ignored as he addressed no content in the book.

Get it from ANY library, read one chapter, and pursue YOUR interest in our wretched government's tyranical tendency!  If the 1st chapter hits, buy the book anywhere you want and study it!  Be free
