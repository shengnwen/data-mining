After many years trying to find a decent introduction to the writing and stroke order of Japenese and Chinese characters I was very pleased with the book's content and found I was able to produce recognisable calligraphy in  my work almost immediately. The only downside is as a beginner I was left  feeling a litte confused to the Katakana spellings and how to correlate  them and also I think you will need some sort of calligraphy practice  before tackling these
