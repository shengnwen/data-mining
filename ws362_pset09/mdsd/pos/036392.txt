I got this book after Mrs. Garrett was referenced by Edgar Cayce. I am diving into this world and trying to learn as much about it as possible. Mrs. Garrett is a very facinating person and has many perspectives concerning the paranormal. This book was difficult to navigate at times and tended to digress a fair bit. I felt that Mrs. Garrett had many insights and I believe her to be a very gifted medium. I hoped for more information on how exactly she would go into her "trance" but got the feeling she herself was not quite sure. She is also lighthearted in her approach and maintains that she and we could all be crazy...lol. I like the fact that she did not take herself to seriously and I think this aspect of her personality only gave her more credibility.
It's an interesting read
