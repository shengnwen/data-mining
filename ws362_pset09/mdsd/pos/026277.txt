To cover South American independence movements in the 19th. century in one book is almost impossible.This is the case with &quot;Liberators&quot;. The research the author has done for his book is very exhaustive and well done, and the bibliography is  very extensive and thorough.The author covers too much &quot;events&quot;, and not as much the reasons many of these events took place. Tremendous emphasis is placed on General San Martin.The data is correct and thorough as to events. However, quite frequently the philosophical and historical reasons that prompted privileged people, such as a San Martin and a Bolivar to undertake such herculean tasks as liberating huge continents with very meager military resources lacks depth. Probably due to the fact that the author is British, heavy emphasis is placed on relatively minor English figures(such as Cochran and others.) While no one denies the importance of these English Navy volunteers, their contribution to the independence of Chile and Argentina pales in comparison to the contributions of national patriots.Perhaps because the author has a book on Cochran, such importance is given to that figure. However, I would rate this as an excellent primer, that should open new alleys for readers who are interested in deepening their knowledge of South American history
