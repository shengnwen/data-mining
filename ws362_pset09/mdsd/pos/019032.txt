I enjoyed this book.  I really liked how Gerard told the story of Ethan and Darcy in flashback style.  You knew they were still in love with each other, and little by little you learned why it did not work out between them.  It was a lot of fun to see how they reconciled their feelings and worked together to see Darcy out of her situation.
