While not an expert by any means, I still learned a lot from this "course".  I especially appreciated the coverage of Burgundy and German wine.  The book is enjoyable to read, very well organized, succinct and does an amazing job of giving a very comprehensive overview of nearly all of the wine regions and varietals of the world.  The sidebars (which can be distracting at times, but worth the effort) are chock full of fascinating information. This book is a must read for the novice and even some more experienced wine lovers
