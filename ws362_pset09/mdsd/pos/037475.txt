	In this story called Jacob's Rescue a Holocaust Story, Jacob is a Jew.  He finds out that he has to go away from his Aunt and his grandma, to live with a German.  The German's name is Alex.  He hides Jacob from the Germans, or any other people who don't like Jews.  Jacob becomes family to Alex and his wife and kids.  Throughout the whole story Jacob is scared and frightened by the Germans.  He doesn't want to get caught.  
	I absolutely loved this book.  I couldn't keep my hands off of it.  It was that good.  I am really interested in the holocaust, so I enjoyed reading it very much.   Anyone who likes reading about history or the holocaust, this is the book for you.  This is based on a true story.  That makes this book a lot more interesting to read.
