I read this book in the audio form against my will for a political book club.  I thought to myself,  "Oh great!  Another liberal tome, telling us liberals how we went wrong and how we need to learn to strategize. blau blau blau..." Instead, I was transported into an America of my dreams, lovingly cradled by Mr. Reich's comforting and hopeful vision of America.  Possessed with a masterful narrating voice, Mr. Reich connects the reader to our rich, democratic traditions and applies these tried and true values to our current problems.  He makes it sound so easy.... I found myself wishing that he was our president.  When I told this to a friend of mine, she noted that "He's probably too short." I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't agree with some of his views on globalism and I thought he was a little too pollyannaish for these times.   If our elected officials would just sit down, read this, and follow the instructions, America would look more like the America that we all claim that it is.  Hopefully, some future president will have this wise and wonderful man on his or her side in the whitehouse again.
