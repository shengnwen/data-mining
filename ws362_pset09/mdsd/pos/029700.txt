I owned this book back when it was first published and the new version is just as good with more updated info such as choosing tack, illness in horses, photos and drawings of what these things look like and detailed info on every aspect of horses and their care. Very good book for a beginner because once read your overall knowledge of horses and their care will be quite good and the type of info you can apply. Also gives you tons of references to organizations,clubs,etc. Great book for horse enthusiasts to own
