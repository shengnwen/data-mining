This comic series is a brillant, fun, mind-bending, though-provoking series unlike anything I've ever seen or read before in any medium. The visual story telling of the comic medium is absolutely perfect for this story. The multiple story arcs are fascinating.

If you're not reading this series already, run, don't walk to the store or the Amazon checkout page to start this series. You WILL NOT be disappointed. I've read the books cover to cover twice since getting them a month ago, and have already read the comics (that I pick up every month like clockwork) start to finish no less than 5 times. 

Great great stuff
