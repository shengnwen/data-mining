This final installment to the Border Trilogy, like the preceding volumes, stands on it own, but stands on it's own less than either of the other two.

This wouldn't be the book to read if you've never read Big Mac before. If you're a hardcore reader, go for Blood Meridian (his best). Or Suttree (his other best). If you're testing the water, and only used to reading pop crime novls or medical mysteries and want to delve a little deeper, start with All the Pretty Horses and work your way into the rest. 

What's it like? Think of Faulkner, then have him write a John Steinbeck story, with Hemmigway editing. 

Mac is better than Steinbeck, has more flower than Hemmingway, not as much as Faulkner.  

But make no mistake, he work is peer to the old masters. America's finest living author.
