As a graduate student studying biochemistry/molecular biology, this book (on the PI's shelf) was a frequent read.  Not only does it explain &quot;old-school&quot; genetic experiments with aplomb, it provides clear and concise examples.  A fine reference for reviewing papers, and a must have for any PI (if only for your students to use as a reference!
