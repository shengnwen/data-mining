This is a good read, solid apologetics and good citations to other sources. But Strobel overhypes his journalistic credentials and an adult, intellectual reader will be frustrated by the occasional superficiality and boasting. I'd highly recommend this book for younger readers, but older or more educated readers may want to go to the original sources cited by Strobel
