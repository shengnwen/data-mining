I have my community college students read Kozol's essays and they always have a strong response leading to debate about thier own education and belief systems. The essays are highly accessible to general readers and  blow the pants off the denser works of the most acclaimed education  theorists.  Like all Kozol's work, On Being a Teacher  book is passionate,  pointed and beautifully written. (Before emerging as a 60s activist, Kozol  was a poet.) He asks us what teaching and schools are for: mantaining an  inequitable status quo or achieving a vibrant democracy that all students  (and teachers)feel they can enter into?  You would be well served to read  it and see what you think! Each short essay addresses a theme having to do  with the ethical and social responsibilities of the teacher.  Topics  include &quot;History from the bottom up,&quot; &quot;The Hero in jail: the  truth will set us free,&quot; and &quot;It is evil to tell lies to  children.&quot; Although this book is almost 20 years old, every essay  still resonates and asks contmeperary questons.  Savor this book if you  have a bit of the revolutionary in you, or if you are feeling like you're  on auto-pilot and need some revolutionary sprit infused into your veins.  Even politically conservative readers like the one above will find they  have an challenging and engaging dialog with this book. As for educators  and parents, On Being a Teacher is a must.  There is only one philosphical  book about education that is more stunning, a book called The Night is Dark  and I am Far From Home, also by Kozol.  Sadly, that book is out of print.   Hopefully that will change. In the meantime, On Being a Teacher continues  to resound
