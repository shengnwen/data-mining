Now, his beloved wife has passed away, and Augie struggles with maintaining a relationship with his son and new grandson while also trying to come to terms with his guilt about past mistakes.

Although the frequent changes in setting could have been disorienting, Canin keeps the reader grounded with use of simple yet enchanting language.  Slowly but surely, the story of Augie's life enfolds, coming to a satisfying conclusion while still leaving the reader with questions about Augie's exact fate.  Sweet without being overly sentimental, this is a short novel with a wide appeal
