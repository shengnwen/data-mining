This is a masterpiece! If nothing else, it's gigantic, thick and full of wonderful pictures. This book is bigger than the phone book! It's done in the same style of &quot;Please Kill Me&quot; (which documented the NYC punk scene). It has oral recollections of punk from a great number of people who were involved. Many of the anecdotes may or may not be true but almost every one is interesting. The main focus seems to be on the Pistols and Clash though many wonderful bands like the Fall, the Undertones and Gang of Four also get mentioned. Too much of the focus dwells on the Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood fashion aspect of summer of '76 Britpunk but it was a part of it so I can't complain even though my interest is more on the music and the DIY aspect that fueled punk and post-punk. Very highly recommended
