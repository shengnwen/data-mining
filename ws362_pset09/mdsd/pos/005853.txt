With spare prose, fine descriptions of South Cal, circa 1960, and some very interesting characters, this is in many ways among the author's best. Very vivid dialogue on occasion gets slightly tiresome, though, and this book almost seems like a theatrical play, though this is very characteristic of this outstanding mystery author. And though the ending was definitely a nifty twist, I was really not convinced that the culprit was capable of the crimes, from a logistics and pyschological angle. The murder of a female professor was not shown as the truly horrid event which it would be in real life. Some of the Greek tragedy inferences indeed provided greater depth to this book, and they may be spotted only after a second reading, which I did after some years. Probably 5 stars for any other mystery writer, but for me, though worthy of a second read, perhaps not quite 5 stars!
