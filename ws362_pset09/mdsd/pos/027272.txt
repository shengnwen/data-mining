This book is about the Pittsburgh Pirates first and Roberto next however it was hard not to have Clemente on my mind throughout the story.  As a boy in the fifties my father would give me $1.00 for the bus ride and right-field seats to the Pirates at Forbes Field.   I will never forget the 'basket catches' and deadly throws to third base if any player dared to try and steal third.  The Pirates played at Three Rivers in 1971, not a great stadium for baseball (or for football for that matter), seeing 10-12 games that season.  Bruce Markusen captured my experience in surprisingly more detail than I would of remembered.  This is great read for anybody who loves baseball, how teamwork can make a difference, seeing a manager at his best at the end of his career and performance from some of the best athletes in the game
