Well, after reading Born In Fire I didn't have much hope for Born In Ice but it was so much better then the first.  These are the first Nora Roberts books that I've ever read.  This is the 2nd book of 3 in the "Born In..." series & I really enjoyed it.  In the first book you were introduced to Brianna & this book is her story.  She is running her bed & breakfast in Ireland when a writer from America comes to stay at her inn.  He is there for several months while writing a book.  During his stay him & Brianna begin a romance that neither of them expect to continue once his book is completed.  This was a very peaceful & enjoyable read.  I recommend this book in the series.
