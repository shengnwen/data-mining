The Commanding Heights tells the fascinating history of the past century through economics. Starting with the reconstruction after the world wars, the rise of communism, socialism, and the economic slump of the 1970's through the rise of globalization and laissez-faire economics in the 1980's and 1990's. 

The book is, without a doubt, the product of a particular time, and a particular point of view. In the late nineties, it seemed as though everything was going in the right direction, pretty much the world over. Even though this the book was revised post 9-11, it still retains the feeling that all roads lead inevitably to the free market and prosperity is the inevitable result. I wouldn't call the book one-sided, but the rise of the free market is definitely the theme.

I was left with a couple of questions unanswered by the book. The book describes the dominance of Keynesian economics (heavy government involvement) in the decades after WW2 and describes the descent of state-owned industry into stagnancy and inefficiency. Keynesian economics rebuilt Europe and Japan and delivered prosperity throughout the 50's and 60's. The failure of statist economics in the 1970's is well described in the book, but why did it work so well during the earlier decades?

Also, the Great Depression and its causes are only touched upon. The fear of market failures motivated the move to Keynesian state control of the economy. The decades before WWI were the last period of ascendency of capitalism and free trade and something went wrong. What went wrong and are we at risk of repeating the same mistakes?

That said, this is one of the most interesting books I've read this year. The political and economic developments in the news make so much more sense with the context of recent history. If you want to understand one of the most vital components of how the world works, the Commanding Heights is a great place to start
