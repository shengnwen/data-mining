I have the third edition of this book and will purchase the newest one today!  I've been using the third edition for years and years and it has been a wonderful tool and a real asset to loosing weight, or just knowing what is in the foods you eat everyday.  If you have to watch fat....you will find that here, if you have to watch carbs., it's in the book.....cutting down on sodium or trying to increase your fiber intake (like I am)....it's all here
