This is a lightweight read in terms of pages, but has quality content and is worth the asking price.

Seth Godin gives the reader some key points to think over before starting their own business.

This is not strictly a step-by-step how-to and is not greatly laden with detail, but it covers the main concepts to bear in mind and is something you can go to again and again for inspiration.

Like a few other of Seth Godin's books, this one gives heart to the small business operator that they can be in a position of advantage when pitted against the corporate giants, providing smart thinking and actions are followed.

What also sets this apart from alot of "run your own business books" is that it is enjoyable and fun to read. 

That makes it easy and quick to read, which means that if you buy it, you will read it, unlike many other business books three times the size of this one
