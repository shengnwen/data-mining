Barbara Walker's second book of knitting patterns is a great book for seasoned knitters wanting to design their own creations, and work in both traditional and new patterns.  Her explanations are always clear (and if you're confused, she does start each book with an explanation of the abbreviations and the techniques she uses) and each pattern comes with a photo, so you can see clearly what the finished product will look like. As in the first volume, she also neatly subdivides the pattern, so you don't have to look through the entire book to find the kind of pattern you're looking for. This book has more multi-colored patterns than the first edition, but here it falls down a bit as the photos are in black and white, not giving as good an idea of the result.  While some of her patterns are suitable for beginners -- as long as they have the basics of knit, purl, and increases and decreases down, most of her patterns are more suited to intermediate or advanced knitters. This is a handy book for those who like to work "outside the box" of purchased patterns, and like all Barbara Walker's books, a great addition to every knitter's library
