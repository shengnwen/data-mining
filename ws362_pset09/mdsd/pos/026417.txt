This  is one of the best books in the Vampire Chronicles. It was refreshing to read this particular volume because of the style and poetics Anne Rice wrote with. The words flow much smother then they did in Blackwood Farm (the book Preceding this one) and the general vibe was that of confidence with a clear direction. The voice of Lestat was very present and his growth within the series was clearly evident. Out of all the vampire Chronicles, i read this volume in the shortest amount of time. Again, i want to emphasize the clear and poetic style of prose Anne Accomplished with this book. All in all this volume is a very visual and is a heart felt piece of art in which you can feel Anne Rice had truly tapped into the world in which she created.
As for this book being the end of the chronicles... I can only say it does not feel like a true conclusion. Lestat comes to terms with his basic questions regarding morality, compassion and sin, thus leading Lestat into a new Psychological space which really opens up the narrative for further adventures
