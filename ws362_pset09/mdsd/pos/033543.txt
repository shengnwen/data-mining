I am a graduate student (not in biology-ralated field) looking for general advice from this book.  To my surprise much of Cajal's advice is still applicable not just today but in different disciplines.  However, this is not a run-of-the-mill advice book for graduate students, and definitely not kind of advice my advisor will give me.  Cajal is very passionate about doing science, and he doesn't hesitate to point out (sometimes very harshly) what he thinks the wrong ways of doing science.

It's expected that part of books are dated (remember it's first releasesd in 1897), but should not deter interested readers from reading it.  Sometimes Cajal made comments upon which any readers today will frown, like "A woman [...] is in different to all work related to change and progress".  But don't call Cajal a sexist, and don't interpret his work in the value system of the 21st century.  Cajal is so enthusiastic about science that few other things matter to him.  Anyone can easily feel and understand his commitment to science after reading few pages of the book
