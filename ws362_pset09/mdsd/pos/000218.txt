This book is a mass of contradictions. In my mind it did not live up to the unatainable hype it has recently recieved. I had not previously come across a book where Richard Russo, one of my all time favorite authors, wrote gushing praises over another writers work on a dust jacket before. In many ways, Russo is the perfect writer to pass a judgement on Walter's work "Citizen Vince." Walter uses his gift for prose in a weaving manner that is straight out of the pages of 'Nobody's Fool'. Walter also starts with a meandering narrative that is fascinating, though about 150 pages in it straightens out and the story becomes not only predictable but lethargically focused on the ending. 

This is not a mystery that deserves any praise whatsoever for its mystery plot. Its strained and not very well thought out. Instead it is in my mind to be praised as a very revealing book that shows considerable strength on the authors part. It shows that Jess Walter might have a strong and creative career ahead of him, and that Citizen Vince is an admirable step along the way towards achieving that goal.

One thing that really got to me while reading this was that besides Vince, the main character, Walter uses up about a third of his pages telling the story of a very young police officer. Thinking back on it, I really don't think that any of this added to the story and instead served only to break up the prose pertaining to Vince. Many of Wlater's characters beyond Vince are only barely fleshed out. 

I think that this was an ok book, but am awaiting further efforts by Walter with anticipation
