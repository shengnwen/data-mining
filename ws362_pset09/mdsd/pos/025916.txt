I am the parent of a fifteen year old boy. I love him dearly and he has  been an ideal child. But he is fifteen and I am having to deal with the  inevitable process of growing apart. My little boy is becoming a man. I am  very proud of his sweet nature but lately I have seen it hurt him or cause  others to take advantage and it is heart wrenching. I was in one of those  sad places that only parents can understand...where one wonders&quot; did i  do something wrong. Has my own co-dependant nature spread to him?&quot; The  answer is yes but also the acknowledgement that he will have to make  mistakes, suffer and thereby grow. ouch!!! Anyway , it was at this moment  that I picked up the book and began to read. It was like a soothing warm  water began to wash over my aching heart.  The stories were so beautiful  that I began to beleive in the miracle of parenting including the mistakes  and the worries.  I started feeling like they were all part of a recipe  that made the most incredible love we as humans will ever know. After  reading the stories I felt grateful and humbled. I could feel the love and  attention that the four authors put into their choices. I recommend this  book to everyone. parents, children , grandparents. It is a celebration of  this amazing thing called life and the fact that a book can make you  realize all of this in such a short time is a small miracle in itself. It  is the comfort youv'e been looking for and all for about 10 dollars.
