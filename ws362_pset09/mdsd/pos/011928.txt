This a good trigger point therapy workbook, complete with "rubberball" tools, but the problem is, once again, this therapy is being touted as the "be-all-end-all" approach to pain management and health.  Trigger point is a modality, a bodywork modality, and needs to be recognized as such.  Just as massage, reflexology,and shiatsu are modalities, there needs to be a line drawn so people don't confuse this with a health book.  Gangi's book does much better in defining our path to balanced health, and also redefines therapies such as this one so people aren't confused or misled. High on the list because it's used in massage schools, but not the best for people wanting to find the cause of their pain, and then dealing with it
