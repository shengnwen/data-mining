We have two version of this book one by Michael Kohn and Bari Weissman 1981.  My daughter laughed and laughed when I read it to her.  And we have this version.  The art work is wonderful and the little captions from the animals are funny.

This book is not sad it is funny no one could possibly swallow a bird, cat, dog, cow or a horse for that matter.

I lost my father a few months before we got this book it did not affect my daughter a bit. She was very close to my father and was devastated when he passed.  But she does not associate this book with him and his passing. 

How crazy is it that some one swallowed an animal.  She new the difference.  Her Kindergarten teacher read this book to her class as well. My daugther knows this is just silly.  It is great book for giggles. 

Although death is a serious matter and if this book had  upset my child in any way I would have disposed of it immediately.
