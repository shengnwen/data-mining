Wow!  I can't believe it's April 2006 and I am just now finding out about J.A. Konrath and Whiskey Sour.  I am a pretty picky reader and a book has to be horrible or fantastic for me review it.  I kiss a lot of frogs.  Whiskey Sour turned out to the handsome prince of a lifetime.  Great writing, great editing, awesome character development and a thrilling ride!  I am on my way to the bookseller today to purchase the next book in the series, Bloody Mary!.  Keep em comin'
