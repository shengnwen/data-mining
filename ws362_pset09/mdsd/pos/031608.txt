The title of the book I just read was Broken Blade it was written by William Durbin. It was published in 1999.  The setting was on Lake Huron in Canada, around 1800.  The main character is Pierre, along with Beloit and La Petite.  The important point is that the only reason Pierre is on the river is because his dad cut off his thumb.  The one part of the book that I did not expect is that Pierre is only 13 and is very well educated.  I would recommend this book because is is fun and had a lot of adventure
