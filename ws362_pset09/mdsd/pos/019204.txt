While small, it's perfect.  I had no idea it would be the description of my life.  The garbage I've been carrying around and didn't even realize.  This was put in such an easy to understand and perfect way.  I'm buying more to give as gifts, not because friends are in bad places, but just because anyone can use this no matter where they are!
