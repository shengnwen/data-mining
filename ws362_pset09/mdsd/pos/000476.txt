As you read through this book, you get to 'listen in' as Mike Litman interviews 9 of the most successful millionaires of our time from one of my personal mentors, Jim Rohn to the mega-best selling Chicken Soup authors, my friend Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen to Wally 'Famous' Amos to Jim McCann CEO of 1-800-Flowers.com fame. 

Mike does an excellent job at getting into not only the minds, but the hearts of these folks where he gleans nuggets of gold you can begin applying in your own life right away.

Well worth the price of the book!
