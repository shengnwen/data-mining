When Dr. Seuss died in the early 90s, it seemed as if the entire country went into mourning.  I had fond memories of Dr. Seuss too, and I WANTED to be as broken up as everyone else was.  But honestly, I wasn't.

Then, in 1998 or 1999, I got an email saying that Shel Silverstein died and it hit home.  I realized what all those Seussers had gone thru.  I think I know why I felt as I did:

Seuss was Cat In The Hat, was the Grinch frustrated by the happy townspeople who need neither feasts nor possessions, but only love to be joyous.  That's swell, and admirable, but to me those books were almost boring.

Uncle Shelby's world was dark and exciting.  One could fly or not take a bath for months or be stupidly stubborn enough to eat nothing but PB sandwiches.  In Silverstein's world, monsters not only existed, but would EAT YOU if you weren't careful.  It was full of the things that my dreams were made of, full of giddiness and dread, full of dark things that glittered expectantly in the moonlight, like diamonds...or like fangs.  

Perhaps you have to be the right kind of person.  Like how some people who worship Looney Tunes look down in realistic, anarchic contempt at the saccharine world created by Walter Disney.  

It's an aesthetic, an aggressive hope, an adventurous fear.  A world the enchanted don't want to grow out of.
