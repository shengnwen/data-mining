As usual, I came into this particular series amidships-but no matter, all and any of the books are wonderful, either individually or in seriatim...O'Brian, like Dickens has an extraordinary ear for speech, as well as a painters eye for landscape and detail. The hermetic and complete world he recreates differs from Dickens in one staggering detail: for the most part his predecessor, except for the &quot;Historical Novels&quot; wrote of what he knew and saw, O'Brian builds his lifelike Universe out of what must be one of the Century's great imaginations. Reader beware: this is a powerfully addictive novel and series
