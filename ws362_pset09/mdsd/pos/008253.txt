Bruce Jakosky has done an excellent job of pulling together recent thinking from many of the different disciplines that contribute to looking for life on other planets.  It would be extremely difficult to find another  book that does as good a job at discussing such up-to-date material at an  introductory level without sacrificing too much depth. The material in this  book should be understandable to advanced undergraduates in biology,  geology, chemistry, or physics.  It is probably best read by skipping from  topic to topic rather than straight through from cover to cover.  The  &quot;Additional Reading&quot; section at the end provides very good  references for more advanced discussions.  Overall, I found &quot;The  Search for Life on Other Planets&quot; to be an extremely helpful  introduction and a good launching board for further reading
