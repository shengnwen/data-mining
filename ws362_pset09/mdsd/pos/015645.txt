To decide whether to buy this book, ask yourself the following questions:

1. Are you in a committed relationship?  
2. Are you and/or your partner experiencing dysfunction, frustration, anxiety or boredom in your sex life with each other? 
3. Are you willing to put substantial personal effort into improving your relationship?

If you answered "yes" to the 3 above questions -- or if you're just interested in learning more about sexual relationships -- you should buy and read this book.  It's not the hackneyed advice that you usually find about sex; most people will find the ideas in here new, fresh, interesting, and personally relevant
