&quot;8 Weeks to Optimum Health&quot; is an excellent informative book with sensible ideas.  One of the points that he brings up is keeping the body at homeostasis, the purest and most healthiest period of one's life.  It is hard to believe that in eight weeks one can bring his body back to a healthy state.  And with Weil's suggestions for mental and physical well being you can continue to improve.  Though going through your pantry or fridge and throwing out probably most of what is in it may be hard, it is the first and hardest step to achieving good health.  It is also shocking to learn how bad oils and fats are for you.  Another very surprising part of the book is about the ways water is bad for you.  Clean water is essential for healthy living.  One adjustment that may be very hard to make is replacing meat with soy foods, which Weil claims to be healthier.  There are many healthy atlernatives to everyday diets and the book is filled with useful information.  The most useful, and probably easiest to adjust to is the customized plans that Weil lays out for different genders and age groups.  Weil also doesn't just preach healthy living but he gives excellent recipes at the end of the book to help one adjust and start being healthy.  It is a good read and a good resource to refer to when your health is in question
