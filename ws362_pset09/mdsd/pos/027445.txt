Last year, I picked up the book Bet Me, and since then I've been glad I gave Crusie, a "new author" to me, a try!  So far, each of her books has managed to entertain me and capture my heart.

Fast Women, did not turn out to be my favorite Crusie book, but it was still a great read.  At the center of the book is the Dysart family, who are quite entangled with each other and with secrets & scandal. One of the issues I had with the book though, was at the beginning the author did not take the time to thoroughly explain how everyone in the family was related.  More so, how everyone at the family law firm was related.  With divorces, deaths, remarriages etc., it became confusing.  Regardless, the other setting of the detective agency proved for interesting goings on, romances, arguments and uncovered secrets.  The main relationship of Gabe who runs the agency and Nell who gets a job there after divorcing the Dysart clan, could be annoying at times, but was overall fun reading.

While the first half of the book was a bit of slow going for me, the second half flowed much better and I felt like we finally got a better look at the characters as secrets were revealed.  The ending, even though a bit choppy, was worthwhile.  Even with these few flaws, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to modern romance fans.
