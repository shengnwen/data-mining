After his sucess with "the Civil War", Ken burns sought to make another masterpiece, another epic series, which was captured here in the film Baseball.  This was a very long series, 18 hours total.  What can I say, it doen't miss much. Starting at the beginning until 1992, just prior to the player's strike of 1994.  An awesome look at old player, ballparks, and the development of the League in general.  It was long to watch, and I know the Segregation issue was tough in baseball, but dang they spent a long time driving that point home stretching it over about 3 tapes. I wish one episode would have concentrated on it more, history, timeline,players and teams, but I guess that's difficult with the series being set up by decades.  I would like to have seen it not skip over 1970-1993, it skipped over many of the scandals (pittsburg pirates 80's drug scandal, Pete rose was a blurp,) and unfortunately the series was before the whole strike fiasco and now some good years since.  One big complaint, why is Shelby Foote in this series at all....he's the civil war buff that annoyed me the first time round.   Anyhow, an entertaining series, just long, but a good job overall
