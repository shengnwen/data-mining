I really liked this book. I was searching for such a useful manual for a long time, and at last found it! It is not only helpful and authorative but also written in a very user-friendly fashion. All those who are involved in  medical writing can learn from (and perhaps enjoy) this book. Go on and  take a look at it before starting to write your next piece
