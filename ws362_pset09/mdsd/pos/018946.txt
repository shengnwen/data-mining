Dekorne gives a lot of insight to materials that many people are unaware of.  He also shows several tips/methods that the average person would not be familiar with.  It would have been nice if there more details on adjusting cuts for out-of-square and out-of-plumb joints, but the book would be very helpful for beginners.  I would buy it again
