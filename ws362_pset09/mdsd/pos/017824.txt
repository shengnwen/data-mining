Some have said that there are no memorable lines in the King Lear play.  I would beg to differ.  I am including a few:  "Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say." -- King Lear (Act 5, Scene 3), Shakespeare.   "This is the excellent foppery of the world : that when we are sick in fortune -- often the surfeits of our own behaviour -- we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and stars, as if we were villains on necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence." ---- William Shakespeare; spoken by Edmond in *King Lear*, act 1 scene 2.

When William Shakespeare wrote his plays, I doubt he thought much about the effect of his works hundreds of years in the future.  Just as I write these words, I doubt they will have a lasting impression.  Yet King Lear does leave us a lasting impression of power:  even the strongest, more arrogant men can fall and faulter if the wrong conditions exist.  May we all hope that one day North Korean dictator Kim Jung Ill meet the fate of King Lear
