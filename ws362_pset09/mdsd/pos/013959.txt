If Mr. Vitale is  guilty of anything, it is at being too good at what he preaches. Like all his books, this one seems to be a product of his own "machine."  I don't doubt this book WAS written and published in 7 days.  Sure, there is some information and advice in here that is beneficial, and if you haven't read other books on the subject, you may even think the advice here is valuable - but ultimately, this book acts as an example of exactly what Joe is trying to teach you - that ANYBODY can write and publish a book in 7 days and start making money.  Is that a bad thing? Not at all. It seems to be working for Joe. When you can't fight 'em, join 'em, I always say! - Brent Sampson, author of Self-Publishing Simplified
