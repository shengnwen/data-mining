My bible arrived today, five days short of the estimated delivery date, which is a job well done by Amazon.
This same bible was selling for $69.99 on another website and so I think this is a bargain at nearly half that price.

On the rear cover it says `bonded leather'. I'm not sure if that's the same as `genuine leather'. I saw a more expensive bible in a bookshop that had a leathery smell to it while this one doesn't.  This is not an issue to me. The cover is decently constructed and neatly presented. 

One of the reviewers on this site mentioned that the binding on theirs was coming apart. Mine looks fine and solid. I'll only know after some continued use whether this is an issue or not. I'm not a book expert and so I don't know whether the pages are bound with glue or stitched etc. It's possible that the reviewer received a defective copy.

I am really impressed with the content of this bible. I'm sure it has everything one could ask for in a study bible. I found a section in the back on the `Prophecies of the Messiah Fulfilled in Jesus Christ' which is something I've always wanted in a bible. 

Another plus is the words of Christ in red which I really like. The fore, top and bottom edge is also finished in gold which gives the bible an expensive appearance.

The only downside I can see is that the print extends quite deep towards the gutter but this is not distracting. Also, two pages in the front (Genesis) had overcuts which I removed carefully with a scissors (I could have torn them off ).

These are minor issues considering the price of this really great bible. 
I certainly recommend this to anyone who loves the King James Version.

Buy one now while the price is still good.
