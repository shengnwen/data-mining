  I had this put in my face in art school; it presents alternative ways of thinking and being to the timid linear ways of the twentieth century. NOT new agey needs a pedicure with those ugly sandals stuff, this is real work to get your brain around. But entirely worth it.
  I'm not going to even try to synopsize this book, but it seems aligned with the work of Robert Graves. If you likes Claudius or The White Goddess you'll love this work. Digs deep into Being. We all have the voices of the Gods in our heads, we're just taught not to listen. That old wiring has cool skills of it's own, though. Not every thing the Roman Church hasn't politicly sanitized is pathology, so don't confuse the idea with schizophrenia as some reviewers have. What psychiatrists will drug you for neurologists and psychologists call the human experience. 
  There's a lot of Jung here too, although it isn't a Jungian work.
  The introduction is something of a death march of twisted academic preening. Feel free to skip to the good parts. You'll need the energy to deal with Mr. Jaynes riddles
