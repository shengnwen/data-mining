I bought this book to give to my aunt when she came down with cancer.   It's actually a really inspiring book.  It's not sappy like some books, but light hearted and matter of fact. The tone is like,  &quot;Let's make the best of this and have a few laughs!&quot;  The author has managed to find joy and humor in life, despite all the surgeries and chemotherapy. I really think this is the perfect gift if you know someone who has cancer
