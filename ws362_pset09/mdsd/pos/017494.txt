I am in the midst of studying for my GRE's. I thought having a book of key terms and subjects would be a great idea. I'm thankful for this book! Terms are clear, well defined and it gives you all the important topics in 14 different areas of psychology, including sensation and perception, abnormal psychology and developmental psychology. Great for any student enrolled in a Psychology course, and a great study aid for GRE's, it certainly beats reading 700pages in a text book
