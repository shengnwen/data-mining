As a lifelong 'Skins fan, it was great to hear stories from the "glory days" and hear stories about Riggins, Gibbs, Theismann and the rest.  In addition, some stories are real eye-openers (the section where he discusses answering the phones on the sidelines and what he had to do surprised me), while others are just hilarious (Riggo figures prominently, surprise surprise).  As a huge fan, I am glad I bought it, although its length was a little disappointing - it was a FAST read, and I for one could have used a few more stories, which is the only reason why I did not give it five stars
