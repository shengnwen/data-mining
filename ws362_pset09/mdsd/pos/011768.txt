I love reading novels, and I hate reading bad novels. Why not read the best? Sure, throw-away thrillers and mysteries are fun but my time is valuable and I prefer reading the best of the best, and Faulkner is at the top of the short list.

This story of love and tragedy, courage and tradition in the Deep South (in 1928) is one of the most moving stories I've ever read. This is great literature!

Faulkner's accounts of children playing in a creek, of lovers torn by tradition and family, of racism and routine cruelty is brilliant. His cadence is perfect, his images hauntingly clear. This is not easy reading, and many students learn to hate Faulkner with a passion! His long sentences, his disjointed dialogue and juxtaposition of time and place require the reader's attention, but it is worth the effort.

Do yourself a huge favor. Buy and read this great American story. It's not "easy" but the best things in life rarely are. And one more suggestion: do not get it at the public library! Buy it. You'll want to savor it, and my guess is you'll want to re-read again and again. This is a book you should definitely own and cherish.
