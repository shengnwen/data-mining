An exceptional book.  The book, however, has little pedagogical value.  I would not recommend those starting out in mathematics to purchase it.  It  is definitely for the mathematically mature.  Indeed, it is the type of  book that may force some to consider abandoning mathematics if it is read  without assistance too early in their development.  The lack of answers to  exercises amplifies these considerations when the book is used for self  study as there are few means to understand whether one is on the right  track, especially when the less natural approach of recursion is required  to answer some questions.  If you want to maximise your understanding of  set theory, however, this is an essential book to get.  In a sense, when  read in conjunction with Paul Halmos' background and some quotes attributed  to him found elsewhere on the Internet, the book is almost  autobiographical
