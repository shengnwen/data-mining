I was a fan of the The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing.  A coworker had this book on his shelf and I asked to borrow it.  It was just as good as the The 22... book.  As I read through it, I was so happy to see that the approach I had taken for my business as it relates to marketing on the internet was correct.  My favorite chapter is the one about the differnce between a business who markets on the internet and a true internet business.  I also loved the information about picking a domain name.  This book is ideal for the small business owner who either has a business they want to expand to the internet, or an idea for a business that uses the internet as the foundation
