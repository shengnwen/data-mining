Frowine lists a multitude of orchids within this book that have been observed to be fragrant either through first hand knowledge or word of mouth. For many of the orchids, he lists some of the basics such as fragrance (i.e. what it smells like), distribution, and some cultivation information. The cultivation information isn't very detailed, but this is a book about fragrance and cultivation information can be found in other books and on the web. For me, the most useful section of the book is the appendices. There are 6 appendices and they are all great:

A) Orchids by Ease of Culture
B) Orchids by Light Requirements
C) Orchids by Nighttime Temperature Preference
D) Orchids by Intensity of Fragrance (my favorite, also describes the fragrance)
E) Orchids by Time of Fragrance
F) Orchids by Season of Bloom
