After reluctantly beginning a weekly regimen of Fosamax for osteopenia,  I began to wonder.  Do I really need this?  What will be the long term side effects?  How do medications like Fosamax really work?  I turned to this book for the answers, and as a result made my own decisions about my bone health.  The book is well written and sheds light on the many misconceptions and preconceptions about osteoporosis.  It identifies who is really at risk and helps to exlain why bone density tests can't be considered conclusive. It goes on to explain how bone medications work in the body and why we need to be wary of them.  And it points to the fact that osteopenia is a very natural occurrence, and does not always progress to osteoporosis. Every woman is different.  And bone density drugs might be right for some, but not all. The factual information in this book, combined with my own common sense and body sense, led me to decide that the drug is not right for me.  Women need more books and resources like this when doctors and drug companies are all too swift to tell us we need an Rx that not only might be unnecessary, but might also be harmful in the long run.
