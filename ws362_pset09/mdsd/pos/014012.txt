As so many other readers have stated, this is a dark story filled with bitter and unfulfilled characters.  Still, Ansay's prose is so adept that I was impressed with how, well, disturbed her words made me feel.

Not all stories have a plot that winds its way around a framework of neat chapters.  Vinegar Hill is as much a character study as a story, and Ellen, Ansay's lead character, is both a spectator and participant in her life.  That balance shifts painfully slowly throughout the book.  There are no easy endings and some characters are left to their own dark broodings.  But such is the way in life.

Sometimes it's the story that disturbs that stays with you.  For me, this is one such novel.  It's not a summer beach read, but it's well worth reading
