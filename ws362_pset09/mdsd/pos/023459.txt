Once more Hamish's peaceful life as policeman in the Scottish Highlands is disturbed by murder.  This time the victim is a disagreeable cleaning lady called Mrs Gillespie.  Hamish doesn't have any trouble discovering the motive, but the problem is deciding which of the many suspects could have done it.  And of course he also has to cope with his usual problem of making sure no-one high up finds out what a brilliant detective he is and promotes him away from his beloved village beat.  Not to mention trying to sort out his complex love-life, still dreaming of Priscilla, dithering over whether or not to marry Elspeth, and getting involved with a few other attractive women just to complicate matters.

The Hamish Macbeth novels are always fun to read, and this one has all the features of the earlier books, an ingenious plot, good characters, and plenty of humorous touches.  I must admit that personally I am a little tired of Hamish's dithering over whether or not to get married, I wish he'd just make up his mind one way or the other, but this is only a minor quibble. A new Hamish Macbeth novel is always a treat.
