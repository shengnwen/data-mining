Penn Cage is a succesful writer who gave up his law practice upon returning to his home town of Natchez, Mississippi, following the death of his wife. On the surface, the town looks like an idyllic interpretation of "everytown" USA, but under the surface, the lives of the high school kids are riddled with drugs, sex and racial hatred which comes from both sides. The strangled body of the school's golden girl is found, face down in the creek with evidence of sexual activities still in her body. Penn is horrified when his old friend and popular town doctor, Drew, confesses to him that he and the girl were not only having an affair, but that he planned to leave his wife and go away with her to another city. Another student is murdered and the townspeople begin to realise the magnitude of the drug problem in their school. When the doctor is charged with the girl's murder, he asks Penn to defend him, but, realising that his skills as a lawyer might not be enough to get an acquittal, Penn hires an elderly, black, activist lawyer to take on the case which by now is riddled with Asian drug runners, a Croatian drug peddler, a gang of thugs and a myriad of odd characters. I found it to be a good read which moves along at a smart pace and dooesn't let up for a minute
