Ok The Ring of McAllister had a good plot to make sure you would keep on reading it (a sucky plot would mean that you won't learn any of the vocab). Hmmm but one problem was the fact that you hadta flip through the pages back and forth to find the meaning was annoying.... cuz sometimes i lost where i was in the story and also it interrupts the story which is very annoying but it still worked pretty well for me. I would recommend this to anyone hu gets sick of just reading through vocab lists and wants a new way of learning it that is entertaining as well as helpful
