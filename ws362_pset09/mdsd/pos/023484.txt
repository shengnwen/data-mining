I have been purchasing many different things on Amazon for a few years now, and never before have I been compelled to write a review about any of them: until now.  I love reading, and have been trying to read many different types of books, just waiting for one that would blow me away.  I missed reading books that I couldn't put down.  This book was just incredible.  I won't explain the plot, since it can be found in other reviews, or in the description of the book.  All I can say is that it was an incredible story of love and betrayal and jealousy that managed to weave religion throughout.  The only think I didn't like about this book is that it ended.  Now I'm back where I was before I started, looking for the next great book
