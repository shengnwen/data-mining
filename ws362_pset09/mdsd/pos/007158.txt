This is an excellent book which shows how young Christians of all stripes are returning to their theologically conservative roots.  I felt that the anecdotal comments from these "new faithful" were very enlightening, especially when they explain why they hold the theological views that they do.  My only disappointment, however, is that, while Carroll includes young persons from many points in the broader catholic tradition (be they Roman, Orthodox, or Anglican), she totally ignores Lutherans, even when introducing individuals who are Pentecostal and Baptist.  Are there none of these "new faithful" among the Lutherans?  Was she unable to find them?  Or has she given up on the Lutheran Church?  In any case, such a serious omission of a major Catholic communion is certainly lamentable, and results in a much lower rating than would have otherwise been deserved
