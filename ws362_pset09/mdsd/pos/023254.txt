It took almost 2 months for me (I am a slow reader!) to finish this colossal book. Even thoug I have never visited South Afriaca , now I would like to visit the exotic place some day.

The book covers mainly Van doorns, English and local tribes. Good exposure to Dutch culture and sad to know how they were misguided by the bible. When comes to aborigines I think Michener is at his best. He writes so beautifully about them, it is like travelling into past.

As the name indicates lot of quotes from old testament, I found that there are lot more quotes than necessary.

Michener warns in the beginning that this is nothing but a novel. But i checked some of the things on the net and they are accurate.

As usual there are a lot of characters and lot of sub plots, one tend to forget what happened in the beginning while reading the final parts.

I never read South African history as a part of my curriculum, so the book was a great source of information. 

The book is clearly very lengthy and could have been reduced to 200 pages less. Lot of details about the wars between Dutch and Xhosa reduces pace of the book in the middle of the book.

Surprised to find that there is no mention of Mandela. Where as in the out-side world first thing comes to mind when mentioned Sounth Africa is Mandela. Gandhi has been mentioned in some places, Not much details about him but still to have him the book is nice.

Apart from everything why I have given 4 stars is because the book is a great source of knowledge. Since I am a slow reader and time is a constraint i have become very selective while reading. I expect more than just entertainment when the book size is 1000+ pages. This book gives lot of information about Africa, initial Dutch settlers, British and xhosa. When you finish the book  you will feel very nice by having so much of knowledge.

Just before this one I read HAWAII, and liked it too. If you like COVENANT, then you will also like HAWAII. Great book!
