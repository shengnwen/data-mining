This is one of the first books I picked up on the topic of Technical Pen illustration. The author (who is apparently known for his work with equine illustrations in pen and ink) is quite accomplished and provides a great introduction to the technical pen and its many uses in art. Decidedly missing much on the lines of brushwork in ink (not watercolor, of course) and it's possibilities, but, then, this is a book on the technical pen (not the brush). I rate this 4 stars because not enough time is spent identifying many of the basic styles and the author tends to stray from style to style in his illustrations. This makes for confusing stylization (ie: shifting from parallel line to scross-hatch to stipple) for the beginning technical pen artist
