Siri Mitchell did it again for me! I previously read "Kissing Adrien" and thought I would try this book as well. I was not dissappointed. The writing is great, the characters come to life on the pages. Her details of cooking and France continue to make me want to go there! It is a great story, that kept me up at nights. I did not want to put this book down!
