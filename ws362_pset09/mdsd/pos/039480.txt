This book was hard to put down. I have been informed about so much concerning the offices and the anointing related to each and the different level of measure that is provided. This book put words to things I have experienced but did not have the language to express myself. Although with some parts like when Hagin said he could not "stand it" I think I would have used different verbage. It does get so deep and you go into His presence but I think that its a wonderful feeling, although it is true that our human bodies cannot stand to be there for too long. Overall I think this book is great
