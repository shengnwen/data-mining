Flyboys consists of facts surrounded with fiction.
I will show 2 sentences from this book so you have an idea of what I'm talking about.  And here they are:  (P193 in large print) Both Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid were surprise attacks, but the Japanese had targeted a military installation.  Now the Americans bombed and strafed hospital patients, children, women, farmers, and fishermen.

Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid were surprise attacks, but that's where the facts end and the fiction begins.  I'm sure the American military leaders didn't tell Doolittle to go and strafe some hospitals and school children.  It just so happened that the Japanese didn't zone their urban areas, so military-industrial plants existed side by side with hospitals, residential neighborhoods, etc.  And don't forget the kind of military power we had back then.  Their were no smart bombs, so this kind of thing was inevitable.  In fact, we often bombed ourselves with "friendly fire".  

The book is interesting, but you might want to skip the first couple of chapters where Bradley covers the manifest destiny and the slaughter of American Indians.  It's just that I expected to read more about flying in this book and less about American Indians.  

I think Bradley has respect for the American pilots that flew during World War II, but no respect for the government that put them there.  He tells many of the atrocities of World War II, but he wants you to believe that we were responsible for just as many, if not more, than the Japanese. 

You probably wonder why I gave this book 4 stars. Several chapters are well written and the book becomes hard to put down in the later chapters, especially when he tells about the pilots that flew at ChiChi Jima and their fate.
