Loverboy creeps up on you even though you get plenty of warning that the narrator, mother of the year, is possibly a half a bubble off plumb. She's got a few hang ups. There's her problem with speaking in contractions. There's her tendency to kiss her son a little more than she ought to. She's got some serious separation issues and things start to escalate from there. You figure it just isn't gonna be one of those happily every after books. That said, it was haunting and beautifully written. As a mother with far less child lust than this poor woman, I could relate in &quot;moments.&quot; Moments that sieze your heart and render you stupid. But uh, insanity is something else. Which is what makes the book so creepy, so enticing that I had to stay up until the wee hours to find out exactly how this would all play out. Not well, I was sure. I'll stick this one on the bookshelf next to Steve Martins' Shopgirl. Small but packs a good punch
