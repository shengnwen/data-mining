I am 24 years old, I have never dealt with Alzheimer's in any way, shape, or form.  I happened across The Forgetting in a bookstore, being the intense browser that I am, and was immediately attracted to the portrayal of the subject matter.
I enjoyed each page of The Forgetting.  With every word, and each carefullly crafted sentence I began to see a different world, one I had been ignorant of and blind too.

David Shenk guides the reader through the history of Alzheimer's and the very little knowledge we have accrued on a illness which has hit its centennial mark.  I am thankful David Shenk wrote a touching and compassionate piece of medical history.
