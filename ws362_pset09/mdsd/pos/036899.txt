The way this story does present itself may be a similar idea to Young Goodman Brown by Nathaniel Hawthorne in which upon traveling through the woods he encounter's what turns out to be a nightmare of the supernatural an intermix of fantasy,reality, & the super natural.Possibly not knowing if it's a dream or a reality but it's an adventure on the whole that's very enjoyable from start to finish.
