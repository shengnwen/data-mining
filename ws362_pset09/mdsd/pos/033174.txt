I love my car, Jessica. But she doesn't do things by herself. Life is not that easy for Arnie Cunningham, a high school boy who went from nice geek to bad attitude sheik once he bought and fixed up his obsession, Christine. Well written, but I like how the film does not reveal all the secrets of the book. I was disappointed in explaining why Christine is "special" or "capable." The unexplained is much scarier. But still creatively cool.
