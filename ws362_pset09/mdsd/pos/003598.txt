When I first got into contact with the teachings of Chogyam Trungpa I was touched and moved by the directness and truth which matched my experience. I wanted to know more about this man. Digging deeper a whole universe of teachings and accomplishments opened up. Not just Buddhist, but also "worldly" Shambhala teachings on enlightened society, theater, poetry, flower arrangments, science and business - to name just a few - were all subjects Chogyam Trungpa genuinely offered his understanding to the benefit of others. All perfectly adapted to the West by a Tibetan master, presented in English, fascinating. Fabrice Midal brilliantly captures the many aspects of Trungpa's exceptional life, well structured and with a profound understanding. A well to read book on the life and accomplishments of Chogyam Trungpa and the profoundness of his teachings. A must read for everybody, at least for the ones interested in Buddhism in the West
