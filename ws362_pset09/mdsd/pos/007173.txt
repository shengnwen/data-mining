Recently I read that, according to a report by Staples *, the "Percentage of American adults who say they have an idea for a new product or innovation: 42." (* Office Solutions, March/ April 2004, p. 10)

Going on the report stated that the "Top reasons for not getting an idea to the drawing board: not enough money (75 percent), not knowing where to start, ..."

If you're in that 75%, then reading Confessions of a Venture Capitalist will be an enlightening experience.

Ruthann Quindlen, a one-time investment banker now with Silicon Valley's Institutional Venture Partners, lays it on the line in this revealing glimpse inside the mind of a Venture Capitalist.

The book is divided into 11 sections, comprising 36 short and entertaining chapters.

Section 1: Life in the Bubble
A short history on life in Silicon Valley.

Section 2: People
"People Are to a Business What Location Is to a Restaurant" (need I say more)

Section 3: Markets
"Find Markets the Size of Texas"

Section 4: Business Models
"Faster, Better, Cheaper" versus "Brave New World"
Business models function as a blueprint on how the company will make money.

Section 5: Venture Capitalists
Stages to funding process and the role of Venture Capitalists.

Section 6: Entrepreneurs
Common mistakes and other words of wisdom for entrepreneurs.

Section 7: The Fine Line between Bizarre and Brilliant
