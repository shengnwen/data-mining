Jayne Ann Krenz's Light in Shadow is a wonderful guilty pleasure, a romantic thriller that is well-done and compelling.  The story of Zoe Luce, an interior designer with a hidden past is light fun reading.  I definitely will read Truth or Dare, the sequel to this novel.  I am sure it will be as much fun to read as this one.  Enjoy
