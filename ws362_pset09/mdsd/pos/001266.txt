What a wonderful book.  I wanted to spend more time with all of these characters, I wanted to spend more time in their world.  They deal with pain and tragedy and confusion so much more thoughtfully and interestingly than I do.  I learned something from them all, like you would learn from a friend's misfortune that they were able to face gracefully.  This book is as nourishing as an Italian banquet with friends outside under the trees on a balmy summer evening.  I'm on to read more by Robert Hellenga.  Why isn't he a household name
