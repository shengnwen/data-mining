Brian Tracy has written another great book.  He always has excellent points and he is a wealth of information.  The only negative about this book (4/5 stars) is that if you are an avid Brian Tracy fan like myself, there is some repeat information from previous books/audio programs.  This is not bad per se because getting back to the basics and reviewing information is always good, however, I think it's a point worth mentioning.  In any case, Brian Tracy is awesome and I'm a devoted fan!  Great work
