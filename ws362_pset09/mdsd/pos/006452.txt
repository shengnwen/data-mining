Gary Lutz is to postmodernism what Henry Miller was to modernism, it's as simple as that.  Here we have a writer who deserves to be cannonized, by his unique aplomb, cutting-edge wit, incomparable story-craft, and sensitivity to social issues pervading our culture of commodity and appearances...and yet he's outright ignored by the "Establishment."  There is no hope for those glib, irony-insensitive, self-righteous critics who think of his work as overbaked and pretentious...he's obviously trying to use his style to make a valid point or two.  Go back to the classroom and stop trying to impress us all with your fashionably hateful and derived commentary
