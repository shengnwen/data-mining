If you don't know what an AD is, it's the guy/gal that many a novice has mistaken for the director, since the AD is usually the one shouting "Quiet on the set!" and "Roll sound/camera!" 

So I picked up FTD expecting more of the mishmash and anecdotes you get from writers who have not spent much, if any, time on a set. Not so. Despite the "sleep with your producer" line (which I too found bizarre beyond belief and is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5), FTD is probably the best book I've ever read on the actual mechanics of making your first movie as a director. I don't know the author and I don't know the publisher, but what I do know is this stuff is coming from a guy who's been there in the trenches, sweating blood and tears to make a movie. Bettman's advice is better and more on point than anything I ever got at USC film school, and is matched only by the advice I got from--and eventually gave to-- the directors I've worked with.

So buy it if you're looking for the nuts and bolts of directing your first feature, ignore the sleep with the producer line, and I think you'll find it worth your hard-earned cash
