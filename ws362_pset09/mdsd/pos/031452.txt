"A Life Without Consequence" is one of the best books I've read this year.  It's a quick, satisfying read, touching and poignant, but never overly sentimental or maudlin.  What I liked most about the book is that it tells an interesting and compelling story of a boy's life while also providing an intimate look into the world of homeless and group home children.  Though the subject is at times heavy, reading this book is a pleasure
