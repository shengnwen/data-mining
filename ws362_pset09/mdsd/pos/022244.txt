This is basically the &quot;powerpoint&quot; version of TOC.  It is not a how-to guide or a novel like most TOC material.  I would recommend buying one copy for any group starting a TOC implementation or needing to present TOC concepts (great slide ideas).  It doesn't deserve a place on everyone's desk like some of the other TOC books, but has value for those who have read or seen The Goal and now need to participate in an implementation
