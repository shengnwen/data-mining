Hilary Mantel has written a small, delightful little book in the novel, Fludd.  The title character, Fludd, arrives in the village of Fetherhoughton and , both subtly and drastically, changes things at a crucial time for the local priest, Father Angwin, and the Catholic Church.  This is background for a wonderfully eccentric group of characters that charm their way through the book.  I initially picked up the book because of an interest in the historical Robert Fludd, the alchemist, but discovered that it was the quirky denizens of this village that captured my heart and were the driving force behind the book
