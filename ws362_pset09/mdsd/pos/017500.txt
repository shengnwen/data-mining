Sinclair Lewis was the first American writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature with a remarkable collection of books including Babbitt and Main Street. I have to say that he writes clearly most of the time. There are times that I wished that he would just get on with it. Zenith is small town America and that is where the protagonist and family lives. George is supposed to be satisifed with his mundane life but he isn't just like Carol wasn't in Main Street. Small town life seems suffocate George and Carol and that is theme in Lewis' novels. If you despise your hometown or small town life, then read Sinclair Lewis. I am just surprised that there is no movie based on his works. Maybe they would not work because it is character driven and not plot driven today.
I know that Sinclair Lewis novels like Elmer Gantry and Dodsworth were adapted to the screen. Classics like Babbitt are timeless and should be taught in schools and adapted to the screen. American Classics like Babbitt and Main Street seem to be disregarded in favor of lighter, inferior fare for the audiences. We have to stop dummying down the audiences' mentality
