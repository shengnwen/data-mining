History of the Blues is criticized for the author's &quot;cynicism,&quot; but the author is justified in seeking to modify or correct much of the last century's &quot;blues scholarship.&quot;  The book is more valuable  because Davis doesn't accept the suppositions and theories of earlier  writers, and in the first chapters the author establishes that &quot;the  blues&quot; are far more complex, socially and musically, than we've been  led to believe.  He writes with wit and plenty of feeling - but the feeling  expressed is one of annoyance with blues and folk &quot;scholars&quot; who  have either not researched very thoroughly, or who have deliberately  ignored facts that subvert their simplistic theories.  What are the blues?   Where did they come from?  What's happened to the blues since mid-century?   Davis examines all of these questions and comes up with some reasonable and  provocative answers.  The book isn't meant to be a study of individual  blues musicians; such works have already been written (by Samuel Charters,  Peter Guralnick, Pete Oliver) and they were well-done.  The History of the  Blues is a very readable account of a century of confusion, best approached  with an open and attentive mind
