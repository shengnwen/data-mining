I read the book The Black Pearl for a project in school. The story takes place on the southern tip of Baja California. A young boy named Ramon is about to join his father in the pearl business. But his father goes to sea for a while and while he was gone Ramon asks an Indian man to teach him to dive for pearls. The man teaches him in the lake of the famous Manta Diablo. The boy goes out by himself one day and finds the biggest pearl ever near the Manta Diablo's cave. He brings the pearl home, but the Manta Diablo was hard on his tail. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and exciting stories. I think this book is for 11 to 14 year olds because I think if you were any older you would not find the uninteresting. I think boys and girls would enjoy the book because it is meant for either gender
