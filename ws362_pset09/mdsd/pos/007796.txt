I was expecting a GREAT book on animation, but it seems a little over-rated to me. I love old cartoons and am enthralled with the golden era, but this book doesn't live up to the 5 star rating for me. I understand it to be historical for an animation book and something that every animator should have for reference. I just don't know if this is the be all end all references for animating. I'm sure it was great for it's time. It is so fun and cute to look at now, but I have learned much more from Richard William's "The Animator's Survival Kit". I won't give up this book, I do love it. I just think it's over rated
