How do we coherently integrate and mobilize our evolving consciousness, technology, outright madness, and pig-headed, luminous human potential? Worldchanging is not the formulative answer but it's the best step in the right direction I have seen so far. 

Worldchanging is a users guide and the starting point needed to begin millions (hopefully billions) of important conversations. It is filled with what we need most: straightforward, bite-sized summaries, directives and how-to instructions on most of the topics that we humans desperately need to know about in order to drive positive change. From under-reported successes in urban areas and environmental movements across the progressive spectrum to alternative energy solutions and simple facts and figures about the millennia we face, it carries the reader through the full intellectual and emotional spectrum. 

I read about 25% of it in the first sitting and finished it the following day. Its rare that I am inspired, educated and empowered with specific tools for action in one sitting. My head was spinning and my eyes hurting but my spirits were quite lifted. I couldn't believe how much I did NOT know about each of the subjects. 

And perhaps therein lies the essential value of Worldchanging: it equips ordinary individuals with information and resources to take immediate, meaningful and impacting action in their lives and on behalf of organizations.
