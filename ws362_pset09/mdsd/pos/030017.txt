Frances' friends decided she desperately needs an intervention to save her life or something like it. No, she's not a pill head or drunk, she's addicted to unrequited love for her best friend, Blue's, brother, Theo. Unless she gives it up and starts doing coed things with other guys and having a life, they will portray her as a stalker to Theo and ruin her chances with him. So, she joins the student newspaper and lands an important assignment on the first day; host a Homework club to integrate the all boys and all girls schools. She knows immediately it's a huge and possibly impossible assignment, but gives it her best shot. Only one taker shows up, a nerdy guy who'd be perfect for her, perfectly awful at least. So, a bit of blackmail gets Theo to help her by bringing his friends over, the problem being that all they study is how to party, with maybe a bit of sex ed. Frances is outraged, Theo amused. He challenges her to loosen up by sneaking out to go on an educational date with him, but he's the one educated. 

**** Nerds can have fun and be cool too. This book will give every shy, brainy girl a ray of hope and a few laughs. Its innocent sensuality almost reminds you of "Dirty Dancing", whose heroine has the same name as the star of this book. If you liked Putting Boys on the Ledge, you'll like this one twice as much. ****
