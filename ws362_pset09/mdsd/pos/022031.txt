I had first read this book during the early 70's when I was Still in my teens,because nostilgia has a way of destorting things this book was not quite as great as I remembered it to be. Nevertheless it is still great a book, for those of us who understand that in History while Wars,Summit Meetings and the like have (and should ) thier place, so should the more ordinary aspects, of our cultural life. The portions of this book that deal with Ty Cobb's insanity and racism Hal Chase's corruption, "Judge Landis's" overated qualties, and the fact that the 1919 World Series scandal was merely a means to an end, rather than the actual cause of the overthrow of The National Commission, for me anyway make for great reading, I would urge anyone intrested in American culture, or just loves baseball/nostilgia to purchase this book here
