I'm usually among the first in line to complain about the NSA, COINTELPRO, the modern surveillance-state, the PATRIOT ACT, etc.  In spite of this (or, perhaps because of this) it is deeply insightful to read this first-hand account about life in a genuine police-state.  Although ponderous and sometimes outright dull, The Gulag Archipelago is an important record of one of the darkest chapters of modern history.  Without books like this, who will remember once all the survivors are gone
