This is about the third book I've read by Gene Veith and I enjoy his clear writing style very much.  This book has a helpful overview of the main genres of literature and their place in the Christian worldview. The real  gems in this book are Veith's discussions of Fiction and Fantasy. There  would certainly be crossover into the realm of filmmaking for the  thoughtful Christian screenwriter. I also found the end chapters on the  development of literature throughout history, and how Christians interacted  and critiqued the errors of their day a helpful corrective to much of the  existential Christian nonsense which tries to pass itself off as  &quot;Christian literature&quot; these days.  My only disappointment is  Veith's repeated use of Madeline L'Engle as a positive example of a  Christian author. Certainly, she has some spiritual overtones to her books,  but I don't think the worldview she presents could be called distinctly  &quot;Christian&quot;.  The other slight criticism I have is that I would  have liked to see Veith give more discussion to developing a model for how  Christians can interact with their culture through literature. He kind of  assumes too much here
