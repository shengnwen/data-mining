Positively Fifth Street by James McManus is positively the best broad survey of the world of poker in print today. Even though it is filed in the poker section of the bookstore, it is not just a simple strategy manual. McManus' artful account of his experiences in the 2000 World Series of Poker makes you feel as if you are sitting right at the poker table with him. From the strip club to the poker felt to the courthouse, McManus gives the reader an enthralling portrayal of the seedier sides of Las Vegas.
McManus also does an excellent job of giving an exciting account of the poker action, while interspersing some of his own interesting commentary. He has an uncanny ability to seamlessly combine and relate his own personal experiences in the tournament to the murder case of Ted Binion, the tournament's host. McManus also effortlessly mixes in some much more "cultured" material, such as Dostoevsky's "The Gambler" and Darwinian Genetics, amidst his accounts of murder, sex, and drugs.
Overall, McManus's down to earth prose, and easy to read cadence, along with wonderful poker insight, make this book worth reading whether poker player or not
