I thought dominion was an honest attempt to portary the racial issues that affect today's church and community. I think Alcorn creatively offers a somewhat viable solution to the race problem in light of biblical theology. As an African-American, it still saddens me that some white envangelicals can love the Bible and miss the need for compassion, repentance, and reconciliation in Christ. Alcorn is right in that many Christians did particpate in slavery, Jim Crowism and even racism today. This is sin! However, once again, in the name of being biblical, some evangelicals would rather stick their heads in the sand and claim &quot;sola scriptura&quot; instead of practicing &quot;true Christianity&quot;. I applaud Alcorn for raising the racial issues without excusing African-American Christians on their need to forgive (a point I thought he did not soften!). The American church will hang her head in shame before God if she doesn't come face to face with this issue.
