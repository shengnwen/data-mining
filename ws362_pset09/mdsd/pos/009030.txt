From the beginning of nursing the movement has always been about more than just handing out pills, taking temperatures, and following the doctor's orders.  From the beginning nurses have been charged with the spiritual life of a patient--how the patient is doing in spirit and mind as well as body.  In her seminal work &quot;Standing on Holy Ground,&quot; O'Brien manages to touch all the important bases, starting with a spiritual history of nursing and quickly moving on to nursing assessment of spiritual needs.  The last two-thirds of the book is devoted to a delineation of the spiritual needs of folks in various life stages--from acute illness to death and dying.  This book is fast becoming a solid anchor and reference for our parish health and wellness team
