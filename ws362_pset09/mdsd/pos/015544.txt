My husband and I have now traveled for three weeks around Argentina, and we have found this book indispensable.  Specific comments:
-The maps are fantastic (occasionally slightly inaccurate, but overall much better than any other maps we've found down here!). 
-Hotel information, while pricing is already out of date (trouble with books) has been accurate, and we've been very happy with all the hotels where we've stayed in Buenos aires, Córdoba, and Mendoza.
-Restaurant recommendations have helped us venture out of the area where our hotel is and find some real treasures elsewhere.  If you're wondering how their recommendations would compare to the locals, well, everytime we ask a local for a recommendation of a great restaurant, we find out it was in "the book".
-Travel recommendations: how to get around, things to remember, explanations of "tango", etc. are invaluable, witty, and as far as we can tell, accurate.

I cannot give the book 5 stars, and it is not the book's fault.  Travel books simply cannot stay completely up to date (esp. with such volatile exchange rates), and three months after publication, this already applies to this book.  Also, given the relationship between Uruguay and Argentina, I would have loved for this edition to include Uruguay (though I was under no illusions when I bought it!)
