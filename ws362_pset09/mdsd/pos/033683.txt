In the course of researching the genre of women adventurers and people who have worked with bears I found this book. This is only the second account I have come across of a woman dealing with bears in the wild and was thrilled that Ruth Harkness' adventure has been brought to light again for us all to enjoy and appreciate. Vickie Constantine Croke proves her worthiness as an author with her eloquent writing and her extensive research of Harkness' life and the current events of China in the 1930's. I was absorbed in the story and after finishing the book went on to read the original account written by Harkness, as well as her children's book "A Giant Baby Panda". Now I am into her South American adventure, "Pangoan Diary". If you are as piqued by the mysterious lady who did what no one had done before and who found pleasure and beauty in the primitive conditions of the wilds of China, then interlibrary loan her books. You will have a better understanding of the woman and some incredible remote areas of the 1930's world
