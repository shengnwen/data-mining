I did watch John Edward's program a few times when it was on TV, especially his celebrity readings (one of which was with Roma Downey) and he openly talked about the fact that he prayed the Rosary before each program. I happened upon this book because I created and maintain Roma's Official website. I'm a cradle Catholic as is Roma (Irish Catholic) and John Edward. I found the information on prayer beads from other cultures and religions interesting. But as a Catholic who attended Catholic school, a lot of it was information I already knew. The very best part of it all is Roma Downey on the CD. She first gives you instructions on how to say the Rosary and then says the whole Rosary. There is lovely background music as well. It's really beautiful and it's almost like praying the Rosary with her in the room with you :-) She speaks for about 28 minutes. Then John Edward starts talking and it's like being jolted into reality...I just don't find his voice to be soothing at all. Roma didn't collect any money for being part of this project, all she asked was that money be donated to the charity Operation Smile. I find it strange that no where in the description of the book here at Amazon does it even mention Roma Downey and it doesn't come up if you put her name in their search engine. But on the bottom of the front cover of the book it does say: "Includes a FREE BONUS Meditation CD featuring actress Roma Downey."

There is an element of New Age beliefs to the book....most Catholics won't be offended, some will...John Edward has a mixed bag of fans.

Buy it if for no other reason than for Roma on the CD!
