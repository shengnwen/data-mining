This sub-200 page book imagines the passions of and conflicts between the brilliant but flawed founding fathers, mostly George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.  Vidal covers the forming of the Constitution, inaugral Presidential terms of George Washington, and the subsequent battle for succession between the Federalist (Adams, Hamilton, John Marshall) and Republican (Jefferson, James Madison) factions.  Hamilton's story is perhaps the most colorful - Vidal insinuates that he is Washington's illegitimate son and accuses him of subterfuging John Jay's postwar treaty with the British (repeatedly labeling him Agent Number Seven) and sabatoging Adams' political career.  The book also explains several important events of the early republic like the Alien and Sedition Acts and Marbury v. Madison.  Vidal includes quotes from vintage letters and other sources but also peppers the text with critical screeds against the current administration and its policies which may distract or annoy some readers.     
A passage from Senator Maclay's diary describing Thomas Jefferson  in 1790 also fits Vidal's book: 'He spoke almost without ceasing.  But even his discourse partook of his personal demeanor.  It was loose and rambling and yet he scattered information wherever he went, and some even brilliant Sentiments sparkled from him.' 
This was my first full Gore Vidal book and it interested me in reading another.  Recommended for those planning to visit the historic sites in Philadelphia.
