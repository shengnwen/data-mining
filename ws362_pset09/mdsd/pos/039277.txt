I enjoyed reading this book from the beginning to the end.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't really an "unforgettable" type of book.  However, it was educational and entertaining throughout.

Peggy Noonan focuses on the character of Reagan, as the title would suggest.  She collected information via personal contact with Reagan and from various interviews with those close to him.  I have read books that give a much more detailed historical biography of Reagan, but this book should not be compared to those.  Ms. Noonan really focused on events that either shaped or displayed the character of this great man.

Yes, the book is written to show Reagan in a very favorable light.  If you believe the things she writes, you have no choice but to assume that Reagan was a man of character and intergrity, who was concerned about the well being of the country far more than he was concerned with himself.  Reading the book, I was proud that he was our President.  Ronald Reagan was one of the greatest and most influential leaders of the 20th century, and this book is a warm, fitting tribute to who he was.

This book is a good book to own, as I'm sure I'll review parts of it again in the future
