The selections in this collection match the selections featured on the RENT - selections album. Unfortunately, this means that many of the best songs in the full score are cut out (including: Light my Candle, La Vie Boheme... I Should Tell You, etc.), because they involve sung dialogue rather than &quot;liftable&quot; songs (songs that work out of context). Another drawback is that in general, songs written for a rock band (featuring extensive guitar) do not transcribe well to solo piano (guitar chords are included in this book, though). With this in mind, however, there is still a lot of good things about this collection. Larson's great ballad-esque songs, like &quot;I'll cover you,&quot; &quot;Your eyes,&quot; &quot;Without You,&quot; and &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; work very well as piano/vocal. Other, more rock-sounding songs such as &quot;Rent,&quot; &quot;Out tonight,&quot; and &quot;What you own&quot; are still doable. As written they may sound a little awkward, but people who have had experience playing rock piano may find that with a little fiddling with the written notes a decent version can be produced. Even if you don't have experience playing rock piano, if you have more experience playing other Broadway music you can still learn a lot from working with these songs and trying out different things. Other songs included are: &quot;Take me or Leave me,&quot; &quot;Another Day,&quot; &quot;Halloween,&quot; and &quot;Santa Fe.&quot; &quot;Take me&quot; didn't transcribe well (esp. the vocal line) due to the bluesy pitches of the song, but the main riff and the chords are accurate. &quot;Another day&quot; contains both the rock elements and the balladesque elements, but the rock elements do not require many changes.&quot;Halloween&quot; transcribes faithfully and works well; &quot;Santa Fe&quot; is transcribed well, but since much of it is spoken it is also a little odd. Overall this book is well done. The songs are all faithful in spirit to the album, although at times a pitch is written differently from the orig. broadway cast recording. The song where this is most apparent is in &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; where it appears that the two soloists' lines were mostly improvised. Although I usually prefer for a song's accompaniment to reflect the actual full score, in the case of these songs such accompaniment is repetitive and adding the vocal line (which is actually a very standard practice for vocal selections) was very welcome. RENT has become a part of the modern musical theater canon, and so this book has become necessary for any Broadway-lover's sheet music collection
