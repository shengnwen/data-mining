A fabulous collection of short stories that more or less piece together to create a fully formed humorous novella. The author spares no-one with his cruel wit and sharp eye for the details of some of the more outrageous  aspects of colonialism in the troubled paradise that is the Pacific. The  finger of fun is pointed at locals and expatriates alike but what is  especially refreshing is that this time it is a Pacific islander that is  doing the pointing and not some foppish Englishman (Somerset Maughan) or  frazzled American (Paul Theroux). For too long it has been the expats  writing about the locals and this book is a great step forward and should  be an inspiration for local writers wherever they may be. And best of all,  you suspect that most of what he writes about isn't that far from reality
