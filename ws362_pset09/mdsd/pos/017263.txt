In Jig and Reels, author Joanne Harris (most famous for her magical realism novel Chocolat) treats her readers to a selection of twenty-two stories, only one previously published.  Some, such as the playfully defiant "Faith and Hope Go Shopping" are surprisingly realistic while others embrace Harris's trademark fascination with fairy-tale lore and magic realism.  "Gastronomicon" unfolds as a young wife decides to experiment with recipes near the end of the ancient cookbook given to her by her mysterious mother-in-law.  "Ugly Sister" and "The Little Mermaid" re-tell fairy tales in a more modern, more twisted way.  "Class of 1981" explores, as Harris says, "what happens when the magic runs out . . ."  Some stories are little more than conceits - in the final story "Eau de Toilette" we meet a parfumier of another time who just happens to be someone famous.  This uneven collection remains an exhilarating read, mostly because Harris seems prepared to try anything, to slyly poke fun at expectations and cultural traditions.  

I wish that Harris had not chosen to preface each story with a short explanation of why she wrote it; it takes the magic out of the illusion.  Once the reader gets into these stories, however, he'll find them witty and much more vibrant than the bland introductions.   Even those stories which cry out for greater development, or a less-than-rushed ending, will charm readers with their originality
