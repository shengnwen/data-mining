As a Chicago resident, I am a big fan.  This is our magnificent U.S. Senator from the great State of Illinois.  And this web page says it all about what I think of this book and Senator Obama: http://www.billslater.com/who_is_barack_obama.htm
Read the book and check out his speeches.  You will see why I am praying for this brilliant leader to be U.S. President someday.  And may that day come sooner than later.  God Bless Senator Obama and his Family
