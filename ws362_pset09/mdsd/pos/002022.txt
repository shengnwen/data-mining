Another reviewer said it best.  This is a SATIRE people.  Don't take it so seriously.  Sykes offers a glimpse into a segment of society few of us see. I love her descriptions of fashion and jewelry - everything sounds so delicious.  I lover her writing style and hope she writes another.  Its actually fascinating to think there are really people out there like that
