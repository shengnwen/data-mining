People have to remember the book was published in 1940.  The language and ideas are typical of that era.  To say it is racist, or to say that it shouldn't be republished is to deny the nations history.  I feel the book is a powerful teaching tool for young people to illustrate how America has changed and how far we have come.  People who do not appreciate the book have their eyes shut to history
