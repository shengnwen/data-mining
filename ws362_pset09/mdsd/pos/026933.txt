 YES THERE ARE MYSTERIES IN LIFE AND MR HILLMAN APPROACHES THEM IN A CLEAR CONCISE  METHOD OF REASONING.  THIS IS NO PULP APPROACH TO THEORY, THE WAY A QUICK BUCK WRITER WILL TELL YOU ABOUT REINCARNATION ETC.

MR HILLMAN IS A WELL REGARDED PSYCHOLOGIST WITH MANY IMPORTANT WRITINGS TO HIS CREDIT, HOWEVER I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF YOU WANT TO READ MR HILLMAN, PURCHASE THIS BOOK IN TANDEM WITH HIS IMPORTANT WRITING  "THE SOUL'S CODE".    SINCERELY PETER A. DATTILO
