THE SEASON OF LILLIAN DAWES by Katherine Mosby
March 17, 2005


THE SEASON OF LILLIAN DAWES is going to be one of my favorite books for 2005. Beautifully written, the story is about Gabriel Gibbs who has just been kicked out of boarding school and is forced to live with his older brother (by ten years) Spencer in New York.  He is introduced to the life of high society and attends parties and other social events with his brother.  It is during this time spent in New York that Gabriel becomes aware of a woman named Lillian Dawes and he becomes obsessed with her.  It is more than just a crush. She is the center of his summer, but he also spends his time getting to know his eccentric Aunt Lavinia, who had just moved from Paris, studies under the tutelage of Spencer, and enjoys his time at cocktail parties and weekend soirees.  It is, in a way,  a coming of age book, with a twist.

Reading this book will remind many of THE GREAT GATSBY and other pieces of that time.  Mosby's writing is definitely not for the average reader, and this book is not a casual read.  Be prepared for some serious reading.  Those who are not focused on the book will most likely lose interest.  But if you are a reader that has the patience for highbrow narratives,  this book will definitely keep you entertained.  The mystery behind Lillian Dawes is the focal point of the last half of the book, and if nothing else, this should help the reader reach that last page.
