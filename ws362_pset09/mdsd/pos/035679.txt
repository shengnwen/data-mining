As in his other books - ACCELERANDO, IRON SUNRISE and SINGULARITY SKY, this is a novel of post- Singularity, after the non-biological entity has become conscious and evolved with a terrifying speed into the Eschaton which is beyond human comprehension.  

In this tongue in cheek horror tale, Alan Turing completed his last theorem and a Turing machine was born.  Unfortunately this opened the gateway to a universe of awful creatures.  Battling this is our intrepid hero, Bob, and his sidekicks of computer geeks.  Indeed it reads like a funny MI6/noire/horror/sci-fi jack of all trades as the nerds save the world from certain doom.
