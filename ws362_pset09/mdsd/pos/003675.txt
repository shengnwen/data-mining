I didn't learn how to become rich from this book but it was an interesting story about Mr. Getty. This read like a good novel. Don't get it expecting on tips and lists on what to do to become rich. But read it on how one unique man did become very wealthy. The book drags a little toward the end but the bulk of the book makes up for this. A little better finish and this would of been a 5 star, still a very worthwhile read
