First published in 1949, The Moving Target is one of Ross Macdonald's earlier novels.  Action packed and nicely paced, the narrative of this book is noticeably less convoluted than many of the other entries in the Macdonald canon.
As hardboiled PI Lew Archer searches high and low to locate missing millionaire Ralph Sampson, he encounters more than a few very interesting characters along the way.  These include Sampson's paraplegic wife Elaine, his headstrong 20 year old daughter Miranda, Claude a bearded prophet of questionable repute and Fay Estabrook an aging film star who doubles as an astrologer.
While successfully relating this intriguing mystery, Macdonald simultaneously manages to paint a vivid picture of life in the Southern California of the immediate postwar era.
The Moving Target is an engaging detective novel that deftly brings to life the place and time in which it unfolds.  Must reading for those who enjoy California noir
