In my opinion, this is the best book ever written on this subject.  Geneen Roth's personal struggle with compulsive eating is heartfelt.  The other personal stories are very helpful also.  She covers so many areas that at first glance you would not consider to be tied in with compulsive eating.  I read this book when it first came out and lost weight easily.  After my last pregnancy, I again began to struggle with my weight.  I used Weight Watchers to get most of it off, but then hit a plateau.  It was then that I discovered that I was still eating compulsively, only I was eating healthier foods.  I am now back with Geneen's books and feel like I'm back on the wagon.  This book makes you reflect on all the issues you have experienced with your weight.  She does it empathetically, but also with a touch of humor.  I hope this book will touch others the way it has touched me
