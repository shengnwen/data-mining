WAITING FOR GODOT is somewhat akin to a conceptual artwork, in which the concept behind the artwork is more important than the sensual aesthetic experience or the entertainment value. In this case, however, what is behind the artwork is a non-concept, the impossibility of creating a masterpiece. After the monumental impossibility of Joyce's FINNEGANS WAKE, what remains for the serious artist? WAITING FOR GODOT is about the impossibility of a masterpiece in the modern world. In that sense, this play is the last masterpiece of "high art." The torch has now passed to movies and popular forms. 

Many critics have tried to convince us that WAITING FOR GODOT is very funny and entertaining. I remain skeptical. There are a few moments of wry humor, but not enough to make up for the emptiness of "waiting." There is literally "Nothing to be done" in this play. "Waiting" is a non-action. What's interesting about the play is that the inconsequential dialogues and trivial actions are presented as significant; there's something like an "alienation effect," or a "defamiliarization," as we are invited to ponder how and why this drama is meaningful.

Why is there "Nothing to be done"? Is it simply because it's all been done before? Or is it because life in the modern world is without any serious purpose or meaning? In many ways, WAITING FOR GODOT is a reaction to the Holocaust and Hiroshima. The characters who have "something to do" in this play are Pozzo and Lucky, who by their stupidity illustrate the futility of action in the modern world.
