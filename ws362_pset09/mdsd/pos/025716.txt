I read this in one sitting and I kept wondering if there was a metaphor that I missed somewhere. But no, it is paranormal at it's strangest depth. It was as if the writing was magical, very beautiful and difficult to stop reading. The flow was musical and yet if I had to describe this book to someone in a word, I would have to say STRANGE. There is one character in this book that was so beautiful in human form and magical form and that is where I wondered whether I had missed a metaphor. Alexander Caebeau is a beautiful Bahamian man of such a gentle and giving nature, incredibly beautiful in every physical and spiritual sense,  he is someone you think about out of the clear blue,  many  months after you've read the book, at a time perhaps when you secretly  wish there was an Alexander Caebeau in your life. And maybe that is what the book is about. I can never be sure but the prose is so lyrically appealing and Alexander is  uncommonly innocent and  sublimely beautiful which made the book worth reading, even if it was the strangest book I've ever read
