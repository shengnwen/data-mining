I have just returned from several weeks in South America, visiting Buenos Aires, Santiago, Patagonia and the desert region of northern Chile. Relating my trip to someone, prompted them to recommend Jim Rodgers book to me and after reading, "Investment Biker", allow me to recommend it to you. If you travel, want to travel or would be just as happy to simply read about traveling and avoid all that packing...this book is for you. 
In 1989, Jim Rodgers and his girl friend, set off to travel on motorcycles around the world. The globe is Mr. Rodgers neighborhood for the next two years. They cross the Sahara, Siberia, float down The Congo River on a barg. Along the way, Jim makes observations about the economic health or lack of it in the areas they visit. He made a fortune in the comodities market so, he knows from whence he speaks. I loved the ride. I plan on reading his follow up, "Adventure Capitilist". Ten years later, he makes the journey in a souped up Mercedes . Beep Beep
