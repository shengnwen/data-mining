"Honest John Turley" (rhymes with Burly), mayor of Slackjaw Kansas, opens Double Wonderful with a "Modest Proposal" to some of the worst villains the Wild West has to offer, including Cole Younger, John Wesely Hardin, the Dalton Boys, Black Bart (a name the criminal Charles E. Boles took from a dime novel), and several others:

"I realize you've got a lot of robbing to do... so I won't bother you.  I just wanted to let you know that the town is completely at your mercy.  The bank is right there.  Or you can rob the jewelry store first.  If you're worried about the law, don't be.  We buried our sheriff last week up there on Sheriff Hill." (pp2-3)

Slackjaw is located near the surrealistically perfect Double Wonderful ranch.  The locals can't stand the owners, Buck and Betty, because they have everything the townsfolk crave: fame and fortune.  Unfortunately, the locals have absolutely no talent, and as Gore Vidal once observed: "Having no talent is no longer enough."

Enter Ned Buntline (the real nom de plume of Edward Zone Carroll Judson, the originator of the dime novel [and the survivor of a lynching]):

"I'm not going to make one of your famous: I'm going to make all of you famous. I'm going to tell the world that Slackjaw Kansas is the home of the drunkest town drunk, the most law enforcing sheriff, the most accommodating prostitute, and the most... uh... prescriptive druggist in the whole United States. You're all champions, the best at what you do." (pg. 40)

After a misguided governmental "might makes right" takeover, Buck and Betty invoke an even mightier might to give Slackjaw a complete "do-over," bringing this swift little satire to a Double Wonderful conclusion
