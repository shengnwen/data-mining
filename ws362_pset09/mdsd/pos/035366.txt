The only reason I did'nt give it a five is, contrary to what &quot;Bo&quot; might think, there is no such thing as a ten.  This book should be on the desk of every manager, and it should appear to be well-worn.  I refer to my copy constantly.  Its application to day-to-day  situations is phenominal.  The time I used to spend thinking about how to  solve, or even approach certain problems, I now spend thumbing through this  book. It does not give me every answer, but usually provokes enough thought  to point me in the right direction. OK, four and a half stars
