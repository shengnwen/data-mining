This book is too funny!

I bought a book to make holiday gifts for friends... For the dogs in my life and their mamas!  I have had so much fun with the project, that I just bought more books for friends to continue the tradition. 

Thanks, Ilene, for adding another dimension to the love of animals! 

Your first books made me laugh, and now your new book keeps me in stitches!
