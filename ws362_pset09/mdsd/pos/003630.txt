What I liked about trust, is that it articulated my thoughts on our society. I knew something was missing from the society I live in verses the one my father lived in.  The author does an excellent job of showing how the fabric of our culture is weaved with trust, not only in each other but in our institutions.  He demonstrates how the breakdown of that trust whether it be the family, the church or a company effects us all.  Many books describe what is wrong with our society this one show us what is missing.
