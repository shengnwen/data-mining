I dont have to much to say because over all it was just a good book, but here it goes.
Tenaka...awesome
Decado...even better
Ananais...sweet
Pagan...he was great
For the people who say that you should only read this if u liked legend, I totally disagree. I actually read this book before Legend and liked it a whole lot better. The battle sequences where fast paced and action packed. Like always Gemmel packs a good story in a short book
