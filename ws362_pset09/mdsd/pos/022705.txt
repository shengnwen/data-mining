An Unlit Path is extremely well written and certainly hit home with me.  The story was hard to read because of the realities of the family's situation.  With that said, the book brought moments of hope, faith and joy into the family's experiences.  I recommend this book to everyone, not only foster and or adoptive parents and child welfare social workers.  Others need to know the realities of foster care and adoption and understand their roles as community supporters, law and policy makers, etc.  Thank you to Deborah Hannah for taking the risk and writing this book
