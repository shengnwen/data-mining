After reading John Gilvey's work "Before the Parade Passes By" I felt compelled to share some thoughts that I believe promote Gilvey's book to a universal level of readership.  Gilvey writing is understandable, clear and well researched.  It appears that every statement that Gilvey makes is grounded in primary sources.  This authoritative text embodies many of the characters that have graced Broadway as they submit for review the life of one of Broadway's greatest legends, Gower Champion.  Gilvey's documentation is nearly flawless as he relates Gower's life in an way that is understandable to a Theater director as well as a person who is marvelled by excellent biographies.  Gilvey's command of using contacts to portray a factual--gossip free--depiction of Gower Champion's life should be commended.  I welcome Gilvey's book to my library and reccommend it any serious reader, both academic and non-academic alike
