I am going to be a first time mom of Twins. There are no twins in either of our families so I was going to books for information. I found this one and it was after reading the first few chapters I finally stoped being scared. I couldn't put down the book. Laughing out loud at Cheryl's no "BS" way of just telling it how it is. I will recomend this book to everyone that I know who needs it. I am also having my parents and inlaws read this book to help them with their concerns. I can't thank Cheryl for writing this book, and helping me and I know other women and families with their new chapters.
