A.E.W Mason's "The Four Feathers' is a classic tale which takes place during the war in Sudan in the late 19th Century. The main character is a soldier, Harry Feversham. Once Harry is told that his regiment has been sent off to war he resigns as a soldier. Harry then receives four white feathers, one from Ethne and three from his friends in his regiment. The white feathers symbolize Harry's cowardice for resigning. Harry's resignation has further consequences not only involving his friends in the regiment, but the love of his life, Ethne Eustace.

This tale is not only about the trials of war. This novel writes of the struggles of a man who has been labeled a coward by everyone he knows and cares about. I would not recommend this novel to any specific audience because I believe the way it has been written allows it to reach readers of every sort.

I enjoy the love story prevalent throughout the novel. Harry's love for Ethne and his willingness to overcome whatever obstacles to win back her heart touched me. I admire the loyalty. Despite the original judgments made of Harry by his friends, they remain loyal in the end. Harry is depicted as such a strong character throughout this novel. Although his friends and family did not see it in him, the readers did. I admire Harry for overcoming so much, determined to show everyone that he is not a coward. 

This novel is incredibly well written. I love to read but I am very specific with what I enjoy. This novel is such an easy read not due to its diction, but to Mason's ability to keep the reader always wanting more. I unfortunately did not discover this novel on my own as it was assigned for school. However I wish I had. I recommend this novel to anyone and everyone. This novel encompasses all that is expected in a classical tale
