This book was about a young girl who's family was very poor.  The family had 7 daughters who couldn't work to bring in money.  At that time, boys could work and not girls.  Buran, the 4th daughter, dresses up as a boy and goes to a new city to work.  She meets a prince and falls in love.  He does not know she is a girl.  If you don't read the story then you can't find out what happens.  This book is great at first but gets a little long in the middle.  The ending is extremely romantic.  It makes the book okay
