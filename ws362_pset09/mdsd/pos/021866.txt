If you are looking for a literary masterpiece, then this is not the book for you.  If you are looking for riveting, real-life drama, read this book. LeAlan Jones and Lloyd Newman live in the Ida B. Wells project of Chicago.  At 13 and 14 they were offered the opportunity to be journalists and to tell their stories.  The book chronicles three years of their lives.  They have a mission in writing this book.  They want us to learn about their America, "Where we live is a second America where the laws of the land don't apply and the laws of the street do.  You must learn Our America as we must learn your America, so that maybe, someday we can become one."  They are pleading for those of us who don't live in the projects to find out about those who do.  

Because the book is written as a script of the interviews they did, we get a sense of the real lives of the people in the projects.  Alcoholism, drug addiction, violence are all a part of the everyday struggle.  There are elements of hope too, found in teachers who care and a grandmother and sisters who are there for these kids.  

The boys become investigative reporters as they try to find out the truth behind the murder of a 5-year-old child who was dropped from the 14th floor window of the projects by two other kids over a dispute about candy.  They even talk to the attorneys and the police. 

I'm glad I read Our America.  I needed to hear these stories from those who rarely get an opportunity to express themselves.  As someone who grew up in the suburbs, I take too much for granted.
