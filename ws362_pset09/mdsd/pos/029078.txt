I was raised Anglo Catholic. I was also taught that Faith is a gift. I was also taught that the Resurrection of Christ must be believed even though there is no way to prove it. Well, Bishop Spong did the impossible! First  he offers us a very deep (and quite probable) speculation of what was going  on between the crucifixion and resurrection. He also goes beyond the  Scriptures and speculates on what may have been going through the Apostles'  minds when all this happened. But the greatest thing Spong does is that he  actually proves the resurrection. What he does is he shows you what  happened BEFORE Easter, and then he shows you what happened AFTER Easter.  In my opinion, even the most obtuse person would be able to see that if one  looks at the picture before and after, the resurrection HAD TO HAVE  HAPPENED. This belongs in the library of ANY Roman Catholic or Anglo  Catholic. I also feel that Bishop Spong hit on something that THOUSANDS of  priests, bishops, and cardinals would have loved to stumble upon. Bishop  Spong did the church a WONDERFUL service when he wrote this book
